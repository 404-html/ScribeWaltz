<v Speaker 1>I'm like a Bald Eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just out there riding on that </v>

7
00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just America.</v>

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 2>I decided to leave the fold of the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a chase,</v>

10
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own futures.</v>

11
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by my own hands.</v>

12
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Are you actively competing or going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be actively competing?</v>

13
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.220
<v Speaker 2>There'll be some grappling stuff this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

14
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.343
<v Speaker 2>I'm figuring by the start of next year </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get back into the MMA circuits </v>

16
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 2>mainly because it's just going to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>some time to set up camps,</v>

17
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 2>managers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the structure of everything.</v>

18
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 2>I have a proper sparring partners and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

19
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.383
<v Speaker 1>And in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about you're doing </v>

20
00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.124
<v Speaker 1>commentary for new Japan pro wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Jim Ross and you do it on our </v>

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>access TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Every Friday night at eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 2>you can see me sit down and run my mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Raslan.</v>

25
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just did a live show up at the cow </v>

26
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.224
<v Speaker 2>palace in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they've been having sporadic a </v>

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 2>wrestling events there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a,</v>

28
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 2>it was a big draw in that building in </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the sixties and seventies I guess.</v>

29
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bit of a historical,</v>

30
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>it feels like wrestling pro wrestlers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make it a renaissance.</v>

31
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like making a return.</v>

32
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that um,</v>

33
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.450
<v Speaker 2>there is a certain audience of a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>age gap that our age group that has come</v>

34
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 2>into flourishing in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

35
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 2>into the Internet and other ways to </v>
<v Speaker 2>which to go ahead and,</v>

36
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:42.564
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bring wrestling back up there and </v>

37
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:45.484
<v Speaker 2>show that wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the biggest company like </v>

38
00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 2>the wwe all the way to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 2>number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be new Japan.</v>

40
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all these independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies all over the place that uh,</v>

41
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 2>some of them have quite a decent </v>
<v Speaker 2>following.</v>

42
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Billy Corgan from smashing pumpkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge wrestling fan.</v>

43
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 1>He owns what is the company that Nwa </v>
<v Speaker 1>national wrestling alliance.</v>

44
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he owns Nwa,</v>

45
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Nwa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rap group.</v>

46
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>It's that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You been.</v>

47
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:10.784
<v Speaker 1>That's what I hear when I hear Nwa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's some attitude involved </v>

48
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.443
<v Speaker 1>with sure,</v>

49
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nwa,</v>

50
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 2>speak about the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

51
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nwa was his,</v>

52
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:27.091
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was a legendary sanctioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>body and so it wasn't any one particular</v>

53
00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:29.740
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a,</v>

54
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.143
<v Speaker 2>a sanctioning body that would then </v>
<v Speaker 2>oversee certain titles and so if you're </v>

55
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:36.364
<v Speaker 2>going to be on this show at this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to defend the Nwa </v>

56
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.353
<v Speaker 2>Championship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The NWA commission would get involved </v>

57
00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:42.184
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had their specifications as to </v>

58
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:45.664
<v Speaker 2>how the title matches would be run and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you could lose by </v>

59
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:49.384
<v Speaker 2>disqualification or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if you go over the top rope would be </v>

60
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 2>a dq and little stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Killer.</v>

61
00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Kowalski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell for a killer.</v>

62
00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Kowalski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't tell you.</v>

63
00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the name,</v>

64
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

65
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v Speaker 1>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I was a famous famous </v>

66
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>trainer after the fact when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school,</v>

67
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.020
<v Speaker 1>probably Uwa guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an Nwa at.</v>

68
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.863
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

69
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Did we talk about that with billy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we did.</v>

70
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>He was like local cable when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>

71
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>It was like three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>like a claw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would like grab his own wrist,</v>

73
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>grab your hat or like a guy fun eric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get his head.</v>

74
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.790
<v Speaker 1>He's got his hand up the claw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's some nostalgia to it.</v>

75
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.580
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

76
00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:36.414
<v Speaker 1>it's coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like people who liked it as a kid </v>

77
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>or now as adults going back to it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia,</v>

78
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.511
<v Speaker 2>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

79
00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:46.260
<v Speaker 2>it's much easier to go out there and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>product out.</v>

80
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.143
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it makes it more easily disseminated </v>

81
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:53.460
<v Speaker 2>to any audience might want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially with like a,</v>

82
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.273
<v Speaker 2>shows that are abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's some shows that go on in </v>

84
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Germany and Austria that will get </v>
<v Speaker 2>streamed and people get ahold of them.</v>

85
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:03.084
<v Speaker 2>They get to watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like the tape trading days </v>

86
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:05.730
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of yesteryear.</v>

87
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.650

<v Speaker 1>barbecue sauce?</v>

<v Speaker 2>fixings.</v>

93
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Is he a pitmaster one of those dudes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he do the whole thing with the wood</v>

94
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:24.654
<v Speaker 1>and smoke with hickory chips and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got his white oak on the side when </v>

95
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>item guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe he lost in my mind.</v>

96
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:37.290

<v Speaker 1>There's people like me that you pellet </v>
<v Speaker 1>grills,</v>

99
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 1>which is infallible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 1>he's one of those triggers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

101
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.360
<v Speaker 1>It's easy for the pellets in it does all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work for you,</v>

102
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.710

<v Speaker 1>Brow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real series dudes.</v>

110
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.210
<v Speaker 1>They get those side pick those side </v>
<v Speaker 1>smokers.</v>

111
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.073
<v Speaker 1>Oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the main chamber and then you </v>

112
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:09.274
<v Speaker 1>got a little wood box on the side where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the woods heating up and then the air </v>

113
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:14.424
<v Speaker 1>goes through and it smokes from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's those people that cook and like </v>

<v Speaker 1>They never let anything.</v>

115
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>I throw stuff over over a gas flames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my lead,</v>

116
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.303
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

117
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I have no</v>

118
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 2>business having any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any voice in the realm of barbecuing,</v>

119
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like something you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>

120
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I love it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who into all things manly.</v>

121
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 1>This is true and I like setting stuff on</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and then eating it.</v>

122
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.540
<v Speaker 1>But do you still drive a manual </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission all around Los Angeles,</v>

123
00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.950
<v Speaker 1>which just drove one today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah Man,</v>

124
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.853
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

125
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.273
<v Speaker 2>I've been driving around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got it out of the shop a little </v>

126
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 2>while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

127
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 2>I have a 75 formula a firebird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead of doing the ls swap,</v>

128
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 2>which everybody does and I understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

129
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got a</v>

130
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 3>4:55</v>
<v Speaker 3>pontiac in it that we bought.</v>

131
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 3>I had a board 60 out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got forged Pistons.</v>

132
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go with forged rods.</v>

133
00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I didn't need it I think because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well no,</v>

134
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 3>actually I did put fours rods and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pistons,</v>

135
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.890
<v Speaker 3>but iron heads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dual quads we look at,</v>

136
00:06:13.891 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 3>at uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

137
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if the goal was to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>make maybe one horsepower per cubic inch</v>

138
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 3>but have well over 500 pound feet of </v>
<v Speaker 3>torque.</v>

139
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.114
<v Speaker 3>That was the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just and it's an automatic </v>

140
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

141
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Senator Force with me and we'll gives me</v>

142
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:29.774
<v Speaker 3>crap about that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's swapped out because I like just </v>

143
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 3>being able to drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut that third hole,</v>

144
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Sun third hole on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the clutch pedal in there.</v>

145
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm more than down.</v>

146
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

147
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 3>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it needs paint.</v>

148
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 3>It needs interior done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's the Burt Reynolds car,</v>

149
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

150
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.391
<v Speaker 3>Was that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

151
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 3>that's [inaudible] 77.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

152
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.790
<v Speaker 3>You're a 75 slash 75,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's got big,</v>

153
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:52.624
<v Speaker 3>big circular headlights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a circular headlights still kind of a </v>

154
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.770
<v Speaker 3>square round off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rounded off square for the center Jamie.</v>

155
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 3>And pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can pull up 75 firebird.</v>

156
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 3>And the formula has the big Ram air </v>
<v Speaker 3>scoops on it,</v>

157
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

158
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

159
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.950
<v Speaker 3>the two big snorkels that come in with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tesla.</v>

160
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

161
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.123
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a transient and minds the </v>

162
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:17.880
<v Speaker 3>formula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

163
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.003
<v Speaker 3>look at that car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that yellow one on the right or </v>

164
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 3>that a gray one formula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

165
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 3>So I've been driving that around quite a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit and hotchkiss did all the suspension</v>

166
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 3>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will look,</v>

167
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 3>did the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It stops in a heartbeat.</v>

168
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Magnaflow exhaust,</v>

169
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the few cars that I liked </v>
<v Speaker 3>from 75,</v>

170
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 3>like it feels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like everything after 71,</v>

171
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 3>it's real risky in a way.</v>

172
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean some of the styling lines of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these mid seventies cars.</v>

173
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 3>I kinda like it in the obnoxiousness of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all.</v>

174
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.950
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

175
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 3>when whatever you get with these as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as like.</v>

176
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:59.150
<v Speaker 3>So this car came with a 400,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that I bought and uh,</v>

177
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.700
<v Speaker 3>it was like seven and a half to one </v>
<v Speaker 3>compression.</v>

178
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:03.000
<v Speaker 3>So it was just a total dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like,</v>

179
00:08:03.001 --> 00:08:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do burnouts.</v>

180
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish that was the year that,</v>

181
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean the years where the gas crunch </v>
<v Speaker 3>was on and they started making these </v>

182
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 3>cars gas efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

183
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they attempted to in some way,</v>

184
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:17.520
<v Speaker 3>and not to mention they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

185
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 3>they started trying to incorporate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>small dog,</v>

186
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elements to try and reduce the amount.</v>

187
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:25.724
<v Speaker 3>A small thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were just highly inefficient </v>

188
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:28.094
<v Speaker 3>the way they were going about it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the air stuff and different processes </v>

189
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 3>that were like things connected to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>heads and it was bad news.</v>

190
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.213
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a rough time for America during </v>

191
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 3>the rare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rare times that that is,</v>

192
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:43.101
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

193
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 3>One of the rare times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a rough time for cars,</v>

194
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 3>like from 71 to the eighties all through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the eighties.</v>

195
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 3>We just make dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cars made some real,</v>

196
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.300
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real snoozers.</v>

197
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Pontiac was one of the few that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting together a decent looking car.</v>

198
00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:57.924
<v Speaker 3>The firebirds and the Trans Ams and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course corvette corvette's still had </v>

199
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:01.884
<v Speaker 3>some good looking cars in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did and especially because they </v>

200
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:07.640
<v Speaker 3>even with the lower horsepower motors </v>
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>

201
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.680
<v Speaker 3>so you could still get up there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hustle even into like 77,</v>

202
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:14.034
<v Speaker 3>78.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had the six point six three or the </v>

203
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:16.014
<v Speaker 3>400 or the four or three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess by that point in the Pontiac's </v>

204
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:20.423
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicks are turning off their fucking </v>

205
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.303
<v Speaker 3>radio in mass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if any chicks wanted to </v>

206
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 3>tune in to listen to what I had to say.</v>

207
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're Josh Barnett,</v>

208
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 3>chicks one here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you have to say,</v>

209
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 3>they want to learn the ways of men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ways of men they want to learn.</v>

210
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.663
<v Speaker 3>They to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of fake men surrounding </v>

211
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 3>using signals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

212
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 3>I have a theory that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so not that long ago,</v>

213
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:48.501
<v Speaker 3>I maybe just a handful of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I finally got like a leather biker style</v>

214
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 3>jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so fonds kind of.</v>

215
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

216
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.813
<v Speaker 3>And old ray every time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every time I smacked something </v>

217
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:00.170
<v Speaker 3>electronic doesn't work better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're.</v>

218
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a magic touch pro.</v>

219
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ladies loved him.</v>

220
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:04.903
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

221
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.420

<v Speaker 3>he uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright.</v>

223
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.063
<v Speaker 3>So I got this jacket and I've always </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted one ever since I was a kid and I </v>

224
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 3>went to this store in New York because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no,</v>

225
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.293
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't a location locally where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could just try the jackets on and I </v>

226
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:23.710
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to buy an expensive jacket </v>
<v Speaker 3>and have to send it back.</v>

227
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 3>All this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was in New York,</v>

228
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.480
<v Speaker 3>went to the store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>found the jacket that fit me,</v>

229
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 3>loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bought it,</v>

230
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.180
<v Speaker 3>been wearing the ever living crap out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

231
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:32.790
<v Speaker 3>taking it all kinds of places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been nasty.</v>

232
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Black metal mosh pits with it on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been all around the world with it.</v>

233
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Have been in far eastern Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A leather jacket is made to tell a story</v>

234
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 3>eventually at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people will go,</v>

235
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.520
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

236
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 3>do you ride a bike?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

237
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.453
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I have this jacket is </v>

238
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 3>because of Mad Max road warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when I saw that as a kid,</v>

239
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 3>those jackets looked bad ass and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

240
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 3>here's the bronze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

241
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.893
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the MFP running around in their falcons </v>

242
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:00.834
<v Speaker 3>just tearing ass and blowing shit up </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing these jackets and I want a </v>

243
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 3>jacket like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I started to notice that this jacket</v>

244
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 3>was everywhere.</v>

245
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>

246
00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:10.614
<v Speaker 3>everybody was making a version of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacket somehow or some way this biker </v>

247
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:17.190
<v Speaker 3>style jacket guys are wearing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

248
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Chicks are wearing it everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm like,</v>

249
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird fashion trend.</v>

250
00:11:21.371 --> 00:11:24.690
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really see that comment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then as I started to think about it more</v>

251
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:25.524
<v Speaker 3>and more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like there is a attempt within </v>

252
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 3>society to try and present the image of </v>
<v Speaker 3>toughness,</v>

253
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from haircuts to jackets to all these</v>

254
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:38.124
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's trying to appear to be tough </v>

255
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.353
<v Speaker 3>and bad ass all the time without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people aren't going out there and </v>

256
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:48.030
<v Speaker 3>necessarily risking it like they used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

257
00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not in generally taking on these</v>

258
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:53.830
<v Speaker 3>jobs that are dangerous or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even just your people want to have</v>

259
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 2>muscle cars but they don't want to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>on them.</v>

260
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like by having the item,</v>

261
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 2>it somehow implies some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>character.</v>

262
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some sort of toughness,</v>

263
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a rugged element to </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

264
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

265
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you've gone through it,</v>

266
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's checking it.</v>

267
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:13.414
<v Speaker 2>You're falling off your bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going 70 miles an hour and just rolling </v>

268
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 2>and dust yourself off and you'll see all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

269
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:20.434
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

270
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.293
<v Speaker 2>like the 30 year old Hollywood type </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes with the manicured beards and all </v>

271
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:24.934
<v Speaker 2>that on their Harley's that have all </v>
<v Speaker 2>been a church turned into choppers and </v>

272
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.053
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

273
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.800
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

274
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 2>a big show of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of toughness without,</v>

275
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:37.660
<v Speaker 2>because people aren't going out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and living tough lives anymore.</v>

276
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Is it toughness or is it coolness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the same?</v>

277
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.160
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

278
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:41.993
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a coolness related to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of being tough and attempt at </v>

279
00:12:45.521 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 2>authenticity.</v>

280
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

281
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.840
<v Speaker 2>to use a term masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

283
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:52.690
<v Speaker 2>And even though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

284
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 2>a woman that's appearing to be tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

285
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:55.834
<v Speaker 2>you would call it a masculine trait even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though that doesn't mean that they're </v>

286
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 2>being a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's putting out a signal,</v>

287
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

288
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.713
<v Speaker 2>a chick that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas like a leather jacket and rides </v>

289
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:05.380
<v Speaker 2>a bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's putting out a signal like,</v>

290
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.393
<v Speaker 2>you better be a bad motherfucker if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want this bitch or I'm going to girls </v>

291
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:16.080
<v Speaker 2>into the previous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could still apply to the latter.</v>

292
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.913
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

293
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

294
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

295
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

296
00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:23.214
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever vibe you're trying to put out </v>

297
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you go and you're like,</v>

298
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.463
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

299
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 2>what's bad motherfucker about you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't take no shit.</v>

300
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you do paper.</v>

301
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't take any shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My agent calls me.</v>

302
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I tell them to fuck off.</v>

303
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I nailed that audition.</v>

304
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even have any product in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>

305
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know me,</v>

306
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm different.</v>

307
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a little,</v>

308
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:48.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a casual observation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally anecdotal,</v>

309
00:13:48.851 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 2>but it just seems like people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>attempting to try.</v>

310
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 2>And it's like things I always tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>people about looking at human history,</v>

311
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:56.910
<v Speaker 2>I go the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

312
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.753
<v Speaker 2>the issues that we deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that affect us or not new </v>

313
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.310
<v Speaker 2>just in a lot of ways are just more </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnified there,</v>

314
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 2>especially with social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media,</v>

315
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I believe like picks and praise on </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain elements of our way of being,</v>

316
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:12.500
<v Speaker 2>our process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

317
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.653
<v Speaker 2>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it heightens our responses to </v>

318
00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:15.784
<v Speaker 2>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also heightens what we see from </v>

319
00:14:18.521 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 2>these responses because when somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

320
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massively insecure,</v>

321
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:29.010
<v Speaker 2>so social media can really pray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help play hell on that and make you feel</v>

322
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 2>more insecure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're putting,</v>

323
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.193
<v Speaker 2>depending on where you're putting value </v>
<v Speaker 2>on what you see or what is said about </v>

324
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:40.390
<v Speaker 2>you or how you are necessarily if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>comparing yourself to others.</v>

325
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.183
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you respond to that in some way </v>

326
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:45.064
<v Speaker 2>through your own social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be it by trying to take more grandiose </v>

327
00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:49.890
<v Speaker 2>photos or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

328
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

329
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 2>whatever sort of</v>

330
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 3>signaling of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of how to make up for that.</v>

331
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 3>It shines even that much more to </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>

332
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.063
<v Speaker 3>So what you do get seen as much as you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see what everybody else does and then </v>

333
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.370
<v Speaker 3>you're given an option on how do you </v>
<v Speaker 3>react to that?</v>

334
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not,</v>

335
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.273
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are the sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go back into old books on </v>

336
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:14.650
<v Speaker 3>philosophy and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

337
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.980
<v Speaker 3>old historical texts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insecurity is not going anywhere.</v>

338
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:19.814
<v Speaker 3>We're not all that much more different </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a thousand years of 2000 years of </v>

339
00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:24.944
<v Speaker 3>3000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way we react and respond to </v>

340
00:15:26.991 --> 00:15:27.824
<v Speaker 3>things than we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that all these things are </v>

341
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.093
<v Speaker 3>amplified under the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the elements of technology that are </v>

342
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 3>around us and how they can affect us and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much easier it is for the,</v>

343
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 3>for those things to get to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Radically amplified.</v>

344
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean I see people fighting with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Instagram,</v>

345
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see people fighting with commenters.</v>

346
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 3>If someone posts something and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people shit on them and then they,</v>

347
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.570
<v Speaker 3>they take their posts and comment on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and,</v>

348
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.810
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like hours of your day man.</v>

349
00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 3>And people just sniping at you for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes you're wearing or your fake lips</v>

350
00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:03.200
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something right?</v>

351
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:03.870
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

352
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:04.521
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

353
00:16:04.521 --> 00:16:05.354
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got the person who's got a WHO's </v>

354
00:16:07.101 --> 00:16:12.101
<v Speaker 3>turned their social media to a very self</v>
<v Speaker 3>absorbed sort of a platform.</v>

355
00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:12.920
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Lot,</v>

356
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>

357
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:16.700
<v Speaker 3>And then even in amongst that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

358
00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:17.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to a degree,</v>

359
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.140
<v Speaker 3>if it's your social media and you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the prime element within it,</v>

360
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.910
<v Speaker 3>of course it would be a bit self </v>
<v Speaker 3>absorbed,</v>

361
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:26.744
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's more nuance to it </v>

362
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:29.930
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just to pick on say,</v>

363
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gals that are taking all the sexy </v>

364
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:33.950
<v Speaker 3>selfies and all that kind of stuff.</v>

365
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:39.030
<v Speaker 3>There's the dudes that do essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same equivalent and it's all in you.</v>

366
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.063
<v Speaker 3>Often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be in a response to drive </v>

367
00:16:41.421 --> 00:16:43.760
<v Speaker 3>attention towards themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what do you,</v>

368
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.860
<v Speaker 3>why do you want that attention in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first place?</v>

369
00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:46.694
<v Speaker 3>And then of course that's something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't know until you know the </v>

370
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:49.130
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

371
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of girls make a living off of it.</v>

372
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.710
<v Speaker 3>A 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

373
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:52.544
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of girls that they do like</v>
<v Speaker 3>sponsored tweets or sponsored instagram </v>

374
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:57.374
<v Speaker 3>posts at once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can get foods are making a living </v>

375
00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 3>off of instagram that way for like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>got famous for girls.</v>

376
00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:04.724
<v Speaker 3>It's like girls with big asses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one girl that I just started </v>

377
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:10.470
<v Speaker 3>following her whole instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her ass.</v>

378
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.740
<v Speaker 3>That is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

379
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.690
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking it was a terrible thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to think,</v>

380
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:16.880
<v Speaker 3>but I was thinking if a dog ever came </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and bit her ass,</v>

381
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:18.530
<v Speaker 3>she'd be out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

382
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.180
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's have an arcane spray of of hugging</v>

383
00:17:22.181 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 3>gels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shooting advert should have Kevlar pants</v>

384
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:25.820
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere she goes.</v>

385
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.990
<v Speaker 3>That asks Lloyd's of London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a.</v>

386
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.040
<v Speaker 3>What will you give me per cheek on </v>
<v Speaker 3>insurance.</v>

387
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean she has a tremendous ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>

388
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:34.423
<v Speaker 3>but it's just weird when there's this </v>
<v Speaker 3>like one here's body part that </v>

389
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:42.120
<v Speaker 3>essentially defines your identity like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this does,</v>

390
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.560
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is weirder that this,</v>

391
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 3>this person with this fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>monumental,</v>

392
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 3>epic level ass is out</v>

393
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.023
<v Speaker 1>there taking photos of it and putting it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there for people to see or that </v>

394
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 1>people not only continuing to look at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more flock to this.</v>

395
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.350
<v Speaker 1>This a religious icon of an ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>

396
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it doesn't get old apparent.</v>

397
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 1>It never gets old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

398
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.180
<v Speaker 1>not for dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for girls is there like one,</v>

399
00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:12.840
<v Speaker 1>but I guess it's abs isn't abs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is the one body attorney?</v>

400
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

401
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

402
00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 1>tell us about what the rules are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for girls it's a wallet.</v>

403
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Look how fat as long as it has an effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fat watt.</v>

404
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will also,</v>

405
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.870
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be surprised that women in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of that,</v>

406
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:33.000
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shallow aspect of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>media in that way could,</v>

407
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.930
<v Speaker 1>could make more impact out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even when you look at,</v>

408
00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:39.890
<v Speaker 1>say all the men's Mag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the women's magazines,</v>

409
00:18:39.891 --> 00:18:40.480
<v Speaker 1>all that kind of stuff.</v>

410
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And like women want to look at young </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

411
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.973
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women are even driven to look at </v>

412
00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Honda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're of course obviously driven to look</v>

413
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:49.100
<v Speaker 1>at hot women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well women know about filters to like,</v>

414
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.510
<v Speaker 1>oh this bitch is using filters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at her.</v>

415
00:18:51.511 --> 00:18:52.344
<v Speaker 1>That is not what she looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looks like a cartoon face look at </v>

416
00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:57.630
<v Speaker 1>her face and then they're trying to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what filter that was.</v>

417
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.260
<v Speaker 1>It felt a beauty filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Cameron does she use?</v>

418
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a girl's found out that there was </v>

419
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:04.194
<v Speaker 1>like one camera that really did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be every girl would use that </v>

420
00:19:07.531 --> 00:19:09.780
<v Speaker 1>one phone that has that one camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

421
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Like they nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're all pretty good now,</v>

422
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 1>but if there was like one standout phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>that took better selfies,</v>

423
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:18.870
<v Speaker 1>like that would be the one that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>

424
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.753
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a marketing avalanche </v>

425
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.480
<v Speaker 1>towards that demographic for sure.</v>

426
00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your rear phone,</v>

427
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.980
<v Speaker 1>like if you have a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera on the back.</v>

428
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 1>It's always more powerful than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>selfie case.</v>

429
00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 1>But the bigger lens and for chicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking bullshit.</v>

430
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Like they need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to reverse the other way.</v>

431
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I need like multiple lenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can choose which one you need to.</v>

432
00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Like I know at my friends look like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see them.</v>

433
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:46.043
<v Speaker 1>I want to see myself selfie sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was dudes only dudes on the </v>

434
00:19:50.311 --> 00:19:51.960
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be no selfie sticks.</v>

435
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:53.790
<v Speaker 1>That shit would've never been invented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so?</v>

436
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we found.</v>

437
00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 1>If it was only men and we found a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a selfie stick,</v>

438
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:01.680
<v Speaker 1>that would be the guy who fucked like </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold them down.</v>

439
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.130
<v Speaker 1>This is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get injured?</v>

440
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.973
<v Speaker 1>Is this a walking stick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a portable baton in case you get </v>

441
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:11.010
<v Speaker 1>attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you using that to take photos inside</v>

442
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:13.160
<v Speaker 1>of a bear cave because you've got to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

443
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to make sure we know where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Grizzly is?</v>

444
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Are you a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.750
<v Speaker 1>putting that thing around corners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the score that rabbit is and get it?</v>

446
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if not,</v>

447
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.993
<v Speaker 1>I've got a problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My arms are short dudes with selfie </v>

448
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:27.990
<v Speaker 1>sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a dark thing.</v>

449
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.760
<v Speaker 1>There's something about it like holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>

450
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in front of a blah blah blah.</v>

451
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does that bother you?</v>

452
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:37.883
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why is it okay for me to take a </v>

453
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:40.224
<v Speaker 1>Selfie with a regular Selfie Lens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a problem for dude as a selfie </v>

454
00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

455
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:49.750
<v Speaker 1>It just seems a bit obnoxious perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

456
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:50.643
<v Speaker 1>it seems that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that I have a reason why it </v>

457
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:54.120
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make me,</v>

458
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.113
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's simply because we view it as </v>

459
00:20:56.621 --> 00:21:00.010
<v Speaker 1>something that we see women do it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we,</v>

460
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:03.550
<v Speaker 1>we think that a man is somehow doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something well.</v>

461
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.383
<v Speaker 1>It's like mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if a man gets fillers in </v>

462
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:06.874
<v Speaker 1>his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever see like a older dude gets </v>

463
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.800
<v Speaker 1>fillers in his face and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

464
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to pull him aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I have.</v>

465
00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to go?</v>

466
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:15.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't.</v>

467
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be wrinkled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just it.</v>

468
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.700
<v Speaker 1>You're 65 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to let it go.</v>

469
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 1>It's letting go on its own anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some,</v>

470
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.100
<v Speaker 1>some gals can kind of pull it off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel bad for them,</v>

471
00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 1>but they still are kind of pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

472
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally myself,</v>

473
00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:31.624
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really all that into the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially manipulating the face like </v>

474
00:21:35.621 --> 00:21:37.590
<v Speaker 1>that for anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that it's,</v>

475
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.410
<v Speaker 1>it's one that the potential for it to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>really badly,</v>

476
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're into it.</v>

477
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:43.624
<v Speaker 1>Just I think that people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to look perfect to be a </v>

478
00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.010
<v Speaker 1>beautiful person.</v>

479
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

480
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:51.124
<v Speaker 1>your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality is at least as </v>

481
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:55.803
<v Speaker 1>important as the way you look and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your personality is such that you need </v>

482
00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:04.780
<v Speaker 1>to shoot plastic in your face in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel good about yourself.</v>

483
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go,</v>

484
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.843
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

485
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.250
<v Speaker 1>What's happened in their below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>below the surface.</v>

486
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.343
<v Speaker 1>It could be a indicator of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>more serious that that no matter how </v>

487
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 1>much filler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how nice it could look.</v>

488
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's still gonna be an issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>per se.</v>

489
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.433
<v Speaker 1>It's also one of those things just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>anorexia or bodybuilders that can never </v>

490
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:25.000
<v Speaker 1>get big enough where they have body </v>
<v Speaker 1>dysmorphia,</v>

491
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.040
<v Speaker 1>people don't know what they really look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

492
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.203
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about the FIBONACCI </v>

493
00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:30.700
<v Speaker 1>sequence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers,</v>

494
00:22:30.701 --> 00:22:33.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the golden ratio.</v>

495
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.413
<v Speaker 1>It actually applies to facial features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find something on that </v>

496
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 1>now to see documentary on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

497
00:22:39.551 --> 00:22:40.384
<v Speaker 1>and at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was something about symmetry </v>

498
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.013
<v Speaker 1>and Elizabeth Hurley when they made that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing was considered one of the most </v>

499
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:49.050
<v Speaker 1>beautiful women in the world by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

500
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.920
<v Speaker 1>by the mathematics of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She still wanting them to be.</v>

501
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't doubt it that chicks like 88 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

502
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 1>she's still hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's rocking it.</v>

503
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 1>But something about the way your face is</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped.</v>

504
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

505
00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.413
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good example is my friend Ari Shaffir </v>

506
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.290
<v Speaker 1>already has a thin face in a long nose </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it all works together.</v>

507
00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Like if he had my nose on his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be like,</v>

508
00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:16.960
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck's wrong with your face.</v>

509
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.960
<v Speaker 1>But the ratios of the width of his face </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the length of his nose,</v>

510
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:23.794
<v Speaker 1>the size of his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff somehow or another syncs </v>

511
00:23:26.681 --> 00:23:27.514
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying it's not that any one </v>

512
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:29.650
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the sum of your parts.</v>

513
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all those things go together.</v>

514
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:35.760
<v Speaker 1>And if one of them is off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if your hair is golden ratio on</v>

515
00:23:35.761 --> 00:23:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you are a,</v>

516
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:42.860
<v Speaker 1>a black woman and you have white lips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a white woman's lips,</v>

517
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:45.350
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

518
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Is she even whistle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

519
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:49.850
<v Speaker 1>She's got a large nose or a wide nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

520
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 1>why grow this facial hair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

521
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:55.100
<v Speaker 1>hide my skinny little skinny lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can platelets lips.</v>

522
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:56.350
<v Speaker 1>You got a viking lips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

523
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I had been told that this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had some girls go,</v>

524
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:00.650
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

525
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.440
<v Speaker 1>You're actually in way better kiss for </v>
<v Speaker 1>than I expected because you have almost.</v>

526
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.820
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you have no lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

527
00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone told Kylie Jenner and that's why</v>

528
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:12.080
<v Speaker 1>she got facial stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

529
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I was reading that today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what kind of a loser I am.</v>

530
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Fifty year old man with children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking pay taxes.</v>

531
00:24:18.181 --> 00:24:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

532
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:20.324
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading some article about why Kylie</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jenner decided to take all the filler </v>

533
00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:24.074
<v Speaker 1>out of her face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucking article on my google </v>

534
00:24:25.791 --> 00:24:27.680
<v Speaker 1>feed and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

535
00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:28.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know.</v>

536
00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:31.130
<v Speaker 1>They know what you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they do.</v>

537
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they've got your tagged</v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction.</v>

538
00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.373
<v Speaker 1>How do they know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know the inner workings of Joe </v>

539
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Rogan will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filler is a fairly recent thing in human</v>

540
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as I've been around earlier with</v>

541
00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:42.974
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't claim to know what's in </v>

542
00:24:45.261 --> 00:24:46.460
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is filler?</v>

543
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

544
00:24:47.391 --> 00:24:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Let's facial filler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google that.</v>

545
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.150
<v Speaker 1>What's in facial filler sand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jb Weld.</v>

546
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.560
<v Speaker 1>Pando gorilla come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

547
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.413
<v Speaker 1>probably depending on what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how higher grade it is or and there's </v>

548
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.823
<v Speaker 1>the freshest levels of the gorilla club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it feel like if they touch your </v>

549
00:25:03.381 --> 00:25:06.380
<v Speaker 1>face and you got some shit and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes your cheeks,</v>

550
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.453
<v Speaker 1>some girls would look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got rocked like their cheeks look </v>

551
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.140
<v Speaker 1>injectable fillers with face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

552
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.333
<v Speaker 1>A hydraulic hyaluronic acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now seeing the college in a hyaluronic </v>

553
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 1>acid are both going to get absorbed into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your system eventually.</v>

554
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the good part about it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's temporary and then if you just</v>

555
00:25:24.561 --> 00:25:29.561
<v Speaker 1>let your body raising scour depressions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing lips and replacing soft tissue</v>

556
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:32.760
<v Speaker 1>volume lost your facial injections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

557
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enhancing Lips.</v>

558
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get it done.</v>

559
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.113
<v Speaker 1>But that's why it looks weird with girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they have big fake lips because of </v>

560
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 1>the golden ratio.</v>

561
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Your face doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't work.</v>

562
00:25:44.871 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Like go back to that article on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>golden ratio of the face please.</v>

563
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.810
<v Speaker 1>And you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see like they have a.</v>

564
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:51.973
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole mathematical sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithm that they can use to sort of </v>

565
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:02.110
<v Speaker 1>explain what is and is not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the shape of your face.</v>

578
00:26:39.921 --> 00:26:44.921
<v Speaker 1>ask somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were the years from the.</v>

579
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.540
<v Speaker 1>From 2000 when I was doing fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fact is that it</v>

580
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:56.200
<v Speaker 4>just stating the obvious is that.</v>

581
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got some big ass too.</v>

582
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so stupid.</v>

583
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.840
<v Speaker 1>From 2000 to two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around 2007.</v>

584
00:27:08.841 --> 00:27:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I think I was high every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all a blur.</v>

585
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:11.843
<v Speaker 1>It's just driving through a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so bored when I was doing fear </v>

586
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:19.300
<v Speaker 1>factor that the only way I enjoyed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was high as fuck.</v>

587
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:20.203
<v Speaker 1>You're enjoying all eating pig anuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people screaming about having a </v>

588
00:27:22.851 --> 00:27:25.940
<v Speaker 1>centipede on their head and after awhile</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got bored,</v>

589
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.620
<v Speaker 1>got desensitized to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't.</v>

590
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I just can't watch general porn anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

591
00:27:31.341 --> 00:27:33.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like if there's not a robot</v>

592
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.080
<v Speaker 3>right in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

593
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.580
<v Speaker 3>having sex with a tiger while a midget </v>
<v Speaker 3>films.</v>

594
00:27:38.581 --> 00:27:40.710
<v Speaker 3>It was clearly that stuff does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

595
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:41.544
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a reason why people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>gag porn is that rule 34 if there's not </v>

596
00:27:45.511 --> 00:27:47.650
<v Speaker 3>a point of it that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

597
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:48.603
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

598
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.690
<v Speaker 3>if you can think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a porn out there and 35 is if it</v>

599
00:27:51.691 --> 00:27:53.070
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shall be made.</v>

600
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

601
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.510
<v Speaker 3>It's a fortune thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I'm unfortunate all the time,</v>

602
00:27:57.511 --> 00:27:57.890
<v Speaker 3>but oh,</v>

603
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:02.390
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to an account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about like,</v>

604
00:28:02.391 --> 00:28:05.330
<v Speaker 1>people getting desensitized that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking absolutely real.</v>

605
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:09.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why like </v>
<v Speaker 1>in times of war,</v>

606
00:28:09.141 --> 00:28:12.770
<v Speaker 1>people are capable of doing more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more awful shit.</v>

607
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like you get desensitized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get normalized,</v>

608
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:16.813
<v Speaker 1>like people are very malleable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get accustomed to all sorts of </v>

609
00:28:19.581 --> 00:28:21.410
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send it to some of those things.</v>

610
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Don't necessarily stay forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

611
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:24.810
<v Speaker 3>they're subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

612
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:25.644
<v Speaker 3>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time in that moment and plus there </v>

613
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:29.220
<v Speaker 3>is everything that's going around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

614
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.063
<v Speaker 3>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're all in here and we're saying </v>

615
00:28:31.911 --> 00:28:34.470
<v Speaker 3>we're drinking coffee when you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is the way to be.</v>

616
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.280
<v Speaker 3>And then other for everyone else are out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and around us and like,</v>

617
00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.123
<v Speaker 3>well they're all drinking energy drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>energy drinks are actually the best </v>

618
00:28:39.871 --> 00:28:40.704
<v Speaker 3>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

619
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:41.573
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's this other thing that you </v>

620
00:28:42.181 --> 00:28:44.300
<v Speaker 3>see that perhaps then that bleeds into </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

621
00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do energy drinks instead.</v>

622
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 3>If you go from that to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

623
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.120
<v Speaker 3>let's drink a grain alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe not.</v>

624
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

625
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:53.603
<v Speaker 1>I mean sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just imitate their atmosphere </v>

626
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.970
<v Speaker 1>show</v>

627
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.490
<v Speaker 3>and if someone else is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

628
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 3>God and war and if they take one year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

629
00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.280
<v Speaker 3>your teammates and then cut them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces and send them back to you,</v>

630
00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:08.190
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden you're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same.</v>

631
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:09.400
<v Speaker 3>And some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

632
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.010
<v Speaker 3>reprisal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

633
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to know a dude who,</v>

634
00:29:13.891 --> 00:29:14.724
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a mormon and Mormons aren't </v>

635
00:29:16.441 --> 00:29:19.110
<v Speaker 3>allowed to drink coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were going to go somewhere</v>

636
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:20.460
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I knew he was a mormon.</v>

637
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:21.660
<v Speaker 3>He used to cut people a piece in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>center.</v>

638
00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:23.580
<v Speaker 3>I know you didn't do any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

639
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.463
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

640
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Mormons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just so friendly.</v>

641
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.560
<v Speaker 3>There's something got to be going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath.</v>

642
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:28.650
<v Speaker 3>If</v>

643
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.080
<v Speaker 1>somethings there's a trigger that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to find it,</v>

644
00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.910
<v Speaker 1>puts a hole in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get a hole in their magic underwear</v>

645
00:29:34.911 --> 00:29:35.810
<v Speaker 1>and they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

646
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:36.883
<v Speaker 1>But I would fucking place down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I offered them a cup of coffee and he's </v>

647
00:29:38.991 --> 00:29:39.561
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

648
00:29:39.561 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I can't drink coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had</v>

649
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.690
<v Speaker 3>a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those huge monster energy drink.</v>

650
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:45.640
<v Speaker 3>Seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

651
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.653
<v Speaker 3>He was drinking them all day long to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>point where he was having heart </v>

652
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:51.490
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's kidding.</v>

653
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Fucking heart palpitations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was drinking.</v>

654
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

655
00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:55.983
<v Speaker 3>wasn't monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was rockstars wonder which one has </v>

656
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:00.410
<v Speaker 3>more caffeine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out which one.</v>

657
00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.360
<v Speaker 3>I think Ryan has more caffeine than a </v>
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>

658
00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Monster's doable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I drink,</v>

659
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:06.123
<v Speaker 3>I'll drink a sugar free monster during </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC broadcasts at the times I drink </v>

660
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:10.600
<v Speaker 3>those during the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

661
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.700

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

662
00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.550

<v Speaker 3>whatever's in there.</v>

663
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Goes right to your system like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Caffeine ain't helping.</v>

664
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.653
<v Speaker 3>Goldberg used to drink those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like they were water and he was </v>

665
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:23.284
<v Speaker 3>always pinging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both monster and Rockstar have the same </v>

666
00:30:25.181 --> 00:30:26.014
<v Speaker 3>amount of caffeine per serving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is eight 80 milligrams per eight </v>

667
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 3>ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

698
00:31:40.901 --> 00:31:43.180
<v Speaker 3>I should get one turn into a fanny pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be dope.</v>

699
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:44.640
<v Speaker 3>Before on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

700
00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:45.474
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

701
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you don't get any ticks.</v>

702
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:49.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no tax on those.</v>

703
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have ticks in Hawaii.</v>

704
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird,</v>

705
00:31:55.811 --> 00:31:56.644
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the thing about paradigms is </v>

706
00:31:57.431 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 3>you don't really realize it's when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paradigm is over until you're out of it.</v>

707
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:02.783
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're in a paradigm now of some </v>

708
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:09.430
<v Speaker 3>sort and it's easy to get lost in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not be able to see outside of it.</v>

709
00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.360
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is happening now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be ridiculed in the future?</v>

710
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

711
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:17.314
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think that in a lot of ways we </v>
<v Speaker 3>would end up to where we are at this </v>

712
00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:20.734
<v Speaker 3>point and so many of the social and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural elements and that didn't even </v>

713
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:29.701
<v Speaker 3>just specifically stay within the u s </v>
<v Speaker 3>but seemed to be bleeding throughout all</v>

714
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:33.490
<v Speaker 3>of western society and civilization at </v>
<v Speaker 3>large.</v>

775
00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:32.534

<v Speaker 1>I can at least say as an athlete that </v>

776
00:35:35.471 --> 00:35:36.304
<v Speaker 1>maybe they've got the slides on because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take those slides off </v>

777
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:38.040

<v Speaker 3>on a car.</v>

825
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what if cost wasn't an option?</v>

826
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.600
<v Speaker 3>What if Elon Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm elon musk,</v>

827
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well God,</v>

828
00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:44.844
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he can not drive a tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out there and have a goddamn three </v>

829
00:37:47.991 --> 00:37:49.790
<v Speaker 3>inch exhaust for 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

830
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.170
<v Speaker 3>big block I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

832
00:37:53.551 --> 00:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>he probably can't drive anything but </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tesla and Oh,</v>

833
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:57.810
<v Speaker 3>what a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

834
00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.033
<v Speaker 3>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But wish I would rather I would rather </v>

835
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.363
<v Speaker 3>drive a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like electric cars have </v>

836
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.930
<v Speaker 3>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have any.</v>

837
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:08.250
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that doesn't</v>

838
00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.541
<v Speaker 1>the beep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boop,</v>

00:38:10.541 --> 00:38:11.374
<v Speaker 1>boop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boop up in the little printer comes out </v>

840
00:38:13.571 --> 00:38:15.220
<v Speaker 1>and I just doesn't do it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

841
00:38:15.221 --> 00:38:17.800
<v Speaker 1>they're really cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

842
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.030
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is it feels good to hear the</v>

<v Speaker 1>rumble of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Engine to me in the fucking put that </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's an old jag.</v>

846
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:41.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a [inaudible] actually.</v>

<v Speaker 1>70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>67 and it's a gorgeous.</v>

857
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.720
<v Speaker 1>So pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see that picture again.</v>

858
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Scroll down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

859
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

860
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:12.790
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about the sound of</v>
<v Speaker 1>combustion engines.</v>

861
00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so magnetic.</v>

862
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Teslas are cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're silent.</v>

863
00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 1>The that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're incredibly comfortable.</v>

864
00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that pad that they.</v>

865
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Big Ass ipad that you have where your </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigation screen is,</v>

866
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:24.694
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the shit while you're driving and </v>

867
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:30.820
<v Speaker 1>that thing and you just ask it to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs and it pulls them up on spotify.</v>

868
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm also a little bit</v>

869
00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:36.900
<v Speaker 2>weirded out by the over elect tronic </v>
<v Speaker 2>element of modern life.</v>

870
00:39:36.901 --> 00:39:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized the usefulness of it,</v>

871
00:39:38.851 --> 00:39:41.190
<v Speaker 2>but I always think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

872
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.593
<v Speaker 2>when some shit goes south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can't just fix it and we keep </v>

873
00:39:45.541 --> 00:39:46.374
<v Speaker 2>going or if something goes bad it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>go bad and a lot of different ways and </v>

874
00:39:50.611 --> 00:39:53.970
<v Speaker 2>there's a chain of command of bad that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's all linked to that it could go</v>

875
00:39:53.971 --> 00:39:55.380
<v Speaker 2>to as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm just like,</v>

876
00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doesn't that.</v>

877
00:39:56.631 --> 00:39:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Plus when you talk about engines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright you,</v>

878
00:39:59.331 --> 00:40:00.164
<v Speaker 2>you start up your porsche startup event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start up an ls motor and then you </v>

879
00:40:05.161 --> 00:40:08.310
<v Speaker 2>started up next to a big block pontiac.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You started up next to a big block.</v>

880
00:40:08.311 --> 00:40:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Ford and everything has a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel,</v>

881
00:40:10.561 --> 00:40:13.470
<v Speaker 2>a different different cam that's in it </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it sound different,</v>

882
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.650
<v Speaker 2>makes it operate different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The exhaust,</v>

883
00:40:15.651 --> 00:40:19.740
<v Speaker 2>it's on everything changes based on all </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of different elements.</v>

884
00:40:19.741 --> 00:40:22.140
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car even of itself,</v>

885
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:23.123
<v Speaker 2>not just the exterior of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the internal is make it seem like a </v>

886
00:40:25.321 --> 00:40:26.820
<v Speaker 2>different vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

887
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:27.683
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like have you ever been around Ferrari </v>

888
00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.560
<v Speaker 2>a?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a ton,</v>

889
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.000
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know they have.</v>

890
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:33.993
<v Speaker 1>They got the salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had their own Aston Martin is </v>

891
00:40:39.701 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 1>famous for having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very specific exhaust.</v>

892
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.330
<v Speaker 1>There's sounds that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a celebration.</v>

893
00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.613
<v Speaker 1>It's like better not drive it too far </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's probably going to break </v>

894
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.910
<v Speaker 1>before the next 12 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fantastic.</v>

895
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.073
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way they sound like I used to love </v>

896
00:40:57.881 --> 00:41:01.960
<v Speaker 1>top gear with Jeremy Clarkson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show was the best.</v>

897
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Whoever he punched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

898
00:41:03.731 --> 00:41:06.790
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The showbread get over it.</v>

899

<v Speaker 1>BBC conscious slap.</v>

900
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.100

<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

901
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.790
<v Speaker 1>People are pussified there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pussified there.</v>

903
00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:21.850
<v Speaker 1>bunch of men drinking booze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys got in a fight and you got hit.</v>

904
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Take a little settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Move on.</v>

905
00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Give them an apology or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even just say,</v>

906
00:41:27.011 --> 00:41:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me hit you one back.</v>

907

<v Speaker 1>Got $70,000,000.</v>

910
00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.513
<v Speaker 1>A million people wanting to sort of live</v>
<v Speaker 1>at parents' house for the rest of their </v>

911
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:41.174
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except then it goes from being mom and </v>

912
00:41:42.411 --> 00:41:43.244
<v Speaker 1>dad to them being a state of some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does all your work for you because </v>

913
00:41:45.921 --> 00:41:46.754
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of either winning or </v>

914
00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:50.240
<v Speaker 1>losing that confrontation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

915
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just got punched.</v>

916
00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.590

<v Speaker 1>Maybe so.</v>

917
00:41:54.591 --> 00:41:58.010
<v Speaker 1>But if it's on Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could just go to me like,</v>

918
00:41:58.011 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 1>all right dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get one on you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's and it's even we're done.</v>

920
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.053
<v Speaker 1>Move on with my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if the guy can fucking crack </v>

921
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.520
<v Speaker 1>with Paul Dale daily?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't have fucking hit him.</v>

922
00:42:07.521 --> 00:42:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Then he shouldn't have fucking hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit a barrier.</v>

923
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.100
<v Speaker 1>All.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

924
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:15.830
<v Speaker 1>that's the realm of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice martial arts.</v>

925
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:16.663
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people get drunk and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>in fistfights that actually know how to </v>

926
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:21.050
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty small.</v>

927
00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 1>According to the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real small.</v>

928
00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:28.271
<v Speaker 1>He watches the district videos idea what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

931
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.750

<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>strong those things are.</v>

<v Speaker 1>how shitty their body works.</v>

947

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're on these slick beer soaked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this,</v>

952
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the end of it right now.</v>

953
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:25.370
<v Speaker 1>The sixth of the 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening right now?</v>

954
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching videos.</v>

955
00:43:27.981 --> 00:43:32.981
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was actually live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so fucking insane.</v>

956
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.350
<v Speaker 1>This is so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are so insane.</v>

957
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.930
<v Speaker 1>What if it gets a beat on you and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden like A.</v>

958
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:39.763
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the only one out of this entire </v>

959
00:43:40.791 --> 00:43:43.640
<v Speaker 1>crowd of 500 people right now that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to Gore.</v>

960
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

961
00:43:44.171 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it finds one that sits still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going have tickets,</v>

962
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:48.434
<v Speaker 1>frustrations out.</v>

963
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.900
<v Speaker 1>And the crazy thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

964
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:50.803
<v Speaker 1>look how many people were there watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and watching these fools running </v>

965
00:43:53.871 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 1>around in the middle of this bull fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see someone get fucked up by a</v>

966
00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 1>bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever watched a bullfight?</v>

967
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>

968
00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I have seen plenty of clips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Footage of it.</v>

969
00:44:03.561 --> 00:44:04.394
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you remember watching a bullfight </v>

970
00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested.</v>

971
00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really do anything for me.</v>

972
00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.411
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

973
00:44:08.411 --> 00:44:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I can up until the point of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

974
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.990
<v Speaker 1>of killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

975
00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.491
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

976
00:44:13.491 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 1>You want to go out there and dodge a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bull?</v>

977
00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.720
<v Speaker 1>A seems like a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all right.</v>

978
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:20.300
<v Speaker 1>But then you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

979
00:44:20.301 --> 00:44:22.880
<v Speaker 1>You've already proven that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuver yourself out of the way.</v>

980
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:23.743
<v Speaker 1>No need to spirit and kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also seems to me that I know it's </v>

981
00:44:27.111 --> 00:44:29.180
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it comes from a different era.</v>

982
00:44:29.181 --> 00:44:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I know I understand that and so I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to here and then just like</v>

983
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.083
<v Speaker 3>go railroading bullfighting necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Position is tradition to know there's a </v>

984
00:44:37.021 --> 00:44:38.310
<v Speaker 3>lot of things that are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>

985
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was horrific traditions.</v>

986
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.023
<v Speaker 3>It just seems to me to be a a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bastardization of our relationship with </v>

987
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.990
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even.</v>

988
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>with domesticated animals,</v>

989
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:55.480
<v Speaker 3>but obviously factory farming is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting.</v>

990
00:44:55.481 --> 00:44:56.500
<v Speaker 3>It's nasty shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

991
00:44:56.501 --> 00:44:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Why do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there is no I.</v>

992
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.053
<v Speaker 3>it's possible to have animals that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to live a more natural way of life </v>

993
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.960
<v Speaker 3>than it is to to jam into a cage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>force feed them until.</v>

994
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's possible to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we've been doing it,</v>

995
00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:11.353
<v Speaker 3>but the real problem is the way we </v>
<v Speaker 3>expect to be able to just go to Jack in </v>

996
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:15.750
<v Speaker 3>the box and get a burger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

997
00:45:15.751 --> 00:45:17.590
<v Speaker 3>we eat too much meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

998
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.420
<v Speaker 3>In general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that your average person doesn't</v>

999
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:24.930
<v Speaker 3>need to eat nearly as much fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>varieties of meat as they do.</v>

1000
00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:26.730
<v Speaker 3>They need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they definitely need meat in their diet,</v>

1001
00:45:26.731 --> 00:45:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I believe on average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know about the carnivore diet?</v>

1002
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:31.651
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1003
00:45:31.651 --> 00:45:33.020
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been uh,</v>

1004
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard you talking to Joel,</v>

1005
00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:38.630
<v Speaker 3>you've talked a lot about and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson and his,</v>

1006
00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:39.760
<v Speaker 3>his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1007
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 3>I talked about it with Chris Bell First </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's been on it for,</v>

1008
00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:49.140
<v Speaker 3>I think he's been on it for at least six</v>
<v Speaker 3>months or so,</v>

1009
00:45:49.141 --> 00:45:49.974
<v Speaker 3>and he's having radical improvements and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons that he's having </v>

1010
00:45:53.431 --> 00:45:56.520
<v Speaker 3>improvements and then Jordan's having </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous results.</v>

1011
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.760
<v Speaker 3>And Jordan's daughter as well is </v>
<v Speaker 3>arthritis.</v>

1012
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.620
<v Speaker 3>They all have arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Chris Bell has two artificial hips.</v>

1013
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to be that market.</v>

1014
00:46:07.121 --> 00:46:07.954
<v Speaker 3>Smelly markers smelly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris Chris's bore Chris Board Bell and </v>

1015
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:15.240
<v Speaker 3>Chris is the one who produced bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

1016
00:46:15.241 --> 00:46:16.650
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met Chris.</v>

1017
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.560
<v Speaker 3>I've met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've actually never met mark the person.</v>

1018
00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Chris is a fantastic always guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>backward baseball cap on.</v>

1019
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're both fantastic guys and really,</v>

1020
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:29.820
<v Speaker 3>really smart and just Chris has suffered</v>
<v Speaker 3>from serious,</v>

1021
00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:32.550
<v Speaker 3>debilitating arthritis and pain in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>joints his whole life.</v>

1022
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.403
<v Speaker 3>Having a carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked it out for them and that's the </v>

1023
00:46:36.821 --> 00:46:37.654
<v Speaker 3>only thing I was familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ketogenic diet and all that kind of </v>

1024
00:46:39.931 --> 00:46:44.931
<v Speaker 3>stuff and and having a higher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works for me as well to be honest,</v>

1025
00:46:44.941 --> 00:46:45.990
<v Speaker 3>to eat that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1026
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:49.080
<v Speaker 3>my problem is my love affair with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking breads.</v>

1027
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.260
<v Speaker 3>You're out there getting a coffee maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning like,</v>

1028
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.393
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks like an amazing croissant </v>

1029
00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:56.910
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How it looks even better in my face.</v>

1030
00:46:56.911 --> 00:46:59.310
<v Speaker 3>He's like a chocolate croissant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do like the chocolate croissants.</v>

1031
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.250
<v Speaker 3>You know who's got the best ones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coffee Bean though.</v>

1032
00:47:02.251 --> 00:47:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Starbucks ones can suck my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I don't eat.</v>

1033
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:07.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Seattle Guy,</v>

1034
00:47:07.021 --> 00:47:08.360
<v Speaker 3>but I don't need starbucks for science.</v>

1035
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're terrible.</v>

1036
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:11.760
<v Speaker 3>They used to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to be pretty good.</v>

1037
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.370
<v Speaker 3>You know when they went south and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>started putting them in plastic bags,</v>

1038
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.413
<v Speaker 3>they give them to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're already sealed up in a plastic </v>

1039
00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:20.310
<v Speaker 3>bag back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's at coffee bean.</v>

1040
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 3>Have way more chocolate in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're thick.</v>

1041
00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go deep.</v>

1042
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the off,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1114
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.241
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

1115
00:50:16.241 --> 00:50:18.210
<v Speaker 3>I had four chickens and one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1116
00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.680
<v Speaker 3>there was a little miniature Chihuahua,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little chihuahua or a little mini docs</v>

1117
00:50:22.681 --> 00:50:23.514
<v Speaker 3>and maybe are many men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a min pin and it got into the </v>

1118
00:50:26.561 --> 00:50:27.394
<v Speaker 3>yard and ended up in the backyard and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the four chickens cornered it and </v>

1119
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:34.124
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't let it leave and so it's back </v>
<v Speaker 3>there whining and yelping and </v>

1120
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:38.960
<v Speaker 3>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1121
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.823
<v Speaker 3>my ex at the time went and caught the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dog and then try to figure out whose it </v>

1122
00:50:43.281 --> 00:50:46.190
<v Speaker 3>was and what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it turned out it was chipped,</v>

1123
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:50.000
<v Speaker 3>I think in you got given somewhere where</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone could then track them down,</v>

1124
00:50:50.001 --> 00:50:51.740
<v Speaker 3>but it was just hilarious that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>chickens were like,</v>

1125
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:52.640
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

1126
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:54.450
<v Speaker 3>You're in the wrong place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know else?</v>

1127
00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Love squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My dog.</v>

1128
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a different animal all together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.280
<v Speaker 3>Marshall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hardly ever catch him though.</v>

1130
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:08.480
<v Speaker 3>He got that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like this sweet golden retriever.</v>

1131
00:51:08.481 --> 00:51:10.690
<v Speaker 3>That's kind dog who loves everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:13.040

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1133
00:51:13.041 --> 00:51:14.950
<v Speaker 3>the problem is the squirrels go into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken coop.</v>

1134
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:17.510
<v Speaker 3>They'll find a way into the chicken coop</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they steal all the chickens for food</v>

1135
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:18.703
<v Speaker 3>and Marshall just decided to wait </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of the chicken coop because he </v>

1136
00:51:21.201 --> 00:51:22.034
<v Speaker 3>knew where the hole was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sit in there and snatched that </v>

1137
00:51:24.831 --> 00:51:28.220
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker and then just with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest shit eating grin on his face.</v>

1138
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs.</v>

1139
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.863
<v Speaker 3>Rogan does not like the squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't like the squirrels getting </v>

1140
00:51:31.761 --> 00:51:33.110
<v Speaker 3>into the chicken food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1141
00:51:33.111 --> 00:51:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we just buy more chicken </v>
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>

1142
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:36.560
<v Speaker 3>poor little squirrels that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>hustling.</v>

1143
00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.000
<v Speaker 3>It's hard life being a squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is just trying to get these,</v>

1144
00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:41.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trends trying to get by trying to live </v>

1146
00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.310
<v Speaker 3>They all have this peer pressure from </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these other squirrels.</v>

1147
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:47.900
<v Speaker 3>And then he started smoking young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:52.550
<v Speaker 3>They find this sweet spot where all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these fucking nuts and all this grain is</v>

1149
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:53.570

<v Speaker 3>this is amazing.</v>

1150
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>they start stealing eggs.</v>

1152
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:58.993
<v Speaker 3>They still stealing eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These cops were trying to roll eggs out </v>

1153
00:52:01.131 --> 00:52:03.770
<v Speaker 3>of the chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when she got mad.</v>

1154
00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:04.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1155
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:05.503
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea that squirrels ate eggs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we started finding videos </v>

1156
00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:09.314

<v Speaker 3>role in chicken eggs out of a chamber.</v>

1158

<v Speaker 3>Heard of that either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have the motherfuckers we,</v>

1159
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:17.600
<v Speaker 3>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have egg boxes.</v>

1160
00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.980
<v Speaker 3>They're elevated egg boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1161
00:52:18.981 --> 00:52:21.110
<v Speaker 3>The egg boxes like two and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three feet off the ground.</v>

1162
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Squirrels got up into the egg box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got the egg,</v>

1163
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.870
<v Speaker 3>chucked it out of the egg box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lands on the ground.</v>

1164
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.000
<v Speaker 3>The getting it in their own egg.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can get away with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do get away with more.</v>

1167
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.790
<v Speaker 3>Like rats must be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no industry for Squirrel killen </v>

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1172
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:49.640

1173
00:52:49.641 --> 00:52:50.474
<v Speaker 3>And that's not an industry out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get their mortgage is paid by </v>

1174
00:52:52.641 --> 00:52:53.474
<v Speaker 3>killing rats.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm an exterminator.</v>

1178
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.940

<v Speaker 3>certain animals and bugs,</v>

1179

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>roaches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swats,</v>

1182
00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes,</v>

1183
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:15.430
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will give you everything.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Know all kinds of diseases and shaken </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay fever,</v>

1185
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:19.250
<v Speaker 3>malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the only,</v>

1186
00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.293
<v Speaker 3>the only part of the mosquitoes life I </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy or think is interesting is when </v>

1187
00:53:22.761 --> 00:53:23.594
<v Speaker 3>their larva and they're these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>vicious little things at these giant </v>

1188
00:53:25.951 --> 00:53:26.260
<v Speaker 3>hook</v>

1189
00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.093
<v Speaker 1>teeth that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can even eat little fish and all that </v>

1190
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the ponds too.</v>

1191
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:35.670
<v Speaker 1>When I first moved to California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rented this house in Encino and nobody</v>

1192
00:53:35.671 --> 00:53:38.010
<v Speaker 1>lived in it for like a year and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years,</v>

1193
00:53:38.011 --> 00:53:42.150
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had a pool in the backyard that</v>

1194
00:53:42.151 --> 00:53:44.250
<v Speaker 1>was just sitting there with Gerald Gamma</v>
<v Speaker 1>Green.</v>

1195
00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:50.700
<v Speaker 1>There was schools of mosquito larva </v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming around like fish.</v>

1196
00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I went out into the yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1197
00:53:52.321 --> 00:53:53.940
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy was like,</v>

1198
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:54.900
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll take care of that.</v>

1199
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1200
00:53:57.070 --> 00:54:00.680
<v Speaker 1>That's you poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just pour bleach into it.</v>

1201
00:54:00.681 --> 00:54:01.514
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the first thing you do is you </v>

1202
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 1>bleach it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to drain it.</v>

1203
00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.670
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take all this Goop,</v>

1204
00:54:05.671 --> 00:54:06.740
<v Speaker 1>all that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1205
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:07.583
<v Speaker 1>You got to drain all that water out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to bring it like a machine and </v>

1206
00:54:10.921 --> 00:54:14.040
<v Speaker 1>then they had a clean all the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom of the pool.</v>

1207
00:54:14.041 --> 00:54:14.874
<v Speaker 1>It was all green and funky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the crazy thing is they were moving </v>

1208
00:54:18.631 --> 00:54:19.560
<v Speaker 1>through the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1209
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see those,</v>

1210
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.520
<v Speaker 1>those big flocks of birds and they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>move together.</v>

1211
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 1>They were doing that in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was fucking thousands of them.</v>

1212
00:54:27.151 --> 00:54:29.170
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then they didn't grow legs.</v>

1213
00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:30.313
<v Speaker 1>It would have been a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been a real problem that </v>

1214
00:54:32.101 --> 00:54:33.910
<v Speaker 1>got out and started flying around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have got fucked.</v>

1215
00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a meme out there and it's,</v>

1216
00:54:36.891 --> 00:54:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a picture,</v>

1217
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's repeated in,</v>

1218
00:54:41.501 --> 00:54:42.890
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the bottom as well.</v>

1219
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Have a pita billboard and it's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1220
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:50.270
<v Speaker 2>these animals all sitting and standing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a line and it says,</v>

1221
00:54:50.271 --> 00:54:53.420
<v Speaker 2>where do you draw the line between food </v>
<v Speaker 2>and friends or whatever.</v>

1222
00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:54.793
<v Speaker 2>And then someone else has and they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got the same thing down there and it's </v>

1223
00:54:57.051 --> 00:54:58.680
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1224
00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:03.200
<v Speaker 2>this is normal food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a catastrophic event apocalypse.</v>

1225
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>

1226
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1227
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a vegetarian or Vegan is a very.</v>

1228
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:11.423
<v Speaker 1>It's a very first world option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why people got to this point </v>

1229
00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.293
<v Speaker 1>is because we figured out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive eating all the animals around </v>

1230
00:55:18.871 --> 00:55:19.704
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like they figured out a way to </v>

1231
00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 1>survive eating the animals around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I need the argument that Oh,</v>

1232
00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:26.400
<v Speaker 1>well this culture is mostly vegetarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>revere this or that.</v>

1233
00:55:26.401 --> 00:55:27.001
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1234
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:31.470
<v Speaker 1>well it's also highly developed based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was available.</v>

1235
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:34.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't just say I don't want to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals.</v>

1236
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Well the only people that did is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindu.</v>

1237
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Hindus are fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1238
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:42.540
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of speculation as to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wash the agriculture civilization.</v>

1239
00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:43.393
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At certain points in time in comparison </v>

1240
00:55:44.881 --> 00:55:46.240
<v Speaker 1>to the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1241
00:55:46.241 --> 00:55:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean you go back and read the Bhagavad</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gita.</v>

1242
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.313
<v Speaker 1>I mean they had some really complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and really interesting </v>

1243
00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:54.354
<v Speaker 1>thoughts about the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people believe that that </v>

1244
00:55:56.581 --> 00:55:59.380
<v Speaker 1>was due to psychedelic drugs and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1245
00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:00.693
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why they believed </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had this interesting relationship </v>

1246
00:56:03.091 --> 00:56:03.924
<v Speaker 1>with cattle but not with lamb was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because cattle shit would grow magic </v>

1247
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:13.080
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is because so much is a big part of</v>

1248
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:17.940
<v Speaker 1>the ancient Hindu folklore and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion and their ancient texts,</v>

1249
00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:18.774
<v Speaker 1>they talk about Soma and Soma was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a psychedelic mixture and they </v>

1250
00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:27.070
<v Speaker 1>don't know exactly what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they know that Hindus,</v>

1251
00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:28.693
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1252
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.613
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the ancient Hindu text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they deal with some sacraments and they </v>

1253
00:56:35.381 --> 00:56:38.680
<v Speaker 1>know that they were into hash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like a lot of the Yogis,</v>

1254
00:56:38.681 --> 00:56:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Assad dues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're into chillums.</v>

1255
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:44.140
<v Speaker 1>They smoke chillums of Hash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they knew they were in the hash,</v>

1256
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but they think that their aversion to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating cows may have had something to do</v>

1257
00:56:50.141 --> 00:56:53.170
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that these cows would </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1258
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.003
<v Speaker 1>And then the mushrooms grow other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they would eat these mushrooms </v>

1259
00:56:56.051 --> 00:56:58.510
<v Speaker 1>and have these profound experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that these,</v>

1260
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:01.030
<v Speaker 1>they thought of these cows as conduits </v>
<v Speaker 1>to God.</v>

1261
00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also the probably drank</v>

1262
00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:05.860
<v Speaker 1>the milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1263
00:57:05.861 --> 00:57:10.030
<v Speaker 1>they probably used them to plow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields to grow their food.</v>

1264
00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

1265
00:57:11.201 --> 00:57:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because when a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a culture has an aversion to eating</v>

1266
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:15.593
<v Speaker 1>a very specific animal and that specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal also is the main source of </v>

1267
00:57:19.511 --> 00:57:23.020
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mushrooms to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ignore that connection seems a little</v>

1268
00:57:23.021 --> 00:57:23.840
<v Speaker 1>bit weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1269
00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.673
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something that would be </v>

1270
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:28.870
<v Speaker 1>worth investigating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1271
00:57:28.871 --> 00:57:30.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

1272
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Worst case scenario come down to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to figure out if something else.</v>

1273
00:57:33.821 --> 00:57:36.250
<v Speaker 1>But we'll look at Shiva like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1274
00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:39.430
<v Speaker 1>You see that picture of Shiva?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Shiva has his arms,</v>

1275
00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.160
<v Speaker 1>six arms and Shiva standing on like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

1276
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:44.230
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always,</v>

1277
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I am like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a giant bronze Shiva in my house.</v>

1278
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And when I bought it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lady said,</v>

1279
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:50.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1280
00:57:50.531 --> 00:57:53.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shiva is standing on ignorance.</v>

1281
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 1>This is what it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1282
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought ignorance would be way bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

1283
00:57:57.650 --> 00:58:01.210
<v Speaker 1>It felt like an ignorance will be like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon.</v>

1284
00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.670
<v Speaker 1>That Shiva was like fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was much larger than him,</v>

1285
00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:07.420
<v Speaker 1>but when you that that thing that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing,</v>

1286
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:10.180
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens when you trip your </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls off.</v>

1287
00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:11.043
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you trip balls and you were started </v>

1288
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.200
<v Speaker 1>moving your arms around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think Josh,</v>

1289
00:58:14.201 --> 00:58:17.140
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got six on that.</v>

1290
00:58:17.141 --> 00:58:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so much of ancient Hindu </v>
<v Speaker 1>artwork that is a.</v>

1291
00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:23.830
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were just fan in a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>fart.</v>

1292
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Could be that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could it be that Jesus.</v>

1293
00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:27.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what we'll all have a fire around</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1294
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're lightened matches,</v>

1295
00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.710
<v Speaker 1>but the like ancient Hindu art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

1296
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:37.210
<v Speaker 1>There's this a iconography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like these iconic imagery,</v>

1297
00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:40.900
<v Speaker 1>this iconic imagery that you see when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do psychedelics.</v>

1298
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:41.734
<v Speaker 1>You see a lot of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly on mushrooms for some </v>

1299
00:58:43.781 --> 00:58:44.614
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see like ancient Hindu and </v>

1300
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.870
<v Speaker 1>sometimes ancient Egyptian shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1301
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:51.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see.</v>

1302
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:55.970
<v Speaker 1>You'll see a geometric shapes appear out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of and you know,</v>

1303
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.823
<v Speaker 1>to me I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's just what you see when </v>

1304
00:58:58.061 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 1>you're poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great.</v>

1305
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:01.270
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1306
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:03.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's not poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about it.</v>

1307
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.233
<v Speaker 1>It's the way it's affecting the way your</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual processing perturbance of your </v>

1308
00:59:08.501 --> 00:59:09.970
<v Speaker 1>visual cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1309
00:59:09.971 --> 00:59:12.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's not poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing.</v>

1310
00:59:12.011 --> 00:59:12.844
<v Speaker 1>It's like the ld 50 of mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible to eat yourself </v>

1311
00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:16.384
<v Speaker 1>to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd have to eat your own body </v>

1312
00:59:17.681 --> 00:59:20.380
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would get way too stuff.</v>

1313
00:59:20.381 --> 00:59:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Put them inside those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>croissants.</v>

1314
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:25.920
<v Speaker 2>So Catholic the songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're talking,</v>

1315
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:28.460
<v Speaker 2>it might be the move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So somebody with monster,</v>

1316
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.220
<v Speaker 2>that's a term that has continued to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout a.</v>

1317
00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:33.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a sleeping pill now.</v>

1318
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.053
<v Speaker 2>And then it was also a major element </v>
<v Speaker 2>within all this Huxley's brave new </v>

1319
00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:39.420
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which uh,</v>

1320
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was based on that I probably.</v>

1321
00:59:41.751 --> 00:59:46.700
<v Speaker 2>So I'm firmly of the belief that what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're living in is not a Orwellian,</v>

1322
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:51.580
<v Speaker 2>a potential desktop dystopic future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're living in a Huxley version because</v>

1323
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Huxley and Orwell was sought from two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways and in orwell was more of</v>

1324
00:59:55.401 --> 00:59:59.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there would be force and violence and,</v>

1325
00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:04.190
<v Speaker 2>and direct suppression of individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and groups and retrain.</v>

1326
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Now there is thought policing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1327
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.380
<v Speaker 2>even though they call them equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity,</v>

1328
01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:14.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever departments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1329
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:17.630
<v Speaker 2>there are people that are there to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1330
01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:18.464
<v Speaker 2>they have these cabals that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that try to force everybody to be in </v>

1331
01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:21.790
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1332
01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:22.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not necessarily gassing folks </v>

1333
01:00:23.931 --> 01:00:26.450
<v Speaker 2>are beating on them or what have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shock therapy.</v>

1334
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:28.243
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huxley's version of how this would all </v>

1335
01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:32.354
<v Speaker 2>go badly was that everybody would be so </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable that there would be so much </v>

1336
01:00:36.681 --> 01:00:41.681
<v Speaker 2>luxury and pleasure and that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just not fight back.</v>

1337
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that they would try to impart </v>

1338
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 2>upon you though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they would get you to do is just</v>

1339
01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.970
<v Speaker 2>make your life even softer and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>

1340
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huxley was right in that regard.</v>

1341
01:00:51.531 --> 01:00:52.364
<v Speaker 1>And also all there's so little danger in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and so little real drama that </v>

1342
01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:00.020
<v Speaker 1>we look for drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1343
01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:00.854
<v Speaker 1>we look forward to all over the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've made the world's going on most of </v>

1344
01:01:03.981 --> 01:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1345
01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>very safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for,</v>

1346
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>at least for us in Western first world </v>
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>

1347
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:11.120
<v Speaker 1>There's something that Dave Rubin </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeted today,</v>

1348
01:01:11.121 --> 01:01:12.640
<v Speaker 1>see if you could find this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1349
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>it's real reason that I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the mayor of Durham,</v>

1350
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently said something about Jordan </v>

1351
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.143
<v Speaker 1>Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Jordan Peterson is not welcome in </v>

1352
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:25.994
<v Speaker 1>Durham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Carolina because of his </v>

1353
01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:31.370
<v Speaker 1>transphobic and racist views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1354
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1355
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't read.</v>

1356
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>That man can make that a little larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking misrepresented person.</v>

1357
01:01:37.731 --> 01:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson has become just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1358
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:40.993
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We believe that Durham is a place for </v>

1359
01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black,</v>

1360
01:01:45.081 --> 01:01:45.914
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian,</v>

1361
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Latin X.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1362
01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I like how you went latinex instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latino,</v>

1363
01:01:49.941 --> 01:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>because if you say a lot to next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Latina,</v>

1364
01:01:52.671 --> 01:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Latino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get all the other Latino's.</v>

1365
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking any chances.</v>

1366
01:01:56.570 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Indigenous and mixed race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trans and CIS sisters in the real word.</v>

1367
01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>You're getting crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mayor.</v>

1368
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Gay and lesbian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queer and straight scissor thing.</v>

1369
01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Queer to cover all of it anymore.</v>

1370
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm always confused by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got very open vague term.</v>

1371
01:02:13.561 --> 01:02:15.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe there is a in there.</v>

1372
01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's some sort of accepted </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard for what?</v>

1373
01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 2>What defines queer versus</v>

1374
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.430
<v Speaker 3>getting an asexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that all right?</v>

1375
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 3>How come you didn't put that in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>asexual people?</v>

1376
01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:26.964
<v Speaker 3>You should march out now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're attack the asexual activist </v>

1377
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:31.303
<v Speaker 3>lobbies coming from those who seek to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exclude or deny the humanity of others </v>

1378
01:02:34.591 --> 01:02:35.424
<v Speaker 3>will find was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting statement that </v>

1379
01:02:38.101 --> 01:02:38.934
<v Speaker 3>people like to make deny the humanity </v>
<v Speaker 3>like who said that you who's denying </v>

1380
01:02:42.061 --> 01:02:44.340
<v Speaker 3>your humanity even even assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1381
01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:45.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean even some of this is just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>prick.</v>

1382
01:02:45.871 --> 01:02:49.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just heard it and responded to it.</v>

1383
01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:51.690
<v Speaker 3>You're living the life that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

1384
01:02:51.691 --> 01:02:54.720
<v Speaker 3>How can they deny your humanity will </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this?</v>

1385
01:02:54.721 --> 01:02:55.554
<v Speaker 3>We wish to emphasize that a person's </v>
<v Speaker 3>right to free speech does not include </v>

1386
01:02:58.261 --> 01:03:00.900
<v Speaker 3>the right to a platform or an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1387
01:03:00.901 --> 01:03:04.770
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't deny that people are listening</v>

1388
01:03:04.771 --> 01:03:05.604
<v Speaker 3>to him and enjoy his work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're gonna make these broad </v>

1389
01:03:08.611 --> 01:03:09.270
<v Speaker 3>statements.</v>

1390
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:12.480
<v Speaker 3>You have to have some sort of evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>to back up what you're saying.</v>

1391
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:16.320
<v Speaker 3>I know Jordan Peterson and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely not a racist.</v>

1392
01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.173
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's definitely not transphobic or </v>

1393
01:03:18.601 --> 01:03:22.510
<v Speaker 3>homophobic or any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was against compelled speech.</v>

1394
01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Jesse compelled speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>state compelled speech,</v>

1395
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:26.543
<v Speaker 3>meaning that there was a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different words that they were forcing </v>

1396
01:03:29.401 --> 01:03:34.050
<v Speaker 3>people to use that where these new </v>
<v Speaker 3>gender pronouns and they were compelling</v>

1397
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.950
<v Speaker 3>and they have human rights councils in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada and he is,</v>

1398
01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:39.163
<v Speaker 3>he's a mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a clinical psychologist and he's </v>

1399
01:03:41.521 --> 01:03:46.521
<v Speaker 3>very well read and he understands like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism and all the Pid postmodernism in</v>

1400
01:03:47.611 --> 01:03:48.444
<v Speaker 3>neo Marxism and its evolution from </v>
<v Speaker 3>classical Marxism and how it's been </v>

1401
01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:52.374
<v Speaker 3>influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference between emphasizing the </v>

1402
01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:58.050
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure over the base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just virtue signaling in its worst form.</v>

1403
01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:58.940
<v Speaker 3>I am a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1404
01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:01.110
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very familiar with jps work.</v>

1405
01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 3>He actually sent me a copy of his book </v>
<v Speaker 3>through twitter.</v>

1406
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:05.483
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

1407
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:06.503
<v Speaker 3>Which was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the way I came across Jordan </v>

1408
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Peterson was that as a big fan of nature</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his philosophical writings,</v>

1409
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.393
<v Speaker 3>so I'd go on Youtube to see if I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>find lectures on nature and in his maps </v>

1410
01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:20.160
<v Speaker 3>of meaning lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was before any of the like,</v>

1411
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:23.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issues with BLC 16 really.</v>

1412
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.353
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know about any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just listening to Jordan Peterson </v>

1413
01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:29.450
<v Speaker 3>lectures because of him referencing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about Nisha,</v>

1414
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:32.700
<v Speaker 3>so and then from Nietzsche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dostoevsky and all this,</v>

1415
01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:33.534
<v Speaker 3>and then it started talk a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism and communism and postmodernism </v>

1416
01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:42.360
<v Speaker 3>in reference to each other in other ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the [inaudible] stuff.</v>

1417
01:04:42.361 --> 01:04:44.190
<v Speaker 3>And then I was living with a Marxist for</v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

1418
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.540
<v Speaker 3>So I started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you really?</v>

1419
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

1420
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not fun.</v>

1421
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.493
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time I had to try to </v>

1422
01:04:50.941 --> 01:04:55.260
<v Speaker 3>understand what the arguments that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>being made and why.</v>

1423
01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.680
<v Speaker 3>And so you got to go research them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if someone says,</v>

1424
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.350
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wage gap,</v>

1425
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.191
<v Speaker 3>blah blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1426
01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:03.024
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1427
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:04.223
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I guess I need to look up the </v>

1428
01:05:05.011 --> 01:05:07.530
<v Speaker 3>research on what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you come back and you go,</v>

1429
01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.813
<v Speaker 3>oh well that's actually not an apples </v>
<v Speaker 3>for apples comparison and it's not 70 </v>

1430
01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:12.543
<v Speaker 3>percent on the dollar and you just go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into it and then they just look at you </v>

1431
01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:16.620
<v Speaker 3>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1432
01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read,</v>

1433
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:19.240
<v Speaker 3>what's your source?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1434
01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:20.074
<v Speaker 3>this thing I read that source,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't talk about education level </v>

1435
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:26.890
<v Speaker 3>job for job hours work like it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

1436
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean no one's saying that things </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't be better.</v>

1437
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heard this argument before,</v>

1438
01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:34.300
<v Speaker 3>when you hear about the wage gap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gender wage gap,</v>

1439
01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:38.150
<v Speaker 3>it's not the people doing the same job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's this.</v>

1440
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.063
<v Speaker 3>This is the best way to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not people doing the same job and </v>

1441
01:05:41.051 --> 01:05:41.884
<v Speaker 3>it's not people working the same hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why men make more money as </v>

1442
01:05:43.811 --> 01:05:44.644
<v Speaker 3>they do different jobs now are those </v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs more difficult for women to get is </v>

1443
01:05:47.231 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 3>a real question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them I imagine they are perhaps.</v>

1444
01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:51.544
<v Speaker 3>I mean I never doubt that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential sexism or any sort of ism to </v>

1445
01:05:55.211 --> 01:05:58.470
<v Speaker 3>some degree in some sexism coming from </v>
<v Speaker 3>both sides of the tracks.</v>

1446
01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:00.213
<v Speaker 3>How many women want to be working on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking oil rig out in the middle of or </v>

1447
01:06:03.521 --> 01:06:07.550
<v Speaker 3>doing pipelines up in a frozen south,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Dakota or something,</v>

1448
01:06:07.551 --> 01:06:08.384
<v Speaker 3>and they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how many of them are physically </v>

1449
01:06:10.001 --> 01:06:14.230
<v Speaker 3>capable of doing the work to which isn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman's fault at all and you can't.</v>

1450
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:16.360
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't hold it against anybody or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if they didn't,</v>

1451
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:17.253
<v Speaker 3>if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did not want to choose to do that kind </v>

1452
01:06:19.091 --> 01:06:19.924
<v Speaker 3>of employment.</v>

1453
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:21.750
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing wrong with that either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1454
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.983
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a woman wanted to go off and make </v>

1455
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:25.900
<v Speaker 3>artisans soap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1456
01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.393
<v Speaker 3>That motherfucker could make the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>soap with essential oils that are the </v>

1457
01:06:30.761 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 3>best for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1458
01:06:32.081 --> 01:06:32.914
<v Speaker 3>like how you use the fence soap stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if that was a woman that came and </v>

1459
01:06:34.871 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 3>created all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a valuable,</v>

1460
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:38.703
<v Speaker 3>respectable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic thing that they just didn't </v>

1461
01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.030
<v Speaker 3>require physical strength anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

1462
01:06:43.031 --> 01:06:46.150
<v Speaker 3>don't diminish the compliments of </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else just because it doesn't fit</v>

1463
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.550
<v Speaker 3>what you think is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1464
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.393
<v Speaker 3>the problem is when we get into teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man mean toxic tribalism is the real </v>

1465
01:06:51.371 --> 01:06:52.204
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is people getting </v>

1466
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.630
<v Speaker 3>teams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's male versus female and this</v>

1467
01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:56.493
<v Speaker 3>mayor of Durham Guarantee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's a lot of this stuff is </v>

1468
01:06:59.321 --> 01:07:00.154
<v Speaker 3>weaponized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most of the stuff about the </v>

1469
01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:03.124
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm also in ingredients with </v>

1470
01:07:05.111 --> 01:07:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1471
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:07.900
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't exist.</v>

1472
01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:11.470
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way that human history </v>
<v Speaker 3>has has rolled out.</v>

1473
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to end or the wage cap.</v>

1474
01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:18.070
<v Speaker 3>These are weaponized things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They use them in a weaponized way to try</v>

1475
01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:18.904
<v Speaker 3>and destroy your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your argument or your position or your </v>

1476
01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:25.210
<v Speaker 3>way of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weaponized administrator point of</v>

1477
01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:27.640
<v Speaker 3>view by saying it's what's your white </v>
<v Speaker 3>privilege talking?</v>

1478
01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I get a lot of white privilege</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

1479
01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:31.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm so white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big white,</v>

1480
01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:32.763
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very white with a red beard from the </v>

1481
01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much?</v>

1482
01:07:37.211 --> 01:07:40.540
<v Speaker 3>How much can you get any white?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I get any wider,</v>

1483
01:07:40.541 --> 01:07:43.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be wearing a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>birkenstocks with socks on.</v>

1484
01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:48.980
<v Speaker 3>You should have a tail and a man bun is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bowl,</v>

1485
01:07:49.661 --> 01:07:50.890
<v Speaker 3>a ponytail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1486
01:07:50.891 --> 01:07:52.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1487
01:07:52.531 --> 01:07:53.050
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1488
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.900
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these terms are used in,</v>

1489
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.620
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in conflict.</v>

1490
01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when,</v>

1491
01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:59.250
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't they be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because most of the,</v>

1492
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.970
<v Speaker 3>the source material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the creation of the,</v>

1493
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:05.860
<v Speaker 3>these sort of ideological viewpoints are</v>
<v Speaker 3>from postmodernist,</v>

1494
01:08:05.861 --> 01:08:06.611
<v Speaker 3>neo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism,</v>

1495
01:08:06.611 --> 01:08:09.160
<v Speaker 3>and it's all based on the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict theory.</v>

1496
01:08:09.161 --> 01:08:11.890
<v Speaker 3>So there's always going to be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>oppressor and oppressed.</v>

1497
01:08:11.891 --> 01:08:14.410
<v Speaker 3>So if what you are doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1498
01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 3>is trying to</v>

1499
01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:20.660
<v Speaker 2>argue with or even just make your case </v>
<v Speaker 2>to someone who's an oppressor,</v>

1500
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:23.180
<v Speaker 2>well it would be weaponized because as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as you're concerned,</v>

1501
01:08:23.181 --> 01:08:24.950
<v Speaker 2>everything they do is weaponized against</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1502
01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:25.853
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've already chosen a </v>

1503
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.690
<v Speaker 2>confrontational position.</v>

1504
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:32.350
<v Speaker 5>There's also a problem with people </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanting to be.</v>

1505
01:08:32.351 --> 01:08:34.870
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's human nature.</v>

1506
01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:35.733
<v Speaker 5>But I also like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's someone who's a </v>

1507
01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:41.320
<v Speaker 5>postmodernist or someone who is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>staunch conservative,</v>

1508
01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.620
<v Speaker 5>people go into any discussion with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>presuppose or they have a preordained or</v>

1509
01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.333
<v Speaker 5>are they have a collected group of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they have attached themselves to </v>

1510
01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.370
<v Speaker 5>and they do not want to let those go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1511
01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:56.283
<v Speaker 5>and you have yours and I have mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult for people to just </v>

1512
01:08:58.481 --> 01:08:59.314
<v Speaker 5>talk and very difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 5>just someone to lay out their their </v>

1513
01:09:03.190 --> 01:09:04.023
<v Speaker 5>position and someone else to lay out </v>
<v Speaker 5>their position and to people to like </v>

1514
01:09:06.601 --> 01:09:10.210
<v Speaker 5>cordially discuss the merits of each </v>
<v Speaker 5>position with an open mind.</v>

1515
01:09:10.450 --> 01:09:11.283
<v Speaker 5>It happens so rarely and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 5>I try so hard to do and it's something </v>

1516
01:09:16.421 --> 01:09:21.421
<v Speaker 5>that it took me years to cultivate the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mindset to not,</v>

1517
01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:26.260
<v Speaker 5>not have these preexisting conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>preexisting ideas or if I do have them,</v>

1518
01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:30.430
<v Speaker 5>don't attach myself to them and be ready</v>
<v Speaker 5>to abandon them at any moment.</v>

1519
01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:32.530
<v Speaker 5>Like under the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>under new evidence.</v>

1520
01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1521
01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:35.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no problem in saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1522
01:09:35.661 --> 01:09:40.661
<v Speaker 2>well I believe a new believer B and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>both believed them to be correct.</v>

1523
01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me why I am,</v>

1524
01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.340
<v Speaker 2>why a is incorrect or better yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me why you believe what you believe</v>

1525
01:09:49.570 --> 01:09:51.320
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me get into some reason.</v>

1526
01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:55.400
<v Speaker 2>What are the facts and let's find if </v>
<v Speaker 2>those facts are real.</v>

1527
01:09:55.401 --> 01:09:56.960
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I used to,</v>

1528
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:58.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have these conversations with this </v>

1529
01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:04.460
<v Speaker 2>person used to that I was living with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say like,</v>

1530
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:05.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just always have to be right.</v>

1531
01:10:05.571 --> 01:10:05.871
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1532
01:10:05.871 --> 01:10:06.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1533
01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to be right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're going to make a claim,</v>

1534
01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.690
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to defend your </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument and I'll defend mind,</v>

1535
01:10:11.691 --> 01:10:12.524
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately I don't care if I'm wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>because being wrong only means that I </v>

1536
01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:18.530
<v Speaker 2>could then perhaps work towards a way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

1537
01:10:18.670 --> 01:10:20.660
<v Speaker 2>the having the most understanding that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can have.</v>

1538
01:10:20.690 --> 01:10:24.530
<v Speaker 2>We as human beings are wrong so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than we're ever right,</v>

1539
01:10:24.531 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 2>but by being wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by making mistakes,</v>

1540
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:31.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like a through martial arts by </v>
<v Speaker 2>being on the mats and you know,</v>

1541
01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:32.133
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get this guy's ankle right </v>

1542
01:10:32.871 --> 01:10:33.621
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1543
01:10:33.621 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 2>fuck that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked that up.</v>

1544
01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I got caught up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that up.</v>

1545
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:39.890
<v Speaker 2>You can't get to the point to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1546
01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:41.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how you set it up.</v>

1547
01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:42.793
<v Speaker 2>This is the way that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't securing the knee well enough </v>

1548
01:10:44.961 --> 01:10:46.730
<v Speaker 2>so it was always sliding out of position</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I couldn't,</v>

1549
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the leg framed in such a position </v>

1550
01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:52.340
<v Speaker 2>where when I applied my hold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pressure went through the joint that</v>

1551
01:10:52.341 --> 01:10:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I needed it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1552
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.960
<v Speaker 2>None of that happens until you make </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake after mistake,</v>

1553
01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:59.460
<v Speaker 2>after mistake after mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's nothing wrong with,</v>

1554
01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:00.303
<v Speaker 2>with before making a move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving forward on something to sit back </v>

1555
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 2>and to study a little bit and to try and</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand somewhat of the landscape,</v>

1556
01:11:08.841 --> 01:11:10.850
<v Speaker 2>but eventually the only thing you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is you just got to go,</v>

1557
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:11.631
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1558
01:11:11.631 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 2>analysis paralysis through analysis </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't gonna help you either.</v>

1559
01:11:14.890 --> 01:11:15.723
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lived a good portion of my life </v>

1560
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:19.880
<v Speaker 5>wanting to be right always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>

1561
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:22.600
<v Speaker 5>and it's a toxic mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible for you.</v>

1562
01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.990
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible for you because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>grow and then you have to live in denial</v>

1563
01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:26.973
<v Speaker 5>and then you have to always tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself that you were right and they </v>

1564
01:11:28.601 --> 01:11:29.434
<v Speaker 5>were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you get out debated or even if </v>

1565
01:11:32.171 --> 01:11:34.030
<v Speaker 5>you're faced with new evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1566
01:11:34.031 --> 01:11:36.970
<v Speaker 5>you try to ignore that new evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know the mindset,</v>

1567
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:38.290
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lived in it for many,</v>

1568
01:11:38.291 --> 01:11:39.124
<v Speaker 5>many good to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an easy place to normal and it's </v>

1569
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.860
<v Speaker 5>hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to relax yourself.</v>

1570
01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:49.120
<v Speaker 5>Just realize that you are not facts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are not your ideas,</v>

1571
01:11:49.121 --> 01:11:50.530
<v Speaker 5>your not your opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1572
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:51.403
<v Speaker 5>your you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you attach yourself to these </v>

1573
01:11:53.111 --> 01:11:55.570
<v Speaker 5>opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these ideas like you're going to,</v>

1574
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:58.090
<v Speaker 5>it's a fucking trap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you have to know what,</v>

1575
01:11:58.091 --> 01:12:00.010
<v Speaker 5>like here's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's something I know for a fact,</v>

1576
01:12:00.370 --> 01:12:02.470
<v Speaker 5>this wood is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've hit this,</v>

1577
01:12:02.471 --> 01:12:03.460
<v Speaker 5>would meet with my knuckles.</v>

1578
01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.230
<v Speaker 5>That shit's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it dropped on you,</v>

1579
01:12:05.231 --> 01:12:08.420
<v Speaker 5>it would hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are undeniable facts and the.</v>

1580
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:11.170
<v Speaker 5>There's a gang of those that you have in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>

1581
01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:12.980
<v Speaker 5>There's a gang of undeniable facts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I cut down.</v>

1582
01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:14.740
<v Speaker 5>Objectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:12:15.190 --> 01:12:16.023
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not Marxism can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>successfully implemented in the large </v>

1584
01:12:18.881 --> 01:12:21.040
<v Speaker 5>scale with a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sensitive,</v>

1585
01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:24.340
<v Speaker 5>compassionate group of human beings that</v>
<v Speaker 5>all live together.</v>

1586
01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.250
<v Speaker 5>Who Kenneth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1587
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:28.560
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1588
01:12:28.570 --> 01:12:29.560
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know though.</v>

1589
01:12:29.561 --> 01:12:30.760
<v Speaker 5>See what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is a,</v>

1590
01:12:30.761 --> 01:12:33.000
<v Speaker 5>this is a comp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't been done before.</v>

1591
01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:35.440
<v Speaker 5>A socialism never really worked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but can it work?</v>

1592
01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:36.483
<v Speaker 5>Did the argument that it can't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to me that doesn't make any </v>

1593
01:12:39.821 --> 01:12:40.654
<v Speaker 5>sense either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe you could work well the </v>

1594
01:12:42.371 --> 01:12:45.520
<v Speaker 5>argument that it could work is that but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but see what I'm saying like these are.</v>

1595
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.300
<v Speaker 5>These are like really to think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>Rod.</v>

1596
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Complex nuanced concepts that need to be</v>

1597
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.313
<v Speaker 5>discussed up and down and back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you also need to look at the weight </v>

1598
01:12:56.980 --> 01:13:00.070
<v Speaker 5>of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the myriad times it's failed,</v>

1599
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:00.953
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in human history and even in ways </v>

1600
01:13:03.031 --> 01:13:03.864
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not directly related to say </v>

1601
01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:05.514
<v Speaker 2>Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just to look at patterns and trends </v>

1602
01:13:07.531 --> 01:13:12.240
<v Speaker 2>and ways of people of operating and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see how okay,</v>

1603
01:13:12.241 --> 01:13:13.074
<v Speaker 2>well given a different circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would that process work within this </v>

1604
01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:20.010
<v Speaker 2>one or this one or this one or this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then even if you wanted to say,</v>

1605
01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:22.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're like,</v>

1606
01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.064
<v Speaker 2>well I don't think Marxism would work </v>
<v Speaker 2>well you can't say that until you </v>

1607
01:13:26.071 --> 01:13:28.800
<v Speaker 2>actually study what Marxism is and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>its principles are.</v>

1608
01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument,</v>

1609
01:13:31.321 --> 01:13:32.670
<v Speaker 2>and this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know John,</v>

1610
01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:33.563
<v Speaker 2>John Stuart Mill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't just defend your side without </v>

1611
01:13:37.051 --> 01:13:38.480
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1612
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:39.383
<v Speaker 2>You have really no opposition to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your position isn't any better than </v>

1613
01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:41.990
<v Speaker 2>theirs.</v>

1614
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:43.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a really good point.</v>

1615
01:13:43.191 --> 01:13:44.024
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think everybody should do that no </v>

1616
01:13:44.871 --> 01:13:47.690
<v Speaker 5>matter what you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like whatever you're trying to defend,</v>

1617
01:13:47.691 --> 01:13:48.524
<v Speaker 5>look at even even if it's something </v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible and it's like a racist </v>

1618
01:13:51.531 --> 01:13:53.510
<v Speaker 5>position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>find out why these people support</v>

1619
01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:54.810
<v Speaker 2>so they believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1620
01:13:54.811 --> 01:13:55.644
<v Speaker 2>And so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do they believe this racist </v>

1621
01:13:56.731 --> 01:13:57.564
<v Speaker 2>position?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it about them that they think </v>

1622
01:13:58.741 --> 01:14:02.250
<v Speaker 2>gives it validity and you can look at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>

1623
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.070
<v Speaker 2>I could see where they could take this </v>
<v Speaker 2>way too.</v>

1624
01:14:05.071 --> 01:14:07.650
<v Speaker 2>It's extreme in that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's nonsensical,</v>

1625
01:14:07.651 --> 01:14:09.780
<v Speaker 2>but you see where it started or you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>see like that.</v>

1626
01:14:09.781 --> 01:14:10.614
<v Speaker 2>That's everything about this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is clearly driven by something else and </v>

1627
01:14:13.211 --> 01:14:15.640
<v Speaker 2>not the not what they claim so</v>

1628
01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:17.130
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also the,</v>

1629
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:18.263
<v Speaker 5>one of the things about society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we really have to take into </v>

1630
01:14:19.861 --> 01:14:21.750
<v Speaker 5>consideration is the momentum of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>past.</v>

1631
01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:22.853
<v Speaker 5>Like there's this country has a unique </v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom to it because it was literally </v>

1632
01:14:27.961 --> 01:14:28.794
<v Speaker 5>created by people who decided to get on </v>
<v Speaker 5>a boat and risk traveling across the </v>

1633
01:14:32.881 --> 01:14:34.440
<v Speaker 5>ocean to some new land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1634
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.393
<v Speaker 5>it's a country filled with savages like </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy people that took wild chances and </v>

1635
01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:40.203
<v Speaker 5>did wild things because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you look at the history of this </v>

1636
01:14:42.601 --> 01:14:45.720
<v Speaker 5>country that's clearly established by </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the art,</v>

1637
01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:48.380
<v Speaker 5>look at the music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the things that have come out,</v>

1638
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.233
<v Speaker 5>the comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of these things that have been </v>

1639
01:14:49.921 --> 01:14:51.060
<v Speaker 5>created,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cars,</v>

1640
01:14:51.061 --> 01:14:55.430
<v Speaker 5>all the different things that have come </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of this one place and this one place</v>

1641
01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.273
<v Speaker 5>just happens to be the most recent place</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the least amount of historical </v>

1642
01:14:59.971 --> 01:15:00.870
<v Speaker 5>baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1643
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:03.780
<v Speaker 5>But then you look at the places that </v>
<v Speaker 5>have the most amount of historic baggage</v>

1644
01:15:03.781 --> 01:15:04.614
<v Speaker 5>like Africa or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some parts of Russia and these are </v>

1645
01:15:09.001 --> 01:15:11.550
<v Speaker 5>places where they have the hardest time </v>
<v Speaker 5>breaking out of these,</v>

1646
01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:14.430
<v Speaker 5>the weight of the cultural momentum of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the past.</v>

1647
01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:15.321
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1648
01:15:15.321 --> 01:15:16.154
<v Speaker 5>it's very difficult for people to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to radically change and established </v>

1649
01:15:20.131 --> 01:15:22.500
<v Speaker 5>system that has existed for a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

1650
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:23.423
<v Speaker 2>Well that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you were to say think about </v>

1651
01:15:26.730 --> 01:15:31.730
<v Speaker 2>communism and the Soviet states in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>length of what constitutes human history</v>

1652
01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:34.360
<v Speaker 2>is has only been gone for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was only,</v>

1653
01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.830
<v Speaker 2>it was around for a short time and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only been gone for an even shorter time.</v>

1654
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.273
<v Speaker 5>Like come on and it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's still a dictatorship over </v>

1655
01:15:42.741 --> 01:15:43.880
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1656
01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.240
<v Speaker 5>I guess they're trying to that Russia to</v>
<v Speaker 5>cheer about that lady in Iran.</v>

1657
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:51.590
<v Speaker 5>That's she's going to jail that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dancing and dancing?</v>

1658
01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh no,</v>

1659
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.200
<v Speaker 5>the Egyptian girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The girl,</v>

1660
01:15:54.201 --> 01:15:57.290
<v Speaker 5>the Lebanese girls going to jail for </v>
<v Speaker 5>she.</v>

1661
01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.040
<v Speaker 5>She made a youtube video about getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>sexually harassed in Egypt.</v>

1662
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:04.250
<v Speaker 5>So they sentenced her to eight years in </v>
<v Speaker 5>prison.</v>

1663
01:16:04.251 --> 01:16:07.760
<v Speaker 5>She's 22 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Fuck it terrifying.</v>

1664
01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:10.090
<v Speaker 5>She's a young 22,</v>
<v Speaker 5>24,</v>

1665
01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:10.933
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's young and they sentenced her to </v>

1666
01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:15.140
<v Speaker 5>eight fucking years that the people here</v>

1667
01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:18.840
<v Speaker 2>in America or western the Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization at large.</v>

1668
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:19.703
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just put on the blinders about </v>

1669
01:16:22.561 --> 01:16:24.210
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there are places,</v>

1670
01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:27.750
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to demonize these </v>
<v Speaker 2>places either,</v>

1671
01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:32.840
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time you as a 22 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old could have a complaint and say,</v>

1672
01:16:33.541 --> 01:16:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am like,</v>

1673
01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:37.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing happened and I'm,</v>

1674
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:39.390
<v Speaker 2>this is fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden they can go,</v>

1675
01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that was fucked up,</v>

1676
01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:44.100
<v Speaker 2>boom and throw your ass in jail or have </v>
<v Speaker 2>you executed or whatever.</v>

1677
01:16:44.101 --> 01:16:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1678
01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:46.373
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I guess I don't have the right to </v>

1679
01:16:47.671 --> 01:16:49.950
<v Speaker 2>express myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you know,</v>

1680
01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:53.820
<v Speaker 2>people will show up and bang on doors </v>
<v Speaker 2>and do all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

1681
01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:54.683
<v Speaker 2>When Jordan Peterson comes and does a </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk and the thing is they're allowed </v>

1682
01:16:59.161 --> 01:16:59.994
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're allowed to protest what he has </v>

1683
01:17:00.781 --> 01:17:01.614
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>counter protests if they want or to </v>

1684
01:17:03.841 --> 01:17:08.000
<v Speaker 2>express their unhappiness with things </v>
<v Speaker 2>political and things,</v>

1685
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:09.143
<v Speaker 2>media way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can say what they want in terms </v>

1686
01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:16.061
<v Speaker 2>of what makes them unhappy without fear </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the government silencing you.</v>

1687
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a major thing.</v>

1688
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:21.930
<v Speaker 5>It's a major thing and this poor girl in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Iran,</v>

1689
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.823
<v Speaker 5>she's just dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know people that are always rail </v>

1690
01:17:24.601 --> 01:17:25.434
<v Speaker 5>against Islam or Islamophobia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so much Islamophobia in this </v>

1691
01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:29.940
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1692
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.380
<v Speaker 5>sure there is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right,</v>

1693
01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:32.940
<v Speaker 5>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know what else there is,</v>

1694
01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:33.893
<v Speaker 5>there's also radical Islam and radical </v>
<v Speaker 5>Islamic governments that are putting </v>

1695
01:17:37.381 --> 01:17:39.720
<v Speaker 5>women in jail because they fucking damn </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious.</v>

1696
01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:42.390
<v Speaker 5>And that's happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just resist religious zealots</v>

1697
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:44.040
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while I have,</v>

1698
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will often get into a </v>

1699
01:17:46.171 --> 01:17:47.460
<v Speaker 2>conversation about this and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring up,</v>

1700
01:17:47.461 --> 01:17:48.900
<v Speaker 2>well what about the Crusades or what </v>
<v Speaker 2>about this?</v>

1701
01:17:48.901 --> 01:17:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1702
01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:51.240
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are all relevant things to.</v>

1703
01:17:51.241 --> 01:17:54.540
<v Speaker 2>And while the Crusades are not nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut and dry as you think they are,</v>

1704
01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.150
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which two it ended in the fourth crusade</v>

1705
01:17:57.151 --> 01:17:59.190
<v Speaker 2>to two groups went down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1706
01:17:59.310 --> 01:18:02.590
<v Speaker 2>and then end up fighting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're both Christians.</v>

1707
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you thinking?</v>

1708
01:18:03.850 --> 01:18:06.210
<v Speaker 2>But then you had things like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inquisition you have,</v>

1709
01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:08.220
<v Speaker 2>you've had all kinds of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1710
01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:09.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1711
01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.160
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1712
01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.270
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't erase this.</v>

1713
01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.460
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't balance each other out.</v>

1714
01:18:14.461 --> 01:18:15.460
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

1715
01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's because it's one religion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not the other.</v>

1716
01:18:18.881 --> 01:18:19.930
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

1717
01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motivations are the same,</v>

1718
01:18:21.911 --> 01:18:24.060
<v Speaker 2>that kind of comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes from the same concept.</v>

1719
01:18:24.061 --> 01:18:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's not technically the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

1720
01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:28.000
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it reinforces it in my opinion.</v>

1721
01:18:28.001 --> 01:18:28.834
<v Speaker 5>I mean the idea that it's not the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>that Christianity is so amazing and </v>

1722
01:18:31.721 --> 01:18:32.554
<v Speaker 5>Islam is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that ideologies force people into </v>

1723
01:18:35.501 --> 01:18:37.180
<v Speaker 5>very terrible behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can,</v>

1724
01:18:37.181 --> 01:18:38.410
<v Speaker 5>they can very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very much.</v>

1725
01:18:38.411 --> 01:18:40.090
<v Speaker 5>And they often do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:40.983
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of the time it goes bad when you </v>

1727
01:18:42.731 --> 01:18:46.070
<v Speaker 5>have a powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>potent ideology that dominating</v>

1728
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:47.670
<v Speaker 2>well imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1729
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.533
<v Speaker 2>you had a Christian zealotry and let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>say Islam and Christianity had swapped </v>

1730
01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.253
<v Speaker 2>and Islam had all kinds of reformations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and different sex break off from it and </v>

1731
01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:01.680
<v Speaker 2>all this and it become more like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity is in this modern era.</v>

1732
01:19:01.681 --> 01:19:02.514
<v Speaker 2>But Christianity stayed in a more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a less developed sense and had a more </v>

1733
01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:07.643
<v Speaker 2>rigorous fervin zealotry in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>adherence to doctrines or at least or </v>

1734
01:19:11.701 --> 01:19:14.160
<v Speaker 2>even a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1735
01:19:14.370 --> 01:19:16.740
<v Speaker 2>interpretations of doctrines and certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways to estimate stocks.</v>

1736
01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:17.593
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but within this context of the modern </v>

1737
01:19:19.951 --> 01:19:21.360
<v Speaker 2>era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you have the Internet.</v>

1738
01:19:21.361 --> 01:19:23.520
<v Speaker 2>So any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

1739
01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only got like a million people in </v>

1740
01:19:27.331 --> 01:19:28.164
<v Speaker 2>the world that feel this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these million can all connect with </v>

1741
01:19:29.971 --> 01:19:32.610
<v Speaker 2>each other via social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different electronic ways.</v>

1742
01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:33.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can create a weapon where they can </v>

1743
01:19:36.691 --> 01:19:39.240
<v Speaker 2>weaponize things much easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can coordinate,</v>

1744
01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:39.600
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>

1745
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.433
<v Speaker 2>It's not like the Crusades where you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get money from a king and other Gulf </v>

1746
01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.230
<v Speaker 2>other monarchs get together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these troops get together,</v>

1747
01:19:49.231 --> 01:19:50.064
<v Speaker 2>all these supplies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>marched them all down into the Middle </v>

1748
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:54.263
<v Speaker 2>East to where you've got the Turks </v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for you that they've done the </v>

1749
01:19:56.101 --> 01:19:56.934
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you guys all meet up on these </v>

1750
01:19:57.991 --> 01:19:59.560
<v Speaker 2>different points of battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1751
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.820
<v Speaker 2>you could literally be at war all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

1752
01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:05.650
<v Speaker 2>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day,</v>

1753
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:09.750
<v Speaker 2>all at the same time because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern advances of technology.</v>

1754
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:10.703
<v Speaker 2>And not to mention you have firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have explosive and chemicals and </v>

1755
01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:16.800
<v Speaker 2>things that you can use to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>disposal.</v>

1756
01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:18.870
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a truck,</v>

1757
01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:20.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have,</v>

1758
01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six ton trucks and drive into a crowd.</v>

1759
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:29.310
<v Speaker 2>That's just technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1760
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:30.121
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps,</v>

1761
01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:30.954
<v Speaker 2>it makes our lives better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in other ways it can also create </v>

1762
01:20:34.021 --> 01:20:36.450
<v Speaker 2>calamity for us and it's really their </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools.</v>

1763
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media is a tool.</v>

1764
01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I think the social media is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were to track mass,</v>

1765
01:20:41.911 --> 01:20:46.830
<v Speaker 2>the mass shootings that have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rise of social media and the rise of</v>

1766
01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:48.600
<v Speaker 2>mass shootings would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be on a parallel.</v>

1767
01:20:48.930 --> 01:20:49.763
<v Speaker 2>I really think that it's social media </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's increasing the amount that you </v>

1768
01:20:52.621 --> 01:20:54.270
<v Speaker 2>see with the school shooting and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1769
01:20:54.271 --> 01:20:55.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that because they get fame from </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1770
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.083
<v Speaker 2>they get fame or you're able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>antagonize someone and they can't get </v>

1771
01:21:00.361 --> 01:21:03.560
<v Speaker 2>away from you much more easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1772
01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:06.990
<v Speaker 2>the resulting mount using a Nietzschean </v>
<v Speaker 2>term in terms of,</v>

1773
01:21:06.991 --> 01:21:07.824
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1774
01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:08.913
<v Speaker 2>the resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the resentfulness from seeing other </v>

1775
01:21:11.641 --> 01:21:13.830
<v Speaker 2>people having what you think you deserve</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1776
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.903
<v Speaker 2>or doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that they somehow are having </v>

1777
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.600
<v Speaker 2>more of what you think you want that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1778
01:21:21.601 --> 01:21:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Why do they get to have it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>

1779
01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:27.900
<v Speaker 2>or any number of reasons why you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly potently resentful.</v>

1780
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.273
<v Speaker 2>And now you have this thing that's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life pumping all this kind of </v>

1781
01:21:32.911 --> 01:21:36.420
<v Speaker 2>stuff that you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that it can affect people in</v>

1782
01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:37.254
<v Speaker 2>some really pathologically bad ways and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now you have technology to also enact </v>

1783
01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:44.550
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's not in the end,</v>

1784
01:21:44.551 --> 01:21:47.220
<v Speaker 2>you can also easily make the argument if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a firearm,</v>

1785
01:21:47.230 --> 01:21:48.290
<v Speaker 2>it could be something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1786
01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:52.410
<v Speaker 2>and that's doesn't make it any better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that the,</v>

1787
01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.250
<v Speaker 2>the rise of social media has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1788
01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.113
<v Speaker 2>is a direct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a correlator are directly responsible </v>

1789
01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:01.794
<v Speaker 2>for the rise in these school shootings </v>
<v Speaker 2>and directly responsible or directly </v>

1790
01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:06.323
<v Speaker 2>correlates to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's a correlation </v>

1791
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:10.050
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think certainly there's a lot going on</v>

1792
01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:12.600
<v Speaker 2>in society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the big factor,</v>

1793
01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.820
<v Speaker 2>well there's a lot of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are alienated,</v>

1794
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.580
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's terrible child rearing.</v>

1795
01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:21.120
<v Speaker 2>People have mental health issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are medicated.</v>

1796
01:22:21.150 --> 01:22:23.730
<v Speaker 2>There's the big one is now imagine all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with the,</v>

1797
01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.073
<v Speaker 2>the technology of social media able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>heighten some of the effects of some of </v>

1798
01:22:28.891 --> 01:22:33.891
<v Speaker 2>these things or to create.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone that feels alienated.</v>

1799
01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Imagine now not only do you feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>alienated in the real world,</v>

1800
01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.030
<v Speaker 2>but then when you're on social media you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

1801
01:22:42.031 --> 01:22:43.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1802
01:22:43.251 --> 01:22:45.150
<v Speaker 2>it's your body knows it's not the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1803
01:22:45.151 --> 01:22:48.420
<v Speaker 2>but you could be alienated out there too</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that which alienates you there could</v>

1804
01:22:48.421 --> 01:22:52.060
<v Speaker 2>still penetrate and get to you while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're out,</v>

1805
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:54.870
<v Speaker 2>what you're away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people are fucking with you at school</v>

1806
01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:56.430
<v Speaker 2>or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're at home,</v>

1807
01:22:56.431 --> 01:22:57.264
<v Speaker 2>you're feeling alienated there and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is continuing to fuck with you </v>

1808
01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:04.170
<v Speaker 2>through social media or other people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking with you on social media.</v>

1809
01:23:04.171 --> 01:23:05.004
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're playing your video games and </v>

1810
01:23:06.131 --> 01:23:08.560
<v Speaker 2>people are talking shit because you keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting shot and you know,</v>

1811
01:23:08.561 --> 01:23:09.394
<v Speaker 2>a battlefield five or whatever and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things are just compounded </v>

1812
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:16.160
<v Speaker 2>compounder and while no one knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

1813
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you wouldn't necessarily know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if I say,</v>

1814
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:19.541
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1815
01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:20.374
<v Speaker 2>fuck you knew or something on some video</v>
<v Speaker 2>game that this person is essentially in </v>

1816
01:23:23.981 --> 01:23:26.830
<v Speaker 2>real life being told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you everyday all day,</v>

1817
01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:29.530
<v Speaker 2>feeling like the whole world thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

1818
01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.310
<v Speaker 2>How would you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it could be.</v>

1819
01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Then that person snaps or that person </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a,</v>

1820
01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.373
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a psychological issue that </v>

1821
01:23:39.611 --> 01:23:40.320
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

1822
01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's a bunch of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of facts.</v>

1823
01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.030
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does the ability to kill large groups of</v>

1824
01:23:45.031 --> 01:23:45.690
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1825
01:23:45.690 --> 01:23:46.890
<v Speaker 5>Which is unprecedented,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1826
01:23:46.891 --> 01:23:47.724
<v Speaker 5>The ability to use assault rifles and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just fucking semiautomatic guns and go </v>

1827
01:23:51.081 --> 01:23:55.110
<v Speaker 5>in and kill large groups of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The knowledge that if you do do that,</v>

1828
01:23:55.111 --> 01:23:58.080
<v Speaker 5>it'll make a huge splash and giant </v>
<v Speaker 5>headlines and you'll be.</v>

1829
01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.753
<v Speaker 5>You'll be infamous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that a lot of these people are </v>

1830
01:24:01.941 --> 01:24:02.774
<v Speaker 5>on disassociative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so a lot of these people are on like </v>

1831
01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.213
<v Speaker 5>serious psych medications that we really</v>
<v Speaker 5>have only been studying the effects on </v>

1832
01:24:10.231 --> 01:24:12.000
<v Speaker 5>human beings for the past couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>decades.</v>

1833
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:17.030
<v Speaker 5>There's not a whole lot of data on long </v>
<v Speaker 5>term use of these Ssri for 20,</v>

1834
01:24:17.071 --> 01:24:18.000
<v Speaker 5>30,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40 years.</v>

1835
01:24:18.001 --> 01:24:18.834
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you've got varying people's varying </v>

1836
01:24:20.971 --> 01:24:21.804
<v Speaker 5>mental illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>varying psychological pressures and </v>

1837
01:24:24.631 --> 01:24:28.440
<v Speaker 5>stresses and lives that are just beyond </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked.</v>

1838
01:24:28.441 --> 01:24:32.210
<v Speaker 5>And then they have access to guns and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they want people to hurt the way they're</v>

1839
01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:33.600
<v Speaker 5>hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of them.</v>

1840
01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:34.860
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of factors going on.</v>

1841
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:35.391
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1842
01:24:35.391 --> 01:24:39.290
<v Speaker 2>even if they illegally require the guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they still have it.</v>

1843
01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:41.540
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this case,</v>

1844
01:24:41.541 --> 01:24:43.210
<v Speaker 2>what the tool is per se,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1845
01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:44.590
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1846
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:46.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we're meant to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to understand.</v>

1847
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:51.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we understand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nor are we meant to live in large groups</v>

1848
01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:53.860
<v Speaker 5>of people where we don't know the people</v>
<v Speaker 5>around us.</v>

1849
01:24:53.861 --> 01:24:54.694
<v Speaker 5>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that is a really new situation </v>

1850
01:24:57.911 --> 01:25:00.490
<v Speaker 5>for human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't they overlook</v>

1851
01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.560
<v Speaker 2>the historical significance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population growth,</v>

1852
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:08.590
<v Speaker 2>the population density that has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering as these we didn't,</v>

1853
01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.230
<v Speaker 2>we get into these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1854
01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:12.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high density,</v>

1855
01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.510
<v Speaker 2>civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilized areas like cities,</v>

1856
01:25:14.511 --> 01:25:17.810
<v Speaker 2>these big cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it changes everything.</v>

1857
01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:18.803
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people are less likely to know that </v>

1858
01:25:20.611 --> 01:25:21.444
<v Speaker 5>many.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you live in a town of 150 </v>

1859
01:25:23.041 --> 01:25:24.920
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you probably know 150 people.</v>

1860
01:25:25.290 --> 01:25:27.690
<v Speaker 5>If you live in a city of 5 million </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1861
01:25:27.691 --> 01:25:29.760
<v Speaker 5>you probably know 10 people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1862
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:32.280
<v Speaker 5>people you work with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might know a couple of friends,</v>

1863
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:33.223
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you're like a really social </v>

1864
01:25:34.441 --> 01:25:35.220
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

1865
01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:39.360
<v Speaker 5>You probably have a way more limited </v>
<v Speaker 5>number of people that you actually know.</v>

1866
01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:43.740
<v Speaker 5>Then people that have a tight knit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>small town and small community,</v>

1867
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:46.320
<v Speaker 5>but you know those people are obviously </v>
<v Speaker 5>in your business.</v>

1868
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.550
<v Speaker 5>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking what?</v>

1869
01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.490
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Friends that live in small towns.</v>

1870
01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:51.390
<v Speaker 5>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1871
01:25:51.391 --> 01:25:54.390
<v Speaker 5>there's things that come with that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of busy bodies.</v>

1872
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:55.243
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people looking over the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they had the anal sex last </v>

1873
01:25:57.930 --> 01:25:58.763
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus is going to punish them to that </v>

1874
01:26:02.010 --> 01:26:03.320
<v Speaker 5>next line and storing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come through.</v>

1875
01:26:03.321 --> 01:26:04.154
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck fucking speaking of blood fucking </v>

1876
01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.120
<v Speaker 5>let's talk about Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1877
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:12.860
<v Speaker 5>Without the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1878
01:26:12.861 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 5>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1879
01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:14.643
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we started this podcast talking about </v>

1880
01:26:16.551 --> 01:26:19.970
<v Speaker 5>what we had talked about your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your situation with Brendan Shop.</v>

1881
01:26:19.971 --> 01:26:22.910
<v Speaker 5>And I had talked about your situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were you,</v>

1882
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:23.833
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were you tested positive from a tainted </v>

1883
01:26:26.901 --> 01:26:30.230
<v Speaker 5>supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like legitimately tested positive from a</v>

1884
01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:32.180
<v Speaker 5>tainted supplement?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

1885
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.160
<v Speaker 5>you were cleared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1886
01:26:34.161 --> 01:26:36.920
<v Speaker 5>but this whole process was a goat rope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1887
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:37.783
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took a long time to work out and you </v>

1888
01:26:40.011 --> 01:26:41.960
<v Speaker 5>didn't feel fairly treated.</v>

1889
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Not In the least it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started one way.</v>

1890
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:47.490
<v Speaker 2>Then took a fucking curve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

1891
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so did you take a.</v>

1892
01:26:49.441 --> 01:26:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I took a supplement that had tribulus in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1893
01:26:52.771 --> 01:26:53.604
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

1894
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Just a Chinese herb.</v>

1895
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:57.740
<v Speaker 5>It's a Chinese herb that stimulates </v>
<v Speaker 5>testosterone.</v>

1896
01:26:57.741 --> 01:26:58.440
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

1897
01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.600
<v Speaker 2>barely works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1898
01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:00.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

1899
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:03.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not gonna turn you into superman or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1900
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.333
<v Speaker 2>If you get more sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better for your testosterone </v>

1901
01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:09.550
<v Speaker 2>production than Tribulus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just tribulus is all it was.</v>

1902
01:27:10.050 --> 01:27:14.970
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they in the supplement itself,</v>

1903
01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.033
<v Speaker 2>as it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was contaminated with a sore arm called </v>

1904
01:27:19.530 --> 01:27:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Asurion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I say contaminated,</v>

1905
01:27:22.261 --> 01:27:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean like it had such trace amounts </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the people that did the lab testing</v>

1906
01:27:26.881 --> 01:27:27.714
<v Speaker 2>on it said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1907
01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:30.330
<v Speaker 2>clearly just contamination because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't help you.</v>

1908
01:27:30.331 --> 01:27:31.980
<v Speaker 2>This wouldn't do anything for you</v>

1909
01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:33.920
<v Speaker 5>and those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's explain how that happens.</v>

1910
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:34.783
<v Speaker 5>A lot of these places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know this for a fact because I am one </v>

1911
01:27:37.431 --> 01:27:38.264
<v Speaker 5>of the owners of on it on it as a third </v>
<v Speaker 5>party tested company where we get our </v>

1912
01:27:42.351 --> 01:27:43.184
<v Speaker 5>stuff tested by an independent party to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make sure that there's nothing funky </v>

1913
01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:47.534
<v Speaker 5>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we've had some issues in the past </v>

1914
01:27:48.411 --> 01:27:51.830
<v Speaker 5>with stuff being in our.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our earliest formulations of Alpha brain</v>

1915
01:27:51.831 --> 01:27:52.664
<v Speaker 5>and weren't supposed to be in there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what it comes from is you buy your </v>

1916
01:27:55.131 --> 01:27:55.964
<v Speaker 5>ingredients from a company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That company has these vats that they </v>

1917
01:27:58.911 --> 01:27:59.744
<v Speaker 5>mix everything in and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>properly cleaned the vats and if they </v>

1918
01:28:02.601 --> 01:28:05.030
<v Speaker 5>don't properly clean the baths,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're buying some stuff from China.</v>

1919
01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.550
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what they're chucking in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1920
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:09.680
<v Speaker 5>They got steroids in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got this,</v>

1921
01:28:09.681 --> 01:28:10.514
<v Speaker 5>they got a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Creatine is tainted with all sorts of </v>

1922
01:28:12.831 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of different supplements or tank.</v>

1923
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:18.020
<v Speaker 5>And that's what you saw to thought it </v>
<v Speaker 5>could have been at first 10 means yes,</v>

1924
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:20.990
<v Speaker 5>it happened to a Yolo Ramiro.</v>

1925
01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this stuff is.</v>

1926
01:28:23.490 --> 01:28:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is contaminated.</v>

1927
01:28:25.771 --> 01:28:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you sorta was was testing me.</v>

1928
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:34.510
<v Speaker 2>I had had a fight in September of 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 2>against our Lawsky and then after that I</v>

1929
01:28:36.001 --> 01:28:36.811
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I get back know I don't </v>

1933
01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:44.993
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm going to get back </v>

1934
01:28:45.631 --> 01:28:48.810
<v Speaker 2>in the ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like all right,</v>

1935
01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.190
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1936
01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:52.030
<v Speaker 2>we told them and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you saw it,</v>

1937
01:28:52.090 --> 01:28:54.600
<v Speaker 2>it would still come around and test and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like okay fine,</v>

1938
01:28:54.601 --> 01:28:55.040
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1939
01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:57.680

<v Speaker 3>whereabouts to fill in because I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>be on a train moving here and moving </v>

1953
01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:31.530
<v Speaker 3>it as an APP?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I'm at work,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Every day.</v>

1965
01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm like,</v>

1966
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to be out here living,</v>

1967
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.440
<v Speaker 3>just doing whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fighting,</v>

1968
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:06.240
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I get home,</v>

1969
01:30:06.241 --> 01:30:10.080
<v Speaker 3>you test me wherever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just want to enjoy a vacation,</v>

1970
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 3>just travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

1971
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:13.080
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

1972
01:30:13.081 --> 01:30:14.610
<v Speaker 3>they send someone to my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1973
01:30:14.611 --> 01:30:15.444
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1974
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:16.343
<v Speaker 3>And then there are times where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what happens when they send someone </v>

1975
01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:20.370
<v Speaker 3>to your house but you told them you </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't there?</v>

1976
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well for one,</v>

1977
01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:23.820
<v Speaker 3>no one told the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how,</v>

1978
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Speaker 3>what mechanical elements within their </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>

1979
01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:30.450
<v Speaker 3>how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they sent someone there anyways.</v>

1980
01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:33.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That a head count.</v>

1981
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:34.343
<v Speaker 3>Does it count?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because.</v>

1982
01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Did you tell them that you were going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be on the road?</v>

1983
01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.590
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did.</v>

1984
01:30:38.610 --> 01:30:41.640
<v Speaker 3>So they still counted that as you not </v>
<v Speaker 3>being there for a test?</v>

1985
01:30:41.641 --> 01:30:42.474
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that doesn't make any fucking </v>

1986
01:30:43.831 --> 01:30:45.060
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1987
01:30:45.061 --> 01:30:47.040
<v Speaker 3>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>

1988
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.980
<v Speaker 3>but wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're going to give you a strike,</v>

1989
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:52.020
<v Speaker 3>like don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

1990
01:30:52.021 --> 01:30:54.750
<v Speaker 3>They have to follow their protocol and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their protocols.</v>

1991
01:30:54.751 --> 01:30:56.490
<v Speaker 3>You have to inform them of where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be.</v>

1992
01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you did that,</v>

1993
01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.300
<v Speaker 3>you informed them or you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1994
01:31:01.330 --> 01:31:02.163
<v Speaker 3>They literally told Lewicki and the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to be home for almost a </v>

1995
01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:12.930
<v Speaker 3>month and he's fucking practically </v>
<v Speaker 3>backpacking all through Europe,</v>

1996
01:31:13.230 --> 01:31:14.063
<v Speaker 3>going from place to place to place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's going to be real hard to get </v>

1997
01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:19.350
<v Speaker 3>ahold of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good time to take steroids.</v>

1998
01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:24.640
<v Speaker 3>You get just fucking get back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gills.</v>

1999
01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:29.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll pass if they showed up in Europe,</v>

2000
01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.970
<v Speaker 3>you did give them your location and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>told them where you are if they would.</v>

2001
01:31:32.971 --> 01:31:35.370
<v Speaker 3>But I was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel in any locations.</v>

2002
01:31:35.371 --> 01:31:38.040
<v Speaker 3>I just went wherever I went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you went,</v>

2003
01:31:38.041 --> 01:31:40.620
<v Speaker 3>wherever you went and your manager told </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2004
01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:41.454
<v Speaker 3>saw that you were in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still showed up at your house in </v>

2005
01:31:43.501 --> 01:31:44.880
<v Speaker 3>La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2006
01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Well that doesn't seem to make any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2007
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:48.510
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they give you a strike?</v>

2008
01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.190
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm like,</v>

2009
01:31:50.191 --> 01:31:53.100
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's aggravating cowboy strike when he</v>

2010
01:31:53.101 --> 01:31:55.800
<v Speaker 3>was at UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's stuff like that,</v>

2011
01:31:55.801 --> 01:31:59.190
<v Speaker 3>that map and I saw that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know what I just did.</v>

2012
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:01.540
<v Speaker 3>I can't fuck around with any of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2013
01:32:01.541 --> 01:32:02.374
<v Speaker 3>I don't want people to use this as some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a kindling to try and start a </v>

2014
01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:10.490
<v Speaker 3>fire about me and so then I get back </v>
<v Speaker 3>home and they're,</v>

2015
01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:11.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>test me again,</v>

2016
01:32:11.711 --> 01:32:12.191
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2017
01:32:12.191 --> 01:32:12.760
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2018
01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 3>And then they test me again and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2019
01:32:14.981 --> 01:32:16.620
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're,</v>

2020
01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:20.050

<v Speaker 3>as you just showed up out of nowhere.</v>

2021

<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do that.</v>

2022
01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Like they can just show up and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't say,</v>

2023
01:32:24.851 --> 01:32:25.684
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an appointment to keep their </v>

2024
01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.290
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We even,</v>

2025
01:32:29.291 --> 01:32:30.124
<v Speaker 3>if you're not fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you're running out the door </v>

2026
01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:33.964
<v Speaker 3>and you have a business appointment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long does it take for them to test </v>

2027
01:32:35.501 --> 01:32:36.850
<v Speaker 3>you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>

2028
01:32:36.850 --> 01:32:37.683
<v Speaker 3>Depends on what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's blood and urine or just </v>

2029
01:32:39.731 --> 01:32:40.564
<v Speaker 3>urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with me it's always been blood in </v>

2030
01:32:41.651 --> 01:32:43.600
<v Speaker 3>urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can't say,</v>

2031
01:32:43.601 --> 01:32:44.434
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are going to have to come with </v>

2032
01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:46.050
<v Speaker 3>me because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2033
01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.940
<v Speaker 3>I got to go to this fucking audition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2034
01:32:47.941 --> 01:32:49.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't try that.</v>

2035
01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:50.950
<v Speaker 3>I would say that get in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>

2036
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.940
<v Speaker 3>blah blah blah.</v>

2037
01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you gonna sit there and have someone</v>

2038
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:55.530
<v Speaker 3>draw blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to you.</v>

2039
01:32:55.531 --> 01:32:57.070
<v Speaker 3>You guys are gonna have to do it when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done,</v>

2040
01:32:57.810 --> 01:33:00.340
<v Speaker 3>like if you want to keep an eye on me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come with me the whole way.</v>

2041
01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.050
<v Speaker 3>I always took it as they showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2042
01:33:02.051 --> 01:33:04.300
<v Speaker 3>well here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't seem to make any sense.</v>

2043
01:33:04.301 --> 01:33:09.301
<v Speaker 3>If you have previous commitments and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to do something they shouldn't have</v>

2044
01:33:09.491 --> 01:33:10.324
<v Speaker 3>like ultimate precedent over your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they shouldn't be able to just </v>

2045
01:33:12.911 --> 01:33:16.740
<v Speaker 3>decide like showing up randomly as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>could.</v>

2046
01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:18.790
<v Speaker 3>They could make an argument in some way </v>
<v Speaker 3>on that.</v>

2047
01:33:18.791 --> 01:33:20.950
<v Speaker 3>But if you have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well in any case.</v>

2048
01:33:20.951 --> 01:33:23.140
<v Speaker 3>So I take this test and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

2049
01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:27.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to retire for now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got too much shit.</v>

2050
01:33:27.551 --> 01:33:30.220
<v Speaker 3>I gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fighting anytime soon.</v>

2051
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:33.520
<v Speaker 3>I've got my new Japan stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got auditions,</v>

2052
01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:34.870
<v Speaker 3>I've got all these things.</v>

2053
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm traveling and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to fight.</v>

2054
01:33:37.630 --> 01:33:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just leave me be.</v>

2055
01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.073
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm in Japan and the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very last test I took right before </v>

2056
01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:50.050
<v Speaker 3>retiring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you're flagged.</v>

2057
01:33:50.051 --> 01:33:52.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be fucking kidding me.</v>

2058
01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:53.913
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really all these tests over all these </v>

2059
01:33:57.251 --> 01:34:00.160
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me being the first person to do complete</v>

2060
01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.053
<v Speaker 3>out of competition or any competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>random urine and blood testing when I </v>

2061
01:34:05.741 --> 01:34:09.700
<v Speaker 3>worked with water and the Nevada state </v>
<v Speaker 3>athletic commission when I fought Travis</v>

2062
01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:10.533
<v Speaker 3>Browne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so no one had ever done actual random </v>

2063
01:34:12.101 --> 01:34:12.934
<v Speaker 3>testing before and there was no usada </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in the UFC yet going through </v>

2064
01:34:16.181 --> 01:34:20.530
<v Speaker 3>why did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was something that the NSAC wanted to</v>

2065
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:22.750
<v Speaker 3>see done and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

2066
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:23.783
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to see that done because you </v>

2067
01:34:24.371 --> 01:34:27.730
<v Speaker 3>had tested positive in the past and so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>tested positive before.</v>

2068
01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:29.580
<v Speaker 3>In the past you've taken some stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2069
01:34:29.650 --> 01:34:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I tested positive for anabolics in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

2070
01:34:32.190 --> 01:34:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean the supplement market used to</v>

2071
01:34:33.911 --> 01:34:35.730
<v Speaker 3>be way wilder than it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2072
01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:40.690
<v Speaker 3>and also we'll end the just fighting was</v>
<v Speaker 3>way wild lighting was way while they're.</v>

2073
01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:43.770
<v Speaker 3>The supplement industry was way wilder </v>
<v Speaker 3>back in o two.</v>

2074
01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:45.790
<v Speaker 3>You could still buy all this shit over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the counter.</v>

2075
01:34:45.791 --> 01:34:48.430
<v Speaker 3>That bio for got reclassified the </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids.</v>

2076
01:34:48.431 --> 01:34:52.250
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was taking this shit called</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mag tent number 10.</v>

2077
01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:57.210
<v Speaker 3>What was the name of the company that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes that incorporated incorporated?</v>

2078
01:34:57.260 --> 01:34:59.240
<v Speaker 3>That shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit is all steroids.</v>

2079
01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was steroids.</v>

2080
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:03.150
<v Speaker 3>I 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember meg 10.</v>

2081
01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:05.430
<v Speaker 3>He came like 10 pounds in six weeks on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit.</v>

2082
01:35:05.431 --> 01:35:07.790
<v Speaker 3>You just get Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was all over the counter.</v>

2083
01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:08.653
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it used to be able to buy a lot of </v>

2084
01:35:09.471 --> 01:35:10.251
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

2085
01:35:10.251 --> 01:35:12.840
<v Speaker 3>liver toxicity is probably off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>charts problems.</v>

2086
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:16.790
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those things that are like </v>
<v Speaker 3>super bad for her but so real effective.</v>

2087
01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:18.610
<v Speaker 3>They fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This stuff worked.</v>

2088
01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2089
01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:21.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a whole different era.</v>

2090
01:35:21.621 --> 01:35:24.980
<v Speaker 3>And then with California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2091
01:35:24.981 --> 01:35:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an issue with,</v>

2092
01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:27.793
<v Speaker 3>with a contaminant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I believe ultimately to be a </v>

2093
01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:30.674
<v Speaker 3>contamination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't take all the steps that I </v>

2094
01:35:32.451 --> 01:35:33.284
<v Speaker 3>had this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once that whole process was such a </v>

2095
01:35:36.171 --> 01:35:38.930
<v Speaker 3>motherfuck like this is never gonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen again.</v>

2096
01:35:38.931 --> 01:35:39.764
<v Speaker 3>So every supplement lot that I took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would always keep bits of it behind </v>

2097
01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.280
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until I knew I could get.</v>

2098
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:48.330
<v Speaker 3>I felt there was enough time it expired </v>
<v Speaker 3>and get rid of it because no one's going</v>

2099
01:35:48.331 --> 01:35:50.450
<v Speaker 3>to come back and test me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I passed all my tests.</v>

2100
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.970
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once you pass your test,</v>

2101
01:35:52.971 --> 01:35:55.490
<v Speaker 3>you would get rid of the old state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to keep those lots that are</v>

2102
01:35:55.491 --> 01:35:58.150
<v Speaker 3>supposed to take only third party </v>
<v Speaker 3>verified.</v>

2103
01:35:58.250 --> 01:36:01.100
<v Speaker 3>That's not what they say necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They suggested,</v>

2104
01:36:01.101 --> 01:36:03.770
<v Speaker 3>I guess a now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know that,</v>

2105
01:36:03.771 --> 01:36:06.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this brand of Tribulus I had taken,</v>

2106
01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:07.793
<v Speaker 3>I had taken three or four different </v>
<v Speaker 3>other supplements from the same company </v>

2107
01:36:11.301 --> 01:36:13.170
<v Speaker 3>and all passed no problem on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>tests.</v>

2108
01:36:13.171 --> 01:36:14.004
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was just some weird contamination </v>

2109
01:36:15.651 --> 01:36:18.310
<v Speaker 3>which does happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Happened at 10 means yes,</v>

2110
01:36:18.311 --> 01:36:20.870
<v Speaker 3>it's happened to several folks as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell.</v>

2111
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:22.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not testing their whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>product line,</v>

2112
01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:23.803
<v Speaker 3>but it just seemed like a fluke and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>such a simple supplement in any case </v>

2113
01:36:27.201 --> 01:36:30.590
<v Speaker 3>over one ingredient deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then they come back and they're like,</v>

2114
01:36:30.591 --> 01:36:32.030
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tested positive for this.</v>

2115
01:36:32.031 --> 01:36:34.400
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that ain't fucking possible.</v>

2116
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:37.820
<v Speaker 3>So then I send in some supplements which</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to pay for,</v>

2117
01:36:37.821 --> 01:36:38.654
<v Speaker 3>to have them tested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run them through the testing and </v>

2118
01:36:40.371 --> 01:36:42.290
<v Speaker 3>then bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find it all right.</v>

2119
01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:44.600
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's your deal.</v>

2120
01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Then they went out and bought a brand </v>
<v Speaker 3>new bottle.</v>

2121
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Unopened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same Lot.</v>

2122
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Tested that one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>verify the results.</v>

2123
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Test saying it doesn't happen.</v>

2124
01:36:54.321 --> 01:36:55.154
<v Speaker 3>Then Tim means as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then we're in contact with Usada </v>

2125
01:36:57.920 --> 01:36:58.753
<v Speaker 3>throughout the entirety of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't ever break contact with </v>

2126
01:37:01.761 --> 01:37:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a specific guy and I'm not going</v>

2127
01:37:04.821 --> 01:37:05.654
<v Speaker 3>to throw his name out there or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have a guy that we spoke to </v>

2128
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:10.880
<v Speaker 3>directly the whole time through my </v>
<v Speaker 3>manager,</v>

2129
01:37:11.110 --> 01:37:11.943
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking with him and I've seen the </v>

2130
01:37:12.921 --> 01:37:13.754
<v Speaker 3>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're talking about how we know </v>

2131
01:37:17.001 --> 01:37:19.100
<v Speaker 3>this is a contamination and when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2132
01:37:19.490 --> 01:37:20.323
<v Speaker 3>when we get done with all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't we even try to put together </v>

2133
01:37:24.081 --> 01:37:26.300
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some promotional stuff,</v>

2134
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:27.163
<v Speaker 3>anything that we can do to try and keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes from ending up in the same </v>

2135
01:37:29.151 --> 01:37:29.580
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

2136
01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:32.390
<v Speaker 3>And we'd like to do whatever we could to</v>
<v Speaker 3>help you guys out with this.</v>

2137
01:37:32.530 --> 01:37:33.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not against you,</v>

2138
01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:36.500
<v Speaker 3>we're a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't mind being a part of the system</v>

2139
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.843
<v Speaker 3>and we understand why you're here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not against them wanting to do drug </v>

2140
01:37:41.631 --> 01:37:46.400
<v Speaker 3>testing or whatever and try to keep a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a clean and fair playing field.</v>

2141
01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:48.720
<v Speaker 3>I get the point of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2142
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:51.530
<v Speaker 3>so we get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the supplements tested,</v>

2143
01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.850
<v Speaker 3>they test the secondary batch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have all their information.</v>

2144
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:55.560
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2145
01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:59.490
<v Speaker 3>this should be a fucking rock and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they got real quiet.</v>

2146
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:01.493
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2147
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Now you're not talking to us anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

2148
01:38:05.851 --> 01:38:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Like you would contact him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't respond.</v>

2149
01:38:07.770 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 3>They would take him a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two weeks.</v>

2150
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:11.940
<v Speaker 3>And what were they saying when they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>respond?</v>

2151
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:12.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2152
01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:13.733
<v Speaker 3>I can't entirely remember myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with my manager was in touch with </v>

2153
01:38:16.621 --> 01:38:16.770
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2154
01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:17.603
<v Speaker 3>And what is the protocol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone tests positive for something </v>

2155
01:38:19.201 --> 01:38:20.034
<v Speaker 3>that's a tainted Solomon and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>third party supplement and where it's </v>

2156
01:38:23.671 --> 01:38:25.740
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not third party verified rather.</v>

2157
01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:26.663
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if it was third party </v>

2158
01:38:27.661 --> 01:38:29.310
<v Speaker 3>verified that anything would be any </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

2159
01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:31.530
<v Speaker 3>Hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2160
01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:32.364
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it is third party verified and still </v>

2161
01:38:34.711 --> 01:38:35.640
<v Speaker 3>is tainted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2162
01:38:35.641 --> 01:38:36.660
<v Speaker 3>that would be an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2163
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you tested positive,</v>

2164
01:38:38.271 --> 01:38:39.990
<v Speaker 3>he tested positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they found the supplement,</v>

2165
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:41.093
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea about third party </v>
<v Speaker 3>verified is it's much less likely to be </v>

2166
01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.453
<v Speaker 3>addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't resolve anything and this is </v>

2167
01:38:48.481 --> 01:38:50.430
<v Speaker 3>coming from someone who's in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplement business.</v>

2168
01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:53.160
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain amount of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You farm it out.</v>

2169
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:54.383
<v Speaker 3>So far as I know what the deal is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a period of ineligibility sort </v>

2170
01:38:59.881 --> 01:39:00.714
<v Speaker 3>of or basically what happens is you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>effectively suspended until this thing </v>

2171
01:39:03.751 --> 01:39:07.430
<v Speaker 3>is all finished out and they tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say that you're not suspended.</v>

2172
01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:10.170
<v Speaker 3>There's no suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not true.</v>

2173
01:39:10.530 --> 01:39:11.363
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's going to book your favorite </v>

2174
01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.880
<v Speaker 3>treats you as you're suspended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to corner Travis Brown because I</v>

2175
01:39:14.881 --> 01:39:17.370
<v Speaker 3>was training him and they wouldn't let </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2176
01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:19.050
<v Speaker 3>It won't let you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The corner mission with.</v>

2177
01:39:19.051 --> 01:39:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Let me try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2178
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they're like,</v>

2179
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:25.200
<v Speaker 3>you're suspended so you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't corner,</v>

2180
01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 3>but you said you're not suspended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2181
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.540
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're effectively suspended.</v>

2182
01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.553
<v Speaker 3>You can't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even work as a tertiary </v>

2183
01:39:34.891 --> 01:39:37.310
<v Speaker 3>individually as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a corner man or anything like that.</v>

2184
01:39:37.311 --> 01:39:38.144
<v Speaker 3>He can't be at the event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is after the fact where you </v>

2185
01:39:41.971 --> 01:39:42.804
<v Speaker 3>brought them the supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They independently verified that it was </v>

2186
01:39:45.661 --> 01:39:46.494
<v Speaker 3>tainted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2187
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:47.603
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then we start talking and throughout </v>

2188
01:39:50.941 --> 01:39:52.020
<v Speaker 3>the process I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2189
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking a punishment for </v>
<v Speaker 3>contamination and I'm not even fighting.</v>

2190
01:39:57.391 --> 01:39:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm not fighting anytime soon.</v>

2191
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

2192
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.270
<v Speaker 3>like what you did with means and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people,</v>

2193
01:40:03.271 --> 01:40:06.360
<v Speaker 3>you punish them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that there was contamination,</v>

2194
01:40:06.361 --> 01:40:08.070
<v Speaker 3>but you punish them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2195
01:40:08.071 --> 01:40:10.080
<v Speaker 3>they gave them many months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2196
01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Have a suspension so that they're able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to compete or make a living during those</v>

2197
01:40:14.630 --> 01:40:15.031
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2198
01:40:15.031 --> 01:40:15.870
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not dealing.</v>

2199
01:40:15.871 --> 01:40:19.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not acceptable because I'm not,</v>

2200
01:40:19.290 --> 01:40:22.230
<v Speaker 3>that's not what's going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is doping.</v>

2201
01:40:22.231 --> 01:40:25.260
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's trying to cheat the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no,</v>

2202
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get by punishing me.</v>

2203
01:40:28.771 --> 01:40:29.604
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to let guilt on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to make me out to be some </v>

2204
01:40:32.971 --> 01:40:35.640
<v Speaker 3>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2205
01:40:35.670 --> 01:40:36.503
<v Speaker 3>a guilty party as if I'm trying to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some soreness like I'm not dealing </v>

2206
01:40:41.611 --> 01:40:42.331
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking.</v>

2207
01:40:42.331 --> 01:40:44.340
<v Speaker 3>So how did it ultimately get resolved?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2208
01:40:44.341 --> 01:40:48.060
<v Speaker 3>ultimately what ended up happening is we</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to go to arbitration.</v>

2209
01:40:48.450 --> 01:40:49.283
<v Speaker 3>That was all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really left to us because then </v>

2210
01:40:50.641 --> 01:40:53.270
<v Speaker 3>they started trying to bring up a</v>

2211
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.860
<v Speaker 2>stuff from my past and then weigh that </v>
<v Speaker 2>against me as well.</v>

2212
01:40:56.861 --> 01:40:57.431
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2213
01:40:57.431 --> 01:40:59.410
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys weren't even around and now you</v>

2214
01:40:59.411 --> 01:41:00.244
<v Speaker 2>get to decide to add to the weight of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever punishment you want to levy </v>

2215
01:41:04.661 --> 01:41:06.520
<v Speaker 2>against me based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2216
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:09.730
<v Speaker 2>things that didn't involve you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

2217
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:12.760
<v Speaker 2>What were they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about 2011.</v>

2218
01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:14.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2008 they went to.</v>

2219
01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried and they tried to say,</v>

2220
01:41:17.891 --> 01:41:18.551
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2221
01:41:18.551 --> 01:41:20.440
<v Speaker 2>well this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then therefore,</v>

2222
01:41:20.710 --> 01:41:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they start talking about two years.</v>

2223
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:25.480
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta be fucking kidding me.</v>

2224
01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:26.373
<v Speaker 2>They started talking about suspending </v>
<v Speaker 2>you for two years for a tainted </v>

2225
01:41:27.911 --> 01:41:28.780
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2226
01:41:29.110 --> 01:41:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just going.</v>

2227
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:32.590
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even expect six months.</v>

2228
01:41:32.591 --> 01:41:36.760
<v Speaker 2>You think I'm going to take two years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we go and we inquire on the Arbor</v>

2229
01:41:36.761 --> 01:41:37.594
<v Speaker 2>and I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did an interview with the guy that we </v>

2230
01:41:39.221 --> 01:41:40.420
<v Speaker 2>were dealing with through skype.</v>

2231
01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:41.260
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

2232
01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:42.093
<v Speaker 2>we've been in touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like at some point everything </v>

2233
01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:47.620
<v Speaker 2>turned and changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their tone changed there.</v>

2234
01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:51.280
<v Speaker 2>Even the original penalties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were looking to levy increased.</v>

2235
01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:52.413
<v Speaker 2>New Shit gets brought in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they became a completely </v>

2236
01:41:54.671 --> 01:41:59.671
<v Speaker 2>different animal as soon as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the evidence of,</v>

2237
01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:00.693
<v Speaker 2>of contamination and that I wasn't gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't willing to take punishment for </v>

2238
01:42:06.491 --> 01:42:07.324
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't.</v>

2239
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:08.950
<v Speaker 2>What do you think their motivation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

2240
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I think that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is just my opinion,</v>

2241
01:42:11.681 --> 01:42:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I think the way you saw to looks at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an easy way to go about it,</v>

2242
01:42:15.221 --> 01:42:18.490
<v Speaker 2>is that the more people they deem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more effective they appear.</v>

2243
01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:21.500
<v Speaker 2>It's their effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their efficacy is based on punishment,</v>

2244
01:42:21.610 --> 01:42:22.443
<v Speaker 2>punishments doled out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily not on lack of </v>

2245
01:42:24.581 --> 01:42:27.370
<v Speaker 2>punishments at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think this is,</v>

2246
01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also remembered by the people that are </v>

2247
01:42:30.641 --> 01:42:31.474
<v Speaker 2>working there.</v>

2248
01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.420
<v Speaker 2>So they arbitrarily get to decide how </v>
<v Speaker 2>things go about right.</v>

2249
01:42:34.421 --> 01:42:38.080
<v Speaker 2>There's not like a very strict protocol </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they must follow.</v>

2250
01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:40.340
<v Speaker 2>They're tainted supplements and for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2251
01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:43.560
<v Speaker 2>there is actually quite a bit of a lever</v>
<v Speaker 2>or there,</v>

2252
01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:47.260
<v Speaker 2>there is leeway in terms of how they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforce and what they can enforce.</v>

2253
01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.640
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's subjective,</v>

2254
01:42:48.641 --> 01:42:50.770
<v Speaker 2>it's up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is subjectivity that um,</v>

2255
01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:51.910
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2256
01:42:51.970 --> 01:42:52.803
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of discretion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is some outlined elements of </v>

2257
01:42:56.231 --> 01:42:57.700
<v Speaker 2>protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is no,</v>

2258
01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:01.690
<v Speaker 2>it is always this or it is always that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2259
01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:02.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't begrudge them for a period of </v>

2260
01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.553
<v Speaker 2>ineligibility while you're going through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the process of finding out whether this </v>

2261
01:43:07.931 --> 01:43:10.850
<v Speaker 2>is contamination or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing any testing.</v>

2262
01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:12.880
<v Speaker 2>And that makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

2263
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:17.020
<v Speaker 2>I understand that if this guy supposedly</v>
<v Speaker 2>has something in the system,</v>

2264
01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:18.460
<v Speaker 2>well let's figure out what it is.</v>

2265
01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:22.240
<v Speaker 2>And once we have a better idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can decide about whether you can</v>

2266
01:43:22.241 --> 01:43:23.074
<v Speaker 2>go back into the pool or do this or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that or if you're going to leverage any </v>

2267
01:43:25.031 --> 01:43:29.560
<v Speaker 2>punishments makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in addition to that,</v>

2268
01:43:29.561 --> 01:43:32.020
<v Speaker 2>then tacking on more shit in terms of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>case and I was like,</v>

2269
01:43:32.050 --> 01:43:34.690
<v Speaker 2>that's not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

2270
01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:35.831
<v Speaker 2>we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2271
01:43:35.831 --> 01:43:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I guess the only thing left to us as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to arbitration.</v>

2272
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:41.840
<v Speaker 2>And so my manager spoke with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2273
01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:45.790
<v Speaker 2>when I was working through them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitration and we said,</v>

2274
01:43:45.791 --> 01:43:46.690
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we'll,</v>

2275
01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.100
<v Speaker 2>what is that going to take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2276
01:43:48.101 --> 01:43:49.900
<v Speaker 2>that's going to cost more money out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my pocket.</v>

2277
01:43:50.170 --> 01:43:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2278
01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:52.153
<v Speaker 2>the arbitration process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are guys that they're paid by </v>

2279
01:43:55.341 --> 01:43:56.174
<v Speaker 2>Usada to do their arbitration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they work for them in a way or </v>

2280
01:43:59.061 --> 01:44:00.980
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't work under them directly,</v>

2281
01:44:00.981 --> 01:44:01.814
<v Speaker 2>but they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do get paid to be a arbitrator </v>

2282
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.720
<v Speaker 2>somehow.</v>

2283
01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.930
<v Speaker 2>There's some something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they get contracted by Usada yes.</v>

2284
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:11.030
<v Speaker 2>And so that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2285
01:44:11.031 --> 01:44:13.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily feel the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable with that,</v>

2286
01:44:13.101 --> 01:44:17.210
<v Speaker 2>but I can also understand how it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably not an easier way to go</v>

2287
01:44:17.211 --> 01:44:18.320
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay,</v>

2288
01:44:18.321 --> 01:44:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when we,</v>

2289
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:22.263
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we get notice back from Usada that </v>

2290
01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:26.540
<v Speaker 2>we have to limit the scope of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

2291
01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:28.400
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2292
01:44:28.401 --> 01:44:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you,</v>

2293
01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:32.720
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna tell us what we can and </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't argue in arbitration.</v>

2294
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the definitions </v>
<v Speaker 2>were exactly,</v>

2295
01:44:37.131 --> 01:44:39.110
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

2296
01:44:39.370 --> 01:44:42.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to keep it within this boundary</v>

2297
01:44:42.051 --> 01:44:44.150
<v Speaker 2>and this realm and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2298
01:44:44.210 --> 01:44:45.043
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't fucking try to say the levy </v>

2299
01:44:47.721 --> 01:44:48.554
<v Speaker 2>this against me and then you stuff from </v>
<v Speaker 2>my past and then tell me I can't argue </v>

2300
01:44:50.751 --> 01:44:51.584
<v Speaker 2>my full case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're limiting the amount that you </v>

2301
01:44:52.941 --> 01:44:55.190
<v Speaker 2>could defend yourself as though you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying the,</v>

2302
01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:57.590
<v Speaker 2>they were limiting the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2303
01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:59.300
<v Speaker 2>the range of argument you could make.</v>

2304
01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:00.163
<v Speaker 2>What would the argument be that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would bring up that they would want to </v>

2305
01:45:01.851 --> 01:45:04.340
<v Speaker 2>limit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2306
01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.233
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly did they define </v>

2307
01:45:07.161 --> 01:45:07.994
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know they had definitions in the </v>

2308
01:45:09.321 --> 01:45:10.154
<v Speaker 2>emails with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with back and forth with my manager and </v>

2309
01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:12.914
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll fuck we because we could argue </v>

2310
01:45:15.561 --> 01:45:17.210
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2311
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:19.160
<v Speaker 2>this is contamination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2312
01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:20.600
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and go from there.</v>

2313
01:45:20.601 --> 01:45:23.720
<v Speaker 2>But it was something really potentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>limiting,</v>

2314
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:26.770
<v Speaker 2>which was weird about how they put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't remember what exactly.</v>

2315
01:45:26.771 --> 01:45:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember all the details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very detail oriented,</v>

2316
01:45:28.911 --> 01:45:33.170
<v Speaker 2>it's legal ease and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then so we get to the point,</v>

2317
01:45:33.171 --> 01:45:34.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well fuck,</v>

2318
01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:38.300
<v Speaker 2>well this doesn't even look like a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2319
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:39.283
<v Speaker 2>this might not even be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a useful way of trying to approach this </v>

2320
01:45:42.411 --> 01:45:46.060
<v Speaker 2>thing and it got down to the wire to </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

2321
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:50.120
<v Speaker 2>and we kept pushing it back and pushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it back and saying like,</v>

2322
01:45:50.121 --> 01:45:51.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can we get an extension and,</v>

2323
01:45:51.970 --> 01:45:54.560
<v Speaker 2>and to try and figure out how the hell </v>
<v Speaker 2>do we approach this?</v>

2324
01:45:54.990 --> 01:45:56.860
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also like how,</v>

2325
01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:57.733
<v Speaker 2>how could we approach without having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend money on having lawyers get </v>

2326
01:46:00.201 --> 01:46:02.030
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the last thing you want to</v>

2327
01:46:02.031 --> 01:46:04.610
<v Speaker 2>do is get to litigation or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even arbitration,</v>

2328
01:46:04.630 --> 01:46:07.170
<v Speaker 2>it's a legal process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's complex and it is,</v>

2329
01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:08.053
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of lawyers love billable </v>

2330
01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:11.593
<v Speaker 2>hours or they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it gets down to the wire </v>

2331
01:46:14.361 --> 01:46:18.980
<v Speaker 2>essentially and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just sit back and I go,</v>

2332
01:46:19.810 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I won't accept any ruling if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>punishment at all.</v>

2333
01:46:22.401 --> 01:46:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just be like,</v>

2334
01:46:23.961 --> 01:46:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not I,</v>

2335
01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:27.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to abide by it.</v>

2336
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:29.960
<v Speaker 2>You can't force me to do shit and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess we'll have to cross</v>

2337
01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:31.333
<v Speaker 5>position is that if you are accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking a tainted supplement and also </v>

2338
01:46:36.171 --> 01:46:40.070
<v Speaker 5>trace amounts that have absolutely zero </v>
<v Speaker 5>effect on performance,</v>

2339
01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:44.510
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing that you're doing by </v>
<v Speaker 5>accidentally taking that that in any way</v>

2340
01:46:44.511 --> 01:46:46.850
<v Speaker 5>would help you and that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a proven fact.</v>

2341
01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:47.713
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So your position is you shouldn't be </v>

2342
01:46:48.621 --> 01:46:49.770
<v Speaker 5>punished.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

2343
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Then you're out of the year when once </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2344
01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:56.040
<v Speaker 2>The time that you've been out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

2345
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:57.630
<v Speaker 2>That's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2346
01:46:57.631 --> 01:46:59.850
<v Speaker 2>It's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to say,</v>

2347
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you.</v>

2348
01:47:01.111 --> 01:47:04.880
<v Speaker 2>If it took six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it took seven months to get the.</v>

2349
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:05.743
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the information that you needed the </v>

2350
01:47:06.661 --> 01:47:07.261
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2351
01:47:07.261 --> 01:47:08.700
<v Speaker 2>To then clarify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2352
01:47:08.701 --> 01:47:11.070
<v Speaker 2>well you're not at fault to then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2353
01:47:11.071 --> 01:47:11.904
<v Speaker 2>well we'll suspend you for six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but since that six months is already </v>

2354
01:47:13.921 --> 01:47:15.480
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we didn't suspend you at all.</v>

2355
01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.830
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker.</v>

2356
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:20.370
<v Speaker 2>When you look into the haunt a at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>

2357
01:47:20.371 --> 01:47:22.680
<v Speaker 2>when you go and look at this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says suspended,</v>

2358
01:47:22.681 --> 01:47:26.430
<v Speaker 2>which means you punished me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means I was guilty in some way.</v>

2359
01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:30.030
<v Speaker 2>You said I'm guilty because that's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to punish me.</v>

2360
01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.193
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not under investigation or after </v>

2361
01:47:33.841 --> 01:47:36.800
<v Speaker 2>this litigation has exonerated after.</v>

2362
01:47:37.210 --> 01:47:38.480
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just no.</v>

2363
01:47:38.490 --> 01:47:40.390
<v Speaker 2>You still love to punishment in there to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2364
01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:42.630
<v Speaker 2>look how we caught this guy and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>punished them and I'm like,</v>

2365
01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

2366
01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm not down for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so Hudley enough.</v>

2367
01:47:47.970 --> 01:47:50.150
<v Speaker 2>So I was like on aerials or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2368
01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:50.730
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2369
01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I won't accept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what they say.</v>

2370
01:47:53.251 --> 01:47:55.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what punishment they try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>levy.</v>

2371
01:47:55.051 --> 01:47:55.884
<v Speaker 2>I don't abide by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't agree to it and I'm done with </v>

2372
01:47:58.051 --> 01:48:02.220
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then someone from the arbitrary,</v>

2373
01:48:02.260 --> 01:48:03.093
<v Speaker 2>the arbitrators office who we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with calls us out of the blue </v>

2374
01:48:05.671 --> 01:48:06.880
<v Speaker 2>and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2375
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:09.510
<v Speaker 2>so you still sure you don't want to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2376
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:10.403
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2377
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:14.070
<v Speaker 2>And my manager goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they said that we have to limit the</v>

2378
01:48:14.071 --> 01:48:16.590
<v Speaker 2>scope of argument to this and this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can talk.</v>

2379
01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:18.150
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2380
01:48:18.151 --> 01:48:19.320
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can talk about,</v>

2381
01:48:19.321 --> 01:48:20.970
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can bring any argument you want.</v>

2382
01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Who is saying this to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The arbitrators office.</v>

2383
01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.700
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2384
01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:28.350
<v Speaker 5>so who would initially come to you and </v>
<v Speaker 5>said the elite,</v>

2385
01:48:28.450 --> 01:48:30.940
<v Speaker 5>the scope of your argument Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2386
01:48:30.941 --> 01:48:31.774
<v Speaker 5>So you saw to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was attempting to establish some </v>

2387
01:48:33.851 --> 01:48:34.684
<v Speaker 5>boundaries for your arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the people who were the actual </v>

2388
01:48:38.471 --> 01:48:40.570
<v Speaker 5>arbitrators said that that's not true.</v>

2389
01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the case.</v>

2390
01:48:41.961 --> 01:48:42.794
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

2391
01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:45.150
<v Speaker 2>they can't force you to argue in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain.</v>

2392
01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:46.101
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2393
01:48:46.101 --> 01:48:49.040
<v Speaker 5>So is it possible that you sought as </v>
<v Speaker 5>lawyers?</v>

2394
01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:50.840
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing I've found about,</v>

2395
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:51.770
<v Speaker 5>about lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2396
01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:52.813
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for sure they're necessary and that's </v>

2397
01:48:54.561 --> 01:48:57.560
<v Speaker 5>all well and good and you need them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's a reality,</v>

2398
01:48:57.561 --> 01:48:58.394
<v Speaker 5>and this is something that I had to deal</v>
<v Speaker 5>with recently in doing something with a </v>

2399
01:49:00.321 --> 01:49:01.154
<v Speaker 5>friend through lawyers where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>attached a bunch of shit to this deal </v>

2400
01:49:05.481 --> 01:49:07.970
<v Speaker 5>that wasn't supposed to be in there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't even know it was in there.</v>

2401
01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.400
<v Speaker 5>And then my lawyer is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this?</v>

2402
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:12.650
<v Speaker 5>And so I contact him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this?</v>

2403
01:49:12.651 --> 01:49:14.090
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is that?</v>

2404
01:49:14.210 --> 01:49:16.280
<v Speaker 5>So he contacts his lawyer is what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck is this?</v>

2405
01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:21.290
<v Speaker 5>And it turns out this is a common thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>lawyers they want to do with each other.</v>

2406
01:49:21.291 --> 01:49:24.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We put this in to give you leverage.</v>

2407
01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:25.873
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you necessarily want that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're looking out for your best </v>

2408
01:49:28.701 --> 01:49:29.534
<v Speaker 5>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so now you have a good negotiation </v>

2409
01:49:31.971 --> 01:49:35.120
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you just go in with what you want,</v>

2410
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:37.430
<v Speaker 5>then they're going to ask for more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2411
01:49:37.431 --> 01:49:38.264
<v Speaker 5>And then you're not in a strong position</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you can't ask for more after </v>

2412
01:49:40.521 --> 01:49:42.070
<v Speaker 5>you've already established your initial </v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

2413
01:49:42.071 --> 01:49:42.170
<v Speaker 5>Makes</v>

2414
01:49:42.170 --> 01:49:43.930
<v Speaker 2>everything convoluted there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gross.</v>

2415
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear you.</v>

2416
01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:49.060
<v Speaker 2>But that's the world we live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grandfather was tejas world.</v>

2417
01:49:49.090 --> 01:49:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Pretty Pretty Fair lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was assistant attorney general,</v>

2418
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:54.820
<v Speaker 2>the state of Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually wanted me to get into law of</v>

2419
01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:55.840
<v Speaker 2>all things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

2420
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:56.703
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd rather beat out my brain's </v>

2421
01:49:58.710 --> 01:49:59.860
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like,</v>

2422
01:49:59.890 --> 01:50:00.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't beaten them out.</v>

2423
01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Very impressive with your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

2424
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:04.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get to.</v>

2425
01:50:05.490 --> 01:50:07.360
<v Speaker 2>My manager comes back and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2426
01:50:07.361 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 2>they just contacted me out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

2427
01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:11.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do this,</v>

2428
01:50:11.381 --> 01:50:12.250
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And No,</v>

2429
01:50:12.251 --> 01:50:12.860
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2430
01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:15.370
<v Speaker 2>you can make the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no limiting in the scope of your</v>

2431
01:50:15.371 --> 01:50:18.220
<v Speaker 2>argument or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then it's like,</v>

2432
01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:19.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2433
01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.400
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go for it.</v>

2434
01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Went to our least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2435
01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:23.803
<v Speaker 2>because at the very least I thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could have some sort of record </v>

2436
01:50:25.691 --> 01:50:28.420
<v Speaker 2>down of what we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was discussed,</v>

2437
01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:29.380
<v Speaker 2>the arguments made.</v>

2438
01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:31.000
<v Speaker 2>So in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2439
01:50:31.001 --> 01:50:32.110
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it came out,</v>

2440
01:50:32.111 --> 01:50:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I can go here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what's legit,</v>

2441
01:50:34.450 --> 01:50:35.283
<v Speaker 2>then you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make your own decision from </v>

2442
01:50:36.011 --> 01:50:37.960
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we go in,</v>

2443
01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:39.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought my legal team.</v>

2444
01:50:39.881 --> 01:50:40.540
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2445
01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:41.373
<v Speaker 2>they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lawyer come who was the same guy </v>

2446
01:50:43.421 --> 01:50:45.460
<v Speaker 2>we were dealing with throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire process and,</v>

2447
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:49.200
<v Speaker 2>and they made their argument and we made</v>
<v Speaker 2>ours and you know,</v>

2448
01:50:49.210 --> 01:50:50.043
<v Speaker 2>and there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are times where I'm sitting back </v>

2449
01:50:51.071 --> 01:50:52.610
<v Speaker 2>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2450
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:54.760
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're making closing arguments,</v>

2451
01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:59.560
<v Speaker 2>the lawyers and I'm just sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to the Usada Seigel man,</v>

2452
01:50:59.561 --> 01:51:02.140
<v Speaker 2>he's just pushing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just moving the goal post.</v>

2453
01:51:02.230 --> 01:51:04.660
<v Speaker 2>He's a how so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2454
01:51:04.661 --> 01:51:07.600
<v Speaker 2>it's just taking a certain element and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then trying to,</v>

2455
01:51:08.010 --> 01:51:08.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you slippery slope arguments and moving </v>

2456
01:51:09.821 --> 01:51:10.654
<v Speaker 2>the goal posts on things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's just doing anything he can to </v>

2457
01:51:12.551 --> 01:51:16.300
<v Speaker 2>use rhetoric instead of logos at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point because,</v>

2458
01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:17.153
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're lawyers and they're trying to </v>

2459
01:51:17.651 --> 01:51:21.490
<v Speaker 2>make their case and trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>impassioned responses when you're saying</v>

2460
01:51:21.491 --> 01:51:22.440
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2461
01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.100
<v Speaker 2>consider the people listening at home.</v>

2462
01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Don't really know your case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know the scope.</v>

2463
01:51:26.530 --> 01:51:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like trying to say that,</v>

2464
01:51:28.901 --> 01:51:29.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2465
01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:33.640
<v Speaker 2>find ways at which to move the goal </v>
<v Speaker 2>posts in terms of.</v>

2466
01:51:33.641 --> 01:51:36.130
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said to you earlier,</v>

2467
01:51:36.131 --> 01:51:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I keep batches of all the supplements </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I take,</v>

2468
01:51:39.590 --> 01:51:40.423
<v Speaker 2>especially when I'm in these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this program and especially after </v>

2469
01:51:42.731 --> 01:51:46.300
<v Speaker 2>dealing with the cluster fuck that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>California and it's like,</v>

2470
01:51:46.301 --> 01:51:49.780
<v Speaker 2>well I didn't have anything that I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring to you that I could fuck,</v>

2471
01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:51.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like,</v>

2472
01:51:51.281 --> 01:51:52.114
<v Speaker 2>this is never happening again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I keep everything they go and they </v>

2473
01:51:55.330 --> 01:51:58.750
<v Speaker 2>test stuff and they find it and I kept </v>
<v Speaker 2>notes.</v>

2474
01:51:58.751 --> 01:51:59.584
<v Speaker 2>I kept this and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what more could I have done for you </v>

2475
01:52:03.791 --> 01:52:05.910
<v Speaker 2>guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it doesn't matter if there's,</v>

2476
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:07.990
<v Speaker 2>let's say what they were all third party</v>
<v Speaker 2>tested as well.</v>

2477
01:52:07.991 --> 01:52:08.824
<v Speaker 2>I would still keep batches of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements and one of the stuff I take </v>

2478
01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:13.780
<v Speaker 2>third party was the issue then.</v>

2479
01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just they kept trying to say that I</v>

2480
01:52:17.141 --> 01:52:20.380
<v Speaker 2>didn't do a good enough job that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you use the,</v>

2481
01:52:20.381 --> 01:52:21.214
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you see this thing on supplement </v>

2482
01:52:24.121 --> 01:52:24.954
<v Speaker 2>form 11?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that came out after the fact </v>

2483
01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.870
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have seen that.</v>

2484
01:52:28.930 --> 01:52:29.763
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use all the resources that you </v>

2485
01:52:31.121 --> 01:52:31.954
<v Speaker 2>provided your global dro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your other supplement for 11 to check </v>

2486
01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:38.470
<v Speaker 2>against ingredient lists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement names,</v>

2487
01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:42.490
<v Speaker 2>company names to make sure none of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit is on the list so that I don't make</v>

2488
01:52:42.491 --> 01:52:45.010
<v Speaker 2>that mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I use the resources that you give me.</v>

2489
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I keep batches</v>

2490
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.920
<v Speaker 3>of my supplements so they can be tested </v>
<v Speaker 3>if need be.</v>

2491
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:52.250
<v Speaker 3>I do what's available to keep from any </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

2492
01:52:52.670 --> 01:52:56.580
<v Speaker 3>And yet they just kept moving the goal </v>
<v Speaker 3>post on that and trying to say,</v>

2493
01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:57.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't,</v>

2494
01:52:57.581 --> 01:52:59.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't hire a psychic,</v>

2495
01:52:59.450 --> 01:53:01.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just that kind of shit.</v>

2496
01:53:01.071 --> 01:53:01.551
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2497
01:53:01.551 --> 01:53:04.130
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can this have been any better?</v>

2498
01:53:04.131 --> 01:53:05.870
<v Speaker 3>And not to mention I'm not fighting.</v>

2499
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.750
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So at the end of the day,</v>

2500
01:53:08.751 --> 01:53:10.190
<v Speaker 5>what were they looking for?</v>

2501
01:53:10.530 --> 01:53:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Portration?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2502
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:16.910
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to levy a punishment against</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and suspend me for years.</v>

2503
01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:18.930
<v Speaker 5>And this is Usada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2504
01:53:18.931 --> 01:53:19.764
<v Speaker 5>So you saw to ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though they knew that you took a </v>

2505
01:53:22.021 --> 01:53:25.680
<v Speaker 5>tainted supplement that had no effect </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatsoever on your performance,</v>

2506
01:53:25.681 --> 01:53:26.514
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They still wanted to punish you for two </v>

2507
01:53:27.601 --> 01:53:29.640
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems stupid.</v>

2508
01:53:30.210 --> 01:53:32.280
<v Speaker 5>That just seemed stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now let me,</v>

2509
01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.233
<v Speaker 5>let me read Jeff Novitsky because </v>
<v Speaker 5>Novitsky texted me because I told him </v>

2510
01:53:35.781 --> 01:53:39.750
<v Speaker 5>this was going to go down and his take </v>
<v Speaker 5>is a little bit different than yours.</v>

2511
01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't imagine it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2512
01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:42.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not surprised that it is.</v>

2513
01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:44.240
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2514
01:53:44.241 --> 01:53:46.610
<v Speaker 5>I told you what it was the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is.</v>

2515
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.863
<v Speaker 5>I'll just read you what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said he'll complain about the amount </v>

2516
01:53:51.141 --> 01:53:53.450
<v Speaker 5>of time that went by with you saw the </v>
<v Speaker 5>process,</v>

2517
01:53:53.451 --> 01:53:54.284
<v Speaker 5>but he notified us of retirement right </v>
<v Speaker 5>after the positive sample was collected </v>

2518
01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:58.753
<v Speaker 5>before a positive was announced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he was off in the wind for many </v>

2519
01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:03.433
<v Speaker 5>months and not communicating with Usada </v>
<v Speaker 5>a big reason the case took so long to </v>

2520
01:54:07.761 --> 01:54:10.880
<v Speaker 5>resolve to his positive was from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tainted supplement,</v>

2521
01:54:10.881 --> 01:54:11.714
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't do the number one thing we</v>
<v Speaker 5>advise to use athletes on UFC athletes </v>

2522
01:54:15.981 --> 01:54:16.814
<v Speaker 5>on supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't choose a supplement that was </v>

2523
01:54:18.501 --> 01:54:22.740
<v Speaker 5>third party certified as a banned </v>
<v Speaker 5>substance free.</v>

2524
01:54:22.741 --> 01:54:24.530
<v Speaker 5>Like on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>supplements are,</v>

2525
01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:25.873
<v Speaker 5>there are literally hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>certified supplements out there in </v>

2526
01:54:27.711 --> 01:54:28.544
<v Speaker 5>virtually and virtually ensures no </v>
<v Speaker 5>issues to a foreign athlete if they </v>

2527
01:54:33.591 --> 01:54:35.250
<v Speaker 5>stick with those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2528
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:36.343
<v Speaker 5>one other point for Barnett when he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>unresponsive to case he missed all of </v>

2529
01:54:40.341 --> 01:54:43.100
<v Speaker 5>his deadlines to file for arbitration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2530
01:54:43.190 --> 01:54:46.580
<v Speaker 5>he came to the table later and said he </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to go to arbitration.</v>

2531
01:54:46.581 --> 01:54:47.414
<v Speaker 5>You saw to maiden exclusion and let him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which ultimately led to his favorable </v>

2532
01:54:51.021 --> 01:54:51.854
<v Speaker 5>ruling by arbitrator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their reasoning was that they wanted to </v>

2533
01:54:55.101 --> 01:54:58.210
<v Speaker 5>rule in favor of fairness to athlete </v>
<v Speaker 5>rules.</v>

2534
01:54:58.211 --> 01:55:01.880
<v Speaker 5>Say they didn't have to after time to </v>
<v Speaker 5>file expired.</v>

2535
01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:03.013
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're saying it ruled favorably </v>

2536
01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:06.800
<v Speaker 5>towards you ultimately at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

2537
01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all live in our favor.</v>

2538
01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Gobbly goop that the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely probably shit.</v>

2539
01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:12.493
<v Speaker 3>Like he says that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well he retired and he was in the </v>

2540
01:55:14.981 --> 01:55:16.200
<v Speaker 3>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what my end,</v>

2541
01:55:16.201 --> 01:55:17.560
<v Speaker 3>the wind was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even that long.</v>

2542
01:55:17.561 --> 01:55:20.440
<v Speaker 3>I was in Japan for rising with my </v>
<v Speaker 3>athlete.</v>

2543
01:55:20.441 --> 01:55:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Alicia Garcia wasn't in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>wind.</v>

2544
01:55:22.811 --> 01:55:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Sounds good though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the wind and the wind</v>

2545
01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:29.590
<v Speaker 6>fucking you and that motorcycle jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2546
01:55:29.591 --> 01:55:34.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm dragging a coffin behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Django through the Nevada</v>

2547
01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:35.840
<v Speaker 5>desert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody pulls you over,</v>

2548
01:55:35.850 --> 01:55:40.130
<v Speaker 5>got eight days growth on your face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get some days where you sought out.</v>

2549
01:55:40.210 --> 01:55:41.450
<v Speaker 5>We're looking for is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

2550
01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:43.970
<v Speaker 5>He pissed this cup for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

2551
01:55:44.050 --> 01:55:44.940
<v Speaker 3>didn't bring a cup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just.</v>

2552
01:55:45.150 --> 01:55:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in Japan at rising.</v>

2553
01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.540
<v Speaker 3>You know I wasn't in the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they in your favor.</v>

2554
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:54.690
<v Speaker 3>The arbitrator arbitrator and what did </v>
<v Speaker 3>they say?</v>

2555
01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:55.524
<v Speaker 3>This is the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The arbitrator is the same guy that put </v>

2556
01:55:58.771 --> 01:56:01.080
<v Speaker 3>together is he's an ICARUS.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He produced ICARUS.</v>

2557
01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.080
<v Speaker 3>The movie on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on doping.</v>

2558
01:56:04.110 --> 01:56:04.943
<v Speaker 3>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the major figures in terms </v>

2559
01:56:07.381 --> 01:56:08.214
<v Speaker 3>of the world of anti-doping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's one of the guys who worked with </v>

2560
01:56:11.041 --> 01:56:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Bryan Fogel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the arbitrator.</v>

2561
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Bryan Fogel was the guy who started in </v>
<v Speaker 3>ICARUS.</v>

2562
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:21.110
<v Speaker 3>This guy is a perpetrator for water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2563
01:56:21.230 --> 01:56:24.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I doing this?</v>

2564
01:56:24.150 --> 01:56:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Either way you look at Jamie can handle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2565
01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:31.380
<v Speaker 3>So this guy has the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything in terms of drug testing,</v>

2566
01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:32.900
<v Speaker 3>they really favor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2567
01:56:32.970 --> 01:56:33.803
<v Speaker 3>And he said he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't see any way that I could </v>

2568
01:56:35.511 --> 01:56:36.344
<v Speaker 3>have done hardly a better job than I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>meticulous with my record keeping that </v>

2569
01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:40.741
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I may,</v>

2570
01:56:40.741 --> 01:56:45.741
<v Speaker 3>I did essentially everything I could in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the means of a normal person to do.</v>

2571
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:48.660
<v Speaker 3>How is it resolved at the end?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a.</v>

2572
01:56:49.050 --> 01:56:52.330
<v Speaker 3>The of reprimand reprimand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2573
01:56:52.410 --> 01:56:53.400
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they do?</v>

2574
01:56:54.150 --> 01:56:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Richard H dot Richard Mclaren.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mclaren chief arbitrator?</v>

2575
01:56:58.710 --> 01:57:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2576
01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.530
<v Speaker 3>So at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after all this,</v>

2577
01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.690
<v Speaker 3>they say they gave you a reprimand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

2578
01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:09.750
<v Speaker 3>It just means like don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be careful.</v>

2579
01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:10.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2580
01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:13.980
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this took but no punishment.</v>

2581
01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:14.873
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all that two year shift from Usada </v>

2582
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:17.950
<v Speaker 3>was on warranty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2583
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:20.910
<v Speaker 3>And heavy handed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy handed as hell.</v>

2584
01:57:20.911 --> 01:57:21.744
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and junior dos Santos went through the </v>

2585
01:57:22.561 --> 01:57:25.140
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started at at six months.</v>

2586
01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:30.420
<v Speaker 3>And then by the time we have both </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplements tested,</v>

2587
01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:33.630
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden it starts getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

2588
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:34.583
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this claim by new whiskey that we were </v>

2589
01:57:36.931 --> 01:57:37.860
<v Speaker 3>out of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2590
01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:40.590
<v Speaker 3>we were always in touch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Novitsky doesn't work for you.</v>

2591
01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:41.970
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

2592
01:57:41.971 --> 01:57:42.804
<v Speaker 3>So what's Kinda funny is new whiskey is </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a public face on this kind of </v>

2593
01:57:46.711 --> 01:57:47.544
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to actually dealing </v>

2594
01:57:49.231 --> 01:57:51.360
<v Speaker 3>with Usada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's all,</v>

2595
01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:52.253
<v Speaker 3>he's hands up.</v>

2596
01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:53.243
<v Speaker 3>I mean he'll come and he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll make sure to put something out </v>

2597
01:57:55.231 --> 01:57:56.064
<v Speaker 3>there in any of the sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in reality he ain't got a fucking </v>

2598
01:57:59.011 --> 01:58:00.000
<v Speaker 3>thing to do with any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2599
01:58:00.001 --> 01:58:00.834
<v Speaker 3>But in his defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a UFC employee and it's </v>

2600
01:58:02.881 --> 01:58:03.714
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate for him to have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence whatsoever on the way they </v>

2601
01:58:06.091 --> 01:58:07.410
<v Speaker 3>rule things that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

2602
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:08.380
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is that,</v>

2603
01:58:08.610 --> 01:58:11.550
<v Speaker 3>I think that's actually the proper thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him to do it in a way.</v>

2604
01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:12.790
<v Speaker 3>But I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2605
01:58:13.330 --> 01:58:14.250
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's it.</v>

2606
01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:17.150
<v Speaker 3>The presentation is a bit of a misnomer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

2607
01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Well initially he was responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the drug testing.</v>

2608
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Now he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is he,</v>

2609
01:58:21.901 --> 01:58:25.140
<v Speaker 3>the president of athletes safety and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wellness bucket.</v>

2610
01:58:25.730 --> 01:58:27.480
<v Speaker 3>They're running the performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>institute.</v>

2611
01:58:27.481 --> 01:58:28.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2612
01:58:28.111 --> 01:58:30.300
<v Speaker 3>what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're concentrating on now,</v>

2613
01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:31.353
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just saying for Jeff and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>shirt off that I think they're </v>

2614
01:58:33.301 --> 01:58:37.880
<v Speaker 3>concentrating more on encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters to train and,</v>

2615
01:58:37.881 --> 01:58:38.714
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fortify their body with nutrition </v>

2616
01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:42.370
<v Speaker 3>directly and giving them education</v>

2617
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:45.250
<v Speaker 5>on how to do this and the Jeff is at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>forefront of that stuff and showing them</v>

2618
01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:49.880
<v Speaker 5>how to avoid accidentally taking </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and definitely have guess</v>

2619
01:58:50.450 --> 01:58:51.283
<v Speaker 2>coming with this is that he is not fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the loop with what happened between </v>

2620
01:58:54.831 --> 01:58:57.590
<v Speaker 2>me and Usada because he's not involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2621
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:58.603
<v Speaker 2>So some of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of what he's saying there is </v>

2622
01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:01.693
<v Speaker 2>incorrect and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't blame him because he's not a </v>

2623
01:59:04.371 --> 01:59:04.900
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>

2624
01:59:04.900 --> 01:59:09.340
<v Speaker 5>So is he misinformed at the very least </v>
<v Speaker 5>think that they,</v>

2625
01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:10.233
<v Speaker 5>they're not being straightforward with </v>
<v Speaker 5>it sounds to me like they wanted to </v>

2626
01:59:12.161 --> 01:59:14.510
<v Speaker 5>punish you badly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wanted to punish me badly.</v>

2627
01:59:14.530 --> 01:59:16.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two years is fucking crazy punishment.</v>

2628
01:59:16.691 --> 01:59:17.524
<v Speaker 5>And also when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when people get to remember when I'm </v>

2629
01:59:22.330 --> 01:59:24.880
<v Speaker 5>Nick Diaz was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2630
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:27.730
<v Speaker 5>was being interviewed by all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2631
01:59:27.731 --> 01:59:28.564
<v Speaker 5>And then there was that mean lady who </v>
<v Speaker 5>works at Nevada State Athletic </v>

2632
01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:33.190
<v Speaker 5>Commission and she was grilling him and </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2633
01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:36.280
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about pot here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You crazy lady.</v>

2634
01:59:36.281 --> 01:59:38.110
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck are you doing?</v>

2635
01:59:38.111 --> 01:59:41.350
<v Speaker 5>You're acting like he robbed a bank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if he's not getting in the ring.</v>

2636
01:59:41.351 --> 01:59:42.340
<v Speaker 5>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And leave him alone.</v>

2637
01:59:42.370 --> 01:59:44.080
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think he probably did a few times,</v>

2638
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:45.623
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in the Gombe fighting he </v>

2639
01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:49.470
<v Speaker 5>might've been highest was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2640
01:59:49.570 --> 01:59:50.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2641
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:53.850
<v Speaker 5>maybe I should choke him right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't give a shit fight.</v>

2642
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones is going through this right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

2643
01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:57.873
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where John Jones stands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's been pretty well established </v>

2644
02:00:00.791 --> 02:00:03.910
<v Speaker 5>that at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the numbers,</v>

2645
02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:05.860
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the numbers when he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>tested,</v>

2646
02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:07.870
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2647
02:00:07.871 --> 02:00:08.704
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people like to say that he's a </v>

2648
02:00:09.911 --> 02:00:10.744
<v Speaker 5>cheater.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of this going on right </v>

2649
02:00:11.831 --> 02:00:14.140
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look real clear.</v>

2650
02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:18.670
<v Speaker 5>The first test was proven that he took </v>
<v Speaker 5>tainted Dick Pills.</v>

2651
02:00:18.930 --> 02:00:19.763
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2652
02:00:20.370 --> 02:00:21.203
<v Speaker 2>It was a actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that got brought up to my attention </v>

2653
02:00:23.521 --> 02:00:26.730
<v Speaker 2>as part of all this because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sought a felon,</v>

2654
02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:29.850
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference between that first one,</v>

2655
02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:31.110
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not,</v>

2656
02:00:31.111 --> 02:00:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about the second shift with</v>
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

2657
02:00:32.671 --> 02:00:36.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't really follow close on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this came across my plate because he</v>

2658
02:00:36.451 --> 02:00:37.284
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was taking like a liquid cialis and </v>

2659
02:00:40.921 --> 02:00:45.921
<v Speaker 2>it was from a company that sells sarms </v>
<v Speaker 2>and peptides and all that.</v>

2660
02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:49.440
<v Speaker 2>So it was a company that also sells </v>
<v Speaker 2>banned substances.</v>

2661
02:00:49.610 --> 02:00:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so their argument was that dude,</v>

2662
02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:55.700
<v Speaker 2>you're buying or using shit from a place</v>
<v Speaker 2>full of illegal shit.</v>

2663
02:00:55.730 --> 02:00:56.760
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to take.</v>

2664
02:00:56.840 --> 02:00:58.530
<v Speaker 5>Definitely a dumb move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely.</v>

2665
02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:02.960
<v Speaker 5>It means God damn prescription for </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cialis.</v>

2666
02:01:03.230 --> 02:01:04.870
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't need to take this phone.</v>

2667
02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:06.710
<v Speaker 5>I imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2668
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:10.080
<v Speaker 5>the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what he took,</v>

2669
02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:14.810
<v Speaker 5>he had such a minuscule trace amount </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he tested negative.</v>

2670
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:17.690
<v Speaker 5>Then he tested positive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then he tested negative again.</v>

2671
02:01:17.691 --> 02:01:19.940
<v Speaker 5>And this is something that's supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>stay in your system for months.</v>

2672
02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:21.133
<v Speaker 5>So this is indicative of someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not taking something to get into </v>

2673
02:01:23.601 --> 02:01:25.520
<v Speaker 5>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>enhance and benefit from it.</v>

2674
02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:28.010
<v Speaker 5>But rather someone who had something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was tainted,</v>

2675
02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:29.373
<v Speaker 2>lab technicians are smart on this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the guy who saw the results from </v>

2676
02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:36.940
<v Speaker 2>the first little batch of supplements we</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave me,</v>

2677
02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:37.823
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had seen everything and then some </v>

2678
02:01:39.861 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 2>under</v>

2679
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 3>the sun and all different levels and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy knew what,</v>

2680
02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:46.070
<v Speaker 3>what constituted contamination and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't.</v>

2681
02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:46.993
<v Speaker 3>He could tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course they can tell just by the </v>

2682
02:01:48.411 --> 02:01:49.244
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look if you'd taken trace amounts of </v>

2683
02:01:51.081 --> 02:01:51.914
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not gonna do a damn thing to your </v>

2684
02:01:53.751 --> 02:01:54.584
<v Speaker 3>body in terms of performance enhancing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is going to show up in these </v>

2685
02:01:56.211 --> 02:01:58.430
<v Speaker 3>tests because these tests are incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>thorough.</v>

2686
02:01:58.670 --> 02:01:59.503
<v Speaker 3>Hey Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google what's going on with Jon Jones </v>

2687
02:02:01.491 --> 02:02:03.800
<v Speaker 3>case because particularly after this </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend,</v>

2688
02:02:03.801 --> 02:02:05.420
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very relevant.</v>

2689
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:06.743
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean with Brock Lesnar get in there </v>

2690
02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:09.554
<v Speaker 3>with DC DC becoming the first light </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight to consecutively hold the </v>

2691
02:02:13.581 --> 02:02:15.950
<v Speaker 3>light heavyweight championship and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight championship,</v>

2692
02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:19.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a spectacular fight by DC.</v>

2693
02:02:19.401 --> 02:02:23.420
<v Speaker 3>But Jon Jones is always going to be sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you cannot,</v>

2694
02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:28.580
<v Speaker 3>you can go on and on about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>extracurricular woes of John Jones.</v>

2695
02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His capabilities as an athlete,</v>

2696
02:02:31.881 --> 02:02:35.000
<v Speaker 3>his talent is undeniable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>undeniable.</v>

2697
02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck he took Dick Pills,</v>

2698
02:02:38.841 --> 02:02:40.280
<v Speaker 3>where as not making them a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter.</v>

2699
02:02:40.281 --> 02:02:42.260
<v Speaker 3>He didn't knock dcl because at dick </v>
<v Speaker 3>pills,</v>

2700
02:02:42.261 --> 02:02:43.350
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2701
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:47.570
<v Speaker 3>it has to do with great skill and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful left high kick.</v>

2702
02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:50.360
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he recognize that tendency,</v>

2703
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:52.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>DC knows he has,</v>

2704
02:02:52.101 --> 02:02:53.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2705
02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:58.900
<v Speaker 3>but with this whole Usada process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just became an it drug on because w,</v>

2706
02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:01.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we said to them,</v>

2707
02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:04.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to take a punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said we won't.</v>

2708
02:03:04.730 --> 02:03:09.440
<v Speaker 3>We're not giving you any option on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's negotiation.</v>

2709
02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:12.260
<v Speaker 3>What happens with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I've talked about</v>

2710
02:03:12.261 --> 02:03:13.094
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to police officers is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have police officers and you </v>

2711
02:03:15.811 --> 02:03:16.644
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are trying to arrest it </v>

2712
02:03:16.911 --> 02:03:19.310
<v Speaker 3>becomes a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean a game in terms of it's</v>

2713
02:03:19.311 --> 02:03:20.144
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a game in terms of one </v>

2714
02:03:21.351 --> 02:03:24.650
<v Speaker 3>person's trying to win and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get people in a restaurant.</v>

2715
02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:28.370
<v Speaker 3>And this is why people plant guns and </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant drugs trying to win.</v>

2716
02:03:28.730 --> 02:03:31.040
<v Speaker 3>And that's what killed me was that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

2717
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:33.960
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sata was trying to win.</v>

2718
02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:35.293
<v Speaker 3>It was more important for them to win </v>
<v Speaker 3>than it was for us to have a clean </v>

2719
02:03:38.121 --> 02:03:38.954
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This comes back to what we're talking </v>

2720
02:03:39.921 --> 02:03:40.754
<v Speaker 3>about earlier when it comes to arguments</v>
<v Speaker 3>and discussions that people oftentimes </v>

2721
02:03:44.091 --> 02:03:46.460
<v Speaker 3>are not really searching for the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just want to be right?</v>

2722
02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:47.713
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've had this argument about </v>

2723
02:03:48.501 --> 02:03:49.900
<v Speaker 3>bureaucracies in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2724
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:51.830
<v Speaker 3>And this goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't just about,</v>

2725
02:03:51.890 --> 02:03:52.723
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Usada and they're bureaucratic </v>

2726
02:03:53.781 --> 02:03:56.450
<v Speaker 3>elements tie like the government or </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things.</v>

2727
02:03:56.451 --> 02:03:58.340
<v Speaker 3>So you come and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2728
02:03:58.341 --> 02:04:00.870
<v Speaker 3>you fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the bureaucracies go,</v>

2729
02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:03.110
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't fuck up.</v>

2730
02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:06.470
<v Speaker 3>And they're going to say we didn't fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>up to the very.</v>

2731
02:04:06.590 --> 02:04:07.423
<v Speaker 3>They'll take that to the very longest </v>
<v Speaker 3>lever until either a they'll scape goat </v>

2732
02:04:10.071 --> 02:04:12.530
<v Speaker 3>someone or be they can figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't.</v>

2733
02:04:12.890 --> 02:04:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Because looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making a mistake on a bureaucratic level</v>

2734
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:20.210
<v Speaker 3>makes it seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2735
02:04:20.211 --> 02:04:21.740
<v Speaker 3>well fuck if we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the thing.</v>

2736
02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:23.870
<v Speaker 3>If you saw to says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2737
02:04:23.871 --> 02:04:25.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not you,</v>

2738
02:04:25.530 --> 02:04:26.363
<v Speaker 3>you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get punished than </v>

2739
02:04:28.011 --> 02:04:29.780
<v Speaker 3>two means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll Romero go,</v>

2740
02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did I get punished?</v>

2741
02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Or if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you sat down and say,</v>

2742
02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:34.843
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2743
02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:36.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a miss,</v>

2744
02:04:36.670 --> 02:04:37.950
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a mistake.</v>

2745
02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that was a mistake,</v>

2746
02:04:40.141 --> 02:04:40.930
<v Speaker 3>well then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2747
02:04:40.930 --> 02:04:43.290
<v Speaker 3>I got fucked on that mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't take care of me.</v>

2748
02:04:43.530 --> 02:04:48.360
<v Speaker 3>So no drug testing is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but too much oversight is also bad.</v>

2749
02:04:48.361 --> 02:04:49.194
<v Speaker 3>I think that a clean sport is okay and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the random testing and all </v>

2750
02:04:53.251 --> 02:04:54.084
<v Speaker 3>is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't do it at the expense of </v>

2751
02:04:57.691 --> 02:04:58.524
<v Speaker 3>the athletes in that we're in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration of the testing that </v>

2752
02:05:01.981 --> 02:05:03.690
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to blast them.</v>

2753
02:05:03.690 --> 02:05:04.523
<v Speaker 3>Like these three Brazilian guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just got busted over contamination that </v>

2754
02:05:08.461 --> 02:05:11.840
<v Speaker 3>they traced back to a compounding </v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmacy when things.</v>

2755
02:05:12.210 --> 02:05:13.043
<v Speaker 3>This is just recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got three different guys in the </v>

2756
02:05:14.911 --> 02:05:15.744
<v Speaker 3>UFC and they were all getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplements from a compounding pharmacy </v>

2757
02:05:19.530 --> 02:05:20.363
<v Speaker 3>and everything was traced back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost seems like you shouldn't take </v>

2758
02:05:22.771 --> 02:05:24.060
<v Speaker 3>any fucking supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2759
02:05:24.061 --> 02:05:25.620
<v Speaker 3>that's the other thing is you'll do we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

2760
02:05:25.621 --> 02:05:27.420
<v Speaker 3>we not allowed to take anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything at all?</v>

2761
02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No on it.</v>

2762
02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:30.570
<v Speaker 3>What are supplements?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they do?</v>

2763
02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:32.570
<v Speaker 3>They help your performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2764
02:05:32.580 --> 02:05:34.400
<v Speaker 3>Should you take no performance and </v>
<v Speaker 3>answers?</v>

2765
02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Should we take nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just eat food.</v>

2766
02:05:36.810 --> 02:05:37.643
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be someone out there as </v>

2767
02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:39.093
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's food that will enhance your </v>

2768
02:05:39.691 --> 02:05:40.950
<v Speaker 3>performance too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2769
02:05:41.070 --> 02:05:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Like kangaroo meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Frank Mir took it,</v>

2770
02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:46.080
<v Speaker 3>take some bad kangaroo meat and oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kangaroo meat.</v>

2771
02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:48.720
<v Speaker 3>You get a good pump on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2772
02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:50.870
<v Speaker 3>ain't nobody giving steroids to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos.</v>

2773
02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos are fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Investigation.</v>

2774
02:05:54.121 --> 02:05:57.540
<v Speaker 3>Identify as compounding pharmacies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The source of tainted supplements behind</v>

2775
02:05:57.750 --> 02:06:01.510
<v Speaker 3>three positive Almeda and Antonio and </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2776
02:06:01.670 --> 02:06:03.930
<v Speaker 3>a minotauro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's the weird thing.</v>

2777
02:06:03.931 --> 02:06:07.500
<v Speaker 3>So it comes all the way down to it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they're there.</v>

2778
02:06:07.530 --> 02:06:10.020
<v Speaker 3>Highlight on this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2779
02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put give him a suspension that,</v>

2780
02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:13.033
<v Speaker 3>but at the time has already lapsed so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they won't actually have to serve any </v>

2781
02:06:15.171 --> 02:06:15.711
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2782
02:06:15.711 --> 02:06:19.350
<v Speaker 3>but you just fucking suspended them </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonetheless.</v>

2783
02:06:19.490 --> 02:06:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't have to do that.</v>

2784
02:06:21.570 --> 02:06:22.403
<v Speaker 3>So they took seven or eight months or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever for this get cleared up and </v>

2785
02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:28.230
<v Speaker 3>that's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Junior tested positive for a diuretic.</v>

2786
02:06:28.231 --> 02:06:29.760
<v Speaker 3>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>

2787
02:06:29.761 --> 02:06:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Which hydrochloric or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either diarrhetic,</v>

2788
02:06:32.221 --> 02:06:33.950
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy because he's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy one.</v>

2789
02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Losing any weight junior's not on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>high side of heavyweight.</v>

2790
02:06:37.111 --> 02:06:37.944
<v Speaker 3>He's not like a to 65 God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of way to make the upper </v>

2791
02:06:40.441 --> 02:06:41.274
<v Speaker 3>limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's just trying to keep those </v>

2792
02:06:41.791 --> 02:06:43.310
<v Speaker 3>wrinkles out of his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to look good.</v>

2793
02:06:43.330 --> 02:06:45.830
<v Speaker 3>Maybe just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does diarrhetics make you look good?</v>

2794
02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:46.560
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2795
02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:48.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that makes it herself.</v>

2796
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:53.940
<v Speaker 3>It just pulls all the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the water on bones.</v>

2797
02:06:53.941 --> 02:06:55.560
<v Speaker 3>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep in mind life is a journey.</v>

2798
02:06:55.561 --> 02:06:58.080
<v Speaker 3>Not a race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God's will for me to be there.</v>

2799
02:06:58.081 --> 02:06:58.891
<v Speaker 3>Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2800
02:06:58.891 --> 02:06:59.724
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

2801
02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:00.743
<v Speaker 3>Let's not forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still the youngest guy in the top </v>

2802
02:07:01.591 --> 02:07:02.700
<v Speaker 3>five of heavyweight and light </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

2803
02:07:02.701 --> 02:07:05.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is young.</v>

2804
02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:06.840
<v Speaker 3>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is unique?</v>

2805
02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:10.440
<v Speaker 3>What does that someone's account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2806
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:11.383
<v Speaker 3>is he responding to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody tweeted that the couple of </v>

2807
02:07:13.101 --> 02:07:16.680
<v Speaker 3>hours ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's up to a four year old right now.</v>

2808
02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:17.873
<v Speaker 3>He remains a provisional suspension of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wind and the outcome of the situation </v>

2809
02:07:20.401 --> 02:07:24.570
<v Speaker 3>with Usada after testing positive for </v>
<v Speaker 3>steroids last July,</v>

2810
02:07:24.571 --> 02:07:26.920
<v Speaker 3>following the Naca one of for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2811
02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:30.540
<v Speaker 3>was it a steroid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A man?</v>

2812
02:07:30.541 --> 02:07:31.374
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John faces up to four years suspension </v>

2813
02:07:34.170 --> 02:07:36.490
<v Speaker 3>due to second violation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Universities anti-doping</v>

2814
02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Pov is policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously young son ever champion.</v>

2815
02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:42.490
<v Speaker 1>But obviously first of all when it says </v>
<v Speaker 1>second violation,</v>

2816
02:07:42.491 --> 02:07:44.980
<v Speaker 1>the first violation was proven to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something tainted.</v>

2817
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:48.160
<v Speaker 1>So he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say violation,</v>

2818
02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear this guy took steroids.</v>

2819
02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:52.503
<v Speaker 1>He took steroids because he was trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a performance enhancing a result </v>

2820
02:07:55.931 --> 02:07:58.000
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suspend that guy.</v>

2821
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2822
02:07:59.741 --> 02:08:00.574
<v Speaker 1>he got toothpaste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's from China and had fucking </v>

2823
02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:04.060
<v Speaker 1>something in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remember that too.</v>

2824
02:08:04.061 --> 02:08:04.894
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have a fucking crazy story </v>

2825
02:08:05.801 --> 02:08:08.980
<v Speaker 1>about the toothpaste that had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>poison in it or something that they were</v>

2826
02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:10.560
<v Speaker 1>selling in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what was that?</v>

2827
02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Some wild shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was a toothpaste in China?</v>

2828
02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:17.290
<v Speaker 1>The poison in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vaguely remembering this.</v>

2829
02:08:17.291 --> 02:08:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I just said it just because it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>

2830
02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:22.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's really just made it up and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden it's true.</v>

2831
02:08:22.570 --> 02:08:25.420
<v Speaker 1>It's probably in the back of my memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that I just.</v>

2832
02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:26.353
<v Speaker 1>I hear what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The toothpaste the made in China found </v>

2833
02:08:28.721 --> 02:08:30.510
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll get her fresh.</v>

2834
02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fresh.</v>

2835
02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:32.021
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For this,</v>

2836
02:08:32.021 --> 02:08:34.270
<v Speaker 1>like some people that don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand English.</v>

2837
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2838
02:08:35.281 --> 02:08:38.560
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how she'll very good.</v>

2839
02:08:38.770 --> 02:08:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Shira.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shelf fresh.</v>

2840
02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a Chinese romanization door</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Maine.</v>

2841
02:08:44.981 --> 02:08:48.220
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to kill people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

2843
02:08:50.461 --> 02:08:51.820
<v Speaker 1>What was in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antifreeze.</v>

2844
02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

2846
02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:54.963
<v Speaker 1>Look at how cold it gets up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't you need people that know </v>

2847
02:08:57.180 --> 02:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>that they were doing a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to.</v>

2848
02:08:58.810 --> 02:09:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Teeth falling out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freeze and shattering glass.</v>

2849
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Little propylene glycol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2850
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:10.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 percent for testing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 percent for them stopping people</v>

2851
02:09:10.931 --> 02:09:14.560
<v Speaker 1>from taking performance enhancing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this sounds very heavy handed.</v>

2852
02:09:14.710 --> 02:09:15.543
<v Speaker 1>It was just an ime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no problem with the system and </v>

2853
02:09:17.411 --> 02:09:21.070
<v Speaker 1>then this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it unfolded to me,</v>

2854
02:09:21.071 --> 02:09:22.200
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

2855
02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:23.133
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to be fighting multiple </v>

2856
02:09:24.281 --> 02:09:25.114
<v Speaker 1>fronts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm just trying to do everything I </v>

2857
02:09:26.411 --> 02:09:29.110
<v Speaker 1>can to stay as in this as an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2858
02:09:29.111 --> 02:09:31.480
<v Speaker 1>when you first started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you want to UFC heavyweight title</v>

2859
02:09:31.481 --> 02:09:35.290

2866
02:09:50.170 --> 02:09:53.080

<v Speaker 1>grabbing.</v>

2878
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:31.090
<v Speaker 1>He's clearly over $9,000</v>

2891
02:11:02.151 --> 02:11:04.190
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew what the fuck it was back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

2892
02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

2893
02:11:05.931 --> 02:11:09.890
<v Speaker 1>Like brock lesnar being back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brock lesner is not asking for over him.</v>

2894
02:11:09.930 --> 02:11:10.763
<v Speaker 1>Over him was the last guy to really fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>him up and he wants to fight DC and he </v>

2895
02:11:14.430 --> 02:11:16.430
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just not the same guy anymore.</v>

2896
02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:17.293
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

2897
02:11:17.370 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 1>He does not perform at the same level as</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

2898
02:11:21.051 --> 02:11:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>

2899
02:11:22.130 --> 02:11:23.840
<v Speaker 1>It's still very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

2900
02:11:23.841 --> 02:11:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Even when he was a two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2901
02:11:25.161 --> 02:11:26.000
<v Speaker 1>five pounder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2902
02:11:26.001 --> 02:11:30.200
<v Speaker 1>And he had a tendency to gas up gas out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get,</v>

2903
02:11:30.230 --> 02:11:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be Chiney to a degree,</v>

2904
02:11:31.911 --> 02:11:36.470
<v Speaker 1>but he was always super technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly skilled,</v>

2905
02:11:36.570 --> 02:11:37.403
<v Speaker 1>like I don't think you could overeem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him and his brother both are actually </v>

2906
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:43.160
<v Speaker 1>very good fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2907
02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their struggles.</v>

2908
02:11:44.991 --> 02:11:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I've never been a physical one for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most part.</v>

2909
02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:48.201
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2910
02:11:48.201 --> 02:11:50.370
<v Speaker 1>they've had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a difficulty that,</v>

2911
02:11:50.410 --> 02:11:53.510
<v Speaker 1>that is most common amongst fighters is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mental game of it.</v>

2912
02:11:54.110 --> 02:11:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw that within Ghana this week.</v>

2913
02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:59.390
<v Speaker 1>We've seen the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I heard it was one for the ages.</v>

2914
02:11:59.570 --> 02:12:00.403
<v Speaker 1>It was one for the ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who just let some lions loosen </v>

2915
02:12:02.631 --> 02:12:03.830
<v Speaker 1>that thing and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2916
02:12:03.831 --> 02:12:04.664
<v Speaker 1>let's crank this up a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the worst heavyweight fight I've </v>

2917
02:12:06.111 --> 02:12:08.340
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the worst one in mind,</v>

2918
02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:13.360
<v Speaker 1>but it came down to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came down to the sea.</v>

2919
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:17.570
<v Speaker 1>It was the second lowest output fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2920
02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:18.733
<v Speaker 1>A demo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't even make it the lowest </v>

2921
02:12:19.881 --> 02:12:22.100
<v Speaker 1>output fight to be number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even get to number one.</v>

2922
02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they failed that failing.</v>

2923
02:12:24.710 --> 02:12:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Jens pulver versus jaw hoke from like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking ufc 13 or some shit.</v>

2924
02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:36.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what day that fight was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that fight was number one with 23 or</v>

2925
02:12:38.361 --> 02:12:39.194
<v Speaker 1>22 strikes landed in three rounds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fight was number two with 23 </v>

2926
02:12:44.091 --> 02:12:45.020
<v Speaker 1>strikes landed.</v>

2927
02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:46.340
<v Speaker 1>That's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2928
02:12:46.341 --> 02:12:48.580
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then overeat.</v>

2929
02:12:48.581 --> 02:12:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean Francis go to Francis and Ganos a</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram.</v>

2930
02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:53.233
<v Speaker 1>He released a statement today and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement was essentially that he was </v>

2931
02:12:56.660 --> 02:12:58.550
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He carried the fear.</v>

2932
02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:00.530
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not proud of my last performance.</v>

2933
02:13:00.531 --> 02:13:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I have carried my fear from the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight to this one.</v>

2934
02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:07.490
<v Speaker 1>I completely understand the frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anger that has caused my fans,</v>

2935
02:13:07.491 --> 02:13:08.480
<v Speaker 1>coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teammates,</v>

2936
02:13:08.481 --> 02:13:09.314
<v Speaker 1>and family and friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird that he would have fear from the </v>

2937
02:13:11.031 --> 02:13:14.870
<v Speaker 1>last time we cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking owned wrestle,</v>

2938
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.823
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't know he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought he was the man and then he </v>

2939
02:13:18.891 --> 02:13:22.010
<v Speaker 1>got owned and then won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's letting everyone down again.</v>

2940
02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:24.770
<v Speaker 1>All I can do now is proved myself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you proud again.</v>

2941
02:13:24.771 --> 02:13:27.530
<v Speaker 1>But look at this picture that he puts up</v>
<v Speaker 1>his swinging on him,</v>

2942
02:13:27.590 --> 02:13:28.560
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him connected,</v>

2943
02:13:28.610 --> 02:13:30.050
<v Speaker 1>one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2944
02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:31.830
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of funny.</v>

2945
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:33.840
<v Speaker 5>It should've been him with his head </v>
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>

2946
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:36.270
<v Speaker 5>Francis in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're gonna,</v>

2947
02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:38.430
<v Speaker 5>if you're gonna post a humble shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look humble.</v>

2948
02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:40.880
<v Speaker 5>There's this is like I'm following him.</v>

2949
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:44.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he doesn't legitimately made.</v>

2950
02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:44.953
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he is carrying some kind of fear </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the last fight in terms of losing </v>

2951
02:13:48.981 --> 02:13:51.680
<v Speaker 3>the result or is a lot of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2952
02:13:51.681 --> 02:13:54.340
<v Speaker 3>That can go into being a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2953
02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:56.200
<v Speaker 3>I think with</v>

2954
02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:00.370
<v Speaker 5>bounced back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've been on both sides and you know,</v>

2955
02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:04.390
<v Speaker 5>the first fight back after a kale loss </v>
<v Speaker 5>or after getting dominated,</v>

2956
02:14:04.391 --> 02:14:05.500
<v Speaker 5>what is that feeling like?</v>

2957
02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:07.893
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good.</v>

2958
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:11.360

<v Speaker 3>I've been at this shit for so long.</v>

2959

<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>

3010
02:16:20.741 --> 02:16:25.030

<v Speaker 1>I mean they're all over the place.</v>

3015
02:16:34.570 --> 02:16:35.403
<v Speaker 1>If you look for a place to hit the heavy</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag and workout and lift weights and </v>

3016
02:16:37.961 --> 02:16:38.920

3020
02:16:48.261 --> 02:16:49.094
<v Speaker 2>pretty much kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just about trying to help people </v>

3021
02:16:51.650 --> 02:16:54.740
<v Speaker 2>achieve work towards the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want as an athlete,</v>

3022
02:16:54.741 --> 02:16:55.574
<v Speaker 2>but also they're good people that I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see them make the most out of their </v>

3023
02:16:58.611 --> 02:17:00.350
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>a positive influence in terms of </v>

3025
02:17:05.490 --> 02:17:10.250
<v Speaker 2>bringing philosophy and ethics to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and helping them be good people and</v>

3026
02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:13.900
<v Speaker 2>to pass that kind of shit on b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ripple in the water that the drop in</v>

3027
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:14.743
<v Speaker 2>the water that sends ripples out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes a positive effect on other </v>

3028
02:17:16.791 --> 02:17:17.150
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>because the ripples of that negativity </v>

3036
02:17:34.311 --> 02:17:37.580
<v Speaker 1>can infect the people around you and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want that stay positive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think that UFC gym is a brilliant </v>

3040
02:17:48.591 --> 02:17:50.930
<v Speaker 1>thing to brilliant move because if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3041
02:17:51.050 --> 02:17:54.020
<v Speaker 1>if I see 24 hour fitness and it's right </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to the UFC gym,</v>

3042
02:17:54.021 --> 02:17:54.650
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3043
02:17:54.650 --> 02:17:56.660
<v Speaker 1>fucking heavy bags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

3044
02:17:56.710 --> 02:17:58.400
<v Speaker 1>What the fights are on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3045
02:17:58.460 --> 02:17:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Put that on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also,</v>

3046
02:17:59.511 --> 02:18:01.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the one in La Mirada has like a</v>

3047
02:18:01.881 --> 02:18:04.760
<v Speaker 1>whole little section that has astroturf </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and all that.</v>

3048
02:18:04.930 --> 02:18:05.763
<v Speaker 1>Little with ladders that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>painted into it so he can do foot </v>

3049
02:18:07.761 --> 02:18:08.340
<v Speaker 1>drills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3050
02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:11.840
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got a sleds and tires and shit.</v>

3051
02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:12.743
<v Speaker 1>You mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can do other nonconventional </v>

3052
02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:15.520
<v Speaker 1>workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells.</v>

3053
02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:18.040
<v Speaker 1>So they have it really like a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and condition.</v>

3054
02:18:18.041 --> 02:18:18.741
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3055
02:18:18.741 --> 02:18:20.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do really anything.</v>

3056
02:18:20.591 --> 02:18:23.270
<v Speaker 1>They have a whole setup of trx is and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit like that shit.</v>

3057
02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bad ass.</v>

3058
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3059
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what you want from a gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to a lot of gyms,</v>

3060
02:18:29.091 --> 02:18:31.040
<v Speaker 1>they just don't have that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3061
02:18:31.041 --> 02:18:32.660
<v Speaker 1>they have your standard stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3062
02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:35.330
<v Speaker 1>machines and shake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could lift with.</v>

3063
02:18:35.331 --> 02:18:37.100
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite good enough</v>

3064
02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:39.290
<v Speaker 2>that I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this gives you that,</v>

3065
02:18:39.291 --> 02:18:40.124
<v Speaker 2>that full spectrum to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to work in whatever ways you want to </v>

3066
02:18:43.041 --> 02:18:43.640
<v Speaker 2>just about.</v>

3067
02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Would you be interested in owning your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own gym?</v>

3068
02:18:45.630 --> 02:18:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

3069
02:18:47.930 --> 02:18:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mind having it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having</v>

3070
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:51.050
<v Speaker 2>my own gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just such a,</v>

3071
02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burden isn't the right word,</v>

3072
02:18:53.841 --> 02:18:55.670
<v Speaker 2>but there's just a lot of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>that comes with it,</v>

3073
02:18:55.671 --> 02:18:56.504
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overhead of having a place and </v>

3074
02:18:57.500 --> 02:18:59.740
<v Speaker 2>creating a program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3075
02:18:59.750 --> 02:19:02.510
<v Speaker 2>and having people manage and run those </v>
<v Speaker 2>programs.</v>

3076
02:19:03.050 --> 02:19:06.410
<v Speaker 2>And with me being as busy as I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3077
02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:07.753
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to do anything half ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also don't want to commit to </v>

3078
02:19:11.601 --> 02:19:15.200
<v Speaker 2>something and then not be able to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>into it what I think is necessary.</v>

3079
02:19:15.350 --> 02:19:17.450
<v Speaker 2>You obviously love teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

3080
02:19:17.510 --> 02:19:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I do love to teach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3081
02:19:18.810 --> 02:19:20.600
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

3082
02:19:20.601 --> 02:19:23.810
<v Speaker 2>it was such a big thing in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>

3083
02:19:23.930 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 2>not just in terms of athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people mentored</v>

3084
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:29.023
<v Speaker 3>me and helped to mold and shape me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>help give me the tools and sometimes a </v>

3085
02:19:33.201 --> 02:19:34.034
<v Speaker 3>kick in the ass as needed to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to move me along in life to get me to </v>

3086
02:19:36.831 --> 02:19:40.110
<v Speaker 3>where I am today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to give me not just in terms of what,</v>

3087
02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:42.890
<v Speaker 3>what you would argue for is successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not,</v>

3088
02:19:42.891 --> 02:19:46.700
<v Speaker 3>but just to be the person that I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while far from perfect,</v>

3089
02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:47.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3090
02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:48.553
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think about exchanging bad </v>

3091
02:19:53.631 --> 02:19:55.520
<v Speaker 3>moments for different moments in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3092
02:19:55.970 --> 02:19:58.190
<v Speaker 3>For the fear of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be who I am today.</v>

3093
02:19:59.020 --> 02:19:59.853
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Nietzsche talks about eternal </v>

3094
02:20:00.711 --> 02:20:03.150
<v Speaker 3>recurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the idea of that is that,</v>

3095
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:04.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your loneliest,</v>

3096
02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:07.310
<v Speaker 3>loneliest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a demon showed up and it said,</v>

3097
02:20:07.311 --> 02:20:08.144
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to live your life in every </v>

3098
02:20:08.871 --> 02:20:12.980
<v Speaker 3>way as you ever have in every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of it.</v>

3099
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:14.091
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3100
02:20:14.091 --> 02:20:18.050
<v Speaker 3>you have to have to be okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to live a life that,</v>

3101
02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:18.933
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3102
02:20:19.580 --> 02:20:22.820
<v Speaker 3>that's reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you would be fine with doing it all</v>

3103
02:20:22.821 --> 02:20:24.410
<v Speaker 3>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doing it all over again.</v>

3104
02:20:24.411 --> 02:20:25.244
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to be specific </v>

3105
02:20:26.171 --> 02:20:28.100
<v Speaker 3>specificity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better like pushing a rock up a hill,</v>

3106
02:20:29.090 --> 02:20:30.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever mistakes you've made,</v>

3107
02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:32.570
<v Speaker 3>they have made you who you are right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3108
02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:33.433
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as it's not catastrophic to the </v>

3109
02:20:35.091 --> 02:20:35.924
<v Speaker 3>point where you've caused a loss of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>or someone's devastated and destroyed </v>

3110
02:20:38.901 --> 02:20:40.550
<v Speaker 3>someone else's life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hope not.</v>

3111
02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:42.280
<v Speaker 3>I hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3112
02:20:42.470 --> 02:20:46.640
<v Speaker 3>I know it's interesting thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the concept of reincarnation.</v>

3113
02:20:46.641 --> 02:20:49.040
<v Speaker 3>There's many concepts with one of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the,</v>

3114
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:50.023
<v Speaker 3>one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a haunting for some people is that you </v>

3115
02:20:52.641 --> 02:20:53.474
<v Speaker 3>will live your life over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly the same way until you get it </v>

3116
02:20:56.301 --> 02:20:56.810
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3117
02:20:56.810 --> 02:20:59.270
<v Speaker 3>I actually heard Leo Gracie talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this once,</v>

3118
02:21:00.050 --> 02:21:01.790
<v Speaker 3>that everything in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every mistake,</v>

3119
02:21:02.030 --> 02:21:04.730
<v Speaker 3>every choice you make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do not do the correct thing,</v>

3120
02:21:04.731 --> 02:21:07.820
<v Speaker 3>he believed that you would have to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>back again and do it all over again.</v>

3121
02:21:07.821 --> 02:21:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Exactly the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is his philosophy,</v>

3122
02:21:10.041 --> 02:21:12.860
<v Speaker 3>the way he lived his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's terrifying for people.</v>

3123
02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:15.920
<v Speaker 3>This idea that somehow or another you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going almost like you're going to repeat</v>

3124
02:21:15.921 --> 02:21:18.130
<v Speaker 3>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure you don't put.</v>

3125
02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:21.740
<v Speaker 3>But here's how brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brutal period of my life and my mind to.</v>

3126
02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:22.813
<v Speaker 3>But here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody's and the people who </v>

3127
02:21:25.311 --> 02:21:27.580
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't brutal for those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>people turn up,</v>

3128
02:21:27.660 --> 02:21:32.150
<v Speaker 5>be losers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stories of that.</v>

3129
02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:34.600
<v Speaker 5>The fucking homecoming king in this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3130
02:21:34.601 --> 02:21:36.370
<v Speaker 5>that's like a fucking billy Joel Song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3131
02:21:36.730 --> 02:21:39.280
<v Speaker 5>the king and the queen of the Prom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3132
02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:42.370
<v Speaker 5>that's a scenes from an Italian </v>
<v Speaker 5>restaurant that's,</v>

3133
02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:43.370
<v Speaker 5>that's literally the,</v>

3134
02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:46.040
<v Speaker 3>the premise of that song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>

3135
02:21:46.041 --> 02:21:47.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3136
02:21:47.250 --> 02:21:48.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3137
02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:49.950
<v Speaker 3>a immortal song too.</v>

3138
02:21:50.390 --> 02:21:51.223
<v Speaker 5>Norway brand new and not with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>populist and the king and the queen of </v>

3139
02:21:53.861 --> 02:21:57.860
<v Speaker 5>the prom running around with the top </v>
<v Speaker 5>down and the radio on.</v>

3140
02:21:59.050 --> 02:21:59.883
<v Speaker 5>Nobody looked any finer who is more of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hit at the parkway diner and we never </v>

3141
02:22:03.701 --> 02:22:05.800
<v Speaker 5>knew we could walk more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I live.</v>

3142
02:22:05.980 --> 02:22:10.980
<v Speaker 5>Remember that I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know it as well as you do.</v>

3143
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:13.153
<v Speaker 5>It's a good song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea of living your life over again </v>

3144
02:22:16.811 --> 02:22:19.510
<v Speaker 5>is terrifying for people though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dying alone,</v>

3145
02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:22.360
<v Speaker 5>but the living over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 5>again for a finisher,</v>

3146
02:22:22.450 --> 02:22:24.130
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why is that?</v>

3147
02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:27.690
<v Speaker 5>When living right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fine for most of us.</v>

3148
02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:29.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you're depressed,</v>

3149
02:22:29.130 --> 02:22:32.730
<v Speaker 5>unless you depressing life to wreck </v>
<v Speaker 5>living right now it's like,</v>

3150
02:22:32.731 --> 02:22:33.564
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm alive.</v>

3151
02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:34.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing it.</v>

3152
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:35.423
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why scared to do it over and over and </v>

3153
02:22:36.421 --> 02:22:37.380
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had forever.</v>

3154
02:22:37.650 --> 02:22:41.580
<v Speaker 5>It's a strange thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's something like the futility</v>

3155
02:22:41.581 --> 02:22:42.414
<v Speaker 5>of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that this is just a repeating </v>

3156
02:22:44.611 --> 02:22:46.650
<v Speaker 5>cycle that's going to haunt you forever.</v>

3157
02:22:47.050 --> 02:22:47.883
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would in the idea that there would </v>

3158
02:22:50.171 --> 02:22:53.470
<v Speaker 2>be nothing that you could do to make any</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect to it.</v>

3159
02:22:54.030 --> 02:22:58.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean to Mifa even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even still,</v>

3160
02:22:58.271 --> 02:23:00.100
<v Speaker 2>like I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me personally,</v>

3161
02:23:00.101 --> 02:23:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't think of something that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like a,</v>

3162
02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:05.500
<v Speaker 2>I want to do something that as a mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>

3163
02:23:05.501 --> 02:23:07.300
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a mind game,</v>

3164
02:23:07.301 --> 02:23:08.134
<v Speaker 2>that if I lived my life in a way that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be okay with doing it all over </v>

3165
02:23:11.681 --> 02:23:13.210
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just exactly the same way.</v>

3166
02:23:13.580 --> 02:23:14.413
<v Speaker 2>And here's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you know that it's gonna happen </v>

3167
02:23:16.061 --> 02:23:17.200
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could you.</v>

3168
02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

3169
02:23:20.060 --> 02:23:20.840
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3170
02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:21.673
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could remember who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this philosopher who was </v>

3171
02:23:25.421 --> 02:23:26.254
<v Speaker 2>saying that if you were given the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to absolutely and utterly </v>

3172
02:23:31.781 --> 02:23:34.930
<v Speaker 2>control your dreams and all aspects and </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of it.</v>

3173
02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:39.580
<v Speaker 2>And so at first most people would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would go to sleep and they would turn it</v>

3174
02:23:39.581 --> 02:23:42.040
<v Speaker 2>into every fucking wonderful thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've ever wanted.</v>

3175
02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:44.290
<v Speaker 2>They would just be the ultimate winner </v>
<v Speaker 2>at everything all the time,</v>

3176
02:23:44.291 --> 02:23:45.124
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they would get tired of that </v>

3177
02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:50.050
<v Speaker 2>and then they would create chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe in,</v>

3178
02:23:50.051 --> 02:23:50.511
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3179
02:23:50.511 --> 02:23:51.220
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3180
02:23:51.220 --> 02:23:52.053
<v Speaker 2>make probably make everything is </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible for themselves and they could </v>

3181
02:23:54.431 --> 02:23:55.264
<v Speaker 2>possibly do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as they're going through these </v>

3182
02:23:57.131 --> 02:23:57.964
<v Speaker 2>cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately the one thing that you're </v>

3183
02:24:00.041 --> 02:24:03.190
<v Speaker 2>going to end up wanting in the end is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you just don't know what's going to</v>

3184
02:24:03.191 --> 02:24:04.024
<v Speaker 2>happen at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find by knowing everything prior to it </v>

3185
02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:13.090
<v Speaker 2>occurring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes the want to experience it away.</v>

3186
02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Cormac McCarthy wrote a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3187
02:24:17.710 --> 02:24:20.740
<v Speaker 2>how many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they knew the path of their lives,</v>

3188
02:24:20.741 --> 02:24:23.370
<v Speaker 2>which still choose to live it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>woo.</v>

3189
02:24:24.810 --> 02:24:26.760
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there isn't that ultimately expressed by</v>

3190
02:24:26.761 --> 02:24:29.100
<v Speaker 5>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like fighting is the ultimate expression</v>

3191
02:24:29.101 --> 02:24:29.934
<v Speaker 5>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because when you step into that cage of </v>

3192
02:24:31.711 --> 02:24:34.790
<v Speaker 5>it's just you and you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 5>another guy who's a,</v>

3193
02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:39.800
<v Speaker 5>a legitimate top flight mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>artists and you really don't know.</v>

3194
02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:44.680
<v Speaker 2>I have a theory about fighting and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting is actually a,</v>

3195
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:49.270
<v Speaker 2>not the only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a great conduit into what I think of</v>

3196
02:24:49.271 --> 02:24:54.271
<v Speaker 2>as the highest point of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being as a human being.</v>

3197
02:24:54.970 --> 02:24:55.803
<v Speaker 2>That you can enter into this state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not a place that you can </v>

3198
02:24:59.771 --> 02:25:01.060
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That all the time,</v>

3199
02:25:01.150 --> 02:25:05.040
<v Speaker 2>like it's just not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you breach it,</v>

3200
02:25:05.390 --> 02:25:06.223
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are so alive and you were at </v>

3201
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:14.440
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the peak of being at that moment,</v>

3202
02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:15.753
<v Speaker 2>and even though it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is brought on through through being </v>

3203
02:25:17.831 --> 02:25:20.710
<v Speaker 2>in the the intensity and the stress of </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat,</v>

3204
02:25:22.270 --> 02:25:26.990
<v Speaker 2>it's as every aspect of your being is </v>
<v Speaker 2>charged in electric,</v>

3205
02:25:27.010 --> 02:25:27.843
<v Speaker 2>in and living and being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a place that you could be </v>

3206
02:25:30.551 --> 02:25:33.580
<v Speaker 2>at all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would just be a maniac,</v>

3207
02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:34.513
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a place that human beings can </v>

3208
02:25:35.441 --> 02:25:38.710
<v Speaker 2>exist in for more than maybe short </v>
<v Speaker 2>periods of time.</v>

3209
02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3210
02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:44.690
<v Speaker 5>your senses have to be insanely </v>
<v Speaker 5>heightened.</v>

3211
02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:46.020
<v Speaker 5>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your you.</v>

3212
02:25:46.050 --> 02:25:48.290
<v Speaker 5>The consequences of your actions are </v>
<v Speaker 5>grave.</v>

3213
02:25:48.291 --> 02:25:49.124
<v Speaker 5>The only thing that really is elevated </v>
<v Speaker 5>passed out as war and one of the things </v>

3214
02:25:52.971 --> 02:25:57.230
<v Speaker 5>that you find about war and Sebastian </v>
<v Speaker 5>younger wrote about this in his book,</v>

3215
02:25:57.231 --> 02:25:58.064
<v Speaker 5>tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that the people that experienced it </v>

3216
02:25:59.511 --> 02:26:02.450
<v Speaker 5>have an incredibly difficult time </v>
<v Speaker 5>adjusting to regular life.</v>

3217
02:26:02.510 --> 02:26:03.343
<v Speaker 5>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they really miss it and want to go </v>

3218
02:26:04.461 --> 02:26:05.810
<v Speaker 5>back to it because they never felt more.</v>

3219
02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:08.670
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that war is a similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

3220
02:26:08.671 --> 02:26:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I think that when you are faced with </v>
<v Speaker 2>death that that is a,</v>

3221
02:26:13.470 --> 02:26:17.040
<v Speaker 2>a conduit to bringing you towards that </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest point of,</v>

3222
02:26:17.090 --> 02:26:19.170
<v Speaker 2>of being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3223
02:26:20.310 --> 02:26:21.143
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it's like that once you get </v>

3224
02:26:22.981 --> 02:26:26.490
<v Speaker 2>past that point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no fear at that level either.</v>

3225
02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:28.290
<v Speaker 2>It is just an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a way.</v>

3226
02:26:28.291 --> 02:26:30.750
<v Speaker 2>It's just an existence you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider.</v>

3227
02:26:30.751 --> 02:26:31.584
<v Speaker 2>You don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't think something isn't this or </v>

3228
02:26:34.621 --> 02:26:35.454
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just is and it's a place that you </v>

3229
02:26:39.841 --> 02:26:41.460
<v Speaker 2>can't be forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't,</v>

3230
02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:46.550
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you've been there and here just</v>

3231
02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:50.820
<v Speaker 2>out here dealing with petty again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet trolls and dumb shit and people</v>

3232
02:26:50.821 --> 02:26:51.654
<v Speaker 2>doing stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that cut their nose to spite their face </v>

3233
02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:54.204
<v Speaker 2>and undermining this and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fabric of our relationships for no </v>

3234
02:26:57.181 --> 02:26:58.580
<v Speaker 2>good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3235
02:26:58.920 --> 02:27:00.480
<v Speaker 2>it's tough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sit in,</v>

3236
02:27:00.481 --> 02:27:02.130
<v Speaker 2>exist in this and go fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3237
02:27:02.131 --> 02:27:06.150
<v Speaker 2>I how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you get back to that other thing,</v>

3238
02:27:06.210 --> 02:27:07.650
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this state of purity,</v>

3239
02:27:08.340 --> 02:27:13.340
<v Speaker 2>this existence of where these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of those things matter anymore.</v>

3240
02:27:14.660 --> 02:27:16.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you,</v>

3241
02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:17.690
<v Speaker 5>you might have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3242
02:27:17.691 --> 02:27:18.524
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have a certain amount of time on </v>

3243
02:27:20.351 --> 02:27:21.470
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on this planet,</v>

3244
02:27:21.471 --> 02:27:22.490
<v Speaker 5>in this life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3245
02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:25.040
<v Speaker 5>You have a 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If everything goes great,</v>

3246
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:29.060
<v Speaker 5>you can't really expect to just live in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3247
02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:35.440
<v Speaker 5>That perfect state of both chaos and and</v>

3248
02:27:40.110 --> 02:27:45.110
<v Speaker 5>chaos and I guess being in the moment </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something about something that's</v>

3249
02:27:47.010 --> 02:27:47.843
<v Speaker 5>dangerous and intense and overwhelmingly</v>
<v Speaker 5>filled with anticipation beforehand and </v>

3250
02:27:54.980 --> 02:27:59.980
<v Speaker 5>the preparation is all consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's very few things in life that are</v>

3251
02:28:00.451 --> 02:28:05.451
<v Speaker 5>the like these big moments like a person</v>
<v Speaker 5>stepping into a cage for a fight and the</v>

3252
02:28:07.381 --> 02:28:11.910
<v Speaker 5>consequences are so grave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just for your emotions,</v>

3253
02:28:11.911 --> 02:28:13.300
<v Speaker 5>for your physical health,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is.</v>

3254
02:28:13.330 --> 02:28:15.990
<v Speaker 5>There's really nothing like it is really</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3255
02:28:15.991 --> 02:28:20.991
<v Speaker 5>the to expect that you would find </v>
<v Speaker 5>something else similar in life and to be</v>

3256
02:28:21.891 --> 02:28:25.700
<v Speaker 5>able to achieve a similar state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Outside of that it's.</v>

3257
02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:27.213
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you ever will because I </v>

3258
02:28:28.371 --> 02:28:29.204
<v Speaker 5>feel like part of what makes what you do</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what all fighters do so intense and </v>

3259
02:28:35.931 --> 02:28:40.550
<v Speaker 5>so incredibly enjoyable to watch is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all know how much is on the line.</v>

3260
02:28:41.150 --> 02:28:41.983
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe I'm 100 percent in agreement </v>

3261
02:28:44.481 --> 02:28:48.440
<v Speaker 3>with you there and I think race car </v>
<v Speaker 3>drivers and fighter pilots.</v>

3262
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I think people like that also likely </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced that state of being as well.</v>

3263
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

3264
02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fighter pilots.</v>

3265
02:28:56.760 --> 02:28:58.880
<v Speaker 3>It has to be fighter pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>

3266
02:28:58.881 --> 02:29:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I was reading some story about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about wife swapping.</v>

3267
02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:03.980
<v Speaker 3>They're like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3268
02:29:03.981 --> 02:29:04.814
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more inclined to have </v>

3269
02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:09.080
<v Speaker 3>polyamorous relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

3270
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the wife swap because the idea </v>

3271
02:29:12.231 --> 02:29:17.231
<v Speaker 3>was that they know that their life </v>
<v Speaker 3>easily could be wiped out any day at any</v>

3272
02:29:18.891 --> 02:29:20.750
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the people they care about the most,</v>

3273
02:29:20.751 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 3>their wife or their girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they want other people to love them</v>

3274
02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:25.693
<v Speaker 3>because they might not be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're interesting and that they would </v>

3275
02:29:29.091 --> 02:29:31.070
<v Speaker 3>want the people they care about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most.</v>

3276
02:29:31.071 --> 02:29:31.904
<v Speaker 3>I love them because they're thinking in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a altruistic fashion of doing what they </v>

3277
02:29:37.131 --> 02:29:37.964
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose to help this person that they </v>

3278
02:29:41.301 --> 02:29:44.120
<v Speaker 3>care so much about continuing to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>joy in their life.</v>

3279
02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:46.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of their,</v>

3280
02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:51.100
<v Speaker 3>their realization that what joy they may</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to derive from them specifically</v>

3281
02:29:51.531 --> 02:29:54.800
<v Speaker 3>is is always on a thin line of not being</v>
<v Speaker 3>there anymore.</v>

3282
02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:58.370
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The love someone so much.</v>

3283
02:29:58.371 --> 02:30:02.720
<v Speaker 3>You want other people to fuck them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because how do I get on that list?</v>

3284
02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably already on there.</v>

3285
02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Just got to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose</v>

3286
02:30:07.930 --> 02:30:12.930
<v Speaker 5>the which comes back to the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is I think poison in life,</v>

3287
02:30:13.930 --> 02:30:18.670
<v Speaker 5>which is to live a dual life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Grieve a boring no risk,</v>

3288
02:30:18.671 --> 02:30:20.830
<v Speaker 5>10 or run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no thrills,</v>

3289
02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:22.930
<v Speaker 5>no challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no growth,</v>

3290
02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:24.670
<v Speaker 5>no knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no learning.</v>

3291
02:30:25.060 --> 02:30:30.060
<v Speaker 5>Just this stagnant bullshit life that is</v>
<v Speaker 5>so prevalent in our society.</v>

3292
02:30:31.061 --> 02:30:31.894
<v Speaker 5>I think it's one of the main problems </v>
<v Speaker 5>with our world is that we have set up </v>

3293
02:30:35.141 --> 02:30:39.970
<v Speaker 5>these really safe cities and safe </v>
<v Speaker 5>societies and cultures,</v>

3294
02:30:39.971 --> 02:30:41.200
<v Speaker 5>which is wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great,</v>

3295
02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:42.573
<v Speaker 5>but also we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We haven't given people the discipline </v>

3296
02:30:45.041 --> 02:30:50.041
<v Speaker 5>or the structure or the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The just the framework for living a life</v>

3297
02:30:52.661 --> 02:30:56.070
<v Speaker 5>that's going to satisfy your needs in </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of your biological needs.</v>

3298
02:30:56.360 --> 02:30:57.193
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psychological and people start </v>

3299
02:30:59.331 --> 02:31:04.220
<v Speaker 3>determining that totally inane things </v>
<v Speaker 3>are what their needs are.</v>

3300
02:31:04.690 --> 02:31:06.170
<v Speaker 3>They're difficult to acquire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3301
02:31:06.220 --> 02:31:09.200
<v Speaker 3>You think of Ferrari's going to make you</v>
<v Speaker 3>happy because a Ferrari is hard to get.</v>

3302
02:31:09.210 --> 02:31:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at it like how much do you cost?</v>

3303
02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:13.670
<v Speaker 3>If I just had that man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be bawling.</v>

3304
02:31:13.671 --> 02:31:15.010
<v Speaker 3>I'd be driving around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Rad.</v>

3305
02:31:16.140 --> 02:31:18.270
<v Speaker 3>I'd be bawling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you get that Ferrari.</v>

3306
02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:19.860
<v Speaker 3>You like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just a car.</v>

3307
02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3308
02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:24.300
<v Speaker 5>like unless you just really love cars </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you could love,</v>

3309
02:31:24.370 --> 02:31:25.203
<v Speaker 5>you know your firebird and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciate it from a mechanical </v>

3310
02:31:27.211 --> 02:31:28.770
<v Speaker 5>standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to step back and look at it.</v>

3311
02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:30.950
<v Speaker 5>It's enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you think that the fucking things</v>

3312
02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:32.700
<v Speaker 5>going to make you happy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're crazy.</v>

3313
02:31:33.320 --> 02:31:34.153
<v Speaker 2>B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then me being happy with who I am as a </v>

3314
02:31:37.101 --> 02:31:40.730
<v Speaker 2>person and the life that I'm living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the firebird can't do,</v>

3315
02:31:40.731 --> 02:31:42.560
<v Speaker 2>can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no item.</v>

3316
02:31:42.820 --> 02:31:43.653
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to sit back and all the time and </v>

3317
02:31:45.111 --> 02:31:46.970
<v Speaker 2>try to think for myself that</v>

3318
02:31:48.610 --> 02:31:50.120
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've,</v>

3319
02:31:50.250 --> 02:31:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love my library,</v>

3320
02:31:51.661 --> 02:31:54.780
<v Speaker 2>that I have all the books within it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the cars that I have.</v>

3321
02:31:54.781 --> 02:31:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I love the relationships that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead of the relationship,</v>

3322
02:31:58.831 --> 02:32:00.930
<v Speaker 2>but just the things and it's like these </v>
<v Speaker 2>are all great things,</v>

3323
02:32:02.690 --> 02:32:04.790
<v Speaker 2>but if I don't have them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still me.</v>

3324
02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:07.250
<v Speaker 2>I still have everything that I need in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this world.</v>

3325
02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to think about them being </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost,</v>

3326
02:32:12.110 --> 02:32:12.943
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly hit the idea of it being </v>

3327
02:32:13.761 --> 02:32:15.230
<v Speaker 2>destroyed because even if it wasn't in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my hands,</v>

3328
02:32:15.231 --> 02:32:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I'd like them to still exist for others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but without them.</v>

3329
02:32:19.550 --> 02:32:20.383
<v Speaker 2>I'm no different than who I am now and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess that's kind of a thinking of like </v>

3330
02:32:25.310 --> 02:32:26.150
<v Speaker 2>the Stoics,</v>

3331
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:27.503
<v Speaker 5>but you've been more defined by your </v>
<v Speaker 5>accomplishments in your thinking and </v>

3332
02:32:29.671 --> 02:32:32.090
<v Speaker 5>your philosophy and there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that people</v>

3333
02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:33.273
<v Speaker 2>obviously they couldn't know about me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not the kind of thing that </v>

3334
02:32:37.740 --> 02:32:41.320
<v Speaker 2>is just my who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3335
02:32:41.321 --> 02:32:44.830
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't need someone to know whether</v>

3336
02:32:44.831 --> 02:32:45.664
<v Speaker 2>or not I'm smart or whether or not I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know this or whether or not I can do </v>

3337
02:32:47.921 --> 02:32:48.754
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'll do it when I need to do </v>

3338
02:32:49.841 --> 02:32:50.674
<v Speaker 2>it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to try and look to see that I </v>

3339
02:32:53.291 --> 02:32:54.124
<v Speaker 2>have my own inner peace is based on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own self knowledge and knowledge also </v>

3340
02:32:57.550 --> 02:33:00.130
<v Speaker 2>that I am lacking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can be better,</v>

3341
02:33:00.370 --> 02:33:01.900
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I want to,</v>

3342
02:33:01.901 --> 02:33:03.580
<v Speaker 2>I can choose to in those days that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

3343
02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:04.893
<v Speaker 2>It was a choice not to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that I couldn't because even </v>

3344
02:33:07.391 --> 02:33:08.224
<v Speaker 2>going and failing like we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 2>before is a worthwhile endeavor because </v>

3345
02:33:11.201 --> 02:33:15.550
<v Speaker 2>it will move you towards either a </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually getting there or be that it's</v>

3346
02:33:15.551 --> 02:33:16.384
<v Speaker 2>not something that's going to be yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what it is and you know </v>

3347
02:33:18.581 --> 02:33:19.414
<v Speaker 2>what it takes to get there and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different perspective altogether and </v>

3348
02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:29.700
<v Speaker 2>that is where I feel like that's where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be okay in this world and deal in.</v>

3349
02:33:31.870 --> 02:33:32.703
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of things that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>draw your focus and really eat at you </v>

3350
02:33:36.611 --> 02:33:37.444
<v Speaker 2>and bother you and you're giving weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>to these things and allowing them to </v>

3351
02:33:39.911 --> 02:33:43.270
<v Speaker 2>have an effect on you and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural.</v>

3352
02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:46.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a normal thing and it's easy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall into,</v>

3353
02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:50.170
<v Speaker 2>but if you can be okay with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

3354
02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:53.800
<v Speaker 2>if all I'm left with is just me and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

3355
02:33:53.890 --> 02:33:55.950
<v Speaker 2>if I no longer have anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3356
02:33:55.980 --> 02:33:57.460
<v Speaker 2>no more luxuries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no more this,</v>

3357
02:33:57.461 --> 02:34:00.220
<v Speaker 2>no more that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you be okay with that?</v>

3358
02:34:00.330 --> 02:34:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what kind of life would you </v>
<v Speaker 2>make of this?</v>

3359
02:34:02.051 --> 02:34:04.720
<v Speaker 2>And I like to think the same one I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3360
02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:07.960
<v Speaker 2>You can pick me up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take all my shit away,</v>

3361
02:34:08.380 --> 02:34:11.410
<v Speaker 2>throw me some other part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the third world country,</v>

3362
02:34:12.490 --> 02:34:13.323
<v Speaker 2>and it will be jarring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be difficult and there will be </v>

3363
02:34:16.001 --> 02:34:20.170
<v Speaker 2>some lament of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will continue to be who I am.</v>

3364
02:34:20.171 --> 02:34:21.004
<v Speaker 2>I will see what is necessary to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with others and to continue </v>

3365
02:34:25.721 --> 02:34:29.920
<v Speaker 2>to propagate this that I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create in me.</v>

3366
02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:31.513
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're all trying to navigate </v>

3367
02:34:32.391 --> 02:34:36.230
<v Speaker 5>this really incredibly difficult thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is your just your life.</v>

3368
02:34:36.231 --> 02:34:38.070
<v Speaker 5>You're the emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3369
02:34:38.071 --> 02:34:38.671
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3370
02:34:38.671 --> 02:34:39.770
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your goals,</v>

3371
02:34:39.771 --> 02:34:41.750
<v Speaker 5>your tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your relationships,</v>

3372
02:34:41.751 --> 02:34:44.360
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your dreams and aspirations.</v>

3373
02:34:44.361 --> 02:34:45.194
<v Speaker 5>All these things are just so complicated</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the whole idea of not knowing what </v>

3374
02:34:50.211 --> 02:34:51.044
<v Speaker 5>the future holds is stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also incredibly rewarding when </v>

3375
02:34:54.621 --> 02:34:57.680
<v Speaker 5>things work out well and even when they </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't work out well.</v>

3376
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:58.783
<v Speaker 5>What's rewarding about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>As you get the gift of knowing that you </v>

3377
02:35:01.581 --> 02:35:06.581
<v Speaker 5>fucked up and you get the gift of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling of fucking up and the horrible,</v>

3378
02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:07.933
<v Speaker 5>just the feeling of failure and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand that that's fuel for you to </v>

3379
02:35:11.391 --> 02:35:12.224
<v Speaker 5>regroup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>repackage your fucking thoughts and and </v>

3380
02:35:14.751 --> 02:35:19.751
<v Speaker 5>now move forward with the knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the mistakes that you've made and you're</v>

3381
02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:20.813
<v Speaker 5>going to be a better person.</v>

3382
02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:23.600
<v Speaker 2>How can you fuck up if you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything?</v>

3383
02:35:23.601 --> 02:35:24.434
<v Speaker 2>If you don't ever do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't just sit back and you try to </v>

3384
02:35:27.201 --> 02:35:30.920
<v Speaker 2>lead the simplest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>safest version of a life.</v>

3385
02:35:30.921 --> 02:35:31.754
<v Speaker 2>It's not a life on the line and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>a life I can really imagine that anyone </v>

3386
02:35:34.581 --> 02:35:39.581
<v Speaker 2>can really be truly fulfilled living and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3387
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:43.280
<v Speaker 2>things are ultimately incredibly soft on</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

3388
02:35:43.281 --> 02:35:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have pressures in other ways,</v>

3389
02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:46.753
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately most of us are living </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite comfortable lives with no </v>

3390
02:35:52.371 --> 02:35:53.204
<v Speaker 2>immediate dangers and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no real impetus to put stress on </v>

3391
02:35:57.051 --> 02:36:00.350
<v Speaker 2>ourselves where it doesn't exist at </v>
<v Speaker 2>times because let's just say you want to</v>

3392
02:36:00.351 --> 02:36:03.770
<v Speaker 2>learn new language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's agitation in terms of,</v>

3393
02:36:03.860 --> 02:36:07.010
<v Speaker 2>of forcing you to have to endure </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3394
02:36:07.011 --> 02:36:09.550
<v Speaker 2>There's some suffering in that and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3395
02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the Nietzschean concept of </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering creates growth.</v>

3396
02:36:13.010 --> 02:36:14.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is suffering.</v>

3397
02:36:14.690 --> 02:36:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Suffering doesn't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic.</v>

3398
02:36:17.031 --> 02:36:22.031
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be this sort of thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is going to debilitate you,</v>

3399
02:36:22.460 --> 02:36:26.420
<v Speaker 2>but that suffering is needed for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to become better,</v>

3400
02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:27.240
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3401
02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:29.130
<v Speaker 5>Everything with exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with learning,</v>

3402
02:36:29.131 --> 02:36:31.050
<v Speaker 5>with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with even relationships,</v>

3403
02:36:31.051 --> 02:36:31.884
<v Speaker 5>learning in relationships that all those</v>
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable feelings are how you </v>

3404
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:36.480
<v Speaker 5>learn.</v>

3405
02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learning relationships.</v>

3406
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always said to two friends of mine,</v>

3407
02:36:40.910 --> 02:36:42.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time they have like a big blow</v>

3408
02:36:42.571 --> 02:36:45.540
<v Speaker 2>out with something called me up and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3409
02:36:45.541 --> 02:36:48.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and so said this and I don't know how</v>

3410
02:36:48.001 --> 02:36:49.970
<v Speaker 2>their Dick ended up there and all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3411
02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:52.650
<v Speaker 2>Look ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3412
02:36:52.651 --> 02:36:54.540
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to get into a row with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

3413
02:36:54.541 --> 02:36:56.220
<v Speaker 2>especially someone that you really care </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

3414
02:36:56.250 --> 02:36:59.370
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this is an important relationship,</v>

3415
02:36:59.371 --> 02:37:03.990
<v Speaker 2>the only way it becomes a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has that deeper lasting meaning and</v>

3416
02:37:03.991 --> 02:37:06.300
<v Speaker 2>that really has any real depth to it at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

3417
02:37:06.660 --> 02:37:07.493
<v Speaker 2>is what you do when you guys are faced </v>
<v Speaker 2>with adversity that shows you what </v>

3418
02:37:10.750 --> 02:37:13.470
<v Speaker 2>relationship you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when things are fun and easy,</v>

3419
02:37:13.740 --> 02:37:15.350
<v Speaker 2>anybody can be a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3420
02:37:15.380 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 2>We're all just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3421
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:19.220
<v Speaker 3>humping and drinking and going out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

3422
02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Fucking wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when someone good,</v>

3423
02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:25.160
<v Speaker 3>once it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not bad as a single guy,</v>

3424
02:37:25.161 --> 02:37:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly looking for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>

3425
02:37:27.170 --> 02:37:28.003
<v Speaker 3>But ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you live in a hump and drink and </v>

3426
02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:33.800
<v Speaker 3>drink and drink and hump mainly whiskey </v>
<v Speaker 3>in coffee,</v>

3427
02:37:33.801 --> 02:37:35.600
<v Speaker 3>but drinking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopping and muscle cars,</v>

3428
02:37:35.601 --> 02:37:37.060
<v Speaker 3>if you're into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3429
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:38.833
<v Speaker 3>but when you get into these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden adversity comes across </v>

3430
02:37:42.111 --> 02:37:45.110
<v Speaker 3>your doorstep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you'd handle that.</v>

3431
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:48.470
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're the person who brought it</v>

3432
02:37:48.471 --> 02:37:51.290
<v Speaker 3>or you're the person who's in enduring </v>
<v Speaker 3>it from the other side.</v>

3433
02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:52.633
<v Speaker 3>And if you haven't experienced that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life and also experience it in a </v>

<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

3436
02:37:57.231 --> 02:38:00.890

<v Speaker 3>You need to do.</v>

3437
02:38:00.891 --> 02:38:01.730
<v Speaker 3>That's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3438
02:38:01.731 --> 02:38:02.564
<v Speaker 3>It gives you the tools to navigate </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult situations and the other </v>

3439
02:38:04.431 --> 02:38:05.300
