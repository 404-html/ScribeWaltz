00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>how much you weigh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much water you're going to take.</v>

29
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:04.674
<v Speaker 1>And he's weighing things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took them an hour and a half to do </v>

30
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>the calculations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

37
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do this weight cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

38
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>And he's got it down to the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>like it's six days to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He think he was one 71 is that,</v>

40
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering what,</v>

41
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.003
<v Speaker 1>what did he start at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it one 71 so I think he's got to </v>

42
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:29.691
<v Speaker 1>lose 16 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy is when Max was on my show,</v>

43
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to him a little bit off it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is on record,</v>

44
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>on let's build anything that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

45
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:35.950
<v Speaker 1>but he just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the injury,</v>

47
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Jesus credit embedded I think is better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

48
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not UFC,</v>

49
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>the HBO ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been 24 seven how dare you,</v>

50
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better than only four seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's a big fight.</v>

51
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 1>watching the generals or blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

53
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.013
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in general they're better </v>

54
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>because they do more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a 24 seven they're good.</v>

55
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>

56
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Liev Schreiber.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Watch her words on that guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

61
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.623
<v Speaker 1>it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find this because there's almost no </v>

62
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>narration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

63
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost just,</v>

64
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>it tells a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Footage.</v>

65
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:16.374
<v Speaker 1>I want to see the footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have liked the video of when </v>

66
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>they called Max with the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause from what I heard,</v>

67
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:20.874
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be that stuff's getting the </v>

68
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

69
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>

70
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just insane.</v>

71
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

72
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>why don't they have a video of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no one knew.</v>

73
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>to to turn the video on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Max knew whether they were</v>

75
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>calling him amazing video of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if he wins.</v>

76
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>This is my thing with Max is I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>

77
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>was the toughest fight in the world on </v>
<v Speaker 1>six days notice.</v>

78
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.193
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather fight anybody else in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and could be one six days because </v>

79
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>this style in just his tenacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with Max win,</v>

80
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:50.604
<v Speaker 1>lose or draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens Saturday night if you </v>

81
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>don't respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like him even more after this,</v>

82
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>you're a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a champions on abroad and like</v>

83
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 3>Max Holloway's on that would be willing </v>
<v Speaker 3>to take this fight on six days notice.</v>

84
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 3>And also I should say coming off of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>broken foot.</v>

85
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.133
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he had a pull out of a fight with a </v>

86
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 3>broken foot with Frankie Edgar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's just happened?</v>

87
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how healed izzy and then like it said on</v>

88
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 3>my show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was saying,</v>

89
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing some Jujitsu,</v>

90
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:19.144
<v Speaker 3>been the swing of things for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good because I haven't been balls </v>

91
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.804
<v Speaker 3>deep into training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been just been a little just to </v>

92
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 3>know getting a light workout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it gives me time with my family.</v>

93
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.800
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which NGOs,</v>

94
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 3>you know this in camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're present but you're not,</v>

95
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 3>which is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

96
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going through it.</v>

97
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with my son in the family,</v>

98
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 3>but I'm thinking about something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

99
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 3>so this has been good for me to really </v>
<v Speaker 3>focus on my family.</v>

100
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 3>That was what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two weeks ago?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

102
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.703
<v Speaker 3>So then pay him you're fighting could be</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the reason why he wants to fight </v>

103
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:47.134
<v Speaker 3>Khabib is cause he thinks could be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>best pound for pound fighter in the </v>

104
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:50.134
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 3>That's how good he is.</v>

120
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 3>DC said he's the pound for pound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greatest fighter he's ever seen.</v>

121
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.483
<v Speaker 3>DC said that he had fights with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>like dcs was the heavyweights </v>

122
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 3>strikeforce champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

123
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.671
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

124
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 3>we got to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go to war war.</v>

125
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 3>Like imagine that DC's a willa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's jacked.</v>

126
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean DC's got some body fat on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's strong as a fucking ox.</v>

127
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:42.634
<v Speaker 3>You see soak at downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fun to watch when DC throws Josh </v>

128
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Barnett through the air when they fought</v>
<v Speaker 3>strikeforce,</v>

129
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 3>you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

130
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 3>when we need to handle fight was </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive.</v>

131
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 3>That goddamn American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was offensive.</v>

132
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.010
<v Speaker 3>He ragdolled Hendo and couldn't be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooler guy like the nicest guy ever.</v>

133
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 3>DC might be the nicest fighter of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

134
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:05.900
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite people here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max,</v>

135
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 3>they're up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love them from Isis fighters.</v>

136
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Max as well as I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

137
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.113
<v Speaker 3>Do you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've done so many shows with </v>

138
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:11.734
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for DC as good as he is to say that </v>

139
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 3>him and Khabib go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

140
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy to Josh Thompson is the cap</v>
<v Speaker 3>ne Kay said,</v>

141
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you know Ed Ruth Penn state and three </v>
<v Speaker 3>time national champion freak.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

144
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 3>I was in San Jose and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a show with him and I go,</v>

145
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:32.224
<v Speaker 3>what were you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

146
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.040
<v Speaker 3>I just came from practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be second class practice and go,</v>

147
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 3>what was he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

148
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just straight wrestling.</v>

149
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.751
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

150
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 3>who was your wrestling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was said,</v>

151
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:39.320
<v Speaker 3>Ruth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

152
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Penn state like legend.</v>

153
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:42.604
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>

154
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 3>how's that go down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

155
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 3>only one of them's gone down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it could be like,</v>

156
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 3>what ruth?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

157
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.621
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

158
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

159
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.390
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's just this legend of five.</v>

160
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 3>They skipped when they tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it scares me like Jesus.</v>

161
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we get to see it in action?</v>

162
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:01.754
<v Speaker 1>When you saw the Barboza fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's walking towards him like a Zombie </v>

163
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>gets a hold of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just rag dolls.</v>

164
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:07.874
<v Speaker 1>I'm just rag dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is what's great about this </v>

165
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.680
<v Speaker 1>fight and that's what makes our sport so</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialists.</v>

166
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm super bummed.</v>

167
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I've been in deep depression because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson fell out,</v>

168
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.933
<v Speaker 1>and we've talked about this off here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our sports so special because what </v>

169
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Max Holloway has the chance to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night,</v>

170
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>if he can beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he can somehow pull that out.</v>

171
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like in professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

172
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.170
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Lebron goes out,</v>

173
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>the team still goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever.</v>

174
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 1>If Tom Brady gets hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sucked,</v>

175
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>but they still play here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know man,</v>

176
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Max has a huge chance now are the odds </v>
<v Speaker 1>stacked against him?</v>

177
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Good God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they ever,</v>

178
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>there couldn't be a worst matchup for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

179
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the one Achilles heel if there is</v>

180
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>one for Khabib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who can strike going backwards.</v>

181
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Max Salaries Pretty fucking good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>going backwards.</v>

182
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

183
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was no controversy,</v>

184
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.660
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't like six day time period </v>
<v Speaker 1>for hand,</v>

185
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.780
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

186
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of cool.</v>

187
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been like,</v>

188
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 1>that was a nate when nate took on connor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the first,</v>

189
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:08.880
<v Speaker 1>here's the difference though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate's the bigger guy,</v>

190
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate's the bigger guy,</v>

191
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>the more seasoned guy there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for nate,</v>

192
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:13.761
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

193
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>it was short notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a rough matchup for connor.</v>

194
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Connor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be an underdog in that fight.</v>

195
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't find it at the same weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

196
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>So that makes a little more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But wait a minute.</v>

197
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>They do nate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nate fights at 55 uh,</v>

198
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>before that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting at 70,</v>

199
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:27.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

200
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:27.711
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

201
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:28.544
<v Speaker 1>He only fought three times at seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he saw that seventies the point he </v>

202
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>fired a college never fought at 70.</v>

203
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if con when Carter fought him at 70,</v>

204
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.680
<v Speaker 1>that was Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

205
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 70 pounder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

206
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nate,</v>

207
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>when he fought 70 it didn't go well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

208
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.080
<v Speaker 1>who did he fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought Rory Macdonald.</v>

209
00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>70 tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else did he fight?</v>

210
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 1>We will see if I had 70 his fights at 70</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think wasn't great at,</v>

211
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.753
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't lose all of them was in grade </v>

212
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't great at 70.</v>

213
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>

214
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:56.400
<v Speaker 1>he's the bigger man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

215
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.273
<v Speaker 1>he's a bigger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they agreed to fight at one 55 </v>

216
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.920
<v Speaker 1>and he would make the one 55 weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100% yes,</v>

217
00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:03.754
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was all this talk about him being </v>

218
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 1>so much bigger than conor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

219
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>he's bigger for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's taller,</v>

220
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.610
<v Speaker 1>he's taller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a major,</v>

221
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.483
<v Speaker 1>he's a bigger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's around heavier when he gets </v>

222
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:12.674
<v Speaker 1>heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they fight at 55 he makes that </v>

223
00:08:14.601 --> 00:08:15.020
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

224
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.853
<v Speaker 1>And Connor makes that weight tough too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both struggled to make one 55 it's </v>

225
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:24.350
<v Speaker 1>a much easier cut for counter at 55 it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the hardest cut.</v>

226
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.213
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between how he looks physically when he </v>

227
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 1>fought nate at one 70 and how he looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's,</v>

228
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 45 he was awful.</v>

229
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say he's on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donna can make one 45 nate could nav.</v>

230
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no show me could've made it.</v>

231
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:39.090
<v Speaker 1>We got his leg ultimate fighter when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was killed.</v>

232
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.950
<v Speaker 1>A leg off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to like real list.</v>

233
00:08:40.951 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>He's not making 40 was very thin during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate fighter days.</v>

234
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Remember we have to be a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

235
00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So you have to make weight basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>three times in a row.</v>

236
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think he filled in too.</v>

237
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was really young back then.</v>

238
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 1>100% but you have to maintain a lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

239
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the closest fight to it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that fight.</v>

240
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.970
<v Speaker 1>The same kind of balls that nate has is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

241
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Max,</v>

242
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.103
<v Speaker 1>the difference is that like Max has </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken on a guy that everybody's </v>

243
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:08.934
<v Speaker 1>avoiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's been able to solve the riddle </v>

244
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:12.114
<v Speaker 1>of Khabib.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's even ever even put them in </v>

245
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:14.660
<v Speaker 1>jeopardy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

246
00:09:14.661 --> 00:09:18.020
<v Speaker 1>he's like the Johnson hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that really wasn't in a while.</v>

247
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.863
<v Speaker 1>It was going a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about that the other </v>

248
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.753
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what was going on in that </v>

249
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 1>fight because that was a fight where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had the same issue,</v>

250
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Speaker 1>cutting weight that he did when he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull out of the Ferguson fight.</v>

251
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.830
<v Speaker 1>His body shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

252
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.003
<v Speaker 1>So who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had that same issue with the Michael </v>

253
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>j.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might've been severely compromised in</v>

254
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:33.530
<v Speaker 1>that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he beat the fuck out of.</v>

255
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.383
<v Speaker 1>Agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference between Mcgregor and </v>

256
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Dheas is the both keep it on the feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

257
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

258
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.730
<v Speaker 1>He has a phenomenal boxer comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal striker,</v>

259
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.713
<v Speaker 1>Max Holloway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal striker could be phenomenal </v>

260
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:45.500
<v Speaker 1>grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

261
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.260
<v Speaker 1>it's even more of a task because could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

262
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:49.720
<v Speaker 1>he was not going to sit there and strike</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

263
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 1>That's your one way to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

264
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm the best grappler on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

265
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 1>He'll entertain it for a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>

266
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:56.484
<v Speaker 1>if you want you down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's literally no one in the world </v>

267
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.890
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say one 55 to one 17 he's not going</v>

268
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>to take that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see,</v>

269
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.553
<v Speaker 1>I really want to see him in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight grappling competition here in </v>

270
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

271
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Hearing that about how amazing he is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the training room.</v>

272
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a guy like dc,</v>

273
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.191
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

274
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:15.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Fitch,</v>

275
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're talking about in the hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pioneers of the sport animals.</v>

276
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to see him against Woodley 70 I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think 70 is his natural weight class.</v>

277
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he'd probably be a lot </v>

278
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 1>healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that.</v>

279
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Imagine being stronger and healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It Woodley and Khabib.</v>

280
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Jesus what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Woodley's at different thing man,</v>

281
00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you miss you,</v>

282
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:33.554
<v Speaker 1>you fuck up and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you leave yourself in a position to get </v>

283
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 1>hit with one of those nuclear bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh knock you out.</v>

284
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Woodley could put people to sleep and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can grab was acid rap his ass off,</v>

285
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.580
<v Speaker 1>hard to take down and puts people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep with one shot.</v>

286
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he gets his due.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the best evidence is the two</v>

287
00:10:49.051 --> 00:10:49.884
<v Speaker 1>fights that people point to where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that like Woodley should have done </v>

288
00:10:52.771 --> 00:10:54.510
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the Thompson fights.</v>

289
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.660
<v Speaker 1>The end of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the my fight.</v>

290
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.320
<v Speaker 1>But Maya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never got hurt.</v>

291
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.303
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit my a bunch of times but it was </v>

292
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:02.580
<v Speaker 1>uneventful cause he was hurt.</v>

293
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Woodley was her early in the first round</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the shoulder.</v>

294
00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:06.680
<v Speaker 1>He fucked his shoulder up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But honestly,</v>

295
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.170
<v Speaker 1>my the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should fight my,</v>

296
00:11:08.171 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to go to the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>100% but my point is in those two fights</v>

297
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 1>with Thompson Woodley was the one who </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt Thompson.</v>

298
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 1>He hurt him that bad in both fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost stopped him in both fights.</v>

299
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see them ever of again,</v>

300
00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:23.860
<v Speaker 1>but I hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great fight hard path.</v>

301
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 1>It was a crazy UFC 200 card and that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

302
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

303
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:32.130
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the dough as a main event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

304
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like twice.</v>

305
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.551
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

306
00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

307
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.120
<v Speaker 1>that's a super complicated equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Upset,</v>

308
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.730
<v Speaker 1>upset though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not good dance and the same</v>

309
00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they just said no,</v>

310
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:45.380
<v Speaker 1>this time it's going to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to war.</v>

311
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.140
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

312
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.540
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then two rounds and you like bastard</v>

313
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.330
<v Speaker 1>is circling each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like Dana on Ferguson and Khabib.</v>

314
00:11:54.331 --> 00:11:55.164
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fights never happened to a fifth </v>

315
00:11:56.321 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>time not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

316
00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

317
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a bummer though.</v>

318
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.313
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk business like I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>how many paper views this was going to </v>

319
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:07.210
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the hardcore fans,</v>

320
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:08.044
<v Speaker 1>this was a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a big one because this is the </v>

321
00:12:10.091 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>first time Khabib is finding a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's super versatile.</v>

322
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 1>They can fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standing up,</v>

323
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:14.944
<v Speaker 1>can knock you out with one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough is fuck has incredible endurance </v>

324
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:21.330
<v Speaker 1>and can grab off his back and the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous guy could be will ever face.</v>

325
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Ferguson has the perfect style to </v>

326
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 1>test what was so we could really find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out where could bebes Zach cause we know</v>

327
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 1>we're Tony's at we and we kind of know </v>
<v Speaker 1>where could bebes at do we?</v>

328
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:33.363
<v Speaker 1>We kind of do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We said the Barboza fight in my opinion </v>

329
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 1>was the best example of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dos Santos.</v>

330
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles was great.</v>

331
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 1>It's old school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dos Anjos.</v>

332
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.413
<v Speaker 1>That's a dose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles also compromise to make one 55 </v>

333
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:45.170
<v Speaker 1>right dose Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wants 70 different animal.</v>

334
00:12:45.171 --> 00:12:46.004
<v Speaker 1>That's a different fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally different piece and </v>

335
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:49.114
<v Speaker 1>that I think dos Anjos is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys where you point to a perfect </v>

336
00:12:52.421 --> 00:12:53.254
<v Speaker 1>example of a guy whose body just was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing him to compete at one 55 </v>

337
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.513
<v Speaker 1>agrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an,</v>

338
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.770
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking animal in his mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

339
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 1>no one works harder than that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that guy trained,</v>

340
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:04.283
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have you seen in person [inaudible] </v>

342
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.840

<v Speaker 1>Covington in Brazil and Brazil.</v>

375
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.920

<v Speaker 1>won't work with just tenure either,</v>

376
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:26.763
<v Speaker 1>which is what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like what he did with bisping help </v>

377
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:30.570
<v Speaker 1>bisbing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We became world champion.</v>

378
00:14:30.571 --> 00:14:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

379
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.060
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking great coat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back to Khabib.</v>

380
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:34.923
<v Speaker 1>You know who I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not just saying this because </v>

381
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.713
<v Speaker 1>he's my boy of known for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you knew who I think could be his </v>

382
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:40.234
<v Speaker 1>Achilles heel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who matches up better with them than </v>

383
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:43.710
<v Speaker 1>anyone who everyone's overlooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Ortega.</v>

384
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

385
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:46.743
<v Speaker 1>Brian would take is a big dude at 55 </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy weight cut for him and put him on </v>

386
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>the ground on the ground.</v>

387
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.480
<v Speaker 1>He's the most dangerous guy in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

388
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so too.</v>

389
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I think the way he locks up submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very different.</v>

390
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.603
<v Speaker 1>It's like if everybody else is hitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it at a seven or an eight or take his </v>

391
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 1>hit into that 10 where you watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

392
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.823
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different and you haven't seen </v>

393
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:06.610
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be who he's,</v>

394
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 1>how he's grappled fricking grizzly bears</v>
<v Speaker 1>since he was four.</v>

395
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.950
<v Speaker 1>He and he seen Sabo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seen black belt in Jujitsu.</v>

396
00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:15.420
<v Speaker 1>He's seen all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to catch them with oric</v>

397
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.263
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little different and he actually </v>

398
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 1>encourages you to go to the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

399
00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.350
<v Speaker 1>he's dangerous on his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the grounds where he thrives.</v>

400
00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny how that thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to the ground?</v>

401
00:15:23.651 --> 00:15:26.180
<v Speaker 1>What does a bride says?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our tag or wrote for the record,</v>

402
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Dana called me yesterday to see if I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>stepping against Khabib since Max hadn't</v>

403
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 1>responded yet.</v>

404
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually Max replied and gay.</v>

405
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Dana gave him the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If all goes according to plan,</v>

406
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll get my turn at both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

407
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.383
<v Speaker 1>it's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

408
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just stylistically I went,</v>

409
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I'm could be,</v>

410
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 1>could be goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would I fight?</v>

411
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:43.814
<v Speaker 1>Our tell was phenomenal fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have a belt in a big name </v>

412
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.110
<v Speaker 1>and it's the most dangerous site for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

413
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

414
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.243
<v Speaker 1>it's also mean or tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became a much bigger star with the </v>

415
00:15:52.221 --> 00:15:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Frankie Edgar knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much bigger star,</v>

416
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's a ways to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

417
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Max Holloway is one of the best fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>

418
00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 1>That's a really interesting fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tor or take has got,</v>

419
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.450
<v Speaker 1>there's something about his Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

420
00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:06.284
<v Speaker 1>it's on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just ramped up and sharpened down to </v>

421
00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Speaker 1>like such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a razor's edge man.</v>

422
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.370
<v Speaker 1>When he grabs a hold of stuff you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have very little room to get out,</v>

423
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:17.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he sets it up from the clinch and </v>

424
00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:19.994
<v Speaker 1>it's a very unconventional and the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>snap switch like Tony Ferguson and the </v>

425
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:23.930
<v Speaker 1>dark jokes where he does he know snap </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

426
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.123
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why I wanted to see in this ferguson </v>

427
00:16:27.831 --> 00:16:31.480
<v Speaker 1>could be fight with the snap city is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Josh Thomson Fitch or like,</v>

428
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.353
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've never seen could be because his </v>

429
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:36.410
<v Speaker 1>neck snapped down ever that it's for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

430
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a pride thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grown up where he grew up there.</v>

431
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.910
<v Speaker 1>No one snaps his neck down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd known snapping them down.</v>

432
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.940
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's Tony Steam.</v>

433
00:16:44.941 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 1>They go watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

434
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.090
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever snap at his neck down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avar wow.</v>

435
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

436
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like nursing him lose around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why,</v>

437

<v Speaker 1>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These goddamn legends,</v>

442
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by this fight.</v>

443
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:09.853
<v Speaker 1>I'm always fascinated when could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights because you're always wondering </v>

444
00:17:11.871 --> 00:17:12.704
<v Speaker 1>like what's the first guy that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to give him something </v>

445
00:17:14.961 --> 00:17:15.470
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>

446
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.550
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at it different.</v>

447
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

448
00:17:17.931 --> 00:17:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I hear all this crazy talk about could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

449
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.840
<v Speaker 1>let's see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wanna see,</v>

450
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I wanna see that pound for pound </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatness out of them.</v>

451
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.473
<v Speaker 1>Let me get it when you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you saw it in the Barboza </v>

452
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 1>fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

453
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I think Barboza is one dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

454
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we did see,</v>

455
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.660
<v Speaker 1>and I think people are taken for granted</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good could be both a grappler is,</v>

456
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:38.120
<v Speaker 1>cause you talked to Frankie talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alvarez.</v>

457
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.043
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard is it take down Barboza they </v>

458
00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:40.850
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

459
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 1>it's damn near impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Training.</v>

460
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't get them down very easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're bad asses.</v>

461
00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'll,</v>

462
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 1>what could be did we didn't think he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna be able to do.</v>

463
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at that third round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barboza is like,</v>

464
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.300
<v Speaker 1>he gets taken down and he's like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cage crawling.</v>

465
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.133
<v Speaker 1>You look at his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks like get me the fuck out of </v>

466
00:17:58.291 --> 00:17:59.124
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's sheer panic and that's the </v>

467
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 1>difference drink could be and the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these fighters,</v>

468
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.293
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's the worst of fight them </v>
<v Speaker 1>on short notice because it's not going </v>

469
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:06.830
<v Speaker 1>to be fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

470
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be fun for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a smashing it.</v>

471
00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen the pound for pound greatness</v>

472
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:14.910
<v Speaker 1>in him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the potential for it,</v>

473
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.830
<v Speaker 1>but we need to see him against pound for</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound greats.</v>

474
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Well that's how you get get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to show up Connor Aldo.</v>

475
00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

476
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.933
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That quick knockout or DC Gustin Jon </v>

477
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:27.451
<v Speaker 1>Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>DC,</v>

478
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:28.284
<v Speaker 1>like there are certain times in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>career where you have the signature </v>

479
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:32.100
<v Speaker 1>wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a signature win.</v>

480
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

481
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I think the Barboza is as close as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get.</v>

482
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.220
<v Speaker 1>But Barbara was his lost to a few guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost it.</v>

483
00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got darks,</v>

484
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:40.050
<v Speaker 1>choked and plus cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

485
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's also very one dimensional.</v>

486
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phenomenal on the ground.</v>

487
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>He's a good anti wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His strikings phenomenal,</v>

488
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>but overall package and that that is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>

489
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:52.584
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the really good guys always </v>

490
00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:55.980
<v Speaker 1>threatened takedowns always threatened </v>
<v Speaker 1>submissions.</v>

491
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.460

<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

492
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.800
<v Speaker 1>he stands up and he's a specialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup,</v>

493
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.673

<v Speaker 1>got some of the best stand up in the </v>

00:22:08.801 --> 00:22:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even say that because teaching</v>

580
00:22:11.181 --> 00:22:13.790
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not be able to go if you,</v>

581
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.093
<v Speaker 1>Matt Hume and mighty mouse are about as </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart as it gets when it comes to </v>

582
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:19.234
<v Speaker 1>preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's no way they would take that </v>

583
00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:21.664
<v Speaker 1>fight of his shoulder wasn't 100% any </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and risk his legacy because he </v>

584
00:22:24.461 --> 00:22:25.294
<v Speaker 1>loses that fight and was like told Ya </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they wouldn't go hard early to test </v>

585
00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:29.860
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would let it.</v>

586
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.233
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at what Whitley's been out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit because of his shoulder he </v>

587
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:35.620
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

588
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 1>he was in here like right after he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

589
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 1>He said he's going to heal up quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

590
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 1>and he might prp all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

591
00:22:42.701 --> 00:22:43.534
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do all the PRP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this as much different </v>

592
00:22:47.321 --> 00:22:48.100
<v Speaker 1>therapies.</v>

593
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Cryo I'm sure it was probably still </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a while even with all our advanced</v>

594
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:53.440
<v Speaker 1>stem cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not now.</v>

595
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:54.274
<v Speaker 1>He's forced to fight and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what the UFC is doing where they </v>

596
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:57.394
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interim Belt tween Colbian dos Anjos </v>

597
00:22:59.201 --> 00:23:00.270
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

598
00:23:00.271 --> 00:23:02.680
<v Speaker 1>it's an interim belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now woodley,</v>

599
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.370
<v Speaker 1>you literally have to fight the winner </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this jam.</v>

600
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Have to fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very sneaky,</v>

601
00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Speaker 1>may have a belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>

602
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.310
<v Speaker 1>You want a super fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

603
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get both sides here.</v>

604
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 1>If it stills Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles Beats Colby dos,</v>

605
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweight champion,</v>

606
00:23:17.081 --> 00:23:19.260
<v Speaker 1>now welterweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to me it takes me,</v>

607
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.630
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

608
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 1>You can have dos Anjos sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 1>with two belts on shoulders.</v>

609
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.723
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what do you do with Dan until </v>

610
00:23:25.811 --> 00:23:27.340
<v Speaker 1>let's say he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

611
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>walks through wonderboy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

612
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough to do but say walks through it,</v>

613
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:32.650
<v Speaker 1>which would lead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

614
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.710
<v Speaker 1>struggled a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walks through him and one of boys,</v>

615
00:23:35.711 --> 00:23:36.544
<v Speaker 1>the number one guy now dead until jumps </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to number one or is dose antral work </v>

616
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 1>that way?</v>

617
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Because the ratings are fucking screwy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

618
00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.253
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I see a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy and then that guy who he beat is </v>

619
00:23:47.841 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 1>still ranked ahead of him there a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare.</v>

620
00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.280
<v Speaker 1>All they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the writings do now.</v>

621
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.610
<v Speaker 1>It almost hurts if you're a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sean shelby or Dana trying to make these</v>

622
00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:57.830
<v Speaker 1>matchups cause guy who's at fourth year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

623
00:23:57.831 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 1>wanting to fight 70 he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

624
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:00.650
<v Speaker 1>he's seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing to gain from that.</v>

625
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Where before it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

626
00:24:02.051 --> 00:24:04.070
<v Speaker 1>we want you to fight this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a name,</v>

627
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:05.450
<v Speaker 1>he's on some fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>win streak.</v>

628
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what ranking is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know he's damn good.</v>

629
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.970
<v Speaker 1>So you guys were more willing to take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they,</v>

630
00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's seven.</v>

631
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:12.740
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a number one.</v>

632
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need three four you know?</v>

633
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

634
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.533
<v Speaker 1>It hurts us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also weird like the UFC could just </v>

635
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 1>did they just decide who's fighting.</v>

636
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.633
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The business is so interesting because </v>

637
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:28.580
<v Speaker 1>it's like they decide who's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decide who's champion.</v>

638
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:29.480
<v Speaker 1>They decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>

639
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 1>you're not champion anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to strip yet.</v>

640
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fell.</v>

641
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox Studios,</v>

642
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I just do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I twist my knee,</v>

643
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 1>but he was working for the UFC when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell.</v>

644
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's doing his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his obligations,</v>

645
00:24:44.841 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 1>his press obligated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange to strip him of a belt</v>

646
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:48.584
<v Speaker 1>when he never lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's the longest winning streak </v>

647
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.103
<v Speaker 1>and then and mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also you have no belt can because </v>

648
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.740
<v Speaker 1>there's no belt can be what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the belt.</v>

649
00:24:57.741 --> 00:24:58.574
<v Speaker 1>They're going to make up a belt and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm or has the belt at 55 so what do </v>

650
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:02.210
<v Speaker 1>you do with that belt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

651
00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:04.250
<v Speaker 1>what they're planning on doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

652
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.830
<v Speaker 1>and now they've kind of let the cat out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bag cause they said it's going to</v>

653
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:08.030
<v Speaker 1>be for the world lightweight title.</v>

654
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.660
<v Speaker 1>They were going to strip connor the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment something happened,</v>

655
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.733
<v Speaker 1>like the moment the fight started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when they were gonna Strip </v>

656
00:25:14.661 --> 00:25:15.494
<v Speaker 1>connor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if they'd stripped him </v>

657
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:18.104
<v Speaker 1>beforehand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what happens if Tony doesn't make </v>

658
00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:23.880
<v Speaker 1>weight or something totally mixed out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>

659
00:25:23.881 --> 00:25:25.280
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what the fuck?</v>

660
00:25:25.281 --> 00:25:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a concern then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

661
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean you already stripped him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to give it back to him.</v>

662
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.380
<v Speaker 1>You gotta give it back to them now if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

663
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.630
<v Speaker 1>so if he wants to fight again now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not the champion anymore.</v>

664
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.380
<v Speaker 1>The fuck kind of Shit is strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they waited and the idea was to wait,</v>

665
00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:38.360
<v Speaker 1>but now they're in a desperado </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

666
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Strange Rato belt on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll yet fucking April fool's.</v>

00:31:12.281 --> 00:31:13.450
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>

811
00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:14.284
<v Speaker 1>Max says opportunity that no one else in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in sports can have and then </v>

812
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then look at Canelo triple g in,</v>

813
00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.450
<v Speaker 1>in combat sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we deal with.</v>

814
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canela it's a biggest fight of the year.</v>

815
00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:25.413
<v Speaker 1>Biggest fight ever wants to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rematch of the year and then tainted </v>

816
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:30.340
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you buy the tainted me?</v>

<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

818
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.300
<v Speaker 1>I've had many Tacos in Mexico and I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>not swole.</v>

819
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not getting tested for trace </v>

820
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:38.950
<v Speaker 1>amounts of clenbuterol you don't know.</v>

821
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:42.603
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I have to go and Snitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to my house just for the fuck of </v>

822
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:45.190

<v Speaker 1>And just to dream.</v>

823
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm still in the testing protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

824
00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:48.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

825
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:48.761
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

826
00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would see some sort of change.</v>

827
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even triple g's camp goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you,</v>

830
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.510
<v Speaker 1>why do you think they said that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

831
00:31:58.511 --> 00:31:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

832
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.393
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure Gonad he's been in there with </v>

<v Speaker 1>Over full 500 people now.</v>

834
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:04.504
<v Speaker 1>400 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just said in his experience he </v>

835
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:10.330
<v Speaker 1>can tell who's on pds and who's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he thought Canelo was,</v>

836
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.720
<v Speaker 1>do you buy that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do cause that a fighter as a fighter.</v>

837
00:32:16.721 --> 00:32:18.940
<v Speaker 1>This guys I fought who I assumed were </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

838
00:32:18.941 --> 00:32:20.890
<v Speaker 1>but what about Woodlin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy like Woodley,</v>

839
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:23.590
<v Speaker 1>he has tremendous genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always been like that.</v>

840
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Always been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so it was canela no,</v>

841
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:27.700
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at it.</v>

842
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:30.010
<v Speaker 1>He's gotten pretty swollen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's getting older though.</v>

843
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.260
<v Speaker 1>So it could be that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just as you get older you,</v>

844
00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:34.840
<v Speaker 1>but I'm more size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the big one was manny.</v>

845
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Manny was the one that everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 1>always accusing.</v>

846
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was the first,</v>

847
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean manny went up eight weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes and kept his knockout piece,</v>

848
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.440
<v Speaker 1>fighting as a little boy and then just </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like crazy.</v>

849
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kept the knockout power.</v>

850
00:32:47.271 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people thought that man,</v>

851
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 1>he was on ped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

852
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.493
<v Speaker 1>And then they thought that man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got off pds when he fought Juan </v>

853
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Manuel Marquez and he got starched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.980
<v Speaker 1>there's two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two side of the story there.</v>

855
00:32:57.981 --> 00:33:00.680

<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

856
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 1>So he stopped going to the Strip clubs.</v>

857
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.553
<v Speaker 1>He stopped hanging out with girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he stopped having fun and then got </v>

00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:08.600
<v Speaker 1>serious about Jesus and got knocked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Thai coach himself.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

1081
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.920
<v Speaker 1>he had a issue and he told me this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that fixed him.</v>

1082
00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Speaker 1>You take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hold it out like this right in front</v>

1083
00:41:06.281 --> 00:41:06.860
<v Speaker 1>of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1084
00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Then you twist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the arm that's injured,</v>

1085
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:09.963
<v Speaker 1>the bottom arm.</v>

1086
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.320
<v Speaker 1>So you hold out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you twist it,</v>

1087
00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:12.154
<v Speaker 1>what the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you hold it straight and then </v>

1088
00:41:13.661 --> 00:41:14.494
<v Speaker 1>you let it untwist with this arm slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been doing this shit all the </v>

1089
00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:19.210
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it in my car,</v>

1090
00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.253
<v Speaker 1>I take it with me at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm twisting the shit out of it and </v>

1091
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:27.440
<v Speaker 1>then slowly untwisting it with my right </v>
<v Speaker 1>side to helping out too.</v>

1092
00:41:27.441 --> 00:41:28.274
<v Speaker 1>And it makes a big impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes a big impact because it's </v>

1093
00:41:30.731 --> 00:41:33.590
<v Speaker 1>strengthening it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthening this,</v>

1094
00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 1>this little particular area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also getting a ton of blow.</v>

1095
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.483
<v Speaker 1>You hold it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like palm palm out and then twist it </v>

1096
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.343
<v Speaker 1>right and now straightened out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now unwind it with this hand with the </v>

1097
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 1>injured hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1098
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:48.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just do that slow and I'll do </v>

1099
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:50.924
<v Speaker 1>that for like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes of time and then I'll leave </v>

1100
00:41:53.241 --> 00:41:53.780
<v Speaker 1>it alone.</v>

1101

<v Speaker 1>Game come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>game changer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously I've had a lot of other</v>

1103
00:41:59.691 --> 00:42:03.300
<v Speaker 1>shit done to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Regena keen was like uh,</v>

1104
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 1>might help a month or so ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it helped,</v>

1105
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:06.104
<v Speaker 1>but that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This once I started doing it almost </v>

1106
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:13.460
<v Speaker 1>immediately within a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're feeling better basics then?</v>

1107
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:14.810

1108
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:17.480

<v Speaker 1>Like I can't do chin ups right now.</v>

1109
00:42:17.481 --> 00:42:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Have been able to do chin ups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do rows,</v>

1110
00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:22.940

<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

1111
00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Like everything has to be all about </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserving this little ligament.</v>

1112
00:42:28.431 --> 00:42:30.020
<v Speaker 1>And your trader knows that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:35.120
<v Speaker 1>usually know how to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even here,</v>

1116
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.013
<v Speaker 1>like when I'm training here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't do it with so much shit I can </v>

1117
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:39.350
<v Speaker 1>do and can't do anything on the rings.</v>

<v Speaker 1>weeks of using this fucking thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Or when if I might get an sleep,</v>

1156
00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:59.630
<v Speaker 1>my buddy crave sugar and carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always say,</v>

1157
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:00.800
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>

1158
00:44:00.801 --> 00:44:03.200
<v Speaker 1>and then one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't stop myself.</v>

1159
00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.910
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then last night,</v>

1160
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.750
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1161
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.260
<v Speaker 1>my son this pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course I have to try it.</v>

1162
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna make sure it's not poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tried it.</v>

1163
00:44:10.161 --> 00:44:10.994
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking way better than my meal </v>

1164
00:44:12.711 --> 00:44:15.490
<v Speaker 1>that they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just fired up some Tortellini.</v>

1165
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.433
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also hard when you work hard </v>

1166
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 1>because I wore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of things.</v>

1167
00:44:21.591 --> 00:44:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm always busy and it's like sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it just want to go off with food.</v>

1168
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:26.534
<v Speaker 1>Like that's my indulgence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one thing that I can get </v>

1169
00:44:28.221 --> 00:44:29.054
<v Speaker 1>loose on men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time I'm very strict </v>

1170
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.920
<v Speaker 1>most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's been hard with this injury,</v>

1171
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 1>it's just because I thought it was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be healed by now,</v>

1172
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:38.970
<v Speaker 1>so it's been frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shit out of me.</v>

1173
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.073
<v Speaker 1>There's certain things I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was on this heavy chin up kick </v>

1174
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:44.573
<v Speaker 1>and heavy cleans and presses kick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably where I want to do this </v>

1175
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.223
<v Speaker 1>because I felt some twinges instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just working on it and like letting it </v>

1176
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:55.860
<v Speaker 1>heal up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push through it for months.</v>

1177
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:59.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the athlete in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idiot in me for months.</v>

1178
00:44:59.311 --> 00:45:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I pushed her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how it works.</v>

1179
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:02.034
<v Speaker 1>When you're an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure when you're doing taekwondo or </v>

1180
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get hurt.</v>

1181
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:05.371
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1182
00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:07.980
<v Speaker 1>let me take months off to make this bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's none of that.</v>

1183
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1184
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:09.733
<v Speaker 1>and that's what Eddie said about Tony is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it like Tony when he gets hurt and he's </v>

1185
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:14.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I'm hurt just works around it.</v>

1186
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't stop working out ever,</v>

1187
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.390
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.400
<v Speaker 1>But this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an eyeopener for me.</v>

1189
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:23.400
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this theraband thing is like always keep</v>

1190
00:45:23.401 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 1>searching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1191
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:25.104
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another thing I have is this other </v>

1192
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:28.980
<v Speaker 1>thing that I put my fingers in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber thing and I expand my fingers,</v>

1193
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very difficult to expand.</v>

1194
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to contract.</v>

1195
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:33.594
<v Speaker 1>You're always doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how much strength do you have this </v>

1196
00:45:34.621 --> 00:45:34.800
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>

1197
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Very little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of shine.</v>

1198
00:45:36.291 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

1199
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

1200
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.610
<v Speaker 1>But this rubber thing is really good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I read,</v>

1201
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it was jim still panty who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilder guy online.</v>

1202
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:47.280

<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's also super,</v>

1204
00:45:48.751 --> 00:45:50.870
<v Speaker 1>super smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated guy and he,</v>

1205
00:45:50.871 --> 00:45:53.160
<v Speaker 1>he was recommending that for people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendonitis.</v>

1206
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:56.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do with bands.</v>

1207
00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:57.803
<v Speaker 1>And this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the strongest ones they have to </v>

1208
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.320
<v Speaker 1>shaking like a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you rubber Dick?</v>

1209

<v Speaker 1>physio therapy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>before he injected yourself with all </v>

1211
00:46:07.951 --> 00:46:08.784
<v Speaker 1>these needles and stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They let me do my thing.</v>

1407
00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.200
<v Speaker 3>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

1408
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.240
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of teleprompter and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1409
00:53:56.241 --> 00:53:57.500
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really not my thing yet.</v>

1410
00:53:57.501 --> 00:53:59.360
<v Speaker 3>Let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they listen to me.</v>

1411
00:53:59.361 --> 00:54:01.070
<v Speaker 3>That's the great thing about showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They listened to me,</v>

1412
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.390
<v Speaker 3>but the fans like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1413
00:54:02.391 --> 00:54:05.580
<v Speaker 3>this isn't why we listened to Brendan to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be another fricking sports show.</v>

1414
00:54:05.581 --> 00:54:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Like you gotta let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then literally they all were like,</v>

1415
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:09.141
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here you go,</v>

1416
00:54:09.141 --> 00:54:10.370
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's your point.</v>

1417
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Do what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1418
00:54:11.301 --> 00:54:12.134
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then they edit it so I don't get in </v>

1419
00:54:13.581 --> 00:54:16.100
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1420
00:54:16.101 --> 00:54:21.101
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why they're showtime and um,</v>

1421
00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.513
<v Speaker 3>what I do,</v>

1422
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 1>well that means this were we we talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the other day with Eve Edwards.</v>

1423
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.200
<v Speaker 1>He was in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

1424
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.153
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was saying when you talk as much </v>

1425
00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.420
<v Speaker 1>as we talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we bought,</v>

1426
00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I talked too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk too much.</v>

1427
00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:36.060
<v Speaker 1>We talked too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1428
00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:38.610
<v Speaker 1>When you talk too much shit comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mouth.</v>

1429
00:54:38.611 --> 00:54:39.444
<v Speaker 1>You guys step in some shit and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're scrambling and trying to like </v>

1430
00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 1>make it</v>

1431
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.243
<v Speaker 3>since Joe [inaudible] I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't listen to the podcast with </v>

1432
00:54:47.951 --> 00:54:49.150
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like these,</v>

1433
00:54:49.151 --> 00:54:49.984
<v Speaker 3>we don't know each other that well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that bothers me about this is </v>

1434
00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:53.763
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even tell you the point I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make as soon as I give us $1 </v>

1435
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:58.503
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell us the point you're trying to make </v>

1436
00:54:59.111 --> 00:55:00.220
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>

1437
00:55:00.221 --> 00:55:01.054
<v Speaker 3>I remember had Kevin Leon and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember before that I was 20 minutes </v>

1438
00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:05.134
<v Speaker 3>deep and explain why think dc the </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest of all time as a beside you as </v>

1439
00:55:08.951 --> 00:55:10.750
<v Speaker 3>a commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is the future of the sport?</v>

1440
00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:11.913
<v Speaker 3>And then before that show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and Brian were talking about </v>

1441
00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:15.124
<v Speaker 3>something with race and men and women </v>
<v Speaker 3>and somehow that entered my brain and I </v>

1442
00:55:20.411 --> 00:55:22.840
<v Speaker 3>have no animosity toward it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does make sense.</v>

1443
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I have no animosity towards UFC tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two of my favorite shows.</v>

1444
00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:28.300
<v Speaker 3>I've worked with Karen Bryant for over </v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years.</v>

1445
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.150
<v Speaker 3>She's a good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woodley DC,</v>

1446
00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Kenny Florence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good friend.</v>

1447
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Bisping's a good buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1448
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:35.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ease.</v>

1449
00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.870
<v Speaker 3>I work with the team on UFC light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love those guys.</v>

1450
00:55:37.871 --> 00:55:40.540
<v Speaker 3>I just had Jimmy Smith in and on my show</v>
<v Speaker 3>who works,</v>

1451
00:55:40.541 --> 00:55:41.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it does,</v>

1452
00:55:41.621 --> 00:55:42.454
<v Speaker 3>it makes zero sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was in Saint Louis and I </v>

1453
00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:47.800
<v Speaker 3>started to get texts from so involved in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that show.</v>

1454
00:55:47.801 --> 00:55:49.450
<v Speaker 3>I won't say their name and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1455
00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:51.280
<v Speaker 3>some people are upset here about what he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>

1456
00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:51.911
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1457
00:55:51.911 --> 00:55:53.230
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can even tell you what I said.</v>

1458
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:56.050
<v Speaker 3>And he tells me like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Chin goes,</v>

1459
00:55:56.051 --> 00:55:56.884
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing online about some of the </v>

1460
00:55:57.671 --> 00:55:59.830
<v Speaker 3>stuff you should I edit it out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1461
00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:01.450
<v Speaker 3>we never do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't edit.</v>

1462
00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Let me deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see what I say.</v>

1463
00:56:03.191 --> 00:56:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Cause that makes me look even worse.</v>

1464
00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:05.163
<v Speaker 3>If you cut it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like I was saying something </v>

1465
00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.710
<v Speaker 3>that I wasn't meant to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1466
00:56:08.711 --> 00:56:09.544
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eve's was upset and then me and eve's </v>

1467
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:13.420
<v Speaker 3>texts back and forth again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know him.</v>

1468
00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Brian works with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit uncertain stuff for help or</v>

1469
00:56:16.151 --> 00:56:18.520
<v Speaker 3>something like that for shows where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've tried to do,</v>

1470
00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.310
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone should talk to Brian,</v>

1471
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:21.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're friends with them.</v>

1472
00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:22.860
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1473
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:27.550
<v Speaker 3>I sent you a text says number from Brian</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought it was over squashed.</v>

1474
00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.480
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1475
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:29.314
<v Speaker 3>I was doing pr for my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>below the belt show in New York and </v>

1476
00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 3>someone brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1477
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:33.790
<v Speaker 3>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1478
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 3>I went and I met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no offense,</v>

1479
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:37.870
<v Speaker 3>I come up with about 10 hours of content</v>
<v Speaker 3>a week.</v>

1480
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:40.090
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I messed up.</v>

1481
00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever had problems with it,</v>

1482
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:44.800
<v Speaker 3>if it's Eve Edwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1483
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:45.693
<v Speaker 3>that's his own insecurities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so stupid because I couldn't </v>

1484
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:50.470
<v Speaker 3>tell you what he should be insecure </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1485
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:51.453
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then as soon as I get done that I </v>

1486
00:56:53.311 --> 00:56:54.070
<v Speaker 3>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get texted,</v>

1487
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:54.970
<v Speaker 3>my brother is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1488
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.520
<v Speaker 3>you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You resurface that story.</v>

1489
00:56:57.521 --> 00:56:58.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

1490
00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:04.540
<v Speaker 3>And so I texted him again and then comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>on here,</v>

1491
00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:06.520
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I haven't listened to it.</v>

1492
00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:07.630
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1493
00:57:07.631 --> 00:57:08.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I texted,</v>

<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1495
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to keep going through this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I meant zero fence.</v>

1496
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 3>I've texted Karen Bryant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>DC Woodley,</v>

1497
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:19.150
<v Speaker 3>literally anyone you'll see tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I this business,</v>

1498
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:20.130
<v Speaker 3>especially in entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1499
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:23.290
<v Speaker 3>better anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible to be successful in this</v>

1500
00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:25.060
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking monster.</v>

1501
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to help them out.</v>

1502
00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 3>I want the help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1503
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to criticize people.</v>

1504
00:57:30.521 --> 00:57:32.740
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I signed up for this.</v>

1505
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:36.920
<v Speaker 3>I just got caught on a path when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>started talking about,</v>

1506
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:39.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then one of the things that we do,</v>

1507
00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Speaker 3>the best part about it is there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>script.</v>

1508
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:45.130
<v Speaker 3>The best and the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the worst because I could deal with</v>

1509
00:57:45.131 --> 00:57:46.930
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes he goes haywire.</v>

1510
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it ain't go haywire.</v>

1511
00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:53.230
<v Speaker 3>My biggest issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is whenever someone was hurt by my words</v>

1512
00:57:53.231 --> 00:57:56.020
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or does it upset by something I said,</v>

1513
00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 3>then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I again,</v>

1514
00:57:57.341 --> 00:58:00.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Eve's that well at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I lost sleep over.</v>

1515
00:58:00.371 --> 00:58:01.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1516
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:03.490
<v Speaker 3>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have respect for him.</v>

1517
00:58:03.491 --> 00:58:04.324
<v Speaker 3>He's a pioneer at one 55 again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love all the people you've seen </v>

1518
00:58:06.671 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 3>tonight and I've watched the show all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Goddamn time there.</v>

1519
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.200
<v Speaker 3>My friend just went to 0 million cents </v>
<v Speaker 3>duck and you,</v>

1520
00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:13.450
<v Speaker 3>you tried to just make sense of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>words.</v>

1521
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.220
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Apologize Steve.</v>

1522
00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.780
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all good.</v>

1523
00:58:16.781 --> 00:58:17.614
<v Speaker 3>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open door policy ones come on the show </v>

1524
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:21.540
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about on there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I put my foot in my mouth and I hate</v>

1525
00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:24.010
<v Speaker 3>to tell you it's right and happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could say it's not,</v>

1526
00:58:24.011 --> 00:58:24.844
<v Speaker 3>it's probably happening again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of what makes it fun is that </v>

1527
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 3>you are really working without a filter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Working without a net.</v>

1528
00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:33.040
<v Speaker 3>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to have fun.</v>

1529
00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:34.240
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

1530
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:37.080
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you just take some swings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you miss things.</v>

1531
00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.320
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came to ball,</v>

1532
00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:40.163
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came to tell you I was taking swings </v>

1533
00:58:41.531 --> 00:58:42.101
<v Speaker 3>at balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1534
00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:45.490
<v Speaker 3>even though it was hitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes that shit happens,</v>

1535
00:58:45.491 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 3>but it happens.</v>

1536
00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of those things.</v>

1537
00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:49.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it a hundred times in this </v>

1538
00:58:50.471 --> 00:58:51.940
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said some shit and I'm,</v>

1539
00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:53.930
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck did I even say that for?</v>

1540
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:56.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what was going on in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my mind.</v>

1541
00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.350
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes like when you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>form a sentence,</v>

1542
00:58:59.351 --> 00:59:00.490
<v Speaker 3>like right now I'm trying to form a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentence,</v>

1543
00:59:00.491 --> 00:59:00.851
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1544
00:59:00.851 --> 00:59:02.860
<v Speaker 3>sometimes while you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1545
00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:04.300
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't going so good.</v>

1546
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.670
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me try to make it sound better.</v>

1547
00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:09.430
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me try to see if I could rescue this</v>

1548
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.530
<v Speaker 3>for the people that are listening and </v>
<v Speaker 3>make some sense.</v>

1549
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.170
<v Speaker 3>And then it just makes it more clout and</v>
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>

1550
00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:16.390
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for people to fall.</v>

1551
00:59:16.391 --> 00:59:17.270
<v Speaker 3>And you was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1552
00:59:17.271 --> 00:59:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I speak for a living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have ever been on stage.</v>

1553
00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 3>He was going through my set and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing it so much lately.</v>

1554
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:26.750
<v Speaker 3>All be in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in my mind,</v>

1555
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:27.584
<v Speaker 3>I'm fat forward to already the next bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking about that bit while </v>

1556
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:33.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of you had done that or am I curious</v>

1557
00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:34.520
<v Speaker 3>about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know cause I'm not,</v>

1558
00:59:34.521 --> 00:59:35.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm not present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do that.</v>

1559
00:59:35.761 --> 00:59:40.761
<v Speaker 3>And you know what happened is I missed I</v>
<v Speaker 3>s I skipped over a part that was new and</v>

1560
00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:43.130
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was gonna be a home run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I skipped over it.</v>

1561
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I went back and because I record it,</v>

1562
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:46.461
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1563
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:47.294
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't realize I was doing the </v>

1564
00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I listen,</v>

1565
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:50.780
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

1566
00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:53.300
<v Speaker 3>And I remember in my head going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1567
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:56.090
<v Speaker 3>you're here on third.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in first base.</v>

1568
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:58.880
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at third already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Miss Second Pace.</v>

1569
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.470
<v Speaker 3>You're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not even the moment.</v>

1570
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 3>That's hard because there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never know how you should think when</v>

1571
01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:05.480
<v Speaker 3>you're on stage.</v>

1572
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:07.850
<v Speaker 3>You're doing the bit and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to perform the bit,</v>

1573
01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:09.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it's going well,</v>

1574
01:00:09.381 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 3>then you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1575
01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 3>this is going well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I going to lead into next?</v>

1576
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:16.400
<v Speaker 3>But while you're still talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>originally you can't do that.</v>

1577
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:17.870
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you done that before though?</v>

1578
01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.713
<v Speaker 3>My ap?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've definitely done it.</v>

1580
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.400
<v Speaker 3>He was so disappointed in myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1581
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:23.323
<v Speaker 3>The big thing about comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the big things is the audience </v>

1582
01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:29.600
<v Speaker 3>has to know that you are honestly </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about that subject.</v>

1583
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:30.583
<v Speaker 3>Like even if you've talked about it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred times when you're talking about </v>

1584
01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:37.190
<v Speaker 3>it that day in front of those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want,</v>

1585
01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.290
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hearing it for the first time.</v>

1586
01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:41.720
<v Speaker 3>They want you to be tuned into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject.</v>

1587
01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.700
<v Speaker 3>100% of present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1588
01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 3>if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can sense it.</v>

1589
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so disappointed.</v>

1590
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:48.740
<v Speaker 3>I've never done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

1591
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:49.663
<v Speaker 3>it was very strange too because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what hurts me about the eve </v>

1592
01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.730
<v Speaker 3>Edward situation is the guys I looked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to yourself,</v>

1593
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Gary Shandling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they always help people,</v>

1594
01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:59.720
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't put anyone down.</v>

1595
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:00.613
<v Speaker 3>They always help people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't have the same platform you </v>

1596
01:01:02.181 --> 01:01:04.910
<v Speaker 3>guys have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I like to think one day I will.</v>

1597
01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.740
<v Speaker 3>And I want to help people like you guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>help people.</v>

1598
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Like there's the 60 degrees of </v>
<v Speaker 3>separation and you look at all the lives</v>

1599
01:01:11.061 --> 01:01:12.600
<v Speaker 3>you've touched and Garry shandling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1600
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.960
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so inspirational to me.</v>

1601
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:16.880
<v Speaker 3>And I was watching the Garry shandling </v>
<v Speaker 3>doc.</v>

1602
01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:17.571
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1603
01:01:17.571 --> 01:01:18.404
<v Speaker 3>that's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why this Edwards situations </v>

1604
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:21.770
<v Speaker 3>fucking me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm like,</v>

1605
01:01:21.771 --> 01:01:22.760
<v Speaker 3>damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1606
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:25.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to hurt anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with back to the comedy,</v>

1607
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.120
<v Speaker 3>I was so excited because the garry </v>
<v Speaker 3>shandling stuff,</v>

1608
01:01:28.121 --> 01:01:29.810
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever they Kay Shanley,</v>

1609
01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:32.540
<v Speaker 3>whenever they show comedy store stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1610
01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:33.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm so into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1611
01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.280
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got super inspired and I was like,</v>

1612
01:01:37.281 --> 01:01:38.114
<v Speaker 3>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm never been more pumped to hit the </v>

1613
01:01:39.111 --> 01:01:40.670
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that happened.</v>

1614
01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.300
<v Speaker 3>I was so disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1615
01:01:42.301 --> 01:01:43.540
<v Speaker 3>you're still getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1616
01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.460
<v Speaker 3>think about like how long you've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing standup.</v>

1617
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:47.040
<v Speaker 3>He'd been doing it less than two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1618
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.080
<v Speaker 3>This is a thing that's going to come up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

1619
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1620

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you're,</v>

1621
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing a certain move and you'll,</v>

1622
01:01:55.191 --> 01:01:56.730
<v Speaker 3>you'll leave yourself open for an arm </v>
<v Speaker 3>bar,</v>

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1624
01:01:57.111 --> 01:01:59.120

<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1625
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.150
<v Speaker 3>you just have to submit it into your </v>
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

1626
01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.490

<v Speaker 1>And then I'll come back and look at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>again tomorrow night.</v>

1662
01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:35.034
<v Speaker 1>And then I have a whole list.</v>

<v Speaker 1>But I can't write with my hands as fast </v>

1671
01:03:56.641 --> 01:04:00.090
<v Speaker 1>as I can type the phone version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1672
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 1>they've got a phone version two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that for Android as well?</v>

1673
01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>It says features for Ios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly do you do with this job?</v>

1674
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this one is,</v>

1675
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.110
<v Speaker 1>this is different show the corkboard </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

1676
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:12.240
<v Speaker 1>the corkboard things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1677
01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.641
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1678
01:04:14.641 --> 01:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>what they do is just see if you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1679
01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull that up.</v>

1680
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So they have it like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

1681
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you could do it in different colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta have different,</v>

1682
01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:26.420
<v Speaker 1>each one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those little windows can be like a box.</v>

1683
01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.273
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool that you know that that </v>

1684
01:04:28.591 --> 01:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look like a cork board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you can,</v>

1685
01:04:30.671 --> 01:04:31.504
<v Speaker 1>you could change the background and shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make it actually look like a cork </v>

1686
01:04:33.851 --> 01:04:34.380
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>

1687
01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.213
<v Speaker 1>But what it is is basically a board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bulletin board where you've taken an </v>

1688
01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:39.654
<v Speaker 1>index card and you put it up there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the index card has the subject that's </v>

1689
01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:45.150
<v Speaker 1>sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do that in real life too.</v>

1690
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I have a real cork board and I put index</v>
<v Speaker 1>cards on the Cork Board.</v>

1691
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm doing like Vegan cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that bit.</v>

1692
01:04:52.621 --> 01:04:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it up right there that says I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't wait for that one.</v>

1693
01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.133
<v Speaker 1>And I put all these different things on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cork board and then I'll look at </v>

1694
01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:05.760
<v Speaker 1>them and I'll pick one and then I'll do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it if it really,</v>

1695
01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:08.850
<v Speaker 1>all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just about making the time,</v>

1696
01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.540
<v Speaker 1>making the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting the focus.</v>

1697
01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:11.723
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do and that's why you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting better so quick and all these </v>

1698
01:05:14.641 --> 01:05:15.810
<v Speaker 1>are the guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1699
01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Here's where we're doing an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck he touring the road.</v>

1700
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>He works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he listens to those recordings.</v>

1701
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Nobody listens to the recordings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1702
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>They record them and they never listened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

1703
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>I listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta listen half too.</v>

1704
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:28.180
<v Speaker 1>It sucks to hear your voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1705
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:30.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the worst.</v>

1706
01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.001
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1707
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>that's sweet man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's set up like that.</v>

1708
01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're literally looks like,</v>

1709
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.770
<v Speaker 1>so I have that on my laptop and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>come home,</v>

1710
01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:39.673
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pause to open a card and I'll pick </v>

1711
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:42.334
<v Speaker 1>a subject and I'll start going and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else comes to mind while I'm </v>

1712
01:05:45.851 --> 01:05:46.684
<v Speaker 1>on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just start talking about that and </v>

1713
01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all just about opening up the flood</v>

1714
01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really just about giving,</v>

1715
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>giving everything more time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving everything more,</v>

1716
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:58.210
<v Speaker 1>more attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your focus,</v>

1717
01:05:58.270 --> 01:05:59.103
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just skimming through it and </v>

1718
01:05:59.851 --> 01:06:00.684
<v Speaker 1>it's over done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's good is a moment like this where </v>

1719
01:06:02.561 --> 01:06:03.394
<v Speaker 1>you fucked up and you were thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about one bit while you're thinking </v>

1720
01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:06.640
<v Speaker 1>about another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know that that can happen.</v>

1721
01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like a lesson.</v>

1722
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>So just look at it as a good thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>stuff and as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just showing your belly.</v>

01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1875
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.590
<v Speaker 1>This whole me too movement and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1876
01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a tricky situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1877
01:12:06.301 --> 01:12:10.890
<v Speaker 1>You think is going to bounce back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the game's changed for forever.</v>

1878
01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're a creep,</v>

1879
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 1>you can get sought out and found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1880
01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.553
<v Speaker 1>I think men in power and position and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an attractive young lady in the </v>

1881
01:12:20.941 --> 01:12:23.100
<v Speaker 1>office or the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1882
01:12:23.101 --> 01:12:25.640
<v Speaker 1>this is always to be the dynamic because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

1883
01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I think there's some attractive young </v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies out there who are like,</v>

1884
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.660

<v Speaker 1>me a movies whenever,</v>

1888

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1889
01:12:37.741 --> 01:12:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being forced to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>

1890
01:12:39.931 --> 01:12:43.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a new option now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a new element is in the</v>

1891
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:43.650
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1892
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:44.483
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're playing a game and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of sudden someone found like a new </v>

1893
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:46.914
<v Speaker 1>magic power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can end careers now if you are like </v>

1894
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:51.623
<v Speaker 1>a woman who was sexually abused by a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Harvey Weinstein used to just have </v>

1895
01:12:55.021 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 1>to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have a new power,</v>

1896
01:12:57.211 --> 01:12:58.830
<v Speaker 1>which is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

1897
01:12:58.831 --> 01:12:59.664
<v Speaker 1>some will take advantage of that power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pull that card when it's not real </v>

1898
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.080
<v Speaker 1>and dudes are losing their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1899
01:13:04.081 --> 01:13:05.400
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the podcast today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that lady was shot up youtube,</v>

1903
01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:14.160
<v Speaker 1>we're watching her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her online videos,</v>

1904
01:13:14.161 --> 01:13:15.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the worst youtube videos I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>

1905
01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.530
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking nuts and there's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be people like that and there's going to</v>

1906
01:13:19.531 --> 01:13:22.470
<v Speaker 1>be people like that that take advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the me too movement.</v>

1907
01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.060
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to be,</v>

1908
01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you can deny that there's</v>

1909
01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:29.430
<v Speaker 1>just a part of human nature that's with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything though,</v>

1910
01:13:29.431 --> 01:13:29.820

1911
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately where it's going to shift</v>

1912
01:13:33.721 --> 01:13:34.554
<v Speaker 1>as people have to be nicer to each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can't get away with shit like </v>

1913
01:13:36.901 --> 01:13:37.734

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.433
<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad he got sought out and he's </v>

1918
01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.860
<v Speaker 1>scrutiny should be screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine being a chicken,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you have to be so hideous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you can do at this </v>

1923
01:13:58.891 --> 01:13:59.724

<v Speaker 3>So you think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You don't think he eats all that shit?</v>

2186
01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:04.191
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not a judge.</v>

2187
01:24:04.191 --> 01:24:04.901
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2188
01:24:04.901 --> 01:24:06.580
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on different supplements than I am.</v>

2189
01:24:06.581 --> 01:24:08.460
<v Speaker 3>We're both very similar size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different supplements,</v>

2190
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:10.870
<v Speaker 3>different supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supplements,</v>

2191
01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:13.750
<v Speaker 3>Supplement pays and they come from south</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the border.</v>

2192
01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:19.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's eating the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] you ain't the same tacos and</v>

2193
01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:22.960
<v Speaker 3>you see he came out and he has </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression.</v>

2194
01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:25.360
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's football thing,</v>

2195
01:24:25.361 --> 01:24:26.440
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2196
01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then also pro wrestling,</v>

2197
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.730
<v Speaker 3>all that slamming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like getting slammed around.</v>

2198
01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.070
<v Speaker 3>This is my take on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2199
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:35.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've dealt with depression,</v>

2200
01:24:35.861 --> 01:24:37.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have bummer days,</v>

2201
01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Haft bummer days,</v>

2202
01:24:38.201 --> 01:24:39.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit happens.</v>

2203
01:24:39.610 --> 01:24:40.443
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>having a depression period in your life </v>

2204
01:24:43.901 --> 01:24:45.370
<v Speaker 3>or event in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2205
01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:47.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're normally a happy dude and there's</v>

2206
01:24:47.471 --> 01:24:50.410
<v Speaker 3>people with severe depression who has to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be medicated.</v>

2207
01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:51.161
<v Speaker 3>There's this scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2208
01:24:51.161 --> 01:24:53.730
<v Speaker 3>And he's not on that scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's on that scale.</v>

2209
01:24:53.731 --> 01:24:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Makes News.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause he goes,</v>

2210
01:24:54.701 --> 01:24:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been sad to before.</v>

2211
01:24:56.210 --> 01:24:57.011
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

2212
01:24:57.011 --> 01:24:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Rocket Sat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two different sad.</v>

2213
01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:01.390
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about you should fear </v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed here.</v>

2214
01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:02.231
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2215
01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:04.750
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about his mom was Ari </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shaffir depressed out.</v>

2216
01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:07.130
<v Speaker 3>Mike Royko.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His mom walked into traffic and I'm,</v>

2217
01:25:07.131 --> 01:25:08.500
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not throwing shade at Ari.</v>

2218
01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:09.573
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about already having </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression before and he takes </v>

2219
01:25:10.691 --> 01:25:11.524
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I said that he doesn't </v>

2220
01:25:12.161 --> 01:25:12.994
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's off medication and he's Hilarious </v>

2221
01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:16.770
<v Speaker 3>magically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2222
01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.311
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2223
01:25:17.311 --> 01:25:20.070
<v Speaker 3>He's a phenomenal comic and successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's not depressed.</v>

2224
01:25:21.130 --> 01:25:21.963
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got off propecia callen calls pull </v>

2225
01:25:24.361 --> 01:25:25.194
<v Speaker 3>shan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I counseled taking propecia like their </v>

2226
01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:28.330
<v Speaker 3>skittles and he's the happiest man I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

2227
01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not necessarily like universal.</v>

2228
01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Like some people can take penicillin and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a problem.</v>

2229
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:36.880
<v Speaker 3>Other people are allergic to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2230
01:25:36.881 --> 01:25:40.030
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's a rare case where he'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>take propecia and get depressed.</v>

2231
01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:40.953
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think is are rare.</v>

2232
01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I bet if you look at the studies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this come from countless,</v>

2233
01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:47.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is bro Science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Calvin just wants that hair,</v>

2234
01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.030
<v Speaker 3>wants to keep that hair so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do anything.</v>

2235
01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:51.530
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should go.</v>

2236
01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good fat one red one.</v>

2237
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go crazy so I can yank it off and I</v>

2238
01:25:57.871 --> 01:26:00.880
<v Speaker 3>want to wear a wig so bad like one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

2239
01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:04.490
<v Speaker 3>those mesh net ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the Lebron sprayed</v>

2240
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:06.620
<v Speaker 1>on look almost looks like a Pittsburgh </v>
<v Speaker 1>steeler helmet.</v>

2241
01:26:06.650 --> 01:26:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Ron Still doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2242
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:10.340
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2243
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got to let it go.</v>

2244
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.823
<v Speaker 1>Question on this though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you take from Kesha because </v>

2245
01:26:15.681 --> 01:26:16.514
<v Speaker 1>you're a little depressed because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hair's falling out and if it didn't </v>

2246
01:26:18.411 --> 01:26:20.600
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to stay correct.</v>

2247
01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:22.640
<v Speaker 1>A little depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fucks with your Dick game.</v>

2248
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

2249
01:26:24.231 --> 01:26:25.064
<v Speaker 1>But I think what they're saying is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicidal depression that there's </v>

2250
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.353
<v Speaker 1>something about the dht inhibitor </v>
<v Speaker 1>dihydrotestosterone which is derivative </v>

2251
01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:37.400
<v Speaker 1>of testosterone is what causes you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have your hair fall out.</v>

2252
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:42.730
<v Speaker 1>The dht inhibiting factors in propecia </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some people it adds to it.</v>

2253
01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a low percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pretty sure might be</v>

2254
01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:48.440
<v Speaker 4>the study this comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I just,</v>

2255
01:26:48.441 --> 01:26:50.840
<v Speaker 4>I would google,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might've been more than one study was</v>

2256
01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:55.490
<v Speaker 4>in 2012 and it was only 61 men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh the only did 61 minute.</v>

2257
01:26:55.530 --> 01:26:59.570
<v Speaker 4>How many got depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>said a 61 man who formerly use propecia,</v>

2258
01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:00.404
<v Speaker 4>who experienced more than three months </v>
<v Speaker 4>of sexual side effects and had no </v>

2259
01:27:02.571 --> 01:27:05.030
<v Speaker 4>history of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual problems of any sort.</v>

2260
01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2261
01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:07.693
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm losing my hair and my Dick won't </v>

2262
01:27:08.841 --> 01:27:10.660
<v Speaker 1>get up and I'd be depressed too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2263
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:11.623
<v Speaker 1>Do stock take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also you've got to figure out </v>

2264
01:27:13.121 --> 01:27:13.954
<v Speaker 1>like what's happening in your love life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're depressed and your Dick </v>

2265
01:27:17.661 --> 01:27:18.770
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2266
01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:19.753
<v Speaker 1>But also up philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a nine to five job you hate </v>

2267
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:26.030
<v Speaker 1>and that pay the bills and then you got </v>
<v Speaker 1>family drama,</v>

2268
01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.073
<v Speaker 4>11% of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess 11% of the 61 which would be </v>

2269
01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:30.980
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six of them,</v>

2270
01:27:30.981 --> 01:27:34.520
<v Speaker 4>five or six had mild symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>symptoms of depression.</v>

2271
01:27:34.521 --> 01:27:37.400
<v Speaker 4>28 had moderate and 36 had severe.</v>

2272
01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>36 had severe.</v>

2273
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2274
01:27:42.351 --> 01:27:43.880
<v Speaker 1>so that's also then when you're asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2275
01:27:43.881 --> 01:27:44.870
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the step?</v>

2276
01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:47.990
<v Speaker 1>What was the study on a second?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you say 61 people?</v>

2277
01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:51.540
<v Speaker 1>36% percent had severe depression.</v>

2278
01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:55.680
<v Speaker 4>I found that 44% of the men had </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced thoughts of suicide.</v>

2279
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:56.623
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm already hold on Jesus Christ to 4% </v>

2280
01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.000
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm also going in.</v>

2281
01:28:01.001 --> 01:28:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Like what were they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would they just ask them like,</v>

2282
01:28:02.711 --> 01:28:04.690
<v Speaker 1>have you ever thought of it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2283
01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they call it the scientific study?</v>

2284
01:28:06.461 --> 01:28:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's some sort of protocol </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to follow.</v>

2285
01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:09.633
<v Speaker 1>Let me understand this though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>66 people were randomly out of how many </v>

2286
01:28:14.171 --> 01:28:15.190
<v Speaker 1>people took it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2287
01:28:15.191 --> 01:28:15.660
<v Speaker 1>It says</v>

2288
01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:18.660
<v Speaker 4>the Journal of Clinical Psych,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychiatric psychiatry,</v>

2289
01:28:18.661 --> 01:28:20.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>study included 61 men.</v>

2290
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.910

<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

2333
01:29:54.991 --> 01:29:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't get out of bed or thought about</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the dark end of this game.</v>

2337
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:05.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing himself and trying to,</v>

2338
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:08.670
<v Speaker 1>trying to not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2339
01:30:08.671 --> 01:30:09.504
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started making some phone calls </v>

2340
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:12.390

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2341
01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:16.680
<v Speaker 1>my business manager found the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist,</v>

2342
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.720
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this guy is a wizard.</v>

2345
01:30:23.850 --> 01:30:24.683
<v Speaker 1>It was very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just paid for it not to say yes to </v>

2346
01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.530
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just told Paul No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He don't you think he was the perfect </v>

2373
01:31:28.741 --> 01:31:29.574

<v Speaker 1>Who knows what's going on with his girl </v>

2374
01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.670
<v Speaker 1>and then it's just this fucking perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm.</v>

2375
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:38.640
<v Speaker 1>The propecia is making you even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>

2376
01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:39.420
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll think about killing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is going on right now?</v>

2378
01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:43.750
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>darts.</v>

2379
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:46.440
<v Speaker 1>So he pulled out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got off the prepuce show,</v>

2380
01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:50.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then his career took the fuck off.</v>

2381
01:31:50.281 --> 01:31:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got on good medication,</v>

2382
01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:55.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever the medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his new psychiatrist got him on,</v>

2383
01:31:55.620 --> 01:32:00.370
<v Speaker 1>worked like a charm and like he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>better in like couple months,</v>

2384

<v Speaker 3>a couple months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like back to Ari fucking around </v>

2385
01:32:03.221 --> 01:32:05.530
<v Speaker 3>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then oddly enough,</v>

2386
01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:08.920
<v Speaker 3>when it started working really well for </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

2387
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:11.350
<v Speaker 3>then his career started taking off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2388
01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.550
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it works.</v>

2389
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm a standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started taking off his career,</v>

2390
01:32:14.831 --> 01:32:16.810
<v Speaker 3>started taking off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he became happier,</v>

2391
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:21.870
<v Speaker 3>got off the propecia and then weaned </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself off the drugs and now he's good.</v>

2392
01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Now he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2393
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:26.950
<v Speaker 3>That was great to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he smokes a lot of weed and I always</v>

2394
01:32:26.951 --> 01:32:27.784
<v Speaker 3>wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that how much of that is self </v>

2395
01:32:28.571 --> 01:32:29.404
<v Speaker 3>medicating?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2396
01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:31.900
<v Speaker 3>But it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you smoke a ton of weed.</v>

2397
01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:33.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not a self medicating though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2398
01:32:33.670 --> 01:32:34.503
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

2399
01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:37.020
<v Speaker 3>I just liked doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're not a doctor.</v>

2400
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:38.860
<v Speaker 3>It makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes you vulnerable.</v>

2401
01:32:38.890 --> 01:32:41.260
<v Speaker 3>It makes you think about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you nervous.</v>

2402
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:42.303
<v Speaker 3>Like she like makes you pause and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't just take things for granted when </v>

2403
01:32:45.251 --> 01:32:46.810
<v Speaker 3>you get high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start thinking about,</v>

2404
01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.340
<v Speaker 3>my problem is I smoked the other night.</v>

2405
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't sleep in US thinking about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of things.</v>

2406
01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:55.570
<v Speaker 3>And then I got this thought in my head </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's some weird shit man.</v>

2407
01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2408
01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:57.341
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2409
01:32:57.341 --> 01:32:59.380
<v Speaker 3>I was telling calendars that hate when </v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2410
01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.250
<v Speaker 3>when I think like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was in San Jose and I saw this mom</v>

2411
01:33:03.251 --> 01:33:06.670
<v Speaker 3>with two homeless kids and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2412
01:33:06.730 --> 01:33:07.563
<v Speaker 3>I was at the store and I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy an expensive sweater and I felt so </v>

2413
01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:11.584
<v Speaker 3>guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he got cash and gave this mom </v>

2414
01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:17.170
<v Speaker 3>bunch of cash and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she started crying and I'm like,</v>

2415
01:33:17.171 --> 01:33:18.004
<v Speaker 3>fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's like this weird die around </v>

2416
01:33:19.481 --> 01:33:22.840
<v Speaker 3>the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the kid was about my son's age,</v>

2417
01:33:22.841 --> 01:33:24.610
<v Speaker 3>about two sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this little girl.</v>

2418
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:26.260
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

2419
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:27.303
<v Speaker 3>I dunno why I had this random thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>once he grabbed her by the lake and </v>

2420
01:33:29.141 --> 01:33:30.070
<v Speaker 3>spiked on the ground.</v>

2421
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2422
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:33.560
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I didn't,</v>

2423
01:33:33.561 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 3>and I gave her the cash felt better </v>
<v Speaker 3>because more people around like no one's</v>

2424
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:36.964
<v Speaker 3>gonna let that happen to a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that whole night fucked up at it </v>

2425
01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.060
<v Speaker 3>and its own reach out to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2426
01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:41.260
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's her side hustle.</v>

2427
01:33:41.261 --> 01:33:42.880
<v Speaker 3>She does that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's actually not,</v>

2428
01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:44.830
<v Speaker 3>we've seen her like raise those kids on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the street.</v>

2429
01:33:44.890 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 3>She gets picked up by a husband.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a shitty deal.</v>

2430
01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:47.711
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2431
01:33:47.711 --> 01:33:49.330
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I smoked weed,</v>

2432
01:33:49.331 --> 01:33:50.164
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

2433
01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm laying in bed and then I had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>visual,</v>

2434
01:33:52.901 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 3>so don't do that to my son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to sleep.</v>

2435
01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:57.830
<v Speaker 3>I felt sick to my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2436
01:33:57.831 --> 01:33:59.100
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes we'd,</v>

2437
01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.943
<v Speaker 3>I can think if I think about a bid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that some are good on this cool </v>

2438
01:34:02.141 --> 01:34:02.770
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>

2439
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:06.760
<v Speaker 3>But then if that creeps in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's like it kept coming up.</v>

2440
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:09.130
<v Speaker 3>It was so visual and I was like sick to </v>
<v Speaker 3>my stomach.</v>

2441
01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:10.623
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my son woke up at five and I fucking </v>

2442
01:34:11.891 --> 01:34:12.724
<v Speaker 3>beeline to his room and just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>squeeze the fuck em for the rest of the </v>

2443
01:34:14.981 --> 01:34:16.930
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard,</v>

2444
01:34:16.931 --> 01:34:21.310
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows how much you love a person,</v>

2445
01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:24.160
<v Speaker 3>how much you can love a person until you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a kid.</v>

2446
01:34:24.250 --> 01:34:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you one says that,</v>

2447
01:34:26.110 --> 01:34:28.330
<v Speaker 3>everyone says that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2448
01:34:28.331 --> 01:34:29.164
<v Speaker 3>okay everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you told me that Brian till </v>

2449
01:34:30.371 --> 01:34:33.310
<v Speaker 3>everyone told me this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then once you have a kid it's like,</v>

2450
01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:34.653
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different animal where now </v>

2451
01:34:37.690 --> 01:34:39.790
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I see the shootings,</v>

2452
01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 3>when I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the,</v>

2453
01:34:41.351 --> 01:34:42.184
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nuclear war talk with North Korea </v>

2454
01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:44.344
<v Speaker 3>and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think God and I see that a lot of </v>

2455
01:34:47.051 --> 01:34:49.030
<v Speaker 3>negativity on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2456
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.863
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world is such a kind of a fucked up </v>

2457
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:54.070
<v Speaker 3>place if you want to look into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and when to have a kid.</v>

2458
01:34:54.071 --> 01:34:55.510
<v Speaker 3>I think about him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2459
01:34:55.511 --> 01:34:56.344
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's it going to be like when he's </v>

2460
01:34:57.471 --> 01:34:58.304
<v Speaker 3>like 16 or 18 like what kind of world is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be when he's 18 of I think too </v>

2461
01:35:01.671 --> 01:35:03.950
<v Speaker 3>hard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when I'll get depressed.</v>

2462
01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the world's going to be okay.</v>

2463
01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:06.793
<v Speaker 3>I mean for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to bring this part just </v>

2464
01:35:08.301 --> 01:35:09.320
<v Speaker 3>down Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2465
01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.180
<v Speaker 3>but horrible things are going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what.</v>

2466
01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2467
01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.560
<v Speaker 3>it changes who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have a kid,</v>

2468
01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:16.513
<v Speaker 3>it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're or you're a piece of shit or </v>

2469
01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:23.090
<v Speaker 3>you're sociopath and he's such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just if you're around the kid enough,</v>

2470
01:35:23.091 --> 01:35:25.610
<v Speaker 3>it changes who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not around the kid,</v>

2471
01:35:25.611 --> 01:35:26.444
<v Speaker 3>it changes who you are because then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize you're not around the kid and </v>

2472
01:35:28.141 --> 01:35:31.250
<v Speaker 3>that that's going to take a piece out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you think you are.</v>

2473
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:32.181
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

2474
01:35:32.181 --> 01:35:33.014
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you and we have friends who aren't </v>

2475
01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:37.040
<v Speaker 3>great dads or whatever and you could see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in their kids.</v>

2476
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:38.081
<v Speaker 3>I can I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

2477
01:35:38.081 --> 01:35:41.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm not up psychologists or I'm some </v>
<v Speaker 3>expert in parenting,</v>

2478
01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:44.240
<v Speaker 3>but if I go to a person's house and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>see the way the kids treat the pants,</v>

2479
01:35:44.241 --> 01:35:45.800
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not around enough man.</v>

2480
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I promise you.</v>

2481
01:35:47.151 --> 01:35:49.780
<v Speaker 3>I can tell my son doesn't act like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2482
01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Cause one thing that you can call me </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever you want,</v>

2483
01:35:51.591 --> 01:35:53.390
<v Speaker 3>whenever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I am is a beast of a dad.</v>

2484
01:35:53.391 --> 01:35:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm get comic.</v>

2485
01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:58.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I was a good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if from good podcasts are,</v>

2486
01:35:58.371 --> 01:35:59.204
<v Speaker 3>that's all up for debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I know is I'm a fucking good </v>

2487
01:36:01.701 --> 01:36:03.500
<v Speaker 3>dad man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for you man.</v>

2488

<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>

2489
01:36:04.911 --> 01:36:05.661
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2490
01:36:05.661 --> 01:36:10.040
<v Speaker 3>very important quality and that quality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when your kid becomes an adult,</v>

2491
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:13.760
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be just a major factor </v>
<v Speaker 3>in how you get along.</v>

2492
01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give you,</v>

2493
01:36:14.661 --> 01:36:19.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean even parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know friends had had bad relationships</v>

2494
01:36:19.281 --> 01:36:21.440
<v Speaker 3>with their parents when they live with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and then once they got out,</v>

2495
01:36:21.441 --> 01:36:23.900
<v Speaker 3>their parents were nice to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the parents were shitty to them when</v>

2496
01:36:23.901 --> 01:36:26.380
<v Speaker 3>they were kids and they always hold it </v>
<v Speaker 3>against a whole always.</v>

2497
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:28.310
<v Speaker 3>They always have that shit in the back </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their head like,</v>

2498
01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:30.440
<v Speaker 3>why were you a dick when I was 12 you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that,</v>

2499
01:36:30.441 --> 01:36:32.050
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit is always in their head.</v>

2500
01:36:32.051 --> 01:36:34.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like that Avatar horse when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>

2501
01:36:34.131 --> 01:36:36.650
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mixed together and if you don't make</v>

<v Speaker 3>a therapist,</v>

2504
01:36:40.401 --> 01:36:41.234
<v Speaker 3>they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's from like til they're </v>

2505
01:36:42.801 --> 01:36:43.610
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

2506
01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:45.420
<v Speaker 3>If you don't make that connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2507
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:46.341
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're like,</v>

01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:52.490
<v Speaker 3>these brain pathways were like,</v>

2545
01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:08.214

<v Speaker 1>who opened my eyes like in a big way,</v>

2564
01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a podcast recently that's really been</v>

2565
01:38:58.231 --> 01:39:00.660
<v Speaker 1>making me think a lot about this is Bret</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weinstein.</v>

2566
01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:03.570
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the professor that gotten that.</v>

2567
01:39:03.571 --> 01:39:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2568
01:39:04.591 --> 01:39:07.860
<v Speaker 1>he is controversy with the Evergreen </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities and all that,</v>

2569
01:39:07.861 --> 01:39:11.370
<v Speaker 1>and they were taking the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a pronoun thing.</v>

2570
01:39:11.371 --> 01:39:14.100
<v Speaker 1>It was the day of absence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted all the white people to stay</v>

2571
01:39:14.101 --> 01:39:14.701
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2572
01:39:14.701 --> 01:39:16.090
<v Speaker 1>that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2573
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on,</v>

2574
01:39:17.881 --> 01:39:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you said there's two different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that men are attracted to.</v>

2575
01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:21.893
<v Speaker 1>They're attracted to a woman that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think would be a great companion and a </v>

2576
01:39:26.491 --> 01:39:27.420
<v Speaker 1>great mother.</v>

2577
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:31.050
<v Speaker 1>And like someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said there's a difference between hot</v>

2578
01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.310
<v Speaker 1>and beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2579
01:39:32.311 --> 01:39:33.144
<v Speaker 1>Like some women are beautiful and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're loving you want to be around </v>

2580
01:39:35.671 --> 01:39:36.840
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>

2581
01:39:36.841 --> 01:39:37.674
<v Speaker 1>but then there's other women who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just hot and in males that very </v>

2582
01:39:42.601 --> 01:39:45.570
<v Speaker 1>receptive woman who doesn't require any </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment,</v>

2583
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:46.703
<v Speaker 1>was an opportunity for men to spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>their seed with someone who they didn't </v>

2584
01:39:50.011 --> 01:39:51.660
<v Speaker 1>have to be around for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2585
01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's literally like a programming </v>

2586
01:39:54.121 --> 01:39:54.954
<v Speaker 1>in a man's mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see a girl with big giant tits </v>

2587
01:39:58.141 --> 01:39:58.974
<v Speaker 1>and a little waist and a fat ass hanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of her shorts and she's got sloppy </v>

2588
01:40:01.681 --> 01:40:03.660
<v Speaker 1>makeup on and she looks at you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2589
01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:04.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2590
01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.140
<v Speaker 1>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what that is.</v>

2591
01:40:07.141 --> 01:40:09.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not like live with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You let,</v>

2592
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.943
<v Speaker 1>you're not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to start a relationship </v>

2593
01:40:11.041 --> 01:40:11.431
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2594
01:40:11.431 --> 01:40:12.264
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to shoot my load into you and </v>

2595
01:40:13.411 --> 01:40:16.800
<v Speaker 1>then you raise my kid when I'm nowhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>near you because it's an opportunity for</v>

2596
01:40:16.801 --> 01:40:18.240
<v Speaker 1>my dna to propagate.</v>

2597
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much sense.</v>

2598
01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:23.370
<v Speaker 1>It makes so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally never considered it until he</v>

2599
01:40:23.371 --> 01:40:24.720
<v Speaker 1>brought it up on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

2600
01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:26.770
<v Speaker 1>oh Duh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me neither.</v>

2601
01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I just thought she's hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just hot,</v>

2602
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:32.400
<v Speaker 1>dirty in a dirty way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why she so attracted to that?</v>

2603
01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Why is she so dirty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my girl,</v>

2604
01:40:34.711 --> 01:40:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my girl Joe,</v>

2605
01:40:35.731 --> 01:40:36.564
<v Speaker 1>probably four weeks into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five weeks we were getting serious and </v>

2606
01:40:39.661 --> 01:40:40.494
<v Speaker 1>she got this job offer to go to Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was talking about career and stuff </v>

2607
01:40:42.661 --> 01:40:43.710
<v Speaker 1>like that and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2608
01:40:43.711 --> 01:40:44.544
<v Speaker 1>that's all cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all I know one's career first more </v>

2609
01:40:45.961 --> 01:40:47.010
<v Speaker 1>than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2610
01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:47.611
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2611
01:40:47.611 --> 01:40:49.230
<v Speaker 1>you're put on the search to be a mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2612
01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Like you're going to be such a beast of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mom.</v>

2613
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I saw her interact with Callan's</v>

2614
01:40:54.191 --> 01:40:55.024
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can guarantee you that you might be </v>

2615
01:40:57.281 --> 01:41:00.490
<v Speaker 1>the greatest host in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to be the best mom I've</v>

2616
01:41:00.491 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 1>ever seen.</v>

2617
01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.110
<v Speaker 1>And then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

2618
01:41:02.111 --> 01:41:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you fucking Bam Bam.</v>

2619
01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.273
<v Speaker 1>Well that's just those qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can see it's something and when </v>

2620
01:41:08.471 --> 01:41:10.810
<v Speaker 1>someone's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone's a bad mom,</v>

2621
01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:13.750
<v Speaker 1>it's such a depressed man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing worse.</v>

2622
01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.273
<v Speaker 1>So depressing to be around women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like really short with her kids </v>

2623
01:41:17.621 --> 01:41:19.840
<v Speaker 1>and Shitty with them and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well even as a kid,</v>

2624
01:41:19.841 --> 01:41:22.750
<v Speaker 1>if I had friends who like talked back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parents are mean to their parents.</v>

2625
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with you?</v>

2626
01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:26.810
<v Speaker 1>If I was dating a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd like bad mouth,</v>

2627
01:41:26.811 --> 01:41:28.790
<v Speaker 1>their mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's wrong with you girl?</v>

2628
01:41:28.791 --> 01:41:30.850
<v Speaker 1>And the hard thing is that pattern hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>to break.</v>

2629
01:41:30.970 --> 01:41:31.803
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kids may very well have that same </v>

2630
01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:37.630
<v Speaker 1>kind of behavior towards their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they become adults,</v>

2631
01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:39.333
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard pattern to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you need the right person in </v>

2632
01:41:40.931 --> 01:41:41.764
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

2633
01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:43.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like a good person in your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

2634
01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:46.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wife or husband or whoever it is.</v>

2635
01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:48.580
<v Speaker 1>You know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you match up with that person,</v>

2636
01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:52.510
<v Speaker 1>like it changes who you are too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I always say that one of the</v>

2637
01:41:52.511 --> 01:41:56.020
<v Speaker 1>most important things about um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

2638
01:41:56.050 --> 01:41:57.490
<v Speaker 1>like your community of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2639
01:41:57.670 --> 01:42:00.850
<v Speaker 1>It's when you have good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people change you.</v>

2640
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone is your tribe.</v>

2641
01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:09.520
<v Speaker 1>You react like everyone's your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you want good for them.</v>

2642
01:42:09.521 --> 01:42:10.990
<v Speaker 1>You love them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you care about them.</v>

2643
01:42:11.110 --> 01:42:11.943
<v Speaker 1>They change who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They change if they inspire you or they </v>

2644
01:42:14.621 --> 01:42:15.454
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether they inspire you with being </v>

2645
01:42:16.241 --> 01:42:18.850
<v Speaker 1>smart or their kindness or their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambition,</v>

2646
01:42:18.851 --> 01:42:22.270
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is that we're on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not individuals.</v>

2647
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.140
<v Speaker 1>We're a piece of a community always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that community,</v>

2648
01:42:26.141 --> 01:42:28.120
<v Speaker 1>even if it's a small community that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>call a family,</v>

2649
01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:31.870
<v Speaker 1>that piece is dependent upon who you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that piece with.</v>

2650
01:42:32.050 --> 01:42:32.883
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be an amazing dad with the </v>

2651
01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:37.090
<v Speaker 1>right woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with the wrong woman,</v>

2652
01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.073
<v Speaker 1>you might be so frustrated with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship that you're not as good at </v>

2653
01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.073
<v Speaker 1>data right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be chaos going on all the </v>

2654
01:42:43.661 --> 01:42:44.494
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be situations you put the kid </v>

2655
01:42:46.061 --> 01:42:46.894
<v Speaker 1>in when you're yelling and screaming at </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other of the kitchen and see all </v>

2656
01:42:49.061 --> 01:42:49.894
<v Speaker 1>these different factors that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent upon your relationship with </v>

2657
01:42:52.961 --> 01:42:53.794
<v Speaker 1>this other person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they changed you and you change </v>

2658
01:42:55.701 --> 01:42:56.534
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you might be the wrong person for </v>

2659
01:42:57.491 --> 01:42:58.324
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be super cool and calm with </v>

2660
01:43:00.041 --> 01:43:01.420
<v Speaker 1>someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with you,</v>

2661
01:43:01.421 --> 01:43:02.530
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not a mitch.</v>

2662
01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:05.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hit buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a woman saying to you,</v>

2663
01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.551
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2664
01:43:06.551 --> 01:43:08.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't want an equal like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2665
01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this.</v>

2666
01:43:10.061 --> 01:43:10.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want this.</v>

2667
01:43:10.961 --> 01:43:12.580
<v Speaker 1>You might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know for sure.</v>

2668
01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're threatened.</v>

2669
01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:15.370
<v Speaker 1>You threatened by a strong woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2670
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm threatened by you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

2671
01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:17.613
<v Speaker 1>you're aggressive for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck has ever said that you </v>

2672
01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:21.700
<v Speaker 1>threatened by strong man to try and by </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong man.</v>

2673
01:43:21.701 --> 01:43:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut up cause he was he calling yourself</v>

2674
01:43:25.031 --> 01:43:26.470
<v Speaker 1>a strong man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2675
01:43:26.471 --> 01:43:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Any guy who calls himself a strong man </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that job most likely's up pitch.</v>

2676
01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just trying to prop himself.</v>

2677
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And I feel the same way about women who </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that women who were like,</v>

2678
01:43:36.881 --> 01:43:38.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're scared of a strong woman.</v>

2679
01:43:38.051 --> 01:43:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I really or are you a cocked?</v>

2680
01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh are you a call?</v>

2681
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Just a raging cause this talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds like this guy can't talk.</v>

2682
01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:49.480
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super uncomfortable.</v>

2683
01:43:49.481 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what got us to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever I did</v>

2684
01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.960
<v Speaker 3>please,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll apologize.</v>

2685
01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:55.480
<v Speaker 3>But I also feel like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2686
01:43:55.481 --> 01:43:59.950
<v Speaker 3>in this community of friends that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about if you are a shit father,</v>

2687
01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.260
<v Speaker 3>it would show elsewhere in your life </v>
<v Speaker 3>around us.</v>

2688
01:44:03.261 --> 01:44:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Or if we're at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a restaurant or in your,</v>

2689
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:08.143
<v Speaker 3>in your social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to come out one way or </v>

2690
01:44:09.531 --> 01:44:10.364
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2691
01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.680
<v Speaker 3>tough to be in that group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the expression,</v>

2692
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:14.300
<v Speaker 3>how you do one thing is how you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2693
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:16.050
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2694
01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:18.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something to that.</v>

2695
01:44:18.561 --> 01:44:19.394
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously there's people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at one thing and then suck </v>

2696
01:44:21.261 --> 01:44:22.280
<v Speaker 3>at other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not a,</v>

2697
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:25.070
<v Speaker 3>it's not always a hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

2698
01:44:25.071 --> 01:44:27.470
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a shitty dad,</v>

2699
01:44:27.471 --> 01:44:29.540
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be a shitty friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2700
01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.250
<v Speaker 3>And if you're a shitty friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're probably going to be shitty.</v>

2701
01:44:31.251 --> 01:44:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Dad and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say this too,</v>

2702
01:44:32.901 --> 01:44:37.040
<v Speaker 3>with like with due to our shitty debt </v>
<v Speaker 3>dads,</v>

2703
01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:37.610
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2704
01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:40.520
<v Speaker 3>If you're willing to do that to your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally your connect to this person,</v>

2705
01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:41.331
<v Speaker 3>chemically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2706
01:44:41.331 --> 01:44:44.030
<v Speaker 3>they're made of your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're on a treat him like that.</v>

2707
01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:47.330
<v Speaker 3>When the going gets rough for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck are you going to be?</v>

2708
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way I want you to my foxhole.</v>

2709
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's big man.</v>

2710
01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:54.410
<v Speaker 3>And then people that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand that.</v>

2711
01:44:54.411 --> 01:44:55.820
<v Speaker 3>They understand what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

2712
01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:58.460
<v Speaker 3>That's rough too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Bummer,</v>

2713
01:44:58.490 --> 01:45:01.820
<v Speaker 3>the people that can't see it and you try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to explain it to them and they can't see</v>

2714
01:45:01.821 --> 01:45:02.654
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one thing people will put up with </v>

2715
01:45:03.681 --> 01:45:05.990
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as in I would never do this,</v>

2716
01:45:05.991 --> 01:45:07.760
<v Speaker 3>but if you give someone parenting </v>
<v Speaker 3>advice,</v>

2717
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:08.960
<v Speaker 3>just doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just,</v>

2718
01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.190
<v Speaker 3>there's certain things you can't talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2719
01:45:10.191 --> 01:45:12.530
<v Speaker 3>Usually politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and parenting.</v>

2720
01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:13.483
<v Speaker 3>The only way I think parenting advice </v>
<v Speaker 3>works ever is if you talk about one </v>

2721
01:45:18.111 --> 01:45:18.944
<v Speaker 3>great thing that you found that you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your kid without criticizing none </v>

2722
01:45:21.621 --> 01:45:23.050
<v Speaker 3>other pests,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

2723
01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:23.913
<v Speaker 3>you could give them advice but not give </v>
<v Speaker 3>them advice by like you can relay your </v>

2724
01:45:27.231 --> 01:45:31.940
<v Speaker 3>personal positive experiences and either</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take it or they don't.</v>

2725
01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:33.260
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as you start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

2726
01:45:33.261 --> 01:45:35.090
<v Speaker 3>I see how you talk to your son and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2727
01:45:35.091 --> 01:45:38.870
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck did you say to your son is</v>

2728
01:45:38.871 --> 01:45:39.441
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2729
01:45:39.441 --> 01:45:42.010
<v Speaker 3>he's an individual man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You treat her like an object.</v>

2730
01:45:42.020 --> 01:45:42.853
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking treat my son like all </v>

2731
01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:46.740
<v Speaker 3>the time came over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not even listening.</v>

2732
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:48.360
<v Speaker 3>What you said you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all ramping up.</v>

2733
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.880
<v Speaker 3>My son was one and a half at the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was taken to this,</v>

2734
01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:54.860
<v Speaker 3>this play area and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2735
01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:55.753
<v Speaker 3>he did not express himself and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>was older and you'd hit kids and he's a </v>

2736
01:45:58.401 --> 01:45:59.234
<v Speaker 3>big kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a 99% tile for size and all that </v>

2737
01:46:01.731 --> 01:46:02.564
<v Speaker 3>stuff and he would hit kids and the the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place where I was taking him in </v>

2738
01:46:06.981 --> 01:46:07.814
<v Speaker 3>Brentwood knew I was a former fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the guys who works front desk as </v>

2739
01:46:10.761 --> 01:46:11.480
<v Speaker 3>a fan.</v>

2740
01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:15.320
<v Speaker 3>I've talked mma with them and they took </v>
<v Speaker 3>me to the side and said,</v>

2741
01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:16.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a bit of a problem because tiger </v>

2742
01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:22.760
<v Speaker 3>is hitting kids and we think it's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>direct correlation of you let them watch</v>

2743
01:46:22.761 --> 01:46:26.030
<v Speaker 3>fights and from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just started laughing,</v>

2784
01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:03.683
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird that people are just </v>

2785

<v Speaker 3>ideological progressive people that </v>

2787
01:48:12.571 --> 01:48:13.404
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're locked into this idea that it's </v>

2788
01:48:14.671 --> 01:48:15.504
<v Speaker 3>amazing to have a trans kid and the kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows any sign whatsoever of being </v>

2789
01:48:20.250 --> 01:48:22.910
<v Speaker 3>inclining to be female or inclined to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>mailed.</v>

2790
01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:23.790
<v Speaker 3>They're pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2791
01:48:23.791 --> 01:48:26.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's actually bad.</v>

2792
01:48:26.670 --> 01:48:27.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also very dangerous because they </v>

2793
01:48:28.321 --> 01:48:30.090
<v Speaker 3>start wanting to fuck with the kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones.</v>

2794
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:31.223
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to let the child develop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no real science and what the </v>

2795
01:48:34.501 --> 01:48:36.800
<v Speaker 3>fuck happens when you put hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>blockers new,</v>

2796
01:48:36.801 --> 01:48:38.940
<v Speaker 3>a three year old and try to transition </v>
<v Speaker 3>them into a girl,</v>

2797
01:48:38.941 --> 01:48:41.940
<v Speaker 3>but also the real doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what the hell they're doing.</v>

2798
01:48:41.970 --> 01:48:43.860
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to inject that kid </v>
<v Speaker 3>with hormones.</v>

2799
01:48:43.861 --> 01:48:44.700
<v Speaker 3>So you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

2800
01:48:44.730 --> 01:48:48.590
<v Speaker 3>if you want to do this when you're 1819 </v>
<v Speaker 3>even then it's a little too early,</v>

2801
01:48:48.591 --> 01:48:51.210
<v Speaker 3>but when you're 21 which is again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too early.</v>

2802
01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:52.313
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've seen this on some of the </v>

2803
01:48:53.250 --> 01:48:55.880
<v Speaker 3>bullshit reality TV shows that much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these legit doctoral,</v>

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:59.100
<v Speaker 3>then I'm willing to help you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But before then get out of here.</v>

2805
01:48:59.130 --> 01:48:59.731
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out.</v>

2806
01:48:59.731 --> 01:49:00.564
<v Speaker 3>Let's see where yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're 16th there's a market for </v>

2807
01:49:02.221 --> 01:49:04.560
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a cruel thing to say in a weird</v>

2808
01:49:04.561 --> 01:49:05.460
<v Speaker 3>way to describe it.</v>

2809
01:49:05.530 --> 01:49:06.640
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>

2810
01:49:06.890 --> 01:49:07.980
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2811
01:49:07.981 --> 01:49:10.470
<v Speaker 3>on the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some of those kids,</v>

2812
01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.690
<v Speaker 3>they do feel like they're trapped in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman's body.</v>

2813
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:14.760
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feel for them that must suck to go</v>

2814
01:49:14.761 --> 01:49:17.580
<v Speaker 3>through high school and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But isn't that the exception?</v>

2815
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:18.833
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is that kit the exception that </v>

2816
01:49:20.401 --> 01:49:23.130
<v Speaker 3>feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they should have access to it.</v>

2817
01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.840
<v Speaker 3>How could you do that with a three year </v>
<v Speaker 3>old?</v>

2818
01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:25.351
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2819
01:49:25.351 --> 01:49:26.580
<v Speaker 3>how do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2820
01:49:26.581 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 3>you just don't and anybody says he do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your crazy people change.</v>

2821
01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:31.253
<v Speaker 3>You change when hormones get entered </v>
<v Speaker 3>into your body and maybe you won't be </v>

2822
01:49:33.181 --> 01:49:36.420
<v Speaker 3>the most masculine man in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you will turn into a woman someday</v>

2823
01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:37.523
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but give yourself a goddamn chance to </v>

2824
01:49:40.081 --> 01:49:42.420
<v Speaker 3>just exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the high school wrestler?</v>

2825
01:49:42.930 --> 01:49:44.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The girl just beaten up.</v>

2826
01:49:44.491 --> 01:49:46.320
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that had been then she waves at test</v>

2827
01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:48.080
<v Speaker 3>booze like a motherfucker.</v>

2828
01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:49.413
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She should be able to out to russel boy </v>

2829
01:49:51.361 --> 01:49:53.950
<v Speaker 1>or he should be allowed to wrestle boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2830
01:49:53.951 --> 01:49:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever man.</v>

2831
01:49:55.331 --> 01:49:55.961
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2832
01:49:55.961 --> 01:49:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you're taking a high school girl and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're filling her up with testosterone,</v>

2833
01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:01.270
<v Speaker 1>with injections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2834
01:50:01.570 --> 01:50:02.403
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're allowing you to wrestle </v>

2835
01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:06.760
<v Speaker 1>girls that aren't on testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking cheating.</v>

2836
01:50:06.970 --> 01:50:07.803
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she was just a girl and she wasn't </v>

2837
01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:11.073
<v Speaker 1>like trying to transition into a man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found out that she was winning the </v>

2838
01:50:14.291 --> 01:50:16.810
<v Speaker 1>state championship as a woman or as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

2839
01:50:16.811 --> 01:50:20.080
<v Speaker 1>rather by taking steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would take it away from it.</v>

2840
01:50:20.250 --> 01:50:22.270
<v Speaker 1>She would say she's cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd be,</v>

2841
01:50:22.330 --> 01:50:26.140
<v Speaker 1>there'd be an uproar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not let her wrestle.</v>

2842
01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not let her wrestling with the law.</v>

2843
01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:29.501
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if they go,</v>

2844
01:50:29.501 --> 01:50:33.790
<v Speaker 1>we can't wrestle with the boys and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>just can't rest that all the rest of the</v>

2845
01:50:33.791 --> 01:50:35.530
<v Speaker 1>boys more don't wrestle.</v>

2846
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I would say she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what she wants.</v>

2847
01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:39.780
<v Speaker 1>What's the rest of the boys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2848
01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:44.050
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're these zero reserves.</v>

2849
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2850
01:50:45.851 --> 01:50:46.601
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>

2851
01:50:46.601 --> 01:50:47.021
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2852
01:50:47.021 --> 01:50:51.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to choose to go that </v>
<v Speaker 1>path of this transitioning to a female,</v>

2853
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:52.383
<v Speaker 1>then you give up your right to wrestle </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't have a division for </v>

2854
01:50:54.431 --> 01:50:56.480
<v Speaker 1>that vet and get and we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough wrestling.</v>

2855
01:50:56.590 --> 01:51:00.370
<v Speaker 1>She's transitioning to he and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fair.</v>

2856
01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.780
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was the other way,</v>

2857
01:51:01.781 --> 01:51:06.130
<v Speaker 1>it would be more fair because like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a man and you're transitioning to</v>

2858
01:51:06.131 --> 01:51:06.964
<v Speaker 1>be a woman and they make you wrestle men</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're going to be at a </v>

2859
01:51:09.671 --> 01:51:10.504
<v Speaker 1>disadvantage because you are taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone blockers or you're getting </v>

2860
01:51:13.451 --> 01:51:15.190
<v Speaker 1>castrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're losing your test to goals,</v>

2861
01:51:15.191 --> 01:51:16.810
<v Speaker 1>your whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2862
01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:19.360
<v Speaker 1>you are at a disadvantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You that aspect.</v>

2863
01:51:19.361 --> 01:51:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's at a disadvantage now transitioning</v>

2864
01:51:21.971 --> 01:51:22.804
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's added a massive advantage </v>

2865
01:51:24.431 --> 01:51:26.500
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transitioning to a man there.</v>

2866
01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:27.333
<v Speaker 1>He's on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're got up the kids on steroids on </v>

2867
01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:30.513
<v Speaker 1>100% and probably a lot of them probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it because they're trying to </v>

2868
01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:34.990
<v Speaker 1>turn him into a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2869
01:51:35.010 --> 01:51:35.843
<v Speaker 1>It's all nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know like where was this 30 years </v>

01:56:08.370 --> 01:56:09.203
<v Speaker 1>And they sent him back on a technicality</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he wasn't going to school cause </v>

2970
01:56:12.721 --> 01:56:15.300
<v Speaker 1>he stopped going to class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what can you do a student visa?</v>

2971
01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:17.610
<v Speaker 1>What they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They deported him.</v>

2972
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:18.833
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2973
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2974
01:56:19.801 --> 01:56:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think we prevented the tragedy.</v>

2975
01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2976
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:24.510
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what they should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2977
01:56:24.511 --> 01:56:25.344
<v Speaker 1>would this lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say they stopped at two in the </v>

2978
01:56:26.491 --> 01:56:29.430
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's in a car and the Dad,</v>

2979
01:56:29.490 --> 01:56:32.130
<v Speaker 1>the dad who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she came from,</v>

2980
01:56:32.131 --> 01:56:33.600
<v Speaker 1>his seat goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2981
01:56:33.601 --> 01:56:34.434
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

2982
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:37.140
<v Speaker 1>she's gonna do something bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think we've seen signs,</v>

2983
01:56:37.141 --> 01:56:40.320
<v Speaker 1>we've known her since she was a day old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys should do something about it.</v>

2984
01:56:40.650 --> 01:56:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should go out.</v>

2985
01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:43.440
<v Speaker 1>We talked to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems all right.</v>

2986
01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe take her in for the night too </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2987
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.903
<v Speaker 1>Talk to the therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if she doesn't do anything and then </v>

2988
01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:49.434
<v Speaker 1>she does like you people are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable and get those eyebrows in </v>

2989
01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:55.530
<v Speaker 1>class or in jail for that video of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing those squats and the jumps,</v>

2990

<v Speaker 1>that workout video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hairball of those eyes crazy that she's </v>

2991
01:56:59.251 --> 01:57:00.084
<v Speaker 1>not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a different plant horror movie </v>

2992
01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:02.460
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

2993
01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:03.353
<v Speaker 1>and then she's mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not getting fricking revenue from </v>

2994
01:57:05.311 --> 01:57:07.920
<v Speaker 1>the Youtube and youtube like ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your videos suck lady.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>

2996
01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:10.493
<v Speaker 1>You didn't come up in the open mic </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit so you don't have a phd in </v>

2997
01:57:13.051 --> 01:57:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Psychos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

2998
01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:17.123
<v Speaker 1>Tony Hinchcliffe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these dudes that have been in the </v>

2999
01:57:19.201 --> 01:57:24.201
<v Speaker 1>grind like I remember a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're fucking crazy people.</v>

3000
01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:26.513
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of open micros </v>
<v Speaker 1>who think that they're really funny and </v>

3001
01:57:29.161 --> 01:57:29.994
<v Speaker 1>they can't get work and they're angry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and they're really fucking </v>

3002
01:57:31.831 --> 01:57:34.590
<v Speaker 1>crazy and killed Tony when I've been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like two or three times.</v>

3003
01:57:34.590 --> 01:57:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill Tony is a primary example.</v>

3004
01:57:36.961 --> 01:57:39.210
<v Speaker 1>You go there and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck am I watching?</v>

3005
01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:40.253
<v Speaker 1>And if someone tries to tell that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe you should connect more with </v>

3006
01:57:42.361 --> 01:57:43.760
<v Speaker 1>the crop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I connect the neck,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're laughing.</v>

3013

<v Speaker 1>They laugh at you until he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing cause you're fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't know what the fuck you're </v>

3016
01:57:58.831 --> 01:57:59.820
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony was like,</v>

3017
01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:01.440
<v Speaker 1>get off the stage.</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>

3020
01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see,</v>

3021
01:58:07.051 --> 01:58:07.884
<v Speaker 1>you see that too on American idol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be some crazy dude like my mom </v>

3022

<v Speaker 1>thinks I'm the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the best things.</v>

3023
01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:13.193
<v Speaker 1>Lionel Richie and they get up and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just completely bomb and then they talk </v>

3024
01:58:16.151 --> 01:58:19.500
<v Speaker 1>shit to the experts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys just don't know what you want.</v>

3025
01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Well you have to look at people as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

3026
01:58:22.050 --> 01:58:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Right now if you look at people as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole like physically,</v>

3027
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:25.823
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are built like you </v>

3028
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:28.590
<v Speaker 1>and there's people that have built like </v>
<v Speaker 1>vern troyer.</v>

3029
01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:30.630
<v Speaker 1>That's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3030
01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:31.770
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

3031
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:32.670
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's does.</v>

3032
01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:36.300
<v Speaker 1>It's also brilliant mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point is it's come on seven.</v>

3033
01:58:36.330 --> 01:58:38.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a roll of the dice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing with everything.</v>

3034
01:58:38.490 --> 01:58:40.170
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with your mind as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3035
01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:43.090
<v Speaker 1>It just is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mine varies widely.</v>

3036
01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:44.133
<v Speaker 1>It varies racially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It varies interracially it varies age </v>

3037
01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:49.013
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can have a 50 year old black </v>

3038
01:58:51.731 --> 01:58:52.564
<v Speaker 1>guy that's a smart guy you ever met in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life and you're going to have a 50 </v>

3039
01:58:55.241 --> 01:58:58.720
<v Speaker 1>year old white guy who is a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>moron and you're going to have a 50 year</v>

3040
01:58:58.721 --> 01:58:59.554
<v Speaker 1>old woman who was out of her fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and you're going to have a 50 year </v>

3041
01:59:02.531 --> 01:59:04.650
<v Speaker 1>old woman who's a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3042
01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:07.150
<v Speaker 1>physicist and you're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you have,</v>

3043
01:59:07.151 --> 01:59:07.984
<v Speaker 1>every combination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every combination of smart and stupid </v>

3044
01:59:10.601 --> 01:59:13.660
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tall and thin people vary.</v>

3045
01:59:13.690 --> 01:59:17.080
<v Speaker 1>But they also vary with how crazy they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

3046
01:59:17.110 --> 01:59:17.943
<v Speaker 1>But also that's a variable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think some people are crazy and then </v>

3047
01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:22.090
<v Speaker 1>they find a passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run with it.</v>

3048
01:59:22.091 --> 01:59:22.924
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's music comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then some of those crazy people who </v>

3049
01:59:26.711 --> 01:59:29.440
<v Speaker 1>are different than the others in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school get made fun of,</v>

3050
01:59:29.441 --> 01:59:32.380
<v Speaker 1>get bullied and then that craziness </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into darkness.</v>

3051
01:59:32.410 --> 01:59:35.980
<v Speaker 1>And then they get ahold of Ak 47 then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you get the mass shootings.</v>

3052
01:59:36.010 --> 01:59:36.843
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's experiences with those </v>

3053
01:59:38.141 --> 01:59:38.974
<v Speaker 1>crazy people and maybe they turned the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right direction and they do something </v>

3054
01:59:41.141 --> 01:59:42.250
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write great songs,</v>

3055
01:59:42.251 --> 01:59:43.084
<v Speaker 1>come up with a great bid or come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great tv show or that person gets </v>

3056
01:59:45.671 --> 01:59:47.920
<v Speaker 1>bullied so bad the direction they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dark,</v>

3057
01:59:47.921 --> 01:59:48.754
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundred percent crazy mind does crazy </v>

3058
01:59:50.801 --> 01:59:51.461
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3059
01:59:51.461 --> 01:59:52.294
<v Speaker 1>so 100% physical abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual abuse along with that </v>

3060
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:56.343
<v Speaker 1>medications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure medications could do it and every </v>

3061
01:59:59.291 --> 02:00:00.940
<v Speaker 1>single mass shooters on medications.</v>

3062
02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:03.940
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at the combination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different factors,</v>

3063
02:00:03.941 --> 02:00:04.774
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you see that lady crying </v>
<v Speaker 1>in her car at two o'clock in the </v>

3064
02:00:07.421 --> 02:00:08.201
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a cop.</v>

3065
02:00:08.201 --> 02:00:09.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

3066
02:00:09.521 --> 02:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>what do you think you think she's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like?</v>

3067
02:00:11.081 --> 02:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I knew when I looked at her that she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go on to youtube and shoot that</v>

3068
02:00:13.781 --> 02:00:14.860
<v Speaker 1>place up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's no way.</v>

3069
02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:15.993
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3070
02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:17.740
<v Speaker 1>But how close cruise kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

3071
02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:18.753
<v Speaker 1>They came to see him two years before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided he wasn't a threat and the </v>

3072
02:00:21.731 --> 02:00:24.550
<v Speaker 1>people like the FBI's and competent know</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 months later.</v>

3073
02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably got fucking crazier,</v>

3074
02:00:27.170 --> 02:00:28.870
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in 24 months.</v>

3075
02:00:28.930 --> 02:00:31.630
<v Speaker 1>His mom wound up dying like six months </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that,</v>

3076
02:00:31.631 --> 02:00:32.464
<v Speaker 1>so that probably fucked him up too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a whole host of </v>

3077
02:00:34.211 --> 02:00:35.170
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but events.</v>

3078
02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he never did it before.</v>

3079
02:00:36.761 --> 02:00:40.370
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck can you predict these </v>
<v Speaker 1>random shooters?</v>

3080
02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're going to do.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's talking about you on a rose.</v>

3122
02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:15.010
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

3126
02:02:21.051 --> 02:02:22.070
<v Speaker 3>overshadowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3127
02:02:22.100 --> 02:02:23.900
<v Speaker 3>it has been overshadowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy one,</v>

3128
02:02:23.901 --> 02:02:24.734
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because nobody expected it to go </v>

3129
02:02:26.121 --> 02:02:30.220
<v Speaker 3>down the way it did in the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3130
02:02:30.290 --> 02:02:32.970
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the rematch you on is on weight.</v>

3131
02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:36.110
<v Speaker 3>She's way lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was one 22 last week,</v>

3132
02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she's just a few pounds away.</v>

3133
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Here's my problem with this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hit,</v>

3134
02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:43.553
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might stop making pigs that said on a </v>

3135
02:02:44.751 --> 02:02:46.880
<v Speaker 3>podcast yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make me feel good when I pick</v>

3136
02:02:46.881 --> 02:02:48.410
<v Speaker 3>against people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make me feel good.</v>

3137
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:49.603
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people don't do pigs and they </v>

3138
02:02:51.921 --> 02:02:53.870
<v Speaker 3>come to me for pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think's gonna Happen?</v>

3139
02:02:55.950 --> 02:02:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long time I thought,</v>

3140
02:02:57.870 --> 02:02:59.010
<v Speaker 3>oof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rose Rose,</v>

3141
02:02:59.011 --> 02:03:01.260
<v Speaker 3>she's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know rose right from Denver.</v>

3142
02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:03.930
<v Speaker 3>She landed that left Hook and trevor </v>
<v Speaker 3>teaches that.</v>

3143
02:03:03.931 --> 02:03:06.330
<v Speaker 3>And Pat Barry teaches that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what to do.</v>

3144
02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Amazing fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they fight,</v>

3145
02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:09.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or four times.</v>

3146
02:03:10.230 --> 02:03:11.063
<v Speaker 3>But if they do a rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they should give you on the </v>

3147
02:03:12.851 --> 02:03:13.684
<v Speaker 3>immediate rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rose me a little bit of trouble cause </v>

3148
02:03:15.391 --> 02:03:18.600
<v Speaker 3>you ana is a fucking machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the caveat to that.</v>

3149
02:03:18.810 --> 02:03:20.820
<v Speaker 3>When I see you on a do interviews and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>

3150
02:03:20.970 --> 02:03:23.070
<v Speaker 3>it was my nutritionist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was this person,</v>

3151
02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:24.450
<v Speaker 3>it was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was this.</v>

3152
02:03:24.630 --> 02:03:27.420
<v Speaker 3>She never once has she owned it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking credibility.</v>

3153
02:03:27.421 --> 02:03:28.254
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way a world champion </v>

3154
02:03:29.541 --> 02:03:31.480
<v Speaker 3>speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way it all.</v>

3155
02:03:31.481 --> 02:03:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Someone talks and when I see a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse,</v>

3156
02:03:33.931 --> 02:03:35.040
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

3157
02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:37.350
<v Speaker 3>you have a hole in your boat and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut.</v>

3158
02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:40.590
<v Speaker 3>You're masking it with duct tape and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to get back to this point.</v>

3159
02:03:41.070 --> 02:03:42.560
<v Speaker 3>You're just math.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not solving that.</v>

3160
02:03:42.561 --> 02:03:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Actually patching that up and so you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>susceptible again and now you,</v>

3161
02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:49.800
<v Speaker 3>you're talking like that never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a fluke.</v>

3162
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:50.833
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rose is pretty fucking good and if you </v>

3163
02:03:51.931 --> 02:03:52.764
<v Speaker 3>don't respect her again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's your nutritionist is why </v>

3164
02:03:54.631 --> 02:03:56.490
<v Speaker 3>he left that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're probably gonna lose again.</v>

3165
02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:58.690
<v Speaker 3>You might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might be right.</v>

3166
02:03:58.691 --> 02:03:59.524
<v Speaker 3>It's only thing that bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you on is one of the greatest </v>

3167
02:04:00.751 --> 02:04:02.250
<v Speaker 3>games of all time with the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters,</v>

3168
02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:03.960
<v Speaker 3>but it's just when I see them like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3169
02:04:03.961 --> 02:04:04.830
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just going,</v>

3170
02:04:05.010 --> 02:04:06.450
<v Speaker 3>you're going about the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>

3171
02:04:06.630 --> 02:04:08.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I even talked to Rhonda and you know,</v>

3172
02:04:08.431 --> 02:04:09.810
<v Speaker 3>she said she had to wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come like,</v>

3173
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:13.170
<v Speaker 3>no one's dealt with loss is worse than </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda.</v>

3174
02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:16.380
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to preface that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to reference that at all.</v>

3175
02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see that out of you,</v>

3176
02:04:18.141 --> 02:04:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Ana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has so much more work to do.</v>

3177
02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3178
02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:22.553

<v Speaker 3>you want to had a long career in Moy </v>

3179
02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Tai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long career.</v>

3180
02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:27.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of fights.</v>

3181
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tons.</v>

3182
02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Lot of kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sparring,</v>

3183
02:04:30.931 --> 02:04:34.530
<v Speaker 3>a lot of MMA sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes your changes goes,</v>

3184
02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:36.091
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

3185
02:04:36.091 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 3>this is a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you change,</v>

3186
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get the Chin thing too.</v>

3187
02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3188
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's too early to call for that,</v>

3189
02:04:43.081 --> 02:04:45.690
<v Speaker 1>especially at that weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for her it was more,</v>

3190
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:46.583
<v Speaker 1>she just wasn't being respectful of rose</v>
<v Speaker 1>or thought she was gonna walk through </v>

3191
02:04:49.201 --> 02:04:52.230
<v Speaker 1>and all the shit talking and she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and rose is a different animal.</v>

3192
02:04:52.231 --> 02:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she reminds me of Brian or take a little</v>

3193
02:04:54.211 --> 02:04:55.044
<v Speaker 1>bit where she's very dangerous on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on conventional and the certain spots </v>

3194
02:04:58.951 --> 02:04:59.784
<v Speaker 1>you can't train for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's that type of animal with </v>

3195
02:05:01.890 --> 02:05:04.350
<v Speaker 1>similar Brian Ortega.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with Yolanda,</v>

3196
02:05:04.750 --> 02:05:08.070
<v Speaker 1>if a gun to my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say you ana winds by decision.</v>

3197
02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:11.610
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate bacon.</v>

3198
02:05:11.670 --> 02:05:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Pigs makes me feel badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3199
02:05:13.291 --> 02:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>making picks is tough man because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you're going to piss people off and</v>

3200
02:05:17.521 --> 02:05:19.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh we're fucking rooting against.</v>

3201
02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:20.360
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3202
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:24.000
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at the analysis of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the fight.</v>

3203
02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I thought rose was in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3204
02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:27.113
<v Speaker 1>you want is very hard to take down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her Stanhope is world class and I think </v>

3205
02:05:29.881 --> 02:05:30.714
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could very well pick rows apart and </v>

3206
02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3207
02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:34.253
<v Speaker 1>and crack or she's coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when she hit her with that left and </v>

3208
02:05:37.321 --> 02:05:38.154
<v Speaker 1>she hit her before that and hurt her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when she hit her with that left </v>

3209
02:05:40.801 --> 02:05:41.341
<v Speaker 1>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3210
02:05:41.341 --> 02:05:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive too.</v>

3211
02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:48.200
<v Speaker 1>She looks good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And rose like a on the embedded rose was</v>

3212
02:05:48.451 --> 02:05:53.451
<v Speaker 1>a pat barry takes a giant box of tennis </v>
<v Speaker 1>balls and throws tennis balls at her and</v>

3213
02:05:53.761 --> 02:05:55.770
<v Speaker 1>she's popping tennis balls in the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

3214
02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>she looks fucking solid and rose to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceilings.</v>

3215
02:05:59.310 --> 02:06:00.143
<v Speaker 1>We're just seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is so much room for growth to show </v>

3216
02:06:01.741 --> 02:06:06.240
<v Speaker 1>young and pat and she trev around her </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now forever people are like,</v>

3217
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be world champion.</v>

3218
02:06:07.650 --> 02:06:10.560
<v Speaker 1>And when everyone tells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coaches tell fives all the time,</v>

3219
02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:11.820
<v Speaker 1>but what actually happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

3220
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not bullshitting.</v>

3221
02:06:14.610 --> 02:06:15.443
<v Speaker 1>They're not just saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it when she actually </v>

3222
02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:18.113
<v Speaker 1>believes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're dealing with different thug </v>

3223
02:06:19.351 --> 02:06:21.150
<v Speaker 1>rose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with different Yolanda,</v>

3224
02:06:21.230 --> 02:06:22.063
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ana doesn't think she's the greatest </v>

3225
02:06:23.071 --> 02:06:26.310
<v Speaker 1>gift to the MMA world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that con combination,</v>

3226
02:06:26.311 --> 02:06:28.860
<v Speaker 1>it's such a fascinating and fight and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's talking about it.</v>

3227
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:29.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well everyone was so caught up in this </v>

3228
02:06:31.170 --> 02:06:32.003
<v Speaker 1>cancellation and the Ferguson could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight was so huge for the hardcores for </v>

3229
02:06:36.181 --> 02:06:37.014
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also one of those things where </v>

3230
02:06:38.730 --> 02:06:39.563
<v Speaker 1>with rose coming into this fight now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to make any excuses for the </v>

3231
02:06:42.721 --> 02:06:44.220
<v Speaker 1>last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3232
02:06:44.221 --> 02:06:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm really interested to see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when they square off.</v>

3233
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait for that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each other is yawn again and do the same</v>

3234
02:06:50.341 --> 02:06:53.220
<v Speaker 1>talk and again and roads can reciting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bible.</v>

3235
02:06:53.250 --> 02:06:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

3236
02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'll want to can do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same talk and you don't.</v>

3237
02:06:57.241 --> 02:06:58.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't think she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a fluke.</v>

3238
02:06:58.771 --> 02:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing the exact same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3239
02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:01.133
<v Speaker 1>I think rose going to stare right </v>
<v Speaker 1>through her fucking soul again and be </v>

3240
02:07:03.031 --> 02:07:03.840
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the champion.</v>

3241
02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:04.673
<v Speaker 1>When you talk a gang of shit at someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just stare right through you </v>

3242
02:07:07.891 --> 02:07:09.660
<v Speaker 1>and then they merch you in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

3243
02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:13.230
<v Speaker 1>It's very tough to talk all that shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second time.</v>

3244
02:07:13.410 --> 02:07:15.920
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a sign if you want.</v>

3245
02:07:15.930 --> 02:07:16.763
<v Speaker 1>It isn't respecting rose again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If she gets up there and start talking </v>

3246
02:07:19.351 --> 02:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would put a ton of money on rose.</v>

3247
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I see her doing the same things,</v>

3248
02:07:23.701 --> 02:07:24.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

3249
02:07:24.271 --> 02:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>You learn nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go there.</v>

3250
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3251
02:07:26.761 --> 02:07:29.070
<v Speaker 1>it's whether or not rose can clipper </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3252
02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:30.053
<v Speaker 1>If rose charges in and clips or again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the thing about a striker </v>

3253
02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 1>always worried being taken</v>

3254
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.480
<v Speaker 3>down is more likely to get hit with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot like Kevin randomly when he knocked</v>

3255
02:07:40.481 --> 02:07:41.314
<v Speaker 3>out Mirko Cro cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing like Kevin was the threat as </v>

3256
02:07:45.011 --> 02:07:45.844
<v Speaker 3>a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leaps in with a left hook and catches </v>

3257
02:07:47.861 --> 02:07:49.510
<v Speaker 3>him right on the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knocked him the fuck out.</v>

3258
02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:52.960
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real correlation there.</v>

3259
02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:53.823
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be surprised if you on a sole</v>
<v Speaker 3>focus on improving her stand up and you </v>

3260
02:07:57.181 --> 02:07:57.810
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like God,</v>

3261
02:07:57.810 --> 02:07:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I caught this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get overwhelmed or to stand up.</v>

3262
02:07:59.771 --> 02:08:00.604
<v Speaker 3>She gets submitted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She overlooked the submission game of </v>

3263
02:08:02.231 --> 02:08:04.210
<v Speaker 3>rose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is actually rose's best weapon.</v>

3264
02:08:04.240 --> 02:08:05.610
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking bro,</v>

3265
02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:08.010
<v Speaker 3>we might see rose throw a flying arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

3266
02:08:08.020 --> 02:08:11.050
<v Speaker 3>We might see rose wild shit doesn't care</v>
<v Speaker 3>about being on her back.</v>

3267
02:08:11.170 --> 02:08:13.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's fast.</v>

3268
02:08:13.930 --> 02:08:15.730
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes for shit.</v>

3269
02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:18.640
<v Speaker 3>She like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a wild explosive person,</v>

3270
02:08:19.090 --> 02:08:19.390
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3271
02:08:19.390 --> 02:08:21.760
<v Speaker 3>And she's a really interesting thinker </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

3272
02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:23.650
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had a tough life man.</v>

3273
02:08:23.670 --> 02:08:24.503
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tough life growing up and develop this </v>

3274
02:08:26.321 --> 02:08:27.154
<v Speaker 3>very strong mind because controlled </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos is what I taught and she's </v>

3275
02:08:30.101 --> 02:08:31.160
<v Speaker 3>brilliant at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3276
02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:33.430
<v Speaker 3>I think what else about fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this?</v>

3277
02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:34.870
<v Speaker 3>Not that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

3278
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:35.743
<v Speaker 3>I'm more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost more excited for that fight to </v>

3279
02:08:36.691 --> 02:08:39.940
<v Speaker 3>anything now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's fascinating to me is everyone</v>

3280
02:08:39.941 --> 02:08:41.020
<v Speaker 3>talks about conor Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3281
02:08:41.021 --> 02:08:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you're talking about one</v>
<v Speaker 3>55 and with connor and Max Holloway.</v>

3282
02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Connor's never looked back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went Back,</v>

3283
02:08:47.451 --> 02:08:48.284
<v Speaker 3>fight that guy back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though I'm better than the thing </v>

3284
02:08:49.271 --> 02:08:53.050
<v Speaker 3>that gets caught her out of bed I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the challenge and making history.</v>

3285
02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:56.140
<v Speaker 3>And I think if Khabib or Max where to </v>
<v Speaker 3>win,</v>

3286
02:08:56.260 --> 02:08:58.920
<v Speaker 3>that would be a new challenge and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>be an underdog against,</v>

3287
02:08:58.930 --> 02:09:00.100
<v Speaker 3>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with Max Holloway,</v>

3288
02:09:00.101 --> 02:09:00.934
<v Speaker 3>the FT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a history at 55 especially if </v>

3289
02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:03.760
<v Speaker 3>could be where to win.</v>

3290
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:06.100
<v Speaker 3>I think we see connotate that fight now </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he goes,</v>

3291
02:09:06.190 --> 02:09:07.420
<v Speaker 3>that's about frown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

3292
02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:10.090
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm the best at moving backwards </v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting dudes.</v>

3293
02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I bet you I can beat that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we see him.</v>

3294
02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:15.730
<v Speaker 3>I think we see him take that fight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never said that before.</v>

3295
02:09:15.731 --> 02:09:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always,</v>

3296
02:09:16.450 --> 02:09:18.030
<v Speaker 3>I know Dana said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh they're going to fight and rush.</v>

3297
02:09:18.031 --> 02:09:18.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3298
02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:19.333
<v Speaker 3>why would counter fighting him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think about like when you </v>

3299
02:09:20.651 --> 02:09:23.350
<v Speaker 3>think of all the challenges and college </v>
<v Speaker 3>career and what gets them going,</v>

3300
02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:25.360
<v Speaker 3>it's not people behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always when people go,</v>

3301
02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:27.190
<v Speaker 3>that guy's the best of you is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me that guy.</v>

3302
02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max Holloway.</v>

3303
02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3304
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:34.000
<v Speaker 3>If Max wins for sure they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rematch.</v>

3305
02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:39.030
<v Speaker 3>100% a hundred percent the thing about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Khabib is you always got a wonder who is</v>

3306
02:09:39.821 --> 02:09:41.950
<v Speaker 3>avoiding him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a difference there.</v>

3307

02:12:24.890 --> 02:12:26.540
<v Speaker 1>who's a good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>GSP.</v>

3377
02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:28.123
<v Speaker 1>Well you haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't know who ben Askern </v>

3378
02:12:30.391 --> 02:12:32.900
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is he fought in bellator for</v>

3379
02:12:32.901 --> 02:12:36.500
<v Speaker 1>so long and then even when bell tours </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten bigger on Spike TV,</v>

3380
02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:38.840
<v Speaker 1>he was off in one FC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you have.</v>

3381
02:12:38.841 --> 02:12:41.530
<v Speaker 1>No ones are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Asks from fans now,</v>

3382
02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:45.260
<v Speaker 1>but we are hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the casual fan has no idea.</v>

3383
02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Like who is this guy with the curly hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sending to his death,</v>

3384
02:12:50.050 --> 02:12:52.910
<v Speaker 1>but we can sell it because he speaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3385
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>He's a beast on the mind and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pin it,</v>

3386
02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:57.650
<v Speaker 1>gets hit an Olympian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never,</v>

3387
02:12:57.670 --> 02:13:01.550
<v Speaker 1>he was undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never been hit against Khabib.</v>

3388
02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we call it the Cold War,</v>

3389
02:13:03.201 --> 02:13:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I think in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly me.</v>

3390
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:06.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big Ben,</v>

3391
02:13:06.810 --> 02:13:10.280
<v Speaker 1>her and Dick Rider and Jimmy Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's also a big Ben Aspirin Dick,</v>

3392
02:13:10.300 --> 02:13:11.133

<v Speaker 1>We could sell the shit out of it.</v>

3394
02:13:14.091 --> 02:13:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I could hype the shit out to be 100% </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest in the process.</v>

3395
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I think he's something special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is grappling is very unusual.</v>

3396
02:13:21.231 --> 02:13:22.064
<v Speaker 1>Very difficult to prepare for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to deal with Khabib </v>

3397
02:13:24.140 --> 02:13:27.980
<v Speaker 1>against a guy who can neutralize his </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

3398
02:13:27.981 --> 02:13:30.530
<v Speaker 1>and then we see like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did we see Khabib on his back?</v>

3399
02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:32.340

<v Speaker 3>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3402
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:37.660
<v Speaker 3>What about Ben asking on this?</v>

3449
02:15:24.151 --> 02:15:27.120
<v Speaker 3>suited to one fc because they allow </v>
<v Speaker 3>those knees to the head on the ground.</v>

3450
02:15:27.121 --> 02:15:29.910

02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:22.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3471
02:16:22.681 --> 02:16:25.020

<v Speaker 3>you'll ever see.</v>

3472
02:16:25.850 --> 02:16:26.850
<v Speaker 3>That was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

3473
02:16:26.851 --> 02:16:28.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that in my,</v>

3474
02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 3>that's horrible.</v>

3475
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.510
<v Speaker 1>That one's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy was,</v>

3476
02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:34.150
<v Speaker 1>he was already hurt and out of it before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3477
02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:35.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the average casual adult soccer </v>

3478
02:16:38.501 --> 02:16:42.460
<v Speaker 1>player can kick a ball with a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot pound force.</v>

3479
02:16:42.970 --> 02:16:45.700
<v Speaker 1>The average professional soccer player </v>
<v Speaker 1>can kick it about 1000,</v>

3480
02:16:45.701 --> 02:16:48.460
<v Speaker 1>200 foot pound force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My educated guesses,</v>

3481
02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:51.550
<v Speaker 1>elite highly trained martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform very similar to the professional</v>

3482
02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:52.690
<v Speaker 1>segment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

3483
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.863
<v Speaker 1>you put somebody down in their hands and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees and I kick him in the head like </v>

3484
02:16:55.541 --> 02:16:57.520
<v Speaker 1>that can be a lot more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucked.</v>

3485
02:16:57.840 --> 02:16:59.710
<v Speaker 1>He might broken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed a guy.</v>

3486
02:16:59.830 --> 02:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to see them.</v>

3487
02:17:00.741 --> 02:17:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could kill somebody doing that.</v>

3488
02:17:02.381 --> 02:17:05.290
<v Speaker 1>You literally could snap their neck is </v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So fast.</v>

3659
02:24:07.101 --> 02:24:08.250
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't get him a color picture.</v>

3660
02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:09.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3665
02:24:21.211 --> 02:24:22.044

<v Speaker 3>they're fighting an 85 and they caught </v>

3666
02:24:25.801 --> 02:24:27.840
<v Speaker 3>them before the wake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes zero sense.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That makes zero sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One guys,</v>

<v Speaker 3>black black dye.</v>

<v Speaker 3>they don't have it right this time </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're not going to shout out.</v>

02:24:51.841 --> 02:24:52.790
<v Speaker 3>We're going to black and white for him.</v>

3679
02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:53.993
<v Speaker 3>We're going to let people know that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't really fought in the UFC before </v>

3680
02:24:57.121 --> 02:24:59.340
<v Speaker 3>so it give you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're still getting pictures.</v>

<v Speaker 3>man Pedis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3683
02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:06.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just bad streak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's on a rough streak.</v>

3684
02:25:06.721 --> 02:25:07.710
<v Speaker 3>He won his last one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3685
02:25:07.711 --> 02:25:09.830
<v Speaker 3>But then him find a 45 whoever told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3686
02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:12.120

<v Speaker 3>So what tell Holloway got his belt.</v>

3687
02:25:12.121 --> 02:25:15.840
<v Speaker 3>But I'm a Kevin Lee Fan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I say he did not submit.</v>

3688
02:25:15.841 --> 02:25:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Michael had it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should have let him,</v>

3689
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:20.880
<v Speaker 3>they should have let them go out and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have won,</v>

3690
02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:23.770
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't and he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3691
02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:25.450
<v Speaker 3>well we're in the same boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

3692
02:25:25.451 --> 02:25:27.610
<v Speaker 3>if it would have kept going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had been choked unconscious.</v>

3693
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not.</v>

3701
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:41.940
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what Gracie,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and for Gosh Sakes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I love Chia Aza.</v>

3704
02:25:45.730 --> 02:25:50.680
<v Speaker 3>That's a far cry from pigs and Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also he went to go tap.</v>

3705
02:25:51.170 --> 02:25:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Have you look at the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the video.</v>

3706
02:25:52.791 --> 02:25:54.370
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he panics a little bit.</v>

3707
02:25:54.430 --> 02:25:55.480
<v Speaker 3>And now he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

3708
02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:56.613
<v Speaker 3>he's a black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he said he knows what the fuck </v>

3709
02:25:58.601 --> 02:25:59.434
<v Speaker 3>he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was going hot and trading on his </v>

3710
02:26:00.461 --> 02:26:01.294
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you hear him talk about it that he </v>

3711
02:26:02.291 --> 02:26:03.124
<v Speaker 3>tightened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he put all his focus on his neck and he </v>

3712
02:26:04.251 --> 02:26:05.790
<v Speaker 3>let his hands go and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>tightening.</v>

3713
02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:07.353
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have Kevin Lee who's a fucking </v>

3714
02:26:08.831 --> 02:26:10.670
<v Speaker 3>anaconda around your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3715
02:26:10.690 --> 02:26:12.970
<v Speaker 3>And has previous winds of rear naked </v>
<v Speaker 3>choke.</v>

3716
02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:14.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

3717
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.300
<v Speaker 3>They should have let it go on.</v>

3718
02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:18.370
<v Speaker 3>I think we'd been choked unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gotta let it go on.</v>

3719
02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:19.233
<v Speaker 3>You have to got to let it go on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only worse rest I've seen was the </v>

3720
02:26:21.521 --> 02:26:22.570
<v Speaker 3>ref in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3721
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Joseph Parker fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the judge.</v>

3722
02:26:25.090 --> 02:26:27.520
<v Speaker 3>The Ref would not fucking let these guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

3723
02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Anytime he got close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he jumped in there and push them away.</v>

3724
02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Do you think that favored?</v>

3725
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.823
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they thought it was going to </v>

3726
02:26:33.281 --> 02:26:34.900
<v Speaker 3>favor anthony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joshua for sure.</v>

3727
02:26:34.901 --> 02:26:37.420
<v Speaker 3>They want him to win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually favored.</v>

3728
02:26:37.570 --> 02:26:39.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3729
02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:41.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3730
02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:43.150
<v Speaker 3>you agree with the decision?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3731
02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:44.013
<v Speaker 3>Parker definitely lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can only agree where people are </v>

3732
02:26:46.411 --> 02:26:47.244
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh Auntie Joshua look batty an off </v>

3733
02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:48.521
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3734
02:26:48.521 --> 02:26:49.354
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you morons.</v>

3735
02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:50.860
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and polly mentioned this,</v>

3736
02:26:50.861 --> 02:26:53.080
<v Speaker 3>the distance they fall in such a high </v>
<v Speaker 3>level,</v>

3737
02:26:53.081 --> 02:26:55.780
<v Speaker 3>no one got hit and Parker's such a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>boxer.</v>

3738
02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:58.000
<v Speaker 3>His Jab is so goddamn good.</v>

3739
02:26:58.210 --> 02:27:00.790
<v Speaker 3>It was just a battle of straight skill </v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3740
02:27:00.850 --> 02:27:03.910
<v Speaker 3>And I thought it was so impressive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people walk away from gun man,</v>

3741
02:27:03.911 --> 02:27:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Joshua is not that good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It man,</v>

3742
02:27:05.711 --> 02:27:07.650
<v Speaker 3>he's better than I thought he can box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3743
02:27:07.651 --> 02:27:08.484
<v Speaker 3>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's cause you understand the </v>

3744
02:27:09.641 --> 02:27:10.474
<v Speaker 3>people that say what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that good cause he didn't win </v>

3745
02:27:11.531 --> 02:27:14.450
<v Speaker 3>by spectacular knockouts like Deontay </v>
<v Speaker 3>wilder.</v>

3746
02:27:14.470 --> 02:27:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wilder.</v>

3747
02:27:16.570 --> 02:27:18.130
<v Speaker 3>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

3748
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:22.000
<v Speaker 3>The wilder fight is very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>because while their talks a ton of shit,</v>

3749
02:27:22.330 --> 02:27:24.550
<v Speaker 3>he's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's brash,</v>

3750
02:27:24.610 --> 02:27:27.010
<v Speaker 3>he's got serious knockout power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

3751
02:27:27.150 --> 02:27:27.983
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fun to watch matt and he's like a </v>

3752
02:27:29.621 --> 02:27:31.480
<v Speaker 3>brash American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3753
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:32.830
<v Speaker 3>that's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great fight.</v>

3754
02:27:32.890 --> 02:27:35.510
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it was wilder.</v>

3755
02:27:35.511 --> 02:27:36.344
<v Speaker 3>I have to fight somebody first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like josh was going to fight </v>

3756
02:27:39.041 --> 02:27:40.490
<v Speaker 3>someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And wilders going fight song.</v>

3757
02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:41.380
<v Speaker 3>Why are they doing that?</v>

3758
02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:42.630
<v Speaker 3>That's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So stupid.</v>

3759
02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Dropbox in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>

3760
02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:45.243
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they build it up to make this big giant </v>

3761
02:27:46.451 --> 02:27:48.760
<v Speaker 3>event and when it comes off like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3762
02:27:48.761 --> 02:27:49.594
<v Speaker 3>it comes off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes off like Pacquiao versus </v>

3763
02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:53.500
<v Speaker 3>mayweather giant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the number one problem with boxing.</v>

3764
02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:55.420
<v Speaker 3>Give us the matchups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone wants to see.</v>

3765
02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:56.373
<v Speaker 3>That's why the UFC gain so much ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>because usually day and besides the </v>

3875
02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:29.130
<v Speaker 1>The problem with karate is we already </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about mma and we already know about</v>

3876
02:32:29.131 --> 02:32:29.964
<v Speaker 1>Muy Thai,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're allowed leg kicks and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the small gloves on.</v>

3878

<v Speaker 1>but I'll stand up.</v>

3879
02:32:38.700 --> 02:32:41.160
<v Speaker 1>It's all standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also then I can allow like kicks.</v>

3880
02:32:41.430 --> 02:32:42.990
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got a lot leg kicks.</v>

3881
02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:45.233
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they know a lot like cake boss just </v>

3882
02:32:47.650 --> 02:32:48.380
<v Speaker 1>to content or is it not?</v>

3883
02:32:48.380 --> 02:32:49.213
<v Speaker 1>I know it was promoter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I'm going to want to </v>

3884
02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:52.320
<v Speaker 1>find out next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would have,</v>

3885
02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I would hope that they allow leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like that.</v>

3886
02:32:56.311 --> 02:32:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Gloria doesn't allow elbows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straight Cope.</v>

3887
02:32:58.980 --> 02:33:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the sport.</v>

3888
02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:02.580
<v Speaker 1>The sport is if you're going to stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

3889
02:33:02.730 --> 02:33:04.410
<v Speaker 1>it should be more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

3890
02:33:04.411 --> 02:33:06.160
<v Speaker 1>that to me is the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rules of Morita.</v>

3891
02:33:06.180 --> 02:33:07.680
<v Speaker 1>You could throw a wheel kicks in Muay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thai,</v>

3892
02:33:07.860 --> 02:33:10.260
<v Speaker 1>you get through a flying psychics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do whatever the fuck you want,</v>

3893
02:33:10.350 --> 02:33:13.470
<v Speaker 1>but you also can do Moitai like knees to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body,</v>

3894
02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:14.333
<v Speaker 1>elbows to the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those super effective close range </v>

3895
02:33:16.531 --> 02:33:17.364
<v Speaker 1>techniques that glory doesn't allow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think their worry about with the </v>

3896
02:33:19.741 --> 02:33:21.510
<v Speaker 1>elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys aren't going to be able to fight,</v>

3897
02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:23.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close together because they'll both,</v>

3898
02:33:23.181 --> 02:33:24.480
<v Speaker 1>because of the cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

3899
02:33:24.481 --> 02:33:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather deal with that then not allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3900
02:33:26.260 --> 02:33:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh well I don't like the guys fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>close together.</v>

3901
02:33:28.381 --> 02:33:29.214
<v Speaker 1>I think that's super dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you have guys fight more than </v>

3902
02:33:32.101 --> 02:33:34.710
<v Speaker 1>one time and at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is fucking crazy.</v>

3903
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:35.783
<v Speaker 1>When you have guys fight two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times a night like Joe Schilling </v>

3904
02:33:37.321 --> 02:33:41.880
<v Speaker 1>did in the La last man standing event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is bananas like you are,</v>

3905
02:33:41.940 --> 02:33:42.773
<v Speaker 1>you're taking a giant chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hoping that someone doesn't get </v>

3906
02:33:46.111 --> 02:33:49.080
<v Speaker 1>severely concussed even in a win and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their first fight and then come back and</v>

3907
02:33:49.081 --> 02:33:50.550
<v Speaker 1>fight in the sense that make it fun </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

3908
02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:52.020
<v Speaker 1>like that's kind of the nature of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

3909
02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Like what about wrestling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can see double a's.</v>

3910
02:33:54.091 --> 02:33:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell getting head kicked,</v>

3911
02:33:56.130 --> 02:33:58.350
<v Speaker 1>they're cutting massive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are cutting massive weight,</v>

3912
02:33:58.380 --> 02:34:01.350
<v Speaker 1>but they're not getting head kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting getting head kicked in the first</v>

3913
02:34:01.351 --> 02:34:02.184
<v Speaker 1>round and getting up at the count of </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven and the people on later and </v>

3914
02:34:04.711 --> 02:34:08.430
<v Speaker 1>fighting and then getting head kicked </v>
<v Speaker 1>again an hour later.</v>

3915
02:34:08.610 --> 02:34:10.410
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

3916
02:34:10.830 --> 02:34:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to,</v>

3917
02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:17.440
<v Speaker 1>and also you don't get the best guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus the best guy in an even right?</v>

3918
02:34:17.921 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

3919
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:19.780
<v Speaker 3>if one guy wins by first round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knock out,</v>

3920
02:34:19.781 --> 02:34:22.290
<v Speaker 3>the other guy has a four round war like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Schilling doing.</v>

3921
02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:23.910
<v Speaker 3>He fought Simon Marcus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3922
02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Crazy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to three rounds.</v>

3923
02:34:26.231 --> 02:34:27.064
<v Speaker 3>It's a draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to the third and Joe had been </v>

3924
02:34:29.111 --> 02:34:32.930
<v Speaker 3>knocked down I think in that first and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then Joe's arched them in the fourth.</v>

3925
02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:35.350
<v Speaker 3>If you know the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3926
02:34:35.351 --> 02:34:36.184
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look how these guys just get through </v>

3927
02:34:37.361 --> 02:34:38.194
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've dealt with this and now it's </v>

3928
02:34:39.341 --> 02:34:40.540
<v Speaker 3>kind of cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3929
02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:41.493
<v Speaker 3>but we know the repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't write well then the </v>

3930
02:34:43.991 --> 02:34:45.790
<v Speaker 3>UFC should bring back a tournament to </v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

3931
02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not mad at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pride tournaments,</v>

3932
02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:50.590
<v Speaker 3>it's so old school it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are probably going to die because</v>

3933
02:34:50.591 --> 02:34:51.424
<v Speaker 3>God is so good now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's what you sign up for with the </v>

3934
02:34:53.231 --> 02:34:54.064
<v Speaker 3>problem as if one guy goes through three</v>
<v Speaker 3>rounds of hell and the other guy just </v>

3935
02:34:57.191 --> 02:35:00.940
<v Speaker 3>lands like a connor straight left hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>they did on Aldo and wins in 13 seconds.</v>

3936
02:35:00.940 --> 02:35:02.990
<v Speaker 3>It's just not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know and you know,</v>

3937
02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:04.413
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but however that guy pulled off that 13 </v>

3938
02:35:06.311 --> 02:35:08.950
<v Speaker 3>second knock out another guy had a war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

3939
02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:10.210
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

3940
02:35:10.660 --> 02:35:11.770
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3941
02:35:11.771 --> 02:35:12.604
<v Speaker 3>Gloria is the only organization right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that's mainstream where you could </v>

3942
02:35:14.921 --> 02:35:16.760
<v Speaker 3>watch guys fight more than once in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

3943
02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:18.180
<v Speaker 3>They do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>

3944
02:35:18.181 --> 02:35:19.014
<v Speaker 3>here's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do UFC is never going to do it in </v>

3945
02:35:20.531 --> 02:35:21.580
<v Speaker 3>most sports won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3946
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:23.900
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3947
02:35:23.901 --> 02:35:27.400
<v Speaker 3>it's a long show b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to market that it shouldn't be</v>

3948
02:35:27.401 --> 02:35:28.390
<v Speaker 3>sanctioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3949
02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:30.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a reason why it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

3950
02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:32.410
<v Speaker 3>you're in the right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reminder tonight,</v>

3951
02:35:32.590 --> 02:35:33.423
<v Speaker 3>I play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason why it's not is because </v>

3952
02:35:35.250 --> 02:35:36.220
<v Speaker 3>the mass is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>

3953
02:35:36.221 --> 02:35:38.280
<v Speaker 3>well attison it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just saw me get kicked in the face</v>

3954
02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:38.950
<v Speaker 3>fighting again.</v>

3955
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:42.220
<v Speaker 3>They sanctioned and for kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't sanction that for MMA.</v>

3956
02:35:42.221 --> 02:35:43.054
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because like last man standing was in </v>

3957
02:35:45.131 --> 02:35:47.110
<v Speaker 3>la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw that at the fucking forum.</v>

3958
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:48.783
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3959
02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:50.620
<v Speaker 3>that was right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole,</v>

3960
02:35:50.650 --> 02:35:51.483
<v Speaker 3>the whole rules are where the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we've talked about this before and </v>

3961
02:35:53.741 --> 02:35:55.670
<v Speaker 3>that's why I was so intrigued about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3962
02:35:55.900 --> 02:35:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Tony First and fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is why I,</v>

3963
02:35:57.950 --> 02:35:59.890
<v Speaker 3>I did a standup at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3964
02:35:59.950 --> 02:36:00.730
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3965
02:36:00.730 --> 02:36:04.360
<v Speaker 3>San Jose Improv and in the front row and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that there can be,</v>

3966
02:36:04.361 --> 02:36:07.990
<v Speaker 3>there was all of teammate Kay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Fitch Thompson and stuff like that,</v>

3967
02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:09.720
<v Speaker 3>and a after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in,</v>

3968
02:36:09.721 --> 02:36:13.480
<v Speaker 3>in front of them asked me this before </v>
<v Speaker 3>first and dropped them at Ferguson.</v>

3969
02:36:13.481 --> 02:36:14.314
<v Speaker 3>Could be who's going to win and I I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a toss up for me but because I </v>

3970
02:36:17.021 --> 02:36:21.100
<v Speaker 3>thought Tony was going to do work off </v>
<v Speaker 3>his back when he was going to land crazy</v>

3971
02:36:21.101 --> 02:36:21.934
<v Speaker 3>amount of elbows and fucked up could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>face but because it could be was on top </v>

3972
02:36:25.091 --> 02:36:25.924
<v Speaker 3>he'd get the wind via decision and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>said the losers are going to be the </v>

3973
02:36:28.451 --> 02:36:29.284
<v Speaker 3>judges because they won't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>judge that fight and say that in front </v>

3974
02:36:31.961 --> 02:36:33.640
<v Speaker 3>of the AK team was awkward.</v>

3975
02:36:34.030 --> 02:36:34.863
<v Speaker 3>Depends upon how it plays out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it plays out the way you </v>

3976
02:36:37.601 --> 02:36:38.590
<v Speaker 3>described it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3977
02:36:38.670 --> 02:36:39.503
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Tony is landing big shots from the </v>

3978
02:36:40.991 --> 02:36:42.790
<v Speaker 3>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>submission threats,</v>

3979
02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:43.653
<v Speaker 3>elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his face getting bloody but Khabib's </v>

3980
02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:47.410
<v Speaker 3>doing work on top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Tony's still threatened elbows,</v>

3981
02:36:47.411 --> 02:36:48.790
<v Speaker 3>elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking them up.</v>

3982
02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:51.940
<v Speaker 3>It's possible but if could be malls but </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be real clear.</v>

3983
02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:55.780
<v Speaker 3>We don't judge them when we got it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see that now and that is a sin.</v>

3984
02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:58.310
<v Speaker 3>That's a sin against humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They says we won't.</v>

3985
02:36:58.480 --> 02:36:59.650
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will never see it.</v>

3986
02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:02.110
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said crazy shit like John Jones never</v>

3987
02:37:02.111 --> 02:37:04.300
<v Speaker 3>be in a main event again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said a lot of crazy shit.</v>

3988
02:37:04.301 --> 02:37:05.134
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says this pushing gets a title shot </v>

3989
02:37:06.881 --> 02:37:09.540
<v Speaker 3>and then someone else does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's as emotional.</v>

3990
02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:10.810
<v Speaker 3>He's upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be pissed too.</v>

3991
02:37:10.930 --> 02:37:13.660
<v Speaker 3>But also thinking about money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's missed out on that.</v>

3992
02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:16.610
<v Speaker 3>That'd be if they tried it again and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fifth time trying to promote this.</v>

3993
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:17.503
<v Speaker 3>Is that also really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the fourth they've dropped out </v>

3994
02:37:19.420 --> 02:37:20.660
<v Speaker 3>north.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've tried to make this fight.</v>

3995
02:37:20.661 --> 02:37:21.494
<v Speaker 3>That's in Sean Shelby and Joe Sia was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make this fight before he </v>

3996
02:37:23.481 --> 02:37:25.760
<v Speaker 3>retired was the one fight he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make it never happen.</v>

3997
02:37:26.170 --> 02:37:27.170
<v Speaker 3>So if you're Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3998
02:37:27.171 --> 02:37:28.004
<v Speaker 3>hold up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much money have we put in marketing </v>

3999
02:37:30.260 --> 02:37:33.380
<v Speaker 3>to these fox?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just doesn't happen for us.</v>

4000
02:37:33.381 --> 02:37:35.420
<v Speaker 3>We're down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that does happen.</v>

4001
02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:36.650
<v Speaker 3>You gotta do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4002
02:37:36.651 --> 02:37:37.484
<v Speaker 3>you said that you didn't believe it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to happen until you saw the door </v>

4003
02:37:39.411 --> 02:37:41.750
<v Speaker 3>bolt and they're standing next to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other and here we are.</v>

4004
02:37:41.810 --> 02:37:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

4005
02:37:43.010 --> 02:37:43.843
<v Speaker 3>It's such a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the first person I text when I </v>

4006
02:37:46.801 --> 02:37:48.750
<v Speaker 3>saw it cause we were talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>sad weepy.</v>

4007
02:37:49.770 --> 02:37:53.240
<v Speaker 3>It's a jet bomber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is the next best thing.</v>

4008
02:37:53.810 --> 02:37:55.460
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next best thing is connor.</v>

4011
02:38:00.201 --> 02:38:01.160
<v Speaker 3>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4012
02:38:01.161 --> 02:38:03.180
<v Speaker 3>You would never get connor on six days </v>
<v Speaker 3>notice.</v>

4013
02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:07.220
<v Speaker 3>But if connor would have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>connor was scheduled to fight.</v>

4014
02:38:07.340 --> 02:38:09.260
<v Speaker 3>See the thing about a connor at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stages,</v>

4015
02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:11.270

02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:13.280
<v Speaker 3>there's never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never going to happen again.</v>

4017
02:38:13.310 --> 02:38:15.440
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like every fight is just giant.</v>

4018
02:38:15.441 --> 02:38:16.274
<v Speaker 3>Only fight where where it'd be a level </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing field would be nate diaz cause </v>

<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

4022
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:28.010
<v Speaker 3>You fight a guy like Khabib.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they offered it to nate?</v>

4029
02:38:43.011 --> 02:38:43.844
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

4030
02:38:43.950 --> 02:38:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making that son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said it.</v>

4031
02:38:45.441 --> 02:38:47.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm all of one night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love Alvarez.</v>

4032
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Imagine losing 35 fucking pounds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please say it for everyone,</v>

4034

<v Speaker 3>Holloway to take this site?</v>

<v Speaker 3>we know you're a champ at one 45.</v>

4037
02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:02.730
<v Speaker 3>Here's the offer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

4038
02:39:02.731 --> 02:39:03.564
<v Speaker 3>We're just giving you this much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I know is what Eddie told me on the </v>

4039
02:39:06.111 --> 02:39:09.470
<v Speaker 3>podcast about Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said he was going to make millions.</v>

4040
02:39:11.220 --> 02:39:13.340
<v Speaker 3>So if that's what we know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got,</v>

4041
02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:16.200
<v Speaker 3>assume there's a big paycheck in it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Max Holloway.</v>

4042
02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:17.210
<v Speaker 3>I told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4043
02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:18.750
<v Speaker 3>Brian Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much you think he's in pain?</v>

4044
02:39:18.751 --> 02:39:19.890
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm Max,</v>

4045
02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:21.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't take that fight for under 4 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>

4046
02:39:22.140 --> 02:39:22.973
<v Speaker 3>I know they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in a tough position and they </v>

4047
02:39:24.391 --> 02:39:25.224
<v Speaker 3>need a big name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then trying to recoup the paper </v>

4048
02:39:26.761 --> 02:39:28.770
<v Speaker 3>views.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got them backed in a corner.</v>

4049
02:39:28.890 --> 02:39:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4050
02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:30.753
<v Speaker 3>longest winning streak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying 4 million or bust your bold </v>

4051
02:39:34.021 --> 02:39:38.520
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say two till after taxes.</v>

4052
02:39:39.090 --> 02:39:39.923
<v Speaker 3>That's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucked that out when you're </v>

4053
02:39:42.541 --> 02:39:43.780
<v Speaker 3>fighting Khabib.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

4054
02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:46.800
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

4055
02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I need a million for every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So six days.</v>

4056
02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:50.700
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

4057
02:39:51.990 --> 02:39:54.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max can submit people,</v>

4058
02:39:54.540 --> 02:39:56.930
<v Speaker 3>but we don't anticipate him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Surbiton could be.</v>

4059
02:39:57.450 --> 02:39:58.283
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems like to be grappling is on a </v>

4060
02:39:59.911 --> 02:40:00.744
<v Speaker 3>higher level than Max.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the way Max can win this </v>

4061
02:40:03.781 --> 02:40:08.670
<v Speaker 3>fight is by pacing because Max is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if Max is not in shape,</v>

4062
02:40:08.671 --> 02:40:09.990
<v Speaker 3>he's in phenomenal shape.</v>

4063
02:40:10.170 --> 02:40:11.003
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got an incredible cardio and he </v>

4064
02:40:14.041 --> 02:40:16.230
<v Speaker 3>really knows how to pace himself very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

4065
02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Pacing if it's more of a style of fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it's at his temple to [inaudible]</v>

4066
02:40:22.290 --> 02:40:24.750
<v Speaker 3>watch a tempo and just throws in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>blender.</v>

4067
02:40:24.790 --> 02:40:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so,</v>

4068
02:40:26.011 --> 02:40:28.830
<v Speaker 3>and it's a six day notice and it's a Max</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was taking time off,</v>

4069
02:40:28.831 --> 02:40:29.664
<v Speaker 3>spend time with his family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all the chips are stacked against </v>

4070
02:40:32.101 --> 02:40:33.030
<v Speaker 3>Max,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>

4071
02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:35.250
<v Speaker 3>And it's a weight class above his weight</v>
<v Speaker 3>class.</v>

4072
02:40:35.251 --> 02:40:36.084
<v Speaker 3>It's a Khabib who's a huge one 55.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's arguably the best grappler in the </v>

4073
02:40:41.221 --> 02:40:45.300
<v Speaker 3>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other promise,</v>

4074
02:40:45.301 --> 02:40:47.100
<v Speaker 3>he really doesn't attain the standup </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

4075
02:40:47.101 --> 02:40:48.510
<v Speaker 3>So your chance of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one,</v>

4076
02:40:48.540 --> 02:40:52.110
<v Speaker 3>the home run shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even dropped even lower.</v>

4077
02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:53.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four mill.</v>

4078
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:55.710
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear what he said about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

4079
02:40:55.711 --> 02:40:57.240
<v Speaker 3>thank you for taking fight.</v>

4080
02:40:57.540 --> 02:40:59.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you'll ever be the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

4081
02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:01.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I have foss.</v>

4082
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:02.181
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4083
02:41:02.181 --> 02:41:05.130
<v Speaker 3>that'd be the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's probably not aligned.</v>

4084
02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:09.440
<v Speaker 3>That's a dark thing to say to not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

4085
02:41:09.441 --> 02:41:12.170
<v Speaker 3>I would never be the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4086
02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:14.280
<v Speaker 3>it breaks my heart did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We might say,</v>

4087
02:41:14.281 --> 02:41:17.210
<v Speaker 3>hope he's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what I do if I was in Max's</v>

4088
02:41:17.220 --> 02:41:18.053
<v Speaker 3>corner and if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it's like halfway through that </v>

4089
02:41:19.771 --> 02:41:21.340
<v Speaker 3>second round and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

4090
02:41:21.341 --> 02:41:23.220
<v Speaker 3>maxx looks exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not in shape.</v>

4091
02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:24.930
<v Speaker 3>He's just taking a beat and he's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>tough.</v>

4092
02:41:24.931 --> 02:41:27.090
<v Speaker 3>He's probably the last five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've thrown that towel.</v>

4093
02:41:27.210 --> 02:41:28.043
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna take all the shit for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the fans because I don't want Max </v>

4094
02:41:30.421 --> 02:41:34.170
<v Speaker 3>dealing with this because this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't his fight to be honest.</v>

4095
02:41:34.171 --> 02:41:35.550
<v Speaker 3>This is in his fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't,</v>

4096
02:41:35.551 --> 02:41:38.280
<v Speaker 3>his path was going to make 4 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>round hopefully.</v>

4097
02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:39.810
<v Speaker 3>And he's gonna be set for life </v>
<v Speaker 3>financial.</v>

4098
02:41:39.811 --> 02:41:41.550
<v Speaker 3>If he's smart with his money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

4099
02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:44.700
<v Speaker 3>this isn't his path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did this to help out the UFC.</v>

4100
02:41:44.760 --> 02:41:46.620
<v Speaker 3>He made bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a towel.</v>

4101
02:41:46.650 --> 02:41:47.401
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're,</v>

4102
02:41:47.401 --> 02:41:48.234
<v Speaker 3>you're in hate me Max.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk in Hawaii over bull of a Ahi </v>

4103
02:41:50.521 --> 02:41:52.540

<v Speaker 3>if we know we,</v>

4105
02:41:54.930 --> 02:41:55.763
<v Speaker 3>I think with a cubby fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things is after the first </v>

4106
02:41:57.901 --> 02:41:59.550
<v Speaker 3>round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of know how it's going to go.</v>

02:41:59.790 --> 02:42:00.271
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4108
02:42:00.271 --> 02:42:01.104
<v Speaker 3>and split the thing from act two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he had 12 weeks and he's in </v>

4109
02:42:03.211 --> 02:42:07.170
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal shape and he gets taken down </v>
<v Speaker 3>all a kind of Chad Mendez,</v>

<v Speaker 3>shape.</v>
