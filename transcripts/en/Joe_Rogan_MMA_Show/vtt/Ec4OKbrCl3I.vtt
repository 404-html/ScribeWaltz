1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my oldest one's super.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:03.713
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

4
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

5
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Ben Aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies,</v>

6
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

7
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about you on this podcast at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least a dozen times.</v>

8
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>You are the number one guy that I'm most</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointed.</v>

9
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Never fought in UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>I always get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you talk about me,</v>

11
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I get like 15 texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

12
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:21.504
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe is talking about you now and you </v>

13
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll send me clips or whatever.</v>

14
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>So obviously appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.941
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:27.774
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really got to fight those top </v>

17
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.114
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was for reasons beyond my </v>

18
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>and you're done now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

20
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

21
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I said I don't want to say I'm done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

22
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.154
<v Speaker 1>I said I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excluding the fact that I get to fight </v>

23
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>and prove I'm number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the excluding fest.</v>

24
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>So if you could get in the UFC you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to do it again.</v>

25
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care where it is,</v>

26
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

27
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.883
<v Speaker 1>I really genuinely don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously that would be the thing </v>

28
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:53.424
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is legislation like the Ali </v>

29
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and the things going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

30
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know that maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm still 33 so I'm not old and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

32
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>polluted GSP took four years off from </v>
<v Speaker 1>one flight to next fight.</v>

33
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.163
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying I'm an age overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well your style to you avoided so much </v>

34
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:09.354
<v Speaker 1>damage I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you hit one once this until </v>

35
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.710
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

36
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get hit once in three fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

37
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I should tell people you were fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in one FC,</v>

38
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>which is a big Asian organizations like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Asian version of the UFC.</v>

39
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one FC started in 2012,</v>

40
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.253
<v Speaker 1>obviously my contract with Belcher came </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in 2013 and then there was that </v>

42
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>negotiation process since I obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>went south.</v>

43
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>And what happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were the champ of belt tour and then</v>

44
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you left and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

45
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still undefeated,</v>

46
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm undefeated.</v>

47
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>18 went off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck happened?</v>

48
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>That beltour let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't what happened.</v>

49
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much misinformation out there</v>

50
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm popular but I'm not that popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a,</v>

52
00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:52.434
<v Speaker 1>lots of times in my story gets missed </v>
<v Speaker 1>toll because I get spoken over by other </v>

53
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:56.551
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

54
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:57.530
<v Speaker 1>And they don't hear what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

55
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.373
<v Speaker 1>here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously so prior to me and Bella </v>

56
00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:02.814
<v Speaker 1>tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hector and Eddie were the ones that </v>

57
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:04.531
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:05.364
<v Speaker 1>There were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hector was the Lombard and Eddie </v>

59
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Alvarez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alvarez was the UFC.</v>

60
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both the middleweight champion.</v>

61
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Then the lightweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both got taken care of pretty well.</v>

62
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you remembered Eddie situation,</v>

63
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got an offer from the UFC still under</v>

64
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>the matching period.</v>

65
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Beltre beltre says we matched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

66
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of what was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>

67
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>it was matched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

68
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>But because Belterra has no paper view </v>
<v Speaker 1>venue,</v>

69
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>well if UFC says we'll pay you and pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>per view belts as well.</v>

70
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>We will too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not real life,</v>

71
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they've done to pay per view</v>

72
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:40.194
<v Speaker 1>shows ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've never met any type of </v>

73
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

74
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:43.344
<v Speaker 1>they say imagine what it doesn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember that they </v>

75
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>went to court over it and the UFC one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie has got the right to.</v>

76
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he,</v>

77
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>he somehow did like a one more fight in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bellator and then with the UFC,</v>

78
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what the finality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that case was,</v>

79
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that happened,</v>

80
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his</v>

81
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>contract became public knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

82
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of UFC fighters were pissed</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he,</v>

83
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.084
<v Speaker 2>they gave him a whole bunch of money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when I was 12 and now I've had my </v>

84
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:11.840
<v Speaker 2>last fight in Bellator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon.</v>

85
00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:16.841
<v Speaker 2>Sandra crush coughed July 30th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>May 31st of 2013,</v>

86
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.183
<v Speaker 2>beat him up pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I had a 12 month matching </v>

87
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.274
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what was expressed to me by the </v>

88
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 2>UFC brass was that you need to get rid </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your matching clause and we will make</v>

89
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.534
<v Speaker 2>you an offer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we will not make you an offer until </v>

90
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of your matching.</v>

91
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>

92
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.631
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

93
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 2>here's how I went about doing it exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>12 months,</v>

94
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a frequent.</v>

95
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to sell it for 12 months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd called Buerger's did it and say,</v>

96
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 2>hey bjorn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to resign.</v>

97
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Please let me this guy who was running </v>
<v Speaker 2>belt or correct.</v>

98
00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now he got fired.</v>

99
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bjorn had a terrible reputation,</v>

100
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 2>but I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a decent relationship with them.</v>

101
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:56.820
<v Speaker 2>I never like butted heads too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every they said,</v>

102
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 2>bjorn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me go.</v>

103
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm not coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so everyone says,</v>

104
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bell tour didn't want to resign me.</v>

105
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every day is bjorn.</v>

106
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you aren't,</v>

107
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.810
<v Speaker 2>let me go because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.803
<v Speaker 2>I love challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I love more than anything in the </v>

109
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:11.580
<v Speaker 2>world is a challenge myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at my wrestling career,</v>

110
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.453
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking the next best thing every single </v>

111
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah.</v>

112
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:17.284
<v Speaker 2>So finally in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll just time Dana and the UFC is </v>

113
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.094
<v Speaker 2>saying we want to ask when we were up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outskirt I'm ranked number seven in </v>

114
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 2>the world or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around there 12 and now.</v>

115
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.293
<v Speaker 2>And so I remember I was going to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asian food store cause I was gonna make </v>

116
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 2>some tom cost soup and bjorn calls me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're released full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full,</v>

118
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 2>you're released,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go.</v>

119
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>

120
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 2>So Friday morning was Thursday night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday morning,</v>

121
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:43.400
<v Speaker 2>it's in November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometime in May,</v>

122
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 2>mid November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm morning,</v>

123
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.193
<v Speaker 2>they fax over the release,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my management faxes it to UFC </v>

124
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:49.924
<v Speaker 2>headquarters and all of a sudden that </v>
<v Speaker 2>afternoon there's a little scrum </v>

125
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:53.764
<v Speaker 2>wherever was asking the questions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the data says we're not interested in </v>

126
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Ben Aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

127
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what just happened there?</v>

128
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.853
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because for the last three months they </v>

129
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 2>were saying we were interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's your where's?</v>

130
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.863
<v Speaker 2>And now I finally produced this full </v>
<v Speaker 2>release for Bella tour that I got and </v>

131
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 2>now they're not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>

132
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got caught in the middle of this.</v>

133
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 2>And was there a reason given also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

134
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.350
<v Speaker 2>so the Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I say F that I buy.</v>

135
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 2>So I bought a plane ticket to Vegas for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Monday,</v>

136
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 2>so that was Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happens.</v>

137
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

138
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking this shit,</v>

139
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:30.484
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a Monday I buy my plane ticket to </v>

140
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 2>Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fly out to Vegas.</v>

141
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to headquarters a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met with Lorenzo.</v>

142
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:42.361
<v Speaker 2>Dana was on the little speakerphone </v>
<v Speaker 2>daily and they offered me a contract but</v>

143
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:44.674
<v Speaker 2>it will be confidential and I would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight one fight for the world series </v>

144
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:49.450
<v Speaker 2>of fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>

145
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 2>well that's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

146
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fight for the world series a funding</v>

147
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.970
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the world series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a feeder</v>

148
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 3>organization at that time</v>

149
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.173
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

150
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

151
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Marlin Mariah's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just engage you.</v>

152
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Both those guys came from champs over </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

153
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the relationship is very hazy </v>

154
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.440
<v Speaker 2>between the old world series of fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UFC because there was also.</v>

155
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.030
<v Speaker 2>People don't want the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

156
00:06:13.031 --> 00:06:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Andre Arlovski gets dropped in the FC </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to world series.</v>

157
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

158
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:19.960
<v Speaker 2>All these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they say one fight,</v>

159
00:06:19.961 --> 00:06:21.640
<v Speaker 2>one fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>world series of fighting.</v>

160
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.370
<v Speaker 2>We will pay Zoopla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll pay you what you do.</v>

161
00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:27.010
<v Speaker 2>One fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say let that's F it up,</v>

162
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.900
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

163
00:06:28.901 --> 00:06:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone's gonna go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll do it.</v>

164
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.120
<v Speaker 2>So I leave and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about six hours later I got a phone call</v>

165
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:38.050
<v Speaker 2>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that deal is no longer available.</v>

166
00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:41.080
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to make you an offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

167
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.290
<v Speaker 2>So wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have no idea why?</v>

168
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.941
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

169
00:06:44.941 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

170
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.243
<v Speaker 2>here's my guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never got to sit face to face </v>

171
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 2>meeting and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was your problem with me?</v>

172
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:52.270
<v Speaker 2>I think there's four things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mind,</v>

173
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.180
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't really like me.</v>

174
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.163
<v Speaker 2>I'm stemming from the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called them out on the steroid thing </v>

175
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.163
<v Speaker 2>where he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible and this is where I </v>

176
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:04.390
<v Speaker 2>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is impossible to test all UFC athletes.</v>

177
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.811
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

178
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:05.644
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You started does it all over the world </v>

179
00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:07.930
<v Speaker 2>for all kinds of athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

180
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.820
<v Speaker 2>You can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just expensive,</v>

181
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.430
<v Speaker 2>but let's just call it what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a private business.</v>

182
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:13.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do drug tests.</v>

183
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.340
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously they do it now.</v>

184
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 3>Do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it through Usada.</v>

185
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.750
<v Speaker 3>So you were totally right.</v>

186
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was correct and now.</v>

187
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:20.921
<v Speaker 2>But that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

188
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:24.970
<v Speaker 2>when Dana is wrong in an argument and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this huge army that follows him</v>

189
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.043
<v Speaker 2>and he said I'd rather hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his quote was bet because I'd </v>

190
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:29.860
<v Speaker 2>rather watch fucked and better ask him </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

191
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:31.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said something like</v>

192
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.620
<v Speaker 3>ambien takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ben Asked her if it goes asleep.</v>

193
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there there's a few of them.</v>

194
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 2>So the personal attacks started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

195
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's number one.</v>

196
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.003
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my fighting style is not highly </v>

197
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:42.134
<v Speaker 2>attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also think that's a little bit of </v>

198
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:48.551
<v Speaker 2>fake news because if you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Georgetown peers to consistently knobs,</v>

199
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor's trumped him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only a couple of times,</v>

200
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 2>but if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a consistent basis.</v>

201
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 2>George Saint Pierre is the number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>draw of all time.</v>

202
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 2>He heavily relied on takedowns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and pound.</v>

203
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean he didn't have a finish in like </v>
<v Speaker 2>five years or something.</v>

204
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Let me</v>

205
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.443
<v Speaker 3>say what my take has always been on you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that style is that it's important </v>

206
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.230
<v Speaker 3>and that it really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really works.</v>

207
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.260
<v Speaker 3>What you're able to do really works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've always said this,</v>

208
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:12.094
<v Speaker 3>and it was proven on a Saturday night in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this deep Emile Francis and modified </v>

209
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.920
<v Speaker 3>wrestling is the most important part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA.</v>

210
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.900
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ability to take the fight to the ground.</v>

211
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Obviously Steve Bay has a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>attributes.</v>

212
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.160
<v Speaker 3>He took tremendous punches in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

213
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.173
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you didn't get a chance to watch </v>

214
00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:26.890
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I saw some highlights that.</v>

215
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the first round was chaos.</v>

216
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.333
<v Speaker 3>I mean Francis and Ghana was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrifying guy and Steve Bay took the </v>

217
00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:34.570
<v Speaker 3>shots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use great movement.</v>

218
00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:38.050
<v Speaker 3>You striking of his own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most importantly after awhile he got</v>

219
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:40.870
<v Speaker 3>his wrestling going and then once he got</v>
<v Speaker 3>in to the ground and gone,</v>

220
00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have any answers.</v>

221
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.870
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What your,</v>

222
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.540
<v Speaker 3>what you've been able to do to guys like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Douglas Lema,</v>

223
00:08:46.541 --> 00:08:49.480
<v Speaker 3>who just fought rory macdonald for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bell to our title.</v>

224
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.343
<v Speaker 3>Really good fight chorus goff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is another fantastic fight who was </v>

225
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.393
<v Speaker 3>beaten a lot of really top guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're able to use your wrestling and </v>

226
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 3>completely nullify all their striking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and offense.</v>

227
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a huge part of fighting.</v>

228
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Fighting is not what's exciting for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to watch,</v>

229
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.753
<v Speaker 3>fighting is what actually works and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been able to do time and time </v>

230
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:09.774
<v Speaker 3>again is take these guys who looked like</v>
<v Speaker 3>world beaters and completely nullify </v>

231
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:14.784
<v Speaker 3>their offense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken to the ground and beat the shit </v>

232
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 3>out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's huge.</v>

233
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 3>That's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>

234
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

235
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:20.394
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

236
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.960
<v Speaker 2>not so we can get back to the UFC thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

237
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I started fighting,</v>

238
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:26.851
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>

239
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:27.451
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go fight.</v>

240
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:29.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really have a coaching and so I</v>

241
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 2>didn't move to Duke's until two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One soup.</v>

242
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.601
<v Speaker 2>Rufus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

243
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Until 2010 I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started.</v>

244
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

245
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 2>2011.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

246
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.573
<v Speaker 2>because I was in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was coaching for Arizona State </v>

247
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 2>University,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I moved there,</v>

248
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.271
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

249
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:43.104
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of elite strikers in this </v>

250
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 2>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

251
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to be elite striker,</v>

252
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.950
<v Speaker 2>but if no one can hit me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't beat me.</v>

253
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.650
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to last me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to have crap on me.</v>

254
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.990
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to beat me if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't knock me out,</v>

255
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plain and simple.</v>

256
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 2>So my whole goal was how do I not get </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit,</v>

257
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.403
<v Speaker 2>not I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to be a great striker </v>

258
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 2>hitting people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just need to not get hit.</v>

259
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:03.324
<v Speaker 2>If you can't knock me out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eventually get you on the </v>

260
00:10:05.161 --> 00:10:06.460
<v Speaker 2>ground and I'm going to beat your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

261
00:10:06.461 --> 00:10:07.294
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was kind of my whole goal </v>

262
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.710
<v Speaker 2>when I got an MBA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how do I not get knocked out?</v>

263
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you said,</v>

264
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.194
<v Speaker 2>obviously I found a really good way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that and it added a lot of longevity </v>

265
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:17.424
<v Speaker 2>in my career where I wasn't taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage a lot of other people were </v>

266
00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:22.014
<v Speaker 2>taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's also a lot of other </v>

267
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 2>things to being a really high level </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler that you know,</v>

268
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 2>besides obviously you can control where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight happens,</v>

269
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:29.814
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of other things that </v>

270
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.190
<v Speaker 2>high level wrestling provides us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

271
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.103
<v Speaker 2>That came from that world that other </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines don't get a lot of </v>

272
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We compete thousands of times.</v>

273
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How to get our mind right.</v>

274
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm these wrestlers are just strong and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just a different strength.</v>

275
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 2>I just actually I got to go workout with</v>
<v Speaker 2>term burrows last week because a midtown</v>

276
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.620
<v Speaker 2>world champ and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you forget how strong wrestlers are.</v>

277
00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Like you grabbed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

278
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.500
<v Speaker 2>good God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is like,</v>

279
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel that from and people.</v>

280
00:10:57.381 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 2>I grabbed him and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my.</v>

281
00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.611
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

282
00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:02.340
<v Speaker 2>there's no worries week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>

283
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:03.360
<v Speaker 2>very disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

284
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.203
<v Speaker 2>Because wrestlers like we've been in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system from youth wrestling high school </v>

285
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 2>wrestling to college said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we're under,</v>

286
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.713
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coaches and have a very strict training </v>

287
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 2>plan and understand how to put a </v>
<v Speaker 2>training regimen together where a lot of</v>

288
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:17.310
<v Speaker 2>other martial arts don't have that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of structured system.</v>

289
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:21.360
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's a lot of advantages </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we as a wrestlers have when we come</v>

290
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:21.950
<v Speaker 2>into mixed martial arts.</v>

291
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.440
<v Speaker 3>And if I could add to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the intention is pure.</v>

292
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.380
<v Speaker 3>It's pure for competition because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no financial reward.</v>

293
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:29.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting into wrestling because they want</v>

294
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:30.374
<v Speaker 3>to get rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of people that really want </v>

295
00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:32.204
<v Speaker 3>to prove that they're the best and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have so many top flight guys that </v>

296
00:11:36.381 --> 00:11:39.710
<v Speaker 3>are incredibly mentally strong feeding </v>
<v Speaker 3>off of each other,</v>

297
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.753
<v Speaker 3>knowing that they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>competing against each other and almost </v>

298
00:11:43.371 --> 00:11:46.370
<v Speaker 3>no financial possibilities except for </v>
<v Speaker 3>coaching.</v>

299
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

300
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.123
<v Speaker 2>I mean now so 2018 to 20 2008 when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and then when I decided to </v>

301
00:11:52.601 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 2>make that jump mma</v>

302
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 1>there is a lot better financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure for senior level athletes now.</v>

303
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.503
<v Speaker 1>None of them are getting rich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only about a dozen of them </v>

304
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:03.280
<v Speaker 1>making a decent living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

305
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

306
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>There's thousands of wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

307
00:12:06.941 --> 00:12:07.774
<v Speaker 1>So your points mostly correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are a handful of top United </v>

308
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.133
<v Speaker 1>States athletes now who can do nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>but Russell where when I was in in 2008 </v>

309
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 1>when I was trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't even the case.</v>

310
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I had to go do camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was coaching at Missouri,</v>

311
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 1>so I was doing other things in addition </v>
<v Speaker 1>to wrestling.</v>

312
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>So like an Olympic athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

313
00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:24.870
<v Speaker 1>what else would they do to make money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

314
00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 1>so like in 2008 I was doing a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>

315
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can travel around the country,</v>

316
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't make money.</v>

317
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm coach a college team that was making</v>
<v Speaker 1>money that way.</v>

318
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.990
<v Speaker 1>So the handful of things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wow,</v>

319
00:12:34.991 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just wake up and train every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single day,</v>

320
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.770
<v Speaker 1>but the athletes of today that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

321
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.790
<v Speaker 1>now that's what they're doing.</v>

322
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.270
<v Speaker 1>That's it coaching and bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things here.</v>

323
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

324
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:42.911
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

325
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:43.744
<v Speaker 1>Some of them don't have jobs saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do it from where are they getting </v>

326
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:48.160
<v Speaker 1>the money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan burroughs and James Green,</v>

327
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:51.220
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsorships are slightly more lucrative</v>

328
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.083
<v Speaker 1>than they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's something called the </v>

329
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:55.610
<v Speaker 1>regional training center system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:12:56.561 --> 00:12:57.394
<v Speaker 1>most major colleges have one that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot more lucrative and that's </v>

332
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:00.641
<v Speaker 1>fundraising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

333
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:01.474
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not earning money that the RTC </v>

334
00:13:03.161 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 1>people go say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

335
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.910
<v Speaker 1>rich guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you like to fund this program?</v>

336
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:08.770
<v Speaker 1>That'll help us develop Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes.</v>

337
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.911
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

338
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the United States,</v>

339
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.420
<v Speaker 1>a USC has slightly more funding given to</v>
<v Speaker 1>USA wrestling than in the past.</v>

340
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the tragic story of John Dupont.</v>

341
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's literally why that whole,</v>

342
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 1>if people have seen that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what movie?</v>

343
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Carl Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox catcher.</v>

344
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:25.204
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awful too crazy story of Dave and Mark </v>

345
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.703
<v Speaker 1>Schultz and this millionaire or </v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire crazy guy wound up shooting </v>

346
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.853
<v Speaker 1>Dave Schultz and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just Weirdo guy that was running </v>

347
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:39.664
<v Speaker 1>this camp and these guys kind of got </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck training with this gap because I </v>

348
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:46.960
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's 96 was when Schultz got shot.</v>

349
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.793
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's 12 years prior to my </v>

350
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Olympic birth and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then it's even worse.</v>

351
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean these guys are literally making </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

352
00:13:55.721 --> 00:13:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.220
<v Speaker 1>let me go back to the argument of </v>
<v Speaker 1>amateurism and the Olympics is stupid,</v>

354
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:03.520
<v Speaker 1>which was abolished like 92 with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream team was kind of totally abolished</v>

355
00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:05.150
<v Speaker 1>with amateurism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

356
00:14:05.151 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 1>those guys in that era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 84,</v>

357
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.260
<v Speaker 1>88,</v>
<v Speaker 1>92 90,</v>

358
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.240
<v Speaker 1>they were making nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when this guy,</v>

359
00:14:10.241 --> 00:14:13.690
<v Speaker 1>John Dupont offers them money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stipends and places to live,</v>

360
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>they don't really have a better option </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's freaking sad to be honest about</v>

361
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:18.754
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then obviously USA wrestling </v>

362
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 1>sanctioned him because he gave you as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>resident a lot of money.</v>

363
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:22.990
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really bad thing.</v>

364
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:23.824
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we're doing a lot better in 2018 </v>

365
00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:26.284
<v Speaker 1>than we were 10 years ago and way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way better than we were doing 20 years </v>

366
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:29.644
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

367
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.460
<v Speaker 1>The Olympic thing where they try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat the Olympics,</v>

368
00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:38.461
<v Speaker 1>like it's an amateur sport event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a business you're making absolutely</v>

369
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 1>aliens and billions of dollars off these</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes who get paid zero is to me it's</v>

370
00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:47.290
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this relic of ancient thinking</v>

371
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.350
<v Speaker 1>and these guys are using it to steal </v>
<v Speaker 1>money from young athletes.</v>

372
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

373
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.080
<v Speaker 4>think the other thing is theft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

374
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:54.923
<v Speaker 4>I usually don't know who ma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's more evil than us or the IOC or </v>

375
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:58.844
<v Speaker 4>the NCA because NCA runs right along the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same lines and I think both are pretty </v>

376
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.220
<v Speaker 4>evil in both are archaic and both DDB </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

377
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.063
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could abolish the NCAA and the </v>

378
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:09.764
<v Speaker 4>IOC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be fantastic for athletes </v>

379
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:11.780
<v Speaker 4>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

380
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when you look at the football</v>

381
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:14.324
<v Speaker 4>teams that are getting literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>billions and billions of dollars every </v>

382
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 4>year and these athletes are ruined in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their lives.</v>

383
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean football players that may be play</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

384
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.720
<v Speaker 4>two seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're lucky,</v>

385
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:26.603
<v Speaker 4>they get their back blown out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their legs get blown out and then they </v>

386
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Speaker 4>never have an nfl career and meanwhile </v>
<v Speaker 4>the university has made tons of money,</v>

387
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 4>tons of money and they make nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

388
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.810
<v Speaker 4>and to make that even worse because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually had to.</v>

389
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 4>I had a whole podcast about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument with someone and to make that,</v>

390
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 4>and we're on the same side of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to make it even worse,</v>

391
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.440
<v Speaker 4>if you're an ncaa athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

392
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 4>you can't even make money off your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>image and likeness.</v>

393
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:47.463
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have a youtube channel where </v>

394
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:49.334
<v Speaker 4>you can say it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So not only will they not pay you </v>

395
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:54.530
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think we can debate and argue on</v>

396
00:15:54.531 --> 00:15:55.364
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that they can't make money </v>

397
00:15:56.901 --> 00:15:58.700
<v Speaker 4>off their own name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>own image and likeness,</v>

398
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.030
<v Speaker 4>that's should be criminal for that to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

399
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Speaker 4>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were telling me about this right?</v>

400
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:04.274
<v Speaker 4>Like a guy got in trouble for having a </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube channel where punter for like a </v>

401
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.160
<v Speaker 4>college football team or a kicker to </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember his name.</v>

402
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember his name at all and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a.</v>

403
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:15.500
<v Speaker 4>There was a wrestler from the University</v>
<v Speaker 4>of I to say University of Minnesota.</v>

404
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 4>He made a rap album and he had to either</v>
<v Speaker 4>quit the wrestling team or or donate all</v>

405
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:25.510
<v Speaker 4>the money back or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like Rah Rah rap in wrestling.</v>

406
00:16:25.511 --> 00:16:27.140
<v Speaker 4>Have they have nothing to do with each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

407
00:16:27.141 --> 00:16:27.974
<v Speaker 4>The fact that he can't go make money off</v>
<v Speaker 4>freaking recording an album is </v>

408
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.920
<v Speaker 4>mindblowing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's disgusting because you're keeping a</v>

409
00:16:33.921 --> 00:16:37.040
<v Speaker 4>kid from being industrious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keeping a a young guy.</v>

410
00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:38.420
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to find his way through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

411
00:16:38.421 --> 00:16:42.500
<v Speaker 4>You keeping them from being successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but though that kind of success,</v>

412
00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.810
<v Speaker 4>like figuring out a way to make some </v>
<v Speaker 4>money off of our name,</v>

413
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:47.750
<v Speaker 4>doing rap that could lead to all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 4>of paths in life.</v>

414
00:16:47.751 --> 00:16:50.180
<v Speaker 4>Like he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's learning as a young guy like,</v>

415
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:51.910
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could be industrious.</v>

416
00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.660
<v Speaker 4>I can go do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can be creative.</v>

417
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I can go do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

418
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:55.664
<v Speaker 4>this is what we should be encouraging </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to do to take chances and make </v>

419
00:16:58.251 --> 00:16:58.490
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

420
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.323
<v Speaker 4>The idea that you're saying like somehow</v>
<v Speaker 4>or another this spoils his amateur </v>

421
00:17:02.391 --> 00:17:04.610
<v Speaker 4>athletic standing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just stupidity.</v>

422
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.270
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fucking disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It drives me nuts.</v>

423
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 4>Agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

424
00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:11.530
<v Speaker 4>It just drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're back to your situation with the</v>

425
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.690
<v Speaker 4>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the UFC says we're not interested in,</v>

426
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:16.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>offer no offer.</v>

427
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.880
<v Speaker 4>So Bella tours released you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

428
00:17:17.881 --> 00:17:21.350
<v Speaker 4>I had spent three months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you,</v>

429
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.180
<v Speaker 4>do you feel like the use might've </v>
<v Speaker 4>played?</v>

430
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.610
<v Speaker 4>They played me her cell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

431
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.360
<v Speaker 4>So number the reasons David doesn't like</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

432
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:27.860
<v Speaker 4>number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number two,</v>

433
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 4>my style and not that great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

434
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.800
<v Speaker 4>Didn't you say something like he's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bald steroid.</v>

435
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.120
<v Speaker 4>So it was mostly after the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

436
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.970
<v Speaker 4>after that went down that I really </v>
<v Speaker 4>torture.</v>

437
00:17:37.971 --> 00:17:38.601
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

438
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:39.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

439
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.330
<v Speaker 4>but the original one was he's lying </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the Usada thing.</v>

440
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.193
<v Speaker 4>So that was the simpler the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So those people who say me and Dana had </v>

441
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 4>beef prior to me</v>

442
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.540
<v Speaker 2>not getting an offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you met him?</v>

443
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

444
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:53.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

445
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.000
<v Speaker 4>Talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've never had a length conversation.</v>

446
00:17:56.001 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 4>So great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot.</v>

447
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:58.610
<v Speaker 4>When you get the wrong impression of </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

448
00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really love the guy.</v>

449
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.823
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I have had different </v>

450
00:18:01.251 --> 00:18:02.084
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like I should be there when </v>

451
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:07.160
<v Speaker 4>people have experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me let you know the Dana.</v>

452
00:18:07.161 --> 00:18:08.120
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

453
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.993
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

454
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.470
<v Speaker 2>so that would be two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number three,</v>

455
00:18:10.471 --> 00:18:11.304
<v Speaker 2>I think obviously stealing a key piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from Bella tour was important to </v>

456
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:15.460
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

457
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.823
<v Speaker 2>and then number four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they thought I really had the </v>

458
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:19.854
<v Speaker 2>ability to be their champion and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can be a belt or champion and </v>

459
00:18:22.711 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 2>make this transition directly to the IFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then be the UFC champion.</v>

460
00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.190
<v Speaker 2>didn't remember this when they're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on right down.</v>

462
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Spike now that bell toward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use that to say,</v>

463
00:18:31.921 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the same.</v>

464
00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:34.380
<v Speaker 2>He was a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a champion there.</v>

465
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:37.100
<v Speaker 2>So I think those four things are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've had,</v>

466
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I've never got to sit down face to face </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dana and say,</v>

467
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 2>why was there no offer that I've never </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten?</v>

468
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:42.893
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when Anthony Pettis was the champ </v>

469
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:46.500
<v Speaker 2>and I'm helping coach him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Tyra was,</v>

470
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 2>I've haven't had more than five words a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day in passing.</v>

471
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.113
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it will be really interesting to </v>

472
00:18:52.351 --> 00:18:53.184
<v Speaker 2>me to sit down and say what was the tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>me for real because I have my </v>

473
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:58.350
<v Speaker 2>assumptions on what the deal was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really know.</v>

474
00:18:58.351 --> 00:18:59.184
<v Speaker 2>And then if I have to add number five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number five is I think he got the idea </v>

475
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:05.480
<v Speaker 2>that I would never be a yes man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm not going to be.</v>

476
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Never would be where Dana really kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>likes the yes man champion to me.</v>

477
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.700
<v Speaker 2>You see he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got some heat with Tyron,</v>

478
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.500
<v Speaker 2>he's got some heat with steep bay as we </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw on Saturday night and he dated.</v>

479
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.433
<v Speaker 2>Really struggles with the personalities </v>
<v Speaker 2>that won't cater to what he wants to </v>

480
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:22.110
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

481
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.040
<v Speaker 4>fighters very rarely are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes men.</v>

482
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.590
<v Speaker 4>Then that's by nature of who they are a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

483
00:19:27.591 --> 00:19:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially the really good ones,</v>

484
00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:32.120
<v Speaker 4>especially as things start going well </v>
<v Speaker 4>and start going their way.</v>

485
00:19:32.121 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 4>They realize they're the fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is.</v>

486
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.320
<v Speaker 4>If you're the guy who running the </v>
<v Speaker 4>division,</v>

487
00:19:36.321 --> 00:19:37.760
<v Speaker 4>you're the guy who's running the </v>
<v Speaker 4>division,</v>

488
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.440
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to take any shit from </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>

489
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's [inaudible] you see as some </v>

490
00:19:41.761 --> 00:19:44.610
<v Speaker 2>of these guys ascend right up the ranks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

491
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Like John Jones started having trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Dana.</v>

492
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But didn't have it.</v>

493
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.953
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jones was having trouble with </v>

494
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.743
<v Speaker 4>everybody's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His problems I think had very little to </v>

495
00:19:53.441 --> 00:19:56.830
<v Speaker 4>do with Dana and more to do with his </v>
<v Speaker 4>actions outside of the cage.</v>

496
00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean inside the octagon he was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the way he was promoted,</v>

497
00:19:59.951 --> 00:20:01.420
<v Speaker 4>he was promoted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fantastic.</v>

498
00:20:01.421 --> 00:20:03.280
<v Speaker 4>But he's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

499
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.170
<v Speaker 4>John's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know John Is.</v>

500
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.123
<v Speaker 4>John needs a babysitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means the baddest motherfucker at </v>

501
00:20:08.261 --> 00:20:09.094
<v Speaker 4>205 ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just had to let him drive a car </v>

502
00:20:11.891 --> 00:20:12.724
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you got that much money is beyond </v>

503
00:20:13.721 --> 00:20:18.721
<v Speaker 4>me like pace to pay your body 40 grand a</v>
<v Speaker 4>year and have him drive you permanently.</v>

504
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.090
<v Speaker 4>Like why he was driving his own car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

505
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.840
<v Speaker 4>That one's beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

506
00:20:22.841 --> 00:20:23.674
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know until they bought them </v>
<v Speaker 4>a Bentley and then he wrapped it around </v>

507
00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:27.910
<v Speaker 4>a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's when.</v>

508
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.710
<v Speaker 4>That's when they should have known and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

509
00:20:29.711 --> 00:20:30.544
<v Speaker 4>but then there was the other one where </v>
<v Speaker 4>he hit and that was the hit and run was </v>

510
00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.130
<v Speaker 4>after that one.</v>

511
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:33.963
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hit and run was after that one and </v>

512
00:20:34.631 --> 00:20:36.310
<v Speaker 4>then there was the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got pulled over,</v>

513
00:20:36.311 --> 00:20:39.250
<v Speaker 4>speeding and he told the cop to go fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>

514
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.390
<v Speaker 4>Terrible decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking wild.</v>

515
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.933
<v Speaker 4>That's why he's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one of the reasons why he's </v>

516
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.760
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you put,</v>

517
00:20:47.761 --> 00:20:49.440
<v Speaker 4>you've got to put safeguards in place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

518
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.283
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're making how many million a </v>

519
00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 4>year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Multiple.</v>

520
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.523
<v Speaker 4>At least for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't pay someone 40 grand to drive </v>

521
00:20:55.271 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 4>you around this and you're preaching to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the choir.</v>

522
00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.693
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could clone me and send me all </v>

523
00:21:01.891 --> 00:21:04.050
<v Speaker 4>to all these stamps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

524
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 4>listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's gonna be fine.</v>

525
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.810
<v Speaker 4>I've got a driver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got a cadillac escalade out here.</v>

526
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.770
<v Speaker 4>Wherever you want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to have some fun,</v>

527
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:12.970
<v Speaker 4>but no driving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no driving.</v>

528
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.740
<v Speaker 4>We don't need driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got me.</v>

529
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.600
<v Speaker 4>We've got fun.</v>

530
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 4>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my gosh.</v>

531
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously.</v>

532
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:19.691
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

533
00:21:19.691 --> 00:21:22.810
<v Speaker 4>that's what you would have if you had </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

534
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

535
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:25.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

536
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 4>I never been to albuquerque.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how he's living,</v>

537
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.180
<v Speaker 4>but he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can't babysit everybody.</v>

538
00:21:31.181 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 4>You got the UFC has 500 fighters on its </v>
<v Speaker 4>roster.</v>

539
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many of those guys are prone to wild</v>

540
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:38.250
<v Speaker 4>behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say three of them.</v>

541
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:38.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

542
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.880
<v Speaker 4>And most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

543
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:40.714
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>High risk males that play a sport where </v>

544
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:45.250
<v Speaker 4>you have potential to be hurt every </v>
<v Speaker 4>single time you step out on the job.</v>

545
00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you're making millions of </v>

546
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:48.873
<v Speaker 4>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to put safeguards against </v>

547
00:21:49.361 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

548
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:51.634
<v Speaker 4>But I think also what makes John so good</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this self confidence and he probably </v>

549
00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

550
00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucked up before when I got it now.</v>

551
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.693
<v Speaker 4>So I'm really into sports psychology and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want someone to write this book </v>

552
00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:06.090
<v Speaker 4>because no one's ever written it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's this,</v>

553
00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:06.924
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I call it the hypocritical elite </v>

554
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:10.990
<v Speaker 4>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's two sides to every coin.</v>

555
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:13.390
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're a really elite athlete,</v>

556
00:22:13.391 --> 00:22:14.224
<v Speaker 4>you need both sides of those corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'll give you a great example </v>

557
00:22:15.431 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 4>because it's kind of what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

558
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.290
<v Speaker 4>There's these guys who are ultra elite </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepares to eat right,</v>

559
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.200
<v Speaker 4>sleep right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they train,</v>

560
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do everything right,</v>

561
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.273
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then if one little thing goes wrong </v>

562
00:22:25.771 --> 00:22:27.400
<v Speaker 4>and it messes with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

563
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 4>If they don't get the right food or </v>
<v Speaker 4>their weight cuts bad,</v>

564
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.570
<v Speaker 4>they start panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

565
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.640
<v Speaker 4>And then on the opposite side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>coin,</v>

566
00:22:33.641 --> 00:22:35.230
<v Speaker 4>there's these cowboys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

567
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.450
<v Speaker 4>And they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to eat right.</v>

568
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to sleep right.</v>

569
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna do anything right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one time step in the cage,</v>

570
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fight my ass off and nothing's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to bother me.</v>

571
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.730
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you need,</v>

572
00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 4>you need both sides of those coins to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make,</v>

573
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.500
<v Speaker 4>to make it whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you want someone ideally who does</v>

574
00:22:50.501 --> 00:22:53.620
<v Speaker 4>everything right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time when when something</v>

575
00:22:53.621 --> 00:22:56.290
<v Speaker 4>goes wrong or their toe hurts or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

576
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 4>they could just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

577
00:22:57.701 --> 00:23:00.010
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go compete anyways.</v>

578
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.350
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to have both sides of those and</v>

579
00:23:01.351 --> 00:23:02.184
<v Speaker 4>that's where I think a lot of the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters are more on the cowboy side of </v>

580
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

581
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.793
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to do a lot of things </v>

582
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:07.330
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just going to go.</v>

583
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.273
<v Speaker 4>I'm on firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to fight like cowboy example and </v>

584
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the namesake of my argument.</v>

585
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

586
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 4>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

587
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.413
<v Speaker 4>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably one of the more </v>

588
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 4>fascinating things about any form of </v>
<v Speaker 4>high stress,</v>

589
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:24.604
<v Speaker 4>high level competition is there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>real guidelines of how to prepare your </v>

590
00:23:27.221 --> 00:23:28.310
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

591
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.163
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody teaches you how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestle and it teaches you how to </v>

592
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:31.894
<v Speaker 4>kickbox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all these martial arts schools </v>

593
00:23:33.431 --> 00:23:34.264
<v Speaker 4>that teach you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Technique is very few real like rock </v>

594
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 4>solid program of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

595
00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.620
<v Speaker 4>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to manage your mind.</v>

596
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:46.280
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should be taught almost like</v>

597
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

598
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.890
<v Speaker 3>in a step by step basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

599
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:50.450
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a flat tire.</v>

600
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Do you kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you scream?</v>

601
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Or do you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what it is.</v>

602
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:55.364
<v Speaker 3>And Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have been born in Ethiopia with </v>

603
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

604
00:23:57.651 --> 00:24:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I could be living in a fucking coal mine</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

605
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.251
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky.</v>

606
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

607
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.590
<v Speaker 3>This is a minor setback.</v>

608
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like I,</v>

609
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I actually started going to graduate </v>
<v Speaker 2>school for sports psychology.</v>

610
00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:07.994
<v Speaker 2>I got nine of the 36 credits done and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I actually got a scholarship to go </v>

611
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.240
<v Speaker 2>further and get it paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

612
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.570
<v Speaker 2>but I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was traveling so much that was 2007,</v>

613
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.423
<v Speaker 2>eight when I was trying to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympic team and I was gone all the </v>

614
00:24:19.611 --> 00:24:20.444
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once I was out of school for a </v>

615
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.490
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

616
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.710
<v Speaker 2>there's no freaking way I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going back to school.</v>

617
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.563
<v Speaker 2>Not going to sit in a class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to freaking write </v>

618
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:30.470
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll still study sports psych on my own.</v>

619
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:31.543
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so actually every Monday I do </v>

620
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.840
<v Speaker 2>something called a mental Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my facebook pages and just people</v>

621
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:38.600
<v Speaker 2>messaged me questions and I talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mental aspect because you're right,</v>

622
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:40.250
<v Speaker 2>there aren't enough people to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

623
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:41.083
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

624
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.400
<v Speaker 2>in wrestling is actually this company </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been highly successful.</v>

625
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:44.234
<v Speaker 2>I'll call wrestling mindset and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a training program for athletes' </v>

626
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:50.090
<v Speaker 2>minds because there's nothing out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a website for this?</v>

627
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

628
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.980
<v Speaker 2>It's wrestling mindset.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>

629
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.380
<v Speaker 2>That's great ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're starting to.</v>

630
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.880
<v Speaker 2>That'll apply to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

631
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to expand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expand and in different disciplines.</v>

632
00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:58.094
<v Speaker 2>But you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

633
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.323
<v Speaker 2>I think there's these general principles</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sports psych which can kind of go </v>

634
00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:03.980
<v Speaker 2>into any domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

635
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:04.814
<v Speaker 2>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a hundred percent correct that </v>

636
00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:07.370
<v Speaker 2>every single individual is different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

637
00:25:07.371 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 2>And one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for me,</v>

638
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

639
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm an overthinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

640
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:13.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do something over and over and over</v>

641
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:14.390
<v Speaker 2>and over it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

642
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.463
<v Speaker 2>And so like when I was 14 I was at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>big national tournament and I was </v>

643
00:25:18.051 --> 00:25:18.884
<v Speaker 2>obsessing about who I'd have to wrestle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this stuff and it warmed me up </v>

644
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:21.650
<v Speaker 2>mentally.</v>

645
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.200
<v Speaker 2>I got my ass kicked right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my coach said,</v>

646
00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was that person many,</v>

647
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:29.990
<v Speaker 2>many years ago and it helped me just </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about fishing.</v>

648
00:25:29.991 --> 00:25:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that maybe because I,</v>

649
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.680
<v Speaker 2>if I don think I don't want to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what I'm going to do,</v>

650
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not one of those guys because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it too much.</v>

651
00:25:36.441 --> 00:25:38.810
<v Speaker 2>All obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so ever since age 15,</v>

652
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:39.644
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always taught myself to train </v>

653
00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:44.780
<v Speaker 2>myself to not think about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition within like,</v>

654
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six hours,</v>

655
00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:47.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe the day before I can think of a</v>

656
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.980
<v Speaker 2>couple of days before I can think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

657
00:25:48.981 --> 00:25:51.110
<v Speaker 2>But like even when I'm in MMA locker </v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

658
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.093
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking about my fight my minds</v>
<v Speaker 2>off of it because if I'm not federal </v>

659
00:25:56.901 --> 00:25:59.390
<v Speaker 2>understand what my strategy is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be by six hours before.</v>

660
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.180
<v Speaker 2>And I haven't trained myself by six </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours before a fucked.</v>

661
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm already fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what am I going to do?</v>

662
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Six hours a brilliant strategy in six </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

663
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:10.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like $6,</v>

664
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

665
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.293
<v Speaker 2>I intentionally fly people to my fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are just my friends who have no </v>

666
00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:17.714
<v Speaker 2>intention of telling me what to do mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>wise and just want to bullshit </v>

667
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.290
<v Speaker 2>backstage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

668
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.153
<v Speaker 2>Because really smart keeps me really </v>
<v Speaker 2>calm because otherwise I started </v>

669
00:26:24.311 --> 00:26:26.270
<v Speaker 2>obsessing and that's going to lead to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some really negative.</v>

670
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:28.160
<v Speaker 2>So that's like one thing is where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

671
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.410
<v Speaker 2>but some people are the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the f off too much.</v>

672
00:26:30.411 --> 00:26:32.090
<v Speaker 2>You kinda gotta bring them back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus.</v>

673
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

674
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.060
<v Speaker 2>in other sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that concept is,</v>

675
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:36.350
<v Speaker 2>is what they'll learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

676
00:26:36.351 --> 00:26:37.184
<v Speaker 2>You want going into the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people you got to get them amped </v>

677
00:26:38.781 --> 00:26:39.890
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>

678
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.600
<v Speaker 2>most people you've got to calm them down</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit.</v>

679
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Like let's relax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's execute because we need to.</v>

680
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Anthony</v>

681
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and I execute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

682
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:46.463
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's a lot of these sports</v>
<v Speaker 1>psych concepts that can crossover many </v>

683
00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:51.480
<v Speaker 1>different genres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're right,</v>

684
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:52.314
<v Speaker 1>no one trains you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a huge part of the sport </v>

685
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.650
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

686
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Speaker 1>it's overlooked because the sport is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

687
00:26:58.501 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is true with every </v>
<v Speaker 1>sport,</v>

688
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.160
<v Speaker 1>the sport's not just the movements that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make,</v>

689
00:27:02.161 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 1>it's what's going on inside the machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the manager of the body is the mind.</v>

690
00:27:06.931 --> 00:27:07.764
<v Speaker 1>And if the manager is like poorly formed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the structures all out of whack and </v>

691
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you have like whenever a problem comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

692
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 1>you fall right into a pit and do all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things should be addressed and you</v>

693
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 1>should develop this mindset and develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to manage your mindset.</v>

694
00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at a young age,</v>

695
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

696
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:26.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>

697
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:27.624
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

698
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.513
<v Speaker 1>I think one issue thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know if it's going to </v>

699
00:27:30.681 --> 00:27:31.170
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

700
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.790
<v Speaker 1>or now we'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

701
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.403
<v Speaker 1>There's very few people who came from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling background that are head </v>

702
00:27:37.051 --> 00:27:39.000
<v Speaker 1>coaches of MMA teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

703
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:39.834
<v Speaker 1>Who came from this very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very structured environment of college </v>

704
00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you go to,</v>

705
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I want you to remember my first training</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp to American top team in Florida and</v>

706
00:27:47.191 --> 00:27:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 11:00</v>

707
00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:50.090
<v Speaker 1>practice chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 11:00.</v>

708
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Where's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's everyone at?</v>

709
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we start at 1145,</v>

710
00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:57.420
<v Speaker 1>like 45 minutes late and that's the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

711
00:27:57.421 --> 00:27:58.254
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well am I am and 1145 or should I show </v>

712
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 1>up at 11?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we say 1145,</v>

713
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:03.923
<v Speaker 1>I can show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

714
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 1>so I show up at 1130 and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>started 1120,</v>

715
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 1>you know like what the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in college wrestling,</v>

716
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.750
<v Speaker 1>if you're a minute late you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get punished to college wrestling.</v>

717
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very structured,</v>

718
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:17.820
<v Speaker 1>organized system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm very curious to see the day where</v>

719
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:22.410
<v Speaker 1>there is an MMA team that is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured like a college wrestling team</v>

720
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:23.244
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be very effective </v>

721
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.773
<v Speaker 1>towards performance for athletes and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again you are going to have is </v>

722
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:29.910
<v Speaker 1>a different structure because called </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressers are poor,</v>

723
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are you gonna?</v>

724
00:28:30.761 --> 00:28:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Have a bunch of MMA fighters who get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich and then say,</v>

725
00:28:32.641 --> 00:28:34.590
<v Speaker 1>well I don't want to do what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying right now.</v>

726
00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to make them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

727
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:36.834
<v Speaker 1>They're the one paying your paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it does become an interesting </v>

728
00:28:39.631 --> 00:28:42.360
<v Speaker 1>circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think if there was someone who ran</v>

729
00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:45.450
<v Speaker 1>a highly structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts team as structured as</v>

730
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.313
<v Speaker 1>a college team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they would have a gigantic </v>

731
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:49.104
<v Speaker 1>amount of success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think their guys would get a lot </v>

732
00:28:49.981 --> 00:28:51.060
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot faster.</v>

733
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.293
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you'd see a really </v>

734
00:28:53.791 --> 00:28:56.850
<v Speaker 1>interesting dynamic developed between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the high level athletes and the coaches.</v>

735
00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're still trying to,</v>

736
00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what's the best way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to coach fighters.</v>

737
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got their own way of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

738
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:04.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us,</v>

739
00:29:04.251 --> 00:29:04.741
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hobbies,</v>

740
00:29:04.741 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 1>ways different than the way they do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>at American top team,</v>

741
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Matt Hume was doing a different than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way duke does it.</v>

742
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:11.303
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you could tell us how </v>

743
00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:14.874
<v Speaker 1>well the athletes compete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way you really find out </v>

744
00:29:17.161 --> 00:29:19.770
<v Speaker 1>who's correct and who's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who needs to make adjustments.</v>

745
00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really hard in fighting because</v>

746
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even your highest level camps,</v>

747
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.960
<v Speaker 1>how many say Bella torn ucl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

748
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.130
<v Speaker 1>How many high level MMA fights do they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have per year?</v>

749
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:29.993
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there'd be a lot for most of </v>

750
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:32.620
<v Speaker 1>these teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

751
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.040
<v Speaker 1>And so you only get 30 samples sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

752
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in college wrestling team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have,</v>

753
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.350
<v Speaker 1>between everybody on the team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the all 40 guys,</v>

754
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:42.640
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have at least a thousand</v>

755
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.500
<v Speaker 2>matches every single year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minimum,</v>

756
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:47.170
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then obviously every event is scored</v>

757
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Speaker 2>by team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every deal made is scored by team,</v>

758
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:50.164
<v Speaker 2>every Ncaa Championship scored by team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get a very good indication of </v>

759
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 2>what coaches are doing it right and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>coaches are doing it wrong.</v>

760
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.860
<v Speaker 2>And then obviously with recruiting </v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

761
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.550
<v Speaker 2>the coaching I'm doing right now get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next crop of the best talent.</v>

762
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.413
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have a very good idea of </v>

763
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.120
<v Speaker 2>what's working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is not working.</v>

764
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.210
<v Speaker 2>We're in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we struggled with it because the</v>

765
00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:10.630
<v Speaker 2>sample size isn't large enough to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>us a really,</v>

766
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:11.980
<v Speaker 2>really direct correlation.</v>

767
00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Now you were able to instigate your </v>
<v Speaker 3>strategy in pretty much every single one</v>

768
00:30:18.231 --> 00:30:21.230
<v Speaker 3>of your mma fights the only fight where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you really struggled as a fight.</v>

769
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

770
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:23.750
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a close fight.</v>

771
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.760
<v Speaker 3>What was different in that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

772
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.640
<v Speaker 2>so that was my first fight at dukes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

773
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.733
<v Speaker 2>obviously J is pretty damn good too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't wanna take that away from </v>

774
00:30:31.811 --> 00:30:32.321
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was right,</v>

775
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:35.530
<v Speaker 2>number 16 in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something at that point in time.</v>

776
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:38.350
<v Speaker 2>So that was my first fight at dukes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the biggest mistake I made,</v>

777
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and obviously at that time,</v>

778
00:30:39.581 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally two years into my fighting</v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

779
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.370
<v Speaker 2>so I stopped wrestling completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

780
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.460
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do one wrestling practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved to Duke's August for a while.</v>

781
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:51.250
<v Speaker 2>I moved to Wisconsin August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first searching and Duke's August first.</v>

782
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.830
<v Speaker 2>I fought a three months later at the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>of October.</v>

783
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I literally did not do one wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

784
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.590
<v Speaker 2>So what were you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

785
00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:59.350
<v Speaker 2>I was just striking like six times a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>

786
00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:00.184
<v Speaker 2>I was doing Jujitsu a handful of times a</v>
<v Speaker 2>week and then I was doing conditioning </v>

787
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 2>instead after that fight my rest.</v>

788
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then actually I went to,</v>

789
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.380
<v Speaker 2>my brother was living in New York at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time who,</v>

790
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.350
<v Speaker 2>my brother is also an ncaa champ and </v>
<v Speaker 2>went to visit him for thanksgiving.</v>

791
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.990
<v Speaker 2>He whooped my ass and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I freaking suck at wrestling.</v>

792
00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

793
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.570
<v Speaker 2>like I went cold Turkey and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

794
00:31:16.571 --> 00:31:17.404
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to wrestle every day to be </v>

795
00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:20.240
<v Speaker 2>great at wrestling anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I need,</v>

796
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:21.123
<v Speaker 2>I need to wrestle once a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice a week with high level </v>

797
00:31:23.921 --> 00:31:26.410
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at that point in time,</v>

798
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.270
<v Speaker 2>and for pretty much the rest of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

799
00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I would go to one of the local colleges </v>
<v Speaker 2>once a week or twice a week just to keep</v>

800
00:31:32.951 --> 00:31:33.784
<v Speaker 2>my skills sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that was the biggest </v>

801
00:31:35.501 --> 00:31:38.380
<v Speaker 2>mistake I made in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't wrestle at all prior to it.</v>

802
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Jim Rohn was good.</v>

803
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:41.620
<v Speaker 2>He was also a division one college </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers.</v>

804
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.080
<v Speaker 2>He knew what he was doing also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

805
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.630
<v Speaker 2>but I think if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to pinpoint one thing that,</v>

806
00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:47.420
<v Speaker 2>that would be it.</v>

807
00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.990
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it fascinating that a guy with as </v>
<v Speaker 3>much wrestling experiences you have,</v>

808
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:54.830
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is take some time off</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything degrades.</v>

809
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.753
<v Speaker 3>Let's timing</v>

810
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.541
<v Speaker 2>sell timing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

811
00:31:56.541 --> 00:31:59.270
<v Speaker 2>So you take three months off your time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to go to.</v>

812
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

813
00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Tell you I wasn't doing one practice and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

814
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.710
<v Speaker 2>but that was also what helped me get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>striking thing down as I was doing,</v>

815
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.370
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I think you actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>made this point a,</v>

816
00:32:10.371 --> 00:32:11.204
<v Speaker 2>who the hell are you talking to about </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestlers are willing to go to the </v>

817
00:32:14.181 --> 00:32:15.014
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was striking six to seven times a </v>

818
00:32:16.341 --> 00:32:18.660
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many strikers go and wrestle?</v>

819
00:32:18.661 --> 00:32:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Six to seven times a week</v>

820
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.910
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of them do.</v>

821
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.100
<v Speaker 3>They literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they refused to.</v>

822
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Well there was Francis in Ghana is </v>
<v Speaker 3>training camp.</v>

823
00:32:25.231 --> 00:32:27.750
<v Speaker 3>When I talk to people outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards,</v>

824
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:29.550
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before everyone's saying,</v>

825
00:32:29.551 --> 00:32:31.050
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in tremendous shape.</v>

826
00:32:31.051 --> 00:32:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Everything's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then afterwards there was like,</v>

827
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.740
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't turn on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he crazy training on the ground.</v>

828
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Like all he wants to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

829
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.090
<v Speaker 3>well you can't let them do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

830
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.023
<v Speaker 3>You can't let him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to fight and a division one </v>

831
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Speaker 3>wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

832
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:48.450
<v Speaker 3>how is he going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is he going to,</v>

833
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.303
<v Speaker 3>how is he gonna stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to somehow or another </v>

834
00:32:51.681 --> 00:32:53.280
<v Speaker 3>magically stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the take downs,</v>

835
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.400
<v Speaker 3>you have to train that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to train it.</v>

836
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah and well and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to train it,</v>

837
00:32:57.841 --> 00:33:00.210
<v Speaker 2>but then even when people train it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strikers,</v>

838
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.850
<v Speaker 2>strikers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to do it.</v>

839
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

840
00:33:03.811 --> 00:33:06.900
<v Speaker 2>when I go to Duke's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started at dukes and it went down</v>

841
00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:08.550
<v Speaker 2>to four times a week where we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>striking,</v>

842
00:33:08.551 --> 00:33:10.320
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the beginning it was six or seven</v>

843
00:33:10.321 --> 00:33:12.360
<v Speaker 2>times a week sessions a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm striking.</v>

844
00:33:12.361 --> 00:33:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm immersed in that culture.</v>

845
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 2>I have to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't not learn.</v>

846
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:20.250
<v Speaker 2>We're doing six to seven times a week </v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

847
00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.160
<v Speaker 2>But the strikers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to do one wrestling practice a</v>

848
00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.470
<v Speaker 2>week to wrestling practices a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

849
00:33:25.471 --> 00:33:28.890
<v Speaker 2>if you're here and they're here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to catch them by doing</v>

850
00:33:28.891 --> 00:33:31.710
<v Speaker 2>one practice a week?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's freaking impossible.</v>

851
00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.090
<v Speaker 2>You need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I,</v>

852
00:33:33.091 --> 00:33:37.140
<v Speaker 2>if I got to like be in charge of an MMA </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys camp and I don't know,</v>

853
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I coach wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love coaching the kids.</v>

854
00:33:39.001 --> 00:33:42.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I ever want to coach mma</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I would consider for someone like</v>

855
00:33:42.211 --> 00:33:44.490
<v Speaker 2>high level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to immerse yourself.</v>

856
00:33:44.491 --> 00:33:45.324
<v Speaker 2>You literally have to take three months </v>
<v Speaker 2>and freaking wrestle every single day </v>

857
00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.190
<v Speaker 2>because Russell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to bill,</v>

858
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:51.420
<v Speaker 2>you have to build those skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to work,</v>

859
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.700
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well do it one time a week,</v>

860
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.050
<v Speaker 2>you are going to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

861
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:57.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree and I think that it.</v>

862
00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.750
<v Speaker 3>It all depends on what the athlete </v>
<v Speaker 3>brings to the table.</v>

863
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.793
<v Speaker 3>Like some guys have like a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling and then maybe they need to </v>

864
00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:04.674
<v Speaker 3>work more on submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some guys need to work more on </v>

865
00:34:06.481 --> 00:34:08.790
<v Speaker 3>their striking that get hit too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

866
00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.953
<v Speaker 3>it's every single fighter is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a different recipe and you have </v>

867
00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:17.430
<v Speaker 3>to figure out what that recipe is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard because it's like you only way</v>

868
00:34:17.431 --> 00:34:18.264
<v Speaker 3>you find out is how well they perform in</v>
<v Speaker 3>competition and how many times you even </v>

869
00:34:21.301 --> 00:34:22.980
<v Speaker 3>get the chance to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three a year,</v>

870
00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.720
<v Speaker 3>three a year maybe.</v>

871
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that,</v>

872
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

873
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.940
<v Speaker 2>that's that and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not saying,</v>

874
00:34:28.941 --> 00:34:29.774
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying a stryker has to do six </v>
<v Speaker 2>sessions a week for three years </v>

875
00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:34.430
<v Speaker 2>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying take three months,</v>

876
00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 2>six months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immerse yourself in that,</v>

877
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.660
<v Speaker 2>be obsessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be obsessed,</v>

878
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.070
<v Speaker 2>learn those skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>

879
00:34:40.071 --> 00:34:42.380
<v Speaker 2>And then after that it might be once a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week,</v>

880
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:43.430
<v Speaker 2>twice a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three times a week.</v>

881
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:44.050
<v Speaker 2>But then when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

882
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.850
<v Speaker 2>when we start considering the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cte factors,</v>

883
00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:47.684
<v Speaker 2>which I'm not totally sold on cte yet as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get hit poster boy for </v>

884
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial art,</v>

885
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:57.890
<v Speaker 2>if you really think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for sure.</v>

886
00:34:57.891 --> 00:34:58.790
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I watched,</v>

887
00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.653
<v Speaker 2>I watched concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I was actually flying in my fight </v>

888
00:35:02.061 --> 00:35:04.130
<v Speaker 2>in April of 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll watch.</v>

889
00:35:04.131 --> 00:35:04.911
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

890
00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

891
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I sparked two more times the rest of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

892
00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>So my crew was 19 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sparred twice.</v>

893
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.823
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do it just because you didn't </v>

894
00:35:14.001 --> 00:35:14.900
<v Speaker 2>want to get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

895
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:16.020
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt as an,</v>

896
00:35:16.021 --> 00:35:16.620
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>

897
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.350
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an unnecessary risk.</v>

898
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.423
<v Speaker 3>Well there was a recent study that came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out just a few days ago that said that </v>

899
00:35:22.821 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 3>it's repeated subconcussive hits and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're causing cte,</v>

900
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:27.260
<v Speaker 3>not concussions.</v>

901
00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the.</v>

902
00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:32.260
<v Speaker 2>But the study that made me really </v>
<v Speaker 2>question the cte phenomenon was they,</v>

903
00:35:32.261 --> 00:35:33.094
<v Speaker 2>they did that study where they studied a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole bunch of professional football </v>

904
00:35:35.291 --> 00:35:39.360
<v Speaker 2>players and it was like 100 per se.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like 99 percent have ct.</v>

905
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:40.194
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they studied people who had </v>

906
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.810
<v Speaker 2>played football for any length of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any length of time and it was like still</v>

907
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:47.910
<v Speaker 2>like 80 percent of the people and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

908
00:35:47.911 --> 00:35:50.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can't live my life in a bubble,</v>

909
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:51.663
<v Speaker 2>like are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can 80 percent of people who have </v>

910
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 2>ever played football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many american males,</v>

911
00:35:56.311 --> 00:35:57.144
<v Speaker 2>what percent of american males walking </v>
<v Speaker 2>around at 40 years old today put some </v>

912
00:35:59.221 --> 00:36:01.410
<v Speaker 2>level of football?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like got to be 80 percent.</v>

913
00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.050
<v Speaker 2>So you'Re telling me 70 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>americans walking around with cte or the</v>

914
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.300
<v Speaker 2>american males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's crazy.</v>

915
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.390
<v Speaker 2>But that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really is what's happening.</v>

916
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.253
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got you got to think there's gotta be </v>

917
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:12.504
<v Speaker 2>some kind of low threshold because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise 40 years down the road if </v>

918
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 2>everybody played football and everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>who played football has cte,</v>

919
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.730
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going to be walking.</v>

920
00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.690
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are walking around like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

921
00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.660
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or is it might be the diet coke.</v>

922
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of that.</v>

923
00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:32.420
<v Speaker 3>I think way more people have some form </v>
<v Speaker 3>of brain damage than real estate.</v>

924
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

925
00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:35.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the world of martial arts,</v>

926
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:37.040
<v Speaker 3>I know so many guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

927
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.200
<v Speaker 3>but let's talk about not martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>are just regular people,</v>

928
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.040
<v Speaker 3>ballplayers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think football players,</v>

929
00:36:42.041 --> 00:36:42.874
<v Speaker 3>it's even worse because you're running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're running at each other clashing </v>

930
00:36:45.881 --> 00:36:47.350
<v Speaker 3>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you watch football.</v>

931
00:36:47.351 --> 00:36:49.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean the damage those guys take his </v>
<v Speaker 3>crate.</v>

932
00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.060
<v Speaker 3>It's once in a ufc you'll see like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild head kit,</v>

933
00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:58.660
<v Speaker 3>care boom and football games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys are literally running at each</v>

934
00:36:58.661 --> 00:37:00.130
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's crazy.</v>

935
00:37:00.131 --> 00:37:00.964
<v Speaker 3>One team's running this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other teams running that way and </v>

936
00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:05.730
<v Speaker 3>they slam into each other and these guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>are 250,</v>

937
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.613
<v Speaker 3>300 pounds that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that impact that the jarring of your </v>

938
00:37:10.211 --> 00:37:11.044
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus they have helmets on which allows </v>

939
00:37:12.611 --> 00:37:14.920
<v Speaker 3>them to be more confident clashing into </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

940
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.980
<v Speaker 3>I think a giant percentage of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

941
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.570
<v Speaker 2>But you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so like I said,</v>

942
00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:20.404
<v Speaker 2>so if that one study said it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something around 80 percent of anyone </v>

943
00:37:23.051 --> 00:37:27.850
<v Speaker 2>who ever played any level of football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>length of time for I like that has cte.</v>

944
00:37:27.851 --> 00:37:28.684
<v Speaker 2>That means like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if we take the american </v>

945
00:37:29.741 --> 00:37:30.574
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least 80 percent of american men </v>

946
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.590
<v Speaker 2>played football</v>

947
00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.810
<v Speaker 3>point in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have ct.</v>

948
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.420
<v Speaker 3>So we're talking about like a gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

949
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:40.770
<v Speaker 3>I think there's levels of cte though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think,</v>

950
00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to the point where you look,</v>

951
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Joe Frazier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could barely talk before he died.</v>

952
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.013
<v Speaker 3>He rest in peace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you also get two guys that are </v>

953
00:37:47.871 --> 00:37:49.670
<v Speaker 3>just like a little forgetful and don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know why,</v>

954
00:37:49.671 --> 00:37:52.040
<v Speaker 3>or impulsive and don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

955
00:37:52.041 --> 00:37:52.874
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of weird stuff that comes </v>

956
00:37:54.861 --> 00:37:55.694
<v Speaker 3>with cte.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've studied it pretty extensively and </v>

957
00:37:57.531 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 3>the more studies that I've read on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more have gotten really</v>

958
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.030
<v Speaker 2>derBy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do you think there's maybe just a low</v>

959
00:38:02.031 --> 00:38:04.040
<v Speaker 2>threshold for what they call cte?</v>

960
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:05.203
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also genes that certain people </v>

961
00:38:06.381 --> 00:38:07.130
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

962
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.630
<v Speaker 3>what was that gene?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda?</v>

963
00:38:08.631 --> 00:38:10.220
<v Speaker 3>Patrick talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

964
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fantastic.</v>

965
00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.391
<v Speaker 3>She's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

966
00:38:12.391 --> 00:38:14.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was talking about uh,</v>

967
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:19.930
<v Speaker 3>some jeans make you more susceptible for</v>
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injury than other ones,</v>

968
00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:21.723
<v Speaker 3>like if you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are many times more likely to </v>

969
00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.400
<v Speaker 3>develop cte.</v>

970
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.990
<v Speaker 2>But then also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so the other thing that I would</v>

971
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.020
<v Speaker 2>is out of curiosity to me when they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>a ct studies,</v>

972
00:38:31.021 --> 00:38:33.210
<v Speaker 2>especially with they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

973
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 2>after death with these football players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

974
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.033
<v Speaker 2>were sent out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dying their pipeline in the </v>

975
00:38:37.331 --> 00:38:38.111
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

976
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:39.850
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that time period,</v>

977
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 2>a steroid use very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high and drug use is also very high</v>

978
00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:48.640
<v Speaker 2>in that culture and so and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and alcohol including drugs.</v>

979
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did those things contribute,</v>

980
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.250
<v Speaker 2>contribute?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a,</v>

981
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it like a mitigating factor or is it </v>

982
00:38:56.381 --> 00:39:00.800
<v Speaker 2>like going to create this crazy storm of</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain damage that you're.</v>

983
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.550
<v Speaker 2>You're going freaking running into </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like this.</v>

984
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:04.623
<v Speaker 2>Then you're doing steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're a fricking and drinking a </v>

985
00:39:06.161 --> 00:39:08.010
<v Speaker 2>pack of beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you're doing some cocaine</v>

986
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 3>that can't be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can.</v>

987
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:11.920
<v Speaker 3>that would be good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't be.</v>

988
00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:12.970
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't be.</v>

989
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

990
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:14.404
<v Speaker 3>Especially the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them get caught with the pain </v>

991
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:17.920
<v Speaker 3>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm caught up on pain pills.</v>

992
00:39:17.921 --> 00:39:18.940
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one,</v>

993
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:19.774
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just found out a tom petty died from </v>

994
00:39:20.951 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 3>fucking pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife and I were talking about sad.</v>

995
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:26.780
<v Speaker 3>That was that a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't have a sense of a</v>

996
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.350
<v Speaker 2>because that my wife and I both love tom</v>
<v Speaker 2>petty music,</v>

997
00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:31.960
<v Speaker 2>but how he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how at 66 years old,</v>

998
00:39:31.961 --> 00:39:35.800
<v Speaker 2>he was still like not so okay with </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>

999
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 2>that he was jamming pills down his </v>
<v Speaker 2>throat,</v>

1000
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:38.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he didn't have a sense of,</v>

1001
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I have had great accomplishments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a great life.</v>

1002
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have people around me that love me,</v>

1003
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:44.310
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1004
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be a sad,</v>

1005
00:39:45.431 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 2>lonely thing when you're overdosing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>pills.</v>

1006
00:39:47.831 --> 00:39:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I would have to assume.</v>

1007
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to guess,</v>

1008
00:39:50.491 --> 00:39:51.324
<v Speaker 3>but I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine he's in some kind of </v>

1009
00:39:52.471 --> 00:39:55.650
<v Speaker 3>pain if we freeze taken those opiates </v>
<v Speaker 3>hip fracture.</v>

1010
00:39:55.651 --> 00:39:58.620
<v Speaker 3>He was recovering from a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got hooked on something,</v>

1011
00:39:58.621 --> 00:40:00.960
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend from amber from the ufc,</v>

1012
00:40:00.961 --> 00:40:01.794
<v Speaker 3>she hurt her ankle recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She blew out her achilles and she said </v>

1013
00:40:04.831 --> 00:40:07.720
<v Speaker 3>the doctor immediately tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prescribe oxycontin was like,</v>

1014
00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:09.630
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1015
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.430
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not taking that shit.</v>

1016
00:40:11.431 --> 00:40:13.350
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1017
00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens man.</v>

1018
00:40:15.121 --> 00:40:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Doctors just try to shove pills down </v>
<v Speaker 3>your throat.</v>

1019
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:18.763
<v Speaker 3>It's a real common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you have any sort of serious </v>

1020
00:40:21.271 --> 00:40:22.104
<v Speaker 3>injury and they put you on that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things they put tom petty on </v>

1021
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:26.243
<v Speaker 3>was fentanyl and fentanyl is that shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking killing every bitch with </v>

1022
00:40:29.281 --> 00:40:31.530
<v Speaker 3>meth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meth are very similar.</v>

1023
00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.940
<v Speaker 3>No heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's heroin dream.</v>

1024
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Really potent opiate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1025
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.840
<v Speaker 3>it's much more much more potent than </v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin.</v>

1026
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:40.743
<v Speaker 3>I know many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many hundreds of times more potent and </v>

1027
00:40:43.021 --> 00:40:43.854
<v Speaker 3>so they give these people fentanyl </v>
<v Speaker 3>patches and then they're taken </v>

1028
00:40:45.781 --> 00:40:50.310
<v Speaker 3>oxycontin's too and who knows what else </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken and I mean I,</v>

1029
00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:55.320
<v Speaker 3>I feel terrible for someone who has bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain like from a broken hip or something</v>

1030
00:40:55.321 --> 00:40:56.154
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but jesus christ take the pain rather </v>

1031
00:40:58.561 --> 00:41:00.060
<v Speaker 3>than death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>

1032
00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:00.923
<v Speaker 3>This shit you could take cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take cbd doesn't even have a </v>

1033
00:41:03.121 --> 00:41:06.450
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive effect and as radical pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>reducing properties to.</v>

1034
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:06.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1035
00:41:06.951 --> 00:41:07.571
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1036
00:41:07.571 --> 00:41:07.820

1037
00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that people are so actively</v>

1038
00:41:12.321 --> 00:41:13.940
<v Speaker 2>prescribing these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these heavy,</v>

1039
00:41:13.941 --> 00:41:14.774
<v Speaker 2>really heavy hard drugs to patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people kill people and weed is still </v>

1040
00:41:18.381 --> 00:41:21.620
<v Speaker 2>illegal and I don't smoke weed so I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not even like for myself,</v>

1041
00:41:21.621 --> 00:41:23.270
<v Speaker 2>but just for other people.</v>

1042
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:24.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1043
00:41:24.671 --> 00:41:27.850
<v Speaker 3>We need to be a pain reliever really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard a lot of people say no.</v>

1044
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.920
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people do say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just maybe,</v>

1045
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:30.993
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the one of those people that you're </v>

1046
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.320
<v Speaker 3>in pain if you're in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just be in pain.</v>

1047
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Just like just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

1048
00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just relax,</v>

1049
00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:40.940
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1050
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:42.800
<v Speaker 3>I remember one time though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my knee operated on,</v>

1051
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:43.634
<v Speaker 3>I had a acl reconstruction and they gave</v>
<v Speaker 3>me one of those buttons in the hospital </v>

1052
00:41:47.341 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 3>when you press it and you get more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was when,</v>

1053
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1054
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.830
<v Speaker 3>they had my leg on this motion machine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1055
00:41:54.831 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right after surgery,</v>

1056
00:41:56.331 --> 00:41:57.164
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to get your blood moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so there's a couple screws in there </v>

1057
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:01.574
<v Speaker 3>and they'd taken my patella tendon and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cut it and put it inside and drilled it </v>

1058
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:05.600
<v Speaker 3>all in place and everything.</v>

1059
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:06.643
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm sitting at this thing just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this throbbing pain and they gave </v>

1060
00:42:09.441 --> 00:42:10.310
<v Speaker 3>me this little button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1061
00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 3>claire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>

1062
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:16.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to overdose.</v>

1063
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.870
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking,</v>

1064
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:18.704
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this could be really fucking dangerous </v>

1065
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:21.950
<v Speaker 3>if you had this in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like a little button on your</v>

1066
00:42:21.951 --> 00:42:25.280
<v Speaker 3>hip and you just press it and you get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dose of morphine.</v>

1067
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:26.114
<v Speaker 3>but it was a wonderful feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only done it once while I was in </v>

1068
00:42:29.061 --> 00:42:31.790
<v Speaker 3>the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got it for that brief moment.</v>

1069
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1070
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:35.080
<v Speaker 3>this is an amazing feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like,</v>

1071
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 3>like you're floating through a cloud of </v>
<v Speaker 3>love and just flying through the air.</v>

1072
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>

1073
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.620
<v Speaker 3>I went from being in exacerbating pain </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

1074
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.230
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel?</v>

1075
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Then we got into this discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about cte.</v>

1076
00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.150
<v Speaker 1>So now like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1077
00:42:49.151 --> 00:42:49.984
<v Speaker 1>I think mma is a terrible career path </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people ask me all the time and as a </v>

1078
00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:57.930
<v Speaker 1>professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't defeat it in two different,</v>

1079
00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.330
<v Speaker 1>two different organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple people.</v>

1080
00:43:01.331 --> 00:43:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the right career path for </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of people.</v>

1081
00:43:03.491 --> 00:43:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Probably not a great career path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1082
00:43:05.381 --> 00:43:06.214
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:08.140
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel about it when you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1084
00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're obviously saying and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the fence,</v>

1085
00:43:10.511 --> 00:43:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but you're saying I think a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are getting cte clearly.</v>

1086
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.000
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about being involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>with acs?</v>

1087
00:43:17.001 --> 00:43:20.110
<v Speaker 1>That's like in my future I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably coach them mma,</v>

1088
00:43:20.111 --> 00:43:22.660
<v Speaker 1>but I struggle with it because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1089
00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I really recommend this person to</v>

1090
00:43:24.821 --> 00:43:25.720
<v Speaker 1>have a mayor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I not?</v>

1091
00:43:25.721 --> 00:43:26.554
<v Speaker 1>Because are they going to end up fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and not be able to take care of the </v>

1092
00:43:28.361 --> 00:43:29.200
<v Speaker 1>kids are aware.</v>

1093
00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should ever recommend </v>
<v Speaker 1>mma to anybody.</v>

1094
00:43:31.511 --> 00:43:31.961
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1095
00:43:31.961 --> 00:43:32.794
<v Speaker 1>I usually don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody should recommend </v>

1096
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.550
<v Speaker 1>an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think some people,</v>

1097
00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:38.080
<v Speaker 1>it's their destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1098
00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:41.900
<v Speaker 1>There's a few people out there that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to look.</v>

1099
00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should recommend </v>
<v Speaker 1>skydiving to anybody either though.</v>

1100
00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.753
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend andy stump is a world record </v>

1101
00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:52.030
<v Speaker 1>holder in the world flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1102
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:53.063
<v Speaker 1>that's the death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever read there was that book </v>

1103
00:43:55.811 --> 00:43:56.930
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1104
00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:01.980
<v Speaker 1>somethIng chasing superman or do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember if it was about people like kim</v>

1105
00:44:02.621 --> 00:44:07.621
<v Speaker 1>and how it almost always ends up very </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly becAuse you need this bigger rush</v>

1106
00:44:08.111 --> 00:44:08.944
<v Speaker 1>and this bigger rush and this bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>rush and tell big wave surfers and the </v>

1107
00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:12.874
<v Speaker 1>flying suit and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about the psychology </v>

1108
00:44:14.741 --> 00:44:18.010
<v Speaker 1>behind it and how like it ends up poorly</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1109
00:44:18.011 --> 00:44:18.844
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very often because these people need </v>

1110
00:44:19.931 --> 00:44:22.870
<v Speaker 1>bigger rushes and more challenges and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the fucking themselves up.</v>

1111
00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.730
<v Speaker 1>It only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never</v>

1112
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.800
<v Speaker 3>encourage anyone to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for him,</v>

1113
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a retired navy seal and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is just another level psychotic</v>

1114
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.950
<v Speaker 4>shit that he can do to fill his time </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

1115
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.070
<v Speaker 4>but he's got a bunch of sponsors and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually makes a living doing that.</v>

1116
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.700
<v Speaker 4>I would never recommend that to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't recommend skiing.</v>

1117
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 4>Think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my kids like skiing.</v>

1118
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:45.174
<v Speaker 4>I don't even like skiing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go skiing with them every time I </v>

1119
00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:47.694
<v Speaker 4>skied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1120
00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:49.050
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never gotten hurt,</v>

1121
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.430
<v Speaker 4>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>

1122
00:44:50.431 --> 00:44:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Every time I'm skiing though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1123
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:52.710
<v Speaker 4>don't get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get hurt.</v>

1124
00:44:52.711 --> 00:44:54.360
<v Speaker 4>Don't get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who wouldn't get hurt?</v>

1125
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.590
<v Speaker 4>Don't get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get hurt.</v>

1126
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.510
<v Speaker 4>I think it's sonny bono.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1127
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 4>who else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the kennedy's and a tree.</v>

1128
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:02.370
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then maybe that was a.</v>

1129
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.250
<v Speaker 4>That could have been false flag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1130
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.130
<v Speaker 4>don't push them into the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking took it.</v>

1131
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.310
<v Speaker 4>Ski out with a sniper rifle right when </v>
<v Speaker 4>he got too close to the woods.</v>

1132
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's a lot of very,</v>

1133
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:18.861
<v Speaker 4>very dAngerous career and I think if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel compelled to do that,</v>

1134
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.290
<v Speaker 4>no one should be talking to you into </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1135
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.280
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think anybody should stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1136
00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.250
<v Speaker 4>Like I liked the fact that boxing </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists,</v>

1137
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would never want to tell,</v>

1138
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>facility lowman,</v>

1139
00:45:29.131 --> 00:45:31.050
<v Speaker 4>chanko don't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1140
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 4>I would never want to tell them don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

1141
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.150
<v Speaker 4>I want to see him fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1142
00:45:34.151 --> 00:45:35.250
<v Speaker 4>what if they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if,</v>

1143
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.113
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets proven without a shadow of a </v>

1144
00:45:37.831 --> 00:45:40.220
<v Speaker 4>doubt that these things cause he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he cte.</v>

1145
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.880
<v Speaker 4>Do you think the government is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>ban them?</v>

1146
00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.190
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they can really.</v>

1147
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.053
<v Speaker 4>How could they be?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they going to ban banning </v>

1148
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:48.780
<v Speaker 4>everything?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really do.</v>

1149
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:49.643
<v Speaker 4>They like banning things that cost them </v>
<v Speaker 4>money or the cost people who donate to </v>

1150
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 4>them money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fair.</v>

1151
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:57.750
<v Speaker 4>Now the banning of the drugs is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>tied to pharmaceutical drugs.</v>

1152
00:45:57.751 --> 00:45:58.584
<v Speaker 4>More than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not banning it because they're </v>

1153
00:46:00.631 --> 00:46:03.540
<v Speaker 4>trying to save us that they're banning </v>
<v Speaker 4>it because someone's putting pressure on</v>

1154
00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 4>them to ban it or put it in the past and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're banning skateboarding.</v>

1155
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:11.220
<v Speaker 4>No one's trying to ban bmx ride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys get fucked up.</v>

1157
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:16.920
<v Speaker 4>of those guys doing the ramp with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>skateboard and the guy got to the top of</v>

1158
00:46:16.921 --> 00:46:19.930
<v Speaker 4>the ramp and didn't catch it right and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fell like $100.</v>

<v Speaker 4>this is a freaking fantastic book.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

1177
00:46:54.871 --> 00:46:55.704
<v Speaker 4>So if you look like the original x game </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and then you go to like the x </v>

1178

1181
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.253

00:47:08.311 --> 00:47:09.270
<v Speaker 4>getting eft up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1183
00:47:09.271 --> 00:47:10.104
<v Speaker 4>You get to a certain point where you can</v>
<v Speaker 4>only do so many flips in the air with </v>

1184
00:47:12.541 --> 00:47:13.374
<v Speaker 4>your bike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently they keep trying to do one </v>

1185
00:47:16.651 --> 00:47:17.580
<v Speaker 4>rotation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody go,</v>

1186
00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:18.414

<v Speaker 4>Somebody that comes along with two and </v>

1187
00:47:19.831 --> 00:47:21.430
<v Speaker 4>then now they're doing three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't there?</v>

1188
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:25.110
<v Speaker 4>The movIe about tony hawk was like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first one did the 7:20</v>

1189
00:47:25.111 --> 00:47:27.120
<v Speaker 4>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now they go way more,</v>

1190
00:47:27.121 --> 00:47:28.060
<v Speaker 4>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1191
00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.533
<v Speaker 4>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be more in every year </v>

1192
00:47:30.971 --> 00:47:31.804
<v Speaker 4>and if you watch any of those par core </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids that are jumping from building to </v>

1193
00:47:34.721 --> 00:47:37.480
<v Speaker 4>building and and we've had one of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>are in here.</v>

1194
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:38.820
<v Speaker 4>What was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>James</v>

1195
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:40.880
<v Speaker 5>was a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The</v>

1196
00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:44.060
<v Speaker 4>find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember that one.</v>

1197
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:47.030
<v Speaker 4>I would mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a political ones.</v>

1198
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.520
<v Speaker 4>I think some of the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>highly fascinating.</v>

1199
00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an interesting time.</v>

1200
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.620
<v Speaker 4>I get labeled all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's bizarre,</v>

1201
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.440
<v Speaker 4>but everybody's so quick to label people</v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

1202
00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.173
<v Speaker 4>it's such a strange time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finger pointing and putting people in </v>

1203
00:48:01.491 --> 00:48:03.850
<v Speaker 4>boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disingenuously.</v>

1204
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:07.880
<v Speaker 4>It's more divisive of these leftist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to,</v>

1205
00:48:07.881 --> 00:48:09.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1206
00:48:09.351 --> 00:48:10.350
<v Speaker 4>they want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1207
00:48:10.351 --> 00:48:13.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to make people less racist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what they're really doing,</v>

1208
00:48:13.431 --> 00:48:14.780
<v Speaker 4>they're being very divisive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:48:14.781 --> 00:48:15.840
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like I would,</v>

1210
00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:16.933
<v Speaker 4>I think you identify aS libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I w I identify more as a libertarian </v>

1211
00:48:20.181 --> 00:48:22.220
<v Speaker 4>than republican or democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1212
00:48:22.221 --> 00:48:26.180
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people say I'm all right or </v>
<v Speaker 4>love trump so much and it's,</v>

1213
00:48:26.181 --> 00:48:28.900
<v Speaker 4>well I'm more libertarian than anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1214
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:31.970
<v Speaker 4>I think less government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less invasion invasion into our lives,</v>

1215
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:33.133
<v Speaker 4>but people want to put you into a little</v>
<v Speaker 4>box because you don't agree with what </v>

1216
00:48:35.421 --> 00:48:36.230
<v Speaker 4>they're saying.</v>

1217
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:37.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird time for that.</v>

1218
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.310
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I think what you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying about shaming.</v>

1219
00:48:40.311 --> 00:48:42.650
<v Speaker 4>They try to shame you and racist or </v>
<v Speaker 4>shame,</v>

1220
00:48:42.651 --> 00:48:43.484
<v Speaker 4>but you're not doing that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretending someone's racist when you </v>

1221
00:48:45.801 --> 00:48:46.634
<v Speaker 4>know they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if you're pretending that someone is </v>

1222
00:48:48.471 --> 00:48:52.610
<v Speaker 4>a sexist or homophobic or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you know that you're just there.</v>

1223
00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.713
<v Speaker 4>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're ignoring nuance and what's what </v>

1224
00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.150
<v Speaker 4>they're really doing also is they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>making.</v>

1225
00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.730
<v Speaker 4>They're making people afrAid to speak </v>
<v Speaker 4>their minds.</v>

1226
00:49:01.731 --> 00:49:02.570
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And really how,</v>

1227
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.790
<v Speaker 4>if you and I had a disagreement on </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

1228
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:07.730
<v Speaker 4>how we come to a common ground is by </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussing it,</v>

1229
00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.140
<v Speaker 4>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1230
00:49:09.141 --> 00:49:10.910
<v Speaker 4>I think you're a reasonable person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you believe?</v>

1231
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.880
<v Speaker 4>You'd say that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't agree with that and this is why.</v>

1232
00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.460
<v Speaker 4>And eventually we would talk it out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe we still disagree,</v>

1233
00:49:16.461 --> 00:49:17.600
<v Speaker 4>but we'd come to a common ground.</v>

1234
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But instead the people on the one side,</v>

1235
00:49:20.481 --> 00:49:22.310
<v Speaker 4>they're not saying that they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what'd you say?</v>

1236
00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:26.000
<v Speaker 4>You're racist or sexist or homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your name one.</v>

1237
00:49:26.001 --> 00:49:27.690
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then ended discussion.</v>

1238
00:49:27.691 --> 00:49:29.210
<v Speaker 4>Then there's no discussion at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1239
00:49:29.211 --> 00:49:30.290
<v Speaker 4>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to win.</v>

1240
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1241
00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:32.143
<v Speaker 4>They just turned them when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to label you and then get the </v>

1242
00:49:33.711 --> 00:49:35.050
<v Speaker 4>upper hand when.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1243
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:35.973
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a real problem with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people not being reasonable and I think </v>

1244
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:39.703
<v Speaker 4>that you should be able to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations like I've had people have </v>

1245
00:49:42.471 --> 00:49:44.990
<v Speaker 4>criticized me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like even in person I've taught,</v>

1246
00:49:44.991 --> 00:49:46.730
<v Speaker 4>like why would you have that guy on your</v>
<v Speaker 4>show?</v>

1247
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:48.223
<v Speaker 4>Which one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any guy like a milo yiannopoulos per </v>

1248
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.730
<v Speaker 4>sample and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well look what happened.</v>

1249
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean we got to see how the guy thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got all,</v>

1250
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:59.490
<v Speaker 4>all of his weird issues that came up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his book deal falling apart.</v>

1251
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.670
<v Speaker 4>A lot of that had to do with </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversations I had with them.</v>

1252
00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.533
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like now you get a chance to see </v>

1253
00:50:04.431 --> 00:50:05.330
<v Speaker 4>how the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

1254
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the way things.</v>

1255
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:10.220
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a provocateur.</v>

1256
00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not how I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1257
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.333
<v Speaker 4>But I think that everybody has this </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective on who he is that is </v>

1258
00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:22.880
<v Speaker 4>exaggerated because of this public </v>
<v Speaker 4>persona that he does to be outrageous.</v>

1259
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:23.743
<v Speaker 4>So I think that's a double edged sword </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think Alex Jones does it as </v>

1260
00:50:26.361 --> 00:50:27.420
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aware,</v>

1261
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:29.660
<v Speaker 4>way crazier than well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but okay.</v>

1262
00:50:29.661 --> 00:50:31.160
<v Speaker 4>But same idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1263
00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:34.790
<v Speaker 4>Is part of their persona is a show is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

1264
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:35.624
<v Speaker 4>It's making it more extreme because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to say that one thing that's </v>

1265
00:50:38.961 --> 00:50:41.390
<v Speaker 4>totally effing crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>IT'll catch a headline somewhere.</v>

1266
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.330
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they have these beliefs,</v>

1267
00:50:44.331 --> 00:50:45.164
<v Speaker 4>but then they kind of go beyond them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it is a show because they will </v>

1268
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:51.020
<v Speaker 4>make more money if they get more </v>
<v Speaker 4>followers or more people clicking on the</v>

1269
00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:52.790
<v Speaker 4>articles or videos or whatever.</v>

1270
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.680
<v Speaker 4>So I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then,</v>

1271
00:50:54.681 --> 00:50:55.514
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to someone like bret weinstein </v>

1272
00:50:56.661 --> 00:50:57.494
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's fascinating people calling </v>

1273
00:50:58.581 --> 00:51:02.390
<v Speaker 4>him a racist and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was strong liberal.</v>

1274
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:03.493
<v Speaker 4>Well he's as progressive as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's as far from a racist as you could </v>

1275
00:51:06.171 --> 00:51:07.004
<v Speaker 4>ever get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1276
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:08.061
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

1277
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:13.061
<v Speaker 4>there's this need to label people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well alex is alex showman and,</v>

1278
00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:17.120
<v Speaker 4>but also like he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some things that are pretty fucked up,</v>

1279
00:51:17.121 --> 00:51:19.010
<v Speaker 4>like the sandy hook stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1280
00:51:19.011 --> 00:51:19.844
<v Speaker 4>That sandy hook was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's looking for conspiracies </v>

1281
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.200
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everywhere.</v>

1282
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:27.140
<v Speaker 4>He finds them someplace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sometimes he's right,</v>

1283
00:51:27.141 --> 00:51:27.974
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it,</v>

1284
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1285
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:29.143
<v Speaker 4>But the problem with looking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracies everywhere as you going </v>

1286
00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:35.180
<v Speaker 4>gonna you're gonna make people feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>

1287
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.293
<v Speaker 4>I meaN,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there was an article that I read </v>

1288
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:38.743
<v Speaker 4>about a guy who was a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 4>theorist until his son was killed in </v>

1289
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:45.980
<v Speaker 4>sandy hook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were tellIng him that his son was</v>

1290
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:46.883
<v Speaker 4>killed and that is some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>government actor and this guy was </v>

1291
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:51.180
<v Speaker 4>devastated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1292
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.070
<v Speaker 4>Of course the people that are really the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nutty conspiracy theorist.</v>

1293
00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:54.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vulgar,</v>

1294
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:57.670
<v Speaker 4>no undercover still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's still under grover.</v>

1295
00:51:58.750 --> 00:51:59.583
<v Speaker 4>there's people out there that look for </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracies and everything and it </v>

1296
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:05.790
<v Speaker 4>becomes a real problem because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>muddies up the water and I think,</v>

1297
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:08.630
<v Speaker 4>I think at the same time you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least for me,</v>

1298
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:11.300
<v Speaker 4>and I think we have similar thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>processes,</v>

1299
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.760
<v Speaker 4>you can't just take what makes you made,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tells you and say,</v>

1300
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:15.680
<v Speaker 4>well I guess that's how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1301
00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:20.720
<v Speaker 4>So as an end in some situations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in sandy hook you have dead kids.</v>

1302
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:22.850
<v Speaker 4>People grieving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have bodies.</v>

1303
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:24.210
<v Speaker 4>Autopsy reports.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1304
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:27.620
<v Speaker 4>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No guns.</v>

1305
00:52:27.621 --> 00:52:30.800
<v Speaker 4>You had a mentally ill person who had </v>
<v Speaker 4>access to these gut.</v>

1306
00:52:30.801 --> 00:52:32.870
<v Speaker 4>Then if you take that same thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>process on say,</v>

1307
00:52:32.871 --> 00:52:34.730
<v Speaker 4>stephen paddock in the las vegas </v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting,</v>

1308
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.920
<v Speaker 4>well we still don't know how that turned</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

1309
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:41.990
<v Speaker 4>The las vegas shooting is complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as we know one guy did do that.</v>

1310
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:44.120
<v Speaker 4>Well now we're coming out with new </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1311
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:47.450
<v Speaker 4>I think there was other people involved </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he might've gotten help from people,</v>

1312
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.890
<v Speaker 4>whether it's willingly or unwillingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but or wittingly or unwittingly,</v>

1313
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.810
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think there was other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting.</v>

1314
00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.540
<v Speaker 4>They've said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know.</v>

1315
00:52:56.541 --> 00:52:57.374
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what the law of these </v>

1316
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:59.450
<v Speaker 4>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to understand that you're never</v>

1317
00:52:59.451 --> 00:53:01.070
<v Speaker 4>really gonna know what the real truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1318
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.990
<v Speaker 4>You have to keep an open mind and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1319
00:53:02.991 --> 00:53:04.310
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well this person says this.</v>

1320
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:06.490
<v Speaker 4>What does this person say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does this person say?</v>

1321
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.600
<v Speaker 4>They do these things check out with each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>

1322
00:53:08.601 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 4>and it's like how many different types </v>
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>

1323
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 4>They changed the las vegas shootings </v>
<v Speaker 4>timeline,</v>

1324
00:53:11.991 --> 00:53:12.824
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it was kind of weird that it </v>

1325
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:14.804
<v Speaker 4>went way out of mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll send you heard about it for a </v>

1326
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.570
<v Speaker 4>week and then you didn't hear about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>again for one of the times.</v>

1327
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.820
<v Speaker 4>I think the news cycle today is about </v>
<v Speaker 4>billing hours.</v>

1328
00:53:22.821 --> 00:53:25.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you would think people want answers.</v>

1329
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

1330
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.843
<v Speaker 3>that's the largest mass shooting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States history that we'd want </v>

1331
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:29.994
<v Speaker 3>some more clear answers on what really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened and how it happened and why it </v>

1332
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:33.744
<v Speaker 3>happened and we never really got those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know there's been a few new </v>

1333
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:37.854
<v Speaker 3>articles on it recently and so maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to find out more </v>

1334
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:40.674
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an incredibly confusing story </v>

1335
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:46.530
<v Speaker 3>because the guy was clearly a psycho </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly fucked up.</v>

1336
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm clearly planned this out for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1337
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:50.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1338
00:53:50.491 --> 00:53:54.630
<v Speaker 3>he got hotel rooms overlooking music </v>
<v Speaker 3>festivals and other places.</v>

1339
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was planning out how to do this </v>

1340
00:53:57.181 --> 00:54:00.240
<v Speaker 3>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a note in his,</v>

1341
00:54:00.241 --> 00:54:01.074
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his hotel room that had all the </v>

1342
00:54:02.731 --> 00:54:03.564
<v Speaker 3>ballistics calculation so he knew like </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet drop from x amount of yards and </v>

1343
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:10.110
<v Speaker 3>he was calculating how to kill all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1344
00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:14.040
<v Speaker 3>He was on some weird antidepressants and</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti,</v>

1345
00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:15.243
<v Speaker 3>not anti anti anxiety medication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which does all kinds of weird shit to </v>

1346
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:18.390
<v Speaker 3>your head.</v>

1347
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:21.690
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy that was prone to fits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rage.</v>

1348
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.110
<v Speaker 3>He was a a calculated professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>gambler.</v>

1349
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:27.540
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird stuff with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1350
00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.900
<v Speaker 3>The fact that he accumulated these </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons over years.</v>

1351
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:31.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe did it knowing that he was </v>

1352
00:54:34.321 --> 00:54:37.460
<v Speaker 3>going to do this so you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>

1353
00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Whenever there's a mass shooting or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

1354
00:54:40.141 --> 00:54:41.760
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have two things happen.</v>

1355
00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:43.890
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants answers to.</v>

1356
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:44.724
<v Speaker 3>Everybody forgets about it really quick </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of new shit happens in the news </v>

1357
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.020
<v Speaker 3>and if it wasn't your family that got </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>

1358
00:54:49.021 --> 00:54:50.640
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't someone who.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're close to the gunshot.</v>

1359
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I know people that got shot there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1360
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I know people that I met them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met people in vegas that that got shot</v>

1361
00:54:55.951 --> 00:54:57.540
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to them after it was over.</v>

1362
00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:03.350
<v Speaker 3>It was complete and total chaos and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's complete and total chaos,</v>

1363
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.180
<v Speaker 3>you get all sorts of conflicting </v>
<v Speaker 3>reports.</v>

1364
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:07.163
<v Speaker 3>People were running into other casinos </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that there's a shooter because </v>

1365
00:55:09.301 --> 00:55:10.134
<v Speaker 3>they ran out of that area and so then </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were calling and police reports </v>

1366
00:55:12.571 --> 00:55:13.404
<v Speaker 3>because the shooter in monte carlo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a shooter in this and so those </v>

1367
00:55:15.871 --> 00:55:16.704
<v Speaker 3>things get reported as fact when many </v>
<v Speaker 3>times it's part of the confusion of a </v>

1368
00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.860
<v Speaker 3>chaotic mass shooting like that vegas </v>
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>

1369
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.293
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that this one guy definitely </v>

1370
00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:28.044
<v Speaker 3>killed a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but whether or not someone was helping </v>

1371
00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:32.760
<v Speaker 3>him or whether or not there was other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people involved or I think they're still</v>

1372
00:55:32.761 --> 00:55:33.690
<v Speaker 3>investigating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still.</v>

1373
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:34.553
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so I guess my greater point there </v>

1374
00:55:36.391 --> 00:55:37.630
<v Speaker 3>would be that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1375
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:38.873
<v Speaker 3>if you're an intelligent individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just take what cvs tells you </v>

1376
00:55:42.781 --> 00:55:44.070
<v Speaker 3>to be complete fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1377
00:55:44.071 --> 00:55:46.320
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go do some investigation yourself,</v>

1378
00:55:46.321 --> 00:55:48.600
<v Speaker 3>you try to read from different sources </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

1379
00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.830
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sandy hook.</v>

1380
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I think there's like a 99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

1381
00:55:51.961 --> 00:55:52.794
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine percent chance of the sandy hook </v>

1382
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:55.230
<v Speaker 3>was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1383
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Is there some crazy in the impetus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really small chance that didn't happen?</v>

1384
00:55:59.941 --> 00:56:00.571
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1385
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:01.650
<v Speaker 3>But I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there is,</v>

1386
00:56:01.651 --> 00:56:04.780
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very unlikely and vegas was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a zero percent chance.</v>

1387
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Sandy sandy hook didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Percent looked into it pretty,</v>

1388
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just sad to me.</v>

1389
00:56:10.261 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 3>And you're a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1390
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.673
<v Speaker 3>the idea of your kid going to school and</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting their school getting shot up by </v>

1391
00:56:15.901 --> 00:56:17.220
<v Speaker 3>some psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1392
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if someone was saying that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was fake.</v>

1393
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After your kid's dead,</v>

1394
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:24.670
<v Speaker 3>you'd be frustrated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>infuriated.</v>

1395
00:56:24.671 --> 00:56:25.504
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't even know where to turn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these that's actually happening to </v>

1396
00:56:28.421 --> 00:56:29.254
<v Speaker 3>these people and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting labeled as frauds and </v>

1397
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 3>people are emailing them and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how could you do this?</v>

1398
00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:38.620
<v Speaker 3>You're defrauding the american people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're A part of the illuminati or.</v>

1399
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1400
00:56:40.201 --> 00:56:41.034
<v Speaker 1>Well I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's obviously those people </v>

1401
00:56:42.511 --> 00:56:45.210
<v Speaker 1>who are on right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way one side of it,</v>

1402
00:56:45.211 --> 00:56:45.871
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's.</v>

1403
00:56:45.871 --> 00:56:47.940
<v Speaker 1>So if you go a spectrum for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1404
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:49.103
<v Speaker 1>there's the american who's drinking diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>coke and eaten frozen pizza and </v>

1405
00:56:51.601 --> 00:56:52.434
<v Speaker 1>listening to ever cbs says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the total opposite of the </v>

1406
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:55.624
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the group that thinks every </v>

1407
00:56:57.241 --> 00:56:58.074
<v Speaker 1>single thing that ever happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America as a planet conspiracy by the </v>

1408
00:56:59.941 --> 00:57:00.774
<v Speaker 1>new world order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are two ends of the spectrum </v>

1409
00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:03.603
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can fall anywhere in the middle </v>

1410
00:57:04.441 --> 00:57:05.274
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so I think as an intelligent </v>

1411
00:57:06.601 --> 00:57:07.434
<v Speaker 1>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look at situations independently and </v>

1412
00:57:09.151 --> 00:57:09.984
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1413
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.510
<v Speaker 1>there's some sketchy things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not sketchy things there.</v>

1414
00:57:12.511 --> 00:57:13.720
<v Speaker 1>That's probably true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1415
00:57:13.721 --> 00:57:16.160
<v Speaker 1>And kind of independently think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff by ourselves and that's,</v>

1416
00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.880
<v Speaker 1>that's how I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1417
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a wise way to approach it.</v>

1418
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.660
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think cbs or nbc or you know,</v>

1419
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.970
<v Speaker 3>any name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your new source,</v>

1420
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:27.790
<v Speaker 3>they're run by people and if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't there,</v>

1421
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:30.280
<v Speaker 3>they only have access to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of information and sometimes they</v>

1422
00:57:30.281 --> 00:57:33.430
<v Speaker 3>get bad information and sometimes they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't necessarily know.</v>

1423
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:34.443
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much of it as a part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>some grand conspiracy rather than how </v>

1424
00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:40.330
<v Speaker 3>much of it is a part of the chaos of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these moments.</v>

1425
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:41.543
<v Speaker 3>The lack Of information and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawing conclusions and then also </v>

1426
00:57:45.701 --> 00:57:49.600
<v Speaker 3>witnesses on the scene on people on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scene of something that's crazy.</v>

1427
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:52.960
<v Speaker 3>They give all sorts of weird accounts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're just,</v>

1428
00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:53.973
<v Speaker 3>they're filled with adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how to handle the </v>

1429
00:57:55.121 --> 00:57:56.290
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>

1430
00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.530
<v Speaker 3>People don't handle chaotic events very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1431
00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think the earth is flat,</v>

1432
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.821
<v Speaker 1>if that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1433
00:58:03.821 --> 00:58:05.750
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1434
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:09.210
<v Speaker 1>What do you possibly believe in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be crazy.</v>

1435
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Can I take a piss and I'll tell you I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

1436
00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No worries man.</v>

1437
00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's something wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my bladder.</v>

1438
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:18.810
<v Speaker 1>You can hold it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1439
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you think I've trained it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1440
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:21.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that guy is going to try to shoot </v>

1441
00:58:23.011 --> 00:58:23.844
<v Speaker 1>himseLf to see the flat earth and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days guys shooting himself up </v>

1442
00:58:26.941 --> 00:58:29.970
<v Speaker 1>and go into the space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't take one mark second.</v>

1443
00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:30.900
<v Speaker 1>James kingston was dead.</v>

1444
00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:32.310
<v Speaker 3>James kingston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1445
00:58:32.311 --> 00:58:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Sorry james.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1446
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:34.543
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1447
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:37.020
<v Speaker 3>it's a dunbar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is dunbar's number,</v>

1448
00:58:37.021 --> 00:58:37.854
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can only keep 150 people in your </v>

1449
00:58:39.721 --> 00:58:42.120
<v Speaker 3>brain at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that fucking picture.</v>

1450
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:44.040
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at a picture for the audio</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>

1451
00:58:44.041 --> 00:58:44.874
<v Speaker 3>Have james kingston on the top of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>tower and I don't know how many fucking </v>

1452
00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:49.403
<v Speaker 3>stories he's up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's insane because below him and I </v>

1453
00:58:52.001 --> 00:58:56.460
<v Speaker 3>mean way below him are skyscrapers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably like dubai or something.</v>

1454
00:58:56.461 --> 00:58:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1455
00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:57.623
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that dunbar's number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could apply to other things besides </v>

1456
00:58:59.691 --> 00:59:03.430
<v Speaker 1>people like websites or chore numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>instructions that can.</v>

1457
00:59:03.450 --> 00:59:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1458
00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:04.621
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1459
00:59:04.621 --> 00:59:05.850
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1460
00:59:05.851 --> 00:59:08.970
<v Speaker 3>I think it applies to too many things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1461
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:12.450
<v Speaker 3>it applies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think for names,</v>

1462
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:13.470
<v Speaker 3>names and people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1463
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:14.933
<v Speaker 3>I'm struggling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm getting like I have an </v>

1464
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.340
<v Speaker 3>overflowing pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>even though I'm a fan of his,</v>

1468

<v Speaker 4>like he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went chris cater and then I'm like,</v>

1470
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:36.380
<v Speaker 4>Like I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're running out of space in my</v>

1471
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:39.590
<v Speaker 4>head for names.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my apologies to calvin cater.</v>

1472
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm running out of names and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about dunbar's number,</v>

1473
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:45.560
<v Speaker 4>how you can only keep so many people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain.</v>

1474
00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.640
<v Speaker 4>My brain's overflowed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any hard drive space left.</v>

1475
00:59:49.641 --> 00:59:50.474
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought it was the is that the guy </v>

1476
00:59:52.551 --> 00:59:53.384
<v Speaker 4>says you can only keep track of 150 </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like what's going on in their </v>

1477
00:59:56.711 --> 00:59:59.930
<v Speaker 4>relationships in that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You only have so much room in your.</v>

1478
00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 4>In your hard drive space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:04.010
<v Speaker 4>It's based on a tribal societies.</v>

1480
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:07.910
<v Speaker 4>Like our brains are sort of designed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep track of 150 people.</v>

1481
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:10.280
<v Speaker 4>That's how we evolved and then over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last,</v>

1482
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>x amount of hundreds of years.</v>

1483
01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:14.450
<v Speaker 4>Now all of a sudden you have to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>track of many,</v>

1484
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:17.420
<v Speaker 4>many multiples of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you're someone like you or</v>

1485
01:00:17.421 --> 01:00:22.250
<v Speaker 4>I that runs into so many people who you </v>
<v Speaker 4>meet on a regular basis.</v>

1486
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:24.140
<v Speaker 4>You've got to keep those people on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

1487
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.460
<v Speaker 4>But is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it.</v>

1488
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:26.323
<v Speaker 4>So I guess I haven't read that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it that you have to just know their </v>

1489
01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:31.334
<v Speaker 4>names and faces or is it that you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to know like what's going on in their </v>

1490
01:00:33.201 --> 01:00:34.034
<v Speaker 4>life?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're supposed to be able to </v>

1491
01:00:35.361 --> 01:00:37.150
<v Speaker 4>track them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like have a,</v>

1492
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.113
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's intimate or personal </v>

1493
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:42.410
<v Speaker 4>relationship with these people know </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1494
01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.753
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like there's only something </v>

1495
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.033
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you think about a </v>

1496
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.863
<v Speaker 4>commentating on fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to pay attention to these guys </v>

1497
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:50.744
<v Speaker 4>and what they're doing and their career </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's hundreds and hundreds and </v>

1498
01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:54.520
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of 500 fighters now.</v>

1499
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:59.390
<v Speaker 4>500 fighters that's active and then how </v>
<v Speaker 4>manY of them get new guys come in,</v>

1500
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.090
<v Speaker 4>old guy go away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still keep them all in my head.</v>

1501
01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.710
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's sean sherk up to these days?</v>

1502
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:07.240
<v Speaker 4>They're all still in the head and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's not,</v>

1503
01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.200
<v Speaker 4>there's only so much room and after </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile you'll,</v>

1504
01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.101
<v Speaker 4>you'll wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1505
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:11.900
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are these people going?</v>

1506
01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found that obviously with a,</v>

1507
01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.900
<v Speaker 4>It's sad like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1508
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.750
<v Speaker 4>college friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1509
01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:18.351
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1510
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:20.810
<v Speaker 4>and it's good because you see them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like no time has passed.</v>

1511
01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:22.830
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's like I,</v>

1512
01:01:22.831 --> 01:01:24.410
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I know if I was living in two minutes</v>

1513
01:01:24.411 --> 01:01:25.730
<v Speaker 4>away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd probably be best friends still.</v>

1514
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:26.450
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1515
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:29.180
<v Speaker 4>Right now I get to see you once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>twice a year maybe.</v>

1516
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:32.510
<v Speaker 4>I can't keep up with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super challenging.</v>

1517
01:01:32.511 --> 01:01:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now max and I run.</v>

1518
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:37.520
<v Speaker 4>The rest of the academy is my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have three in Wisconsin and it's like</v>

1519
01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:39.423
<v Speaker 4>this fall was my first wife fulltime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked at one and so now I'm really </v>

1520
01:01:43.131 --> 01:01:47.180
<v Speaker 4>immersed in the one academy whereas I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was kind of loosely keeping track of all</v>

1521
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:48.014
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now that I'm kind of totally </v>

1522
01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:49.964
<v Speaker 4>immersed in the one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find it a lot harder to keep track of </v>

1523
01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:53.354
<v Speaker 4>what's going on at the other two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas kind of bed right before when I </v>

1524
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:58.280
<v Speaker 4>wasn't so immersed in one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1525
01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:01.280
<v Speaker 4>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eddie bravo is 100 schools.</v>

1526
01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:01.881
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1527
01:02:01.881 --> 01:02:04.250
<v Speaker 4>As a 110 plans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu's worldwide.</v>

1528
01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:07.250

<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1529
01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:08.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to ask him.</v>

1530
01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:10.550
<v Speaker 4>I know he travels to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He travels.</v>

1531
01:02:10.551 --> 01:02:13.480
<v Speaker 4>He's constantly traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He travels constantly.</v>

1532
01:02:13.481 --> 01:02:16.430
<v Speaker 4>He's doing seminars at all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got always traveling.</v>

1533
01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once the sodium to do like one time a </v>

1534
01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 4>year for each facility</v>

1535
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.821
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1536
01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question because that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be columbia.</v>

1537
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going,</v>

1538
01:02:23.641 --> 01:02:25.020

<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1539
01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want three years.</v>

1540
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:27.863
<v Speaker 1>Singapore now he was out in st paul when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there and one of my fights this </v>

1541
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was maybe the.</v>

1542
01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the may fight dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1543

<v Speaker 1>seminar and now that now they have a </v>

1544
01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:39.654
<v Speaker 1>10th planet program at evolve is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evolve as supposed to be an amazing </v>

1545
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>facility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard some things.</v>

1546
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the nicest mma facility I've ever</v>

1547
01:02:49.021 --> 01:02:49.854
<v Speaker 1>been to and so they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually just opened their fourth </v>

1548
01:02:51.151 --> 01:02:51.881
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin,</v>

1549
01:02:51.881 --> 01:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore is a city state,</v>

1550
01:02:54.421 --> 01:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 6 million people in a,</v>

1551
01:02:56.451 --> 01:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>on a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really small island.</v>

1552
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.053
<v Speaker 1>But some of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of their academies are only a mile </v>

1553
01:03:02.221 --> 01:03:02.970
<v Speaker 1>or two apart.</v>

1554
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not far apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the population density is such that,</v>

1555
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:08.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they listened.</v>

1556
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:12.420
<v Speaker 1>They start classes at I think at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM and they end class at 11:00</v>

1557
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.253
<v Speaker 1>PM and you can freaking stop in anytime </v>
<v Speaker 1>of day and there'll be a class there </v>

1558
01:03:16.381 --> 01:03:20.070
<v Speaker 1>that's full with muay thai or jujitsu or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you name it.</v>

1559
01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.560
<v Speaker 1>It'll be going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1560
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well manhattan is kind of like that a </v>

1561
01:03:24.331 --> 01:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1562
01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan as how many jujitsu schools </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in manhattan?</v>

1563
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:30.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously marcel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1564
01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:33.240
<v Speaker 1>there's hundreds but run big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Handles got a huge one.</v>

1565
01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Marcel has got a huge one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1566
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:39.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are huge places.</v>

1567
01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds and hundreds of students.</v>

1568
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1569
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what someone told me.</v>

1570
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:45.743
<v Speaker 1>Hands over a thousand students in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>main New York city location and I think </v>

1571
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1572
01:03:51.471 --> 01:03:52.304
<v Speaker 1>it ain't cheap because you got to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>for rent and so they're probably paying </v>

1573
01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>a couple hundred bucks a month.</v>

1574
01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So evolve is I think $350 a month.</v>

1575
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But obviously,</v>

1576
01:04:02.311 --> 01:04:05.010
<v Speaker 1>so Singapore is one of the most wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries on the planet,</v>

1577
01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:08.220
<v Speaker 1>so you have to take that into account </v>
<v Speaker 1>for which everyone that lives there,</v>

1578
01:04:08.221 --> 01:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>he has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a decent amount of wealth and they spend</v>

1579
01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:14.120
<v Speaker 1>it differently in Singapore is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating country if you,</v>

1580
01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:14.973
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1581
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:17.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there 15 times or whatever,</v>

1582
01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:18.354
<v Speaker 1>so I got kind of immersed in the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that ended up reading the books </v>

1583
01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:22.290
<v Speaker 1>about lee kuan yew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who started the country.</v>

1584
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1585
01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:25.020
<v Speaker 1>there was a whole bunch of those asian </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

1586
01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:28.410
<v Speaker 1>they're got independence in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties and sixties.</v>

1587
01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe was founded in 1965.</v>

1588
01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:34.490
<v Speaker 1>It could be off by one year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may be,</v>

1589
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1590
01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:39.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those countries are not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>super well economically.</v>

1591
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.313
<v Speaker 1>And sIngapore is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is freaking standout country who's </v>

1592
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>like top five world per person wealth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and why,</v>

1593
01:04:47.831 --> 01:04:49.230
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they doing so much better?</v>

1594
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.153
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so this is me from an outsider's </v>

1595
01:04:51.901 --> 01:04:52.734
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1596
01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really do a lot of kind of.</v>

1597
01:04:55.171 --> 01:04:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like self tracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1598
01:04:57.451 --> 01:05:01.410
<v Speaker 1>And so every month a bunch of your check</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out to a,</v>

1599
01:05:01.411 --> 01:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we would pay taxes,</v>

1600
01:05:02.611 --> 01:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of mannequins,</v>

1601
01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.160
<v Speaker 1>other check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so they can spend it.</v>

1602
01:05:05.161 --> 01:05:07.260
<v Speaker 1>This is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spend their money on three things.</v>

1603
01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>It goes into this fund,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1604
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>

1605
01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.870
<v Speaker 1>and housing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1606
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.110
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any one of those,</v>

1607
01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>if you want the cheapest form of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1608
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.160
<v Speaker 1>It's very government subsidized and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out of your fund,</v>

1609
01:05:21.161 --> 01:05:21.994
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So only a little bit of mine comes out </v>

1610
01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>if you want the nicest healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nicest housing are nice,</v>

1611
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.610
<v Speaker 1>then it's only a tiny percent government</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidized.</v>

1612
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more expensive stuff gets,</v>

1613
01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>whether it's education or housing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>

1614
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>the less subsidized it gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cheaper it gets,</v>

1615
01:05:37.481 --> 01:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>the more subsidized it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so everyone kind of,</v>

1616
01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:40.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pay,</v>

1617
01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>they pay into this fund so everyone has </v>
<v Speaker 1>this personal fund that they can use and</v>

1618
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into those three things.</v>

1619
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:48.454
<v Speaker 1>And so I think a lot of people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they feel like they have more </v>

1620
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>control over their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1621
01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:52.443
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it is very strict regulations </v>

1622
01:05:54.191 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>and laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from what I've seen and I've spent a</v>

1623
01:05:56.621 --> 01:05:58.570
<v Speaker 1>lot of time there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone seems pretty happy.</v>

1624
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.680
<v Speaker 1>That's interest.</v>

1625
01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting way to go.</v>

1626
01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:01.923
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any one good way </v>

1627
01:06:02.651 --> 01:06:04.960
<v Speaker 3>to government to govern people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.330
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I think we have a pretty good</v>
<v Speaker 3>system over here,</v>

1629
01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:08.164
<v Speaker 3>but it's obviously filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>bureaucratic bullshit and too much </v>

1630
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.100
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much government.</v>

1631
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 3>There's so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's way too many people doing stupid</v>

1632
01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:17.800
<v Speaker 3>jobs and getting paid too much or doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and I mean it's.</v>

1633
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the shit like,</v>

1634
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to chase down medical marijuana </v>

1635
01:06:22.601 --> 01:06:25.990
<v Speaker 3>in 2017 trying to stop legal marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 3>and like why,</v>

1636
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:27.820
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's paying you to do this?</v>

1637
01:06:27.821 --> 01:06:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Like why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you doing that?</v>

1638
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:29.854
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not what our tax dollars should be </v>

1639
01:06:31.331 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 3>going to.</v>

1640
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:33.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny when you go all the way back,</v>

1641
01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.213
<v Speaker 1>I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've talked about that process of </v>

1642
01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.390
<v Speaker 1>who's keeping them from doing this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have about the pharmaceuticals with,</v>

1643
01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:41.110
<v Speaker 1>with weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is true.</v>

1644
01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>You know what a funny one I think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is john mccain and mixed martial arts,</v>

1645
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:48.550
<v Speaker 1>who is sponsoring john mccain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>budweiser,</v>

1646
01:06:48.551 --> 01:06:49.384
<v Speaker 1>budweiser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was like the main advertise of her </v>

1647
01:06:51.191 --> 01:06:52.024
<v Speaker 1>boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you cannot make an argument </v>

1648
01:06:53.921 --> 01:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>that boxing safer for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mma,</v>

1649
01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.300
<v Speaker 1>you can't freaking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like it's impossible possible.</v>

1650
01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:01.930
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But john mccain's over here getting paid</v>

1651
01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:05.380
<v Speaker 1>by budweiser and saying mma is awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's ban it.</v>

1652
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.570
<v Speaker 1>And the same time he's promoting boxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

1653
01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:09.100
<v Speaker 1>It's freaking mindblowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1654
01:07:09.101 --> 01:07:10.780
<v Speaker 1>in his defense it was mma</v>

1655
01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.713
<v Speaker 3>from a long time ago and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't really the same as them may </v>

1656
01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:15.764
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's turned the corner and now he </v>

1657
01:07:16.881 --> 01:07:17.714
<v Speaker 3>supports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1658
01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:22.010
<v Speaker 3>But also you've got budweiser and bud </v>
<v Speaker 3>light or sponsors now of mna.</v>

1659
01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:22.903
<v Speaker 3>So it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's a real problem with </v>

1660
01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:26.030
<v Speaker 3>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty years.</v>

1661
01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:28.820
<v Speaker 3>There's so many dirty politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what percentage is,</v>

1662
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:30.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>97.</v>

1663
01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:32.180
<v Speaker 3>It's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a fucking high.</v>

1664
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:37.070
<v Speaker 3>What crazy shIt that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What crazy conspiracy do you believe in?</v>

1665
01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:38.613
<v Speaker 1>So the one that got me started really </v>
<v Speaker 1>like independently think myself as nine </v>

1666
01:07:41.921 --> 01:07:43.150
<v Speaker 1>slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think that was,</v>

1667
01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:45.340
<v Speaker 1>that was for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1668
01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:46.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1669
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:48.080
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1670
01:07:48.270 --> 01:07:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know all the answers,</v>

1671
01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:54.630
<v Speaker 1>but I know the given explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe what given explanation.</v>

1672
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that came,</v>

1673
01:07:55.901 --> 01:07:58.540
<v Speaker 1>what's the damn report that they wrote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1674
01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.040
<v Speaker 3>the nist report?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1675
01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:01.300
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it?</v>

1676
01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:01.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1677
01:08:01.961 --> 01:08:06.961
<v Speaker 3>nist is the one who did the report on </v>
<v Speaker 3>tower seven collapsing</v>

1678
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:08.343
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the other report that came out </v>

1679
01:08:08.891 --> 01:08:11.230
<v Speaker 1>with right away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1680
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:14.560
<v Speaker 1>so my buddies live right by the airport </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he played loose change for me.</v>

1681
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were out of your ged mind,</v>

1682
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:19.840
<v Speaker 1>like you are insane man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1683
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:22.990
<v Speaker 1>and then I started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't make,</v>

1684
01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe I should think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1685
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>that it was an inside job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not totally,</v>

1686
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1687
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.220
<v Speaker 1>so I think obviously the planes flew </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the buildings for sure.</v>

1688
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:35.540
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1689
01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe the,</v>

1690
01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.293
<v Speaker 1>there was inklings inclinations that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>had that was going to happen and that </v>

1691
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:43.580
<v Speaker 1>not enough was done to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1692
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.883
<v Speaker 3>this is one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is another thing where you have a </v>

1693
01:08:47.451 --> 01:08:50.060
<v Speaker 3>gigantic tragedy and because of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic tragedy,</v>

1694
01:08:50.061 --> 01:08:50.894
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that draw these </v>
<v Speaker 3>conclusions based on witness testimony </v>

1695
01:08:54.801 --> 01:08:55.634
<v Speaker 3>and things that are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think you have to realize that </v>

1696
01:08:57.670 --> 01:09:01.040
<v Speaker 3>anytime there is some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some thing that happens,</v>

1697
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:05.450
<v Speaker 3>people start looking for all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different correlating factors,</v>

1698
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:06.051
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start saying,</v>

1699
01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:06.884
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>

1700
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:07.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a local tests that were being </v>

1701
01:09:10.161 --> 01:09:10.994
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

1702
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.923
<v Speaker 3>they were looking out for planes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were potentially gonna fly into </v>

1703
01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:15.734
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They knew this was going to happen in </v>

1704
01:09:16.311 --> 01:09:17.144
<v Speaker 3>advance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you talk to anybody that is in </v>

1705
01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.470
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1706
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.690
<v Speaker 3>they're dealing with that shit every </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1707
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.943
<v Speaker 3>Just one day something happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always warnings about terrorist </v>

1708
01:09:29.391 --> 01:09:30.224
<v Speaker 3>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always warnings about things </v>

1709
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:32.930
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of times they,</v>

1710
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 3>these warnings get toward like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fbi stopped that.</v>

1711
01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

1712
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.850
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one,</v>

1713
01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:38.410
<v Speaker 1>there was one in san francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1714
01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:40.950
<v Speaker 1>They had bombs and they stopped and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>through security,</v>

1715
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1716
01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 3>and this has happened many times now </v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1717
01:09:44.610 --> 01:09:45.443
<v Speaker 3>when it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they don't catch it and it goes </v>

1718
01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:49.380
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people start thinking,</v>

1719
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some sort of a conspiracy.</v>

1720
01:09:51.481 --> 01:09:53.820
<v Speaker 3>They allow these planes to fly into </v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings.</v>

1721
01:09:53.821 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 3>The missile hit the pentagon and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled up.</v>

1722
01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:57.853
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a video came out of that last </v>

1723
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:00.320
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I might've been fake news.</v>

1724
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.273
<v Speaker 1>The pentagon thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a video of the pentagon or </v>

1725
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:03.463
<v Speaker 1>something handed the pentagon which </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked take a missile and not an </v>

1726
01:10:04.911 --> 01:10:07.030
<v Speaker 1>airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't believe it was know.</v>

1727
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:07.873
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is interesting because I've never </v>

1728
01:10:08.811 --> 01:10:09.644
<v Speaker 1>seen this video before and obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>there no video evidence of what hit the </v>

1729
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:13.483
<v Speaker 1>pentagon.</v>

1730
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:14.803
<v Speaker 3>There's a video of something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there was one camera thing or a </v>

1731
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:19.303
<v Speaker 3>security camera video that was released,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they did have is all sorts of </v>

1732
01:10:22.101 --> 01:10:22.934
<v Speaker 3>pizza pieces of aircraft all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking lawn in a blown up building and </v>

1733
01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:30.380
<v Speaker 3>a plane that's missing and all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people dead.</v>

1734
01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to guess it was a plane.</v>

1735
01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:33.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1736
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:36.980
<v Speaker 3>I think people look for conspiracies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything because it's exciting,</v>

1737
01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.350
<v Speaker 1>stimulating about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

1738
01:10:40.351 --> 01:10:41.184
<v Speaker 1>but then obviously be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you don't believe that </v>

1739
01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:46.290
<v Speaker 1>everything we're told is the truth right</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

1740
01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:48.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we go to something like a gulf</v>

1741
01:10:48.631 --> 01:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>of tonkin incident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1742
01:10:50.041 --> 01:10:50.874
<v Speaker 1>I mean perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been proven to be false or the </v>

1743
01:10:52.561 --> 01:10:54.240
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the banana republics,</v>

1744
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:55.103
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where dole asked us to go take out one </v>

1745
01:10:56.941 --> 01:10:57.774
<v Speaker 1>of their dictators because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to nationalize all the banana </v>

1746
01:10:59.671 --> 01:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>plants in that country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those things have been now proven</v>

1747
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.713
<v Speaker 1>to be totally factual that the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States government went and did that </v>

1748
01:11:06.511 --> 01:11:07.710
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So The fact that,</v>

1749
01:11:07.711 --> 01:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 19 sixties or seventies,</v>

1750
01:11:09.691 --> 01:11:12.930
<v Speaker 1>those things were reported the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1751
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.000
<v Speaker 1>So we can't obviously take</v>

1752
01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:15.960
<v Speaker 3>everything that we've been reported as </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

1753
01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:17.123
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely been conspiracies </v>

1754
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:19.583
<v Speaker 3>that have been put together and executed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these conspiracies have greatly </v>

1755
01:11:24.991 --> 01:11:28.620
<v Speaker 3>affected the american people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gulf of tonkin is a perfect example.</v>

1756
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:33.090
<v Speaker 3>Another one that they were planning on </v>
<v Speaker 3>was operation northwoods operation.</v>

1757
01:11:33.091 --> 01:11:36.730
<v Speaker 3>Northwoods was one that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>planning on blowing up a drone jet liner</v>

1758
01:11:36.731 --> 01:11:37.564
<v Speaker 3>and blaming it on the cubans that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to arm cuban friendlies and have </v>

1759
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:40.734
<v Speaker 3>them attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted,</v>

1760
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:43.290
<v Speaker 3>obey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be sacrifice american troops</v>

1761
01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:44.124
<v Speaker 3>in american lives and they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do this in order to get people to be </v>

1762
01:11:47.161 --> 01:11:48.810
<v Speaker 3>excited about a war with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1763
01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:49.653
<v Speaker 3>Was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ThIs is a real thing that was signed by </v>

1764
01:11:50.581 --> 01:11:51.414
<v Speaker 3>the joint chiefs of staff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was released by the freedom of </v>

1765
01:11:52.801 --> 01:11:55.020
<v Speaker 3>information act and it was vetoed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>kennedy,</v>

1766
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:58.530
<v Speaker 3>so we know that there were people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in 1962,</v>

1767
01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.180
<v Speaker 3>they were planning on shit like this.</v>

1768
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:01.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a real thing too.</v>

1769
01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 3>And the idea that that just went away </v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one does that anymore.</v>

1770
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:05.910
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dOn't,</v>

1771
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:07.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

1772
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:12.230
<v Speaker 3>there's most certainly evil people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>all fucking sectors of life.</v>

1773
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1774
01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's good to have an open mind,</v>

1775
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.823
<v Speaker 3>but there's also a lot of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy loons that and they get </v>

1776
01:12:19.651 --> 01:12:22.560
<v Speaker 3>consumed that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the issue they get consumed with.</v>

1777
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.113
<v Speaker 3>nothing that I've been told is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously I said that one far </v>

1778
01:12:26.851 --> 01:12:29.040
<v Speaker 3>end of the spectrum that I didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>who that end is.</v>

1779
01:12:29.041 --> 01:12:29.874
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also.</v>

1780
01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:30.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people out there that think to </v>

1781
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:32.003
<v Speaker 3>satellites are fake and they think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were real and that the earth is </v>

1782
01:12:36.721 --> 01:12:40.110
<v Speaker 3>flat as that's once I just shake my head</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the moon landing one's my favorite.</v>

1783
01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.600
<v Speaker 3>I got balls deep in that for years.</v>

1784
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.820
<v Speaker 3>I was completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think they did not go to the moon?</v>

1785
01:12:44.821 --> 01:12:45.231
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1786
01:12:45.231 --> 01:12:46.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

1787
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.750
<v Speaker 3>You know what I think now I think I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>

1788
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:50.423
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that it is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>more fascinating conspiracies that </v>

1789
01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:57.270
<v Speaker 3>between 1969 in 1972,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had seven,</v>

1790
01:12:57.690 --> 01:12:59.950
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven attempt.</v>

1791
01:12:59.951 --> 01:13:00.784
<v Speaker 3>Six of them successful when they went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the apollo 13 was the one that they </v>

1792
01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:05.940
<v Speaker 3>didn't apparently make it and they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come back,</v>

1793
01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:07.163
<v Speaker 3>but that was the only time in history </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a human being has been more than </v>

1794
01:13:10.531 --> 01:13:14.610
<v Speaker 3>400 miles above the earth's surface.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the space station missions,</v>

1795
01:13:14.611 --> 01:13:18.420
<v Speaker 3>all the space shuttle missions and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff is is within orbit.</v>

1796
01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.550
<v Speaker 3>That's low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all very low.</v>

1797
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.090
<v Speaker 3>They went 260,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles out and back into deep space,</v>

1798
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:28.120
<v Speaker 3>but they had never even flown a chicken </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there and see if it comes alive.</v>

1799
01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Like we really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

1800
01:13:29.281 --> 01:13:29.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1801
01:13:29.741 --> 01:13:31.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into this space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Travel.</v>

1802
01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:32.094
<v Speaker 3>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they did a couple of flybys went </v>

1803
01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:35.880
<v Speaker 3>around the moon early before they landed</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the moon.</v>

1804
01:13:35.881 --> 01:13:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But other than that,</v>

1805
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:38.003
<v Speaker 3>I mean without unmanned drones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what we have on mars and things </v>

1806
01:13:41.161 --> 01:13:41.994
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never really sent a living thing </v>

1807
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:44.603
<v Speaker 3>out through the magneto sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the van allen radiation belts </v>

1808
01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:48.750
<v Speaker 3>into deep space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have it,</v>

1809
01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:51.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these possibilities of solar</v>

1810
01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:52.344
<v Speaker 3>flares and anything that would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed him instantly and they just did </v>

1811
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:57.900
<v Speaker 3>that and then we haven't been able to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that since 1972.</v>

1812
01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.480
<v Speaker 3>That's the one way I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never looked into the moon landing.</v>

1813
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kind of goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1814
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

1815
01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:05.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why have we never gone back?</v>

1816
01:14:05.581 --> 01:14:08.070
<v Speaker 3>It's been fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>surely our technology is far superior to</v>

1817
01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:09.840
<v Speaker 3>what it was in 1969,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1818
01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:10.733
<v Speaker 3>The technology is far superior except </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're not using that technology </v>

1819
01:14:15.191 --> 01:14:19.630
<v Speaker 3>for man space travel into deep space </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and it's going to the moon,</v>

1820
01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:23.710
<v Speaker 3>so it's like our technology and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these other areas is superior,</v>

1821
01:14:23.711 --> 01:14:26.800
<v Speaker 3>but they haven't really worked towards </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because they haven't been funded.</v>

1822
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.400
<v Speaker 3>So the big issue is in many ways it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

1823
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.383
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how much money is there and going </v>

1824
01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 3>to the moon and it's also very risky to </v>
<v Speaker 3>send humans out there.</v>

1825
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we're talking about manned </v>
<v Speaker 3>missions to mars now,</v>

1826
01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 3>which may or may not take place by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30.</v>

1827
01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:42.334
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's way cheaper and safer to send </v>

1828
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:46.384
<v Speaker 3>robots out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why risk human lives retro the </v>

1829
01:14:50.021 --> 01:14:50.710
<v Speaker 3>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1830
01:14:50.710 --> 01:14:53.710
<v Speaker 3>And if put robots on mars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rovers,</v>

1831
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:54.583
<v Speaker 3>rovers on mars or most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the most interesting because </v>

1832
01:14:57.311 --> 01:14:58.144
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sending these really high </v>

1833
01:14:58.601 --> 01:14:59.434
<v Speaker 3>resolution photos of the surface of mars</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're running tests and checking </v>

1834
01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 3>for biological life.</v>

1835
01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:05.350
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting stuff,</v>

1836
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.310
<v Speaker 3>but between 69 and 72 when they did all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff,</v>

1837
01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.173
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's the technology back then </v>
<v Speaker 3>was nothing compared to what they have </v>

1838
01:15:14.351 --> 01:15:19.351
<v Speaker 3>now in terms of calculations and </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers and and it's also there was a.</v>

1839
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.823
<v Speaker 3>There's unquestionably some stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was images or video that was </v>

1840
01:15:26.411 --> 01:15:30.730
<v Speaker 3>faked and I think really like that never</v>
<v Speaker 3>looked into this at all.</v>

1841
01:15:30.890 --> 01:15:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Gemini 15 is the big one because there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a photo of Michael Collins,</v>

1842
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:35.523
<v Speaker 3>it shows him in deep space and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they use it as a press release saying </v>

1843
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:40.144
<v Speaker 3>that he was on a space walk when it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really an image of him from a test run </v>

1844
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:49.120
<v Speaker 3>where there was all this stuff in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background and he was on his harness and</v>

1845
01:15:49.121 --> 01:15:51.550
<v Speaker 3>they just blacked out the background and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to sell it.</v>

1846
01:15:51.551 --> 01:15:54.820
<v Speaker 3>As him being in space a find that my </v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Collins,</v>

1847
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:57.620
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at how much it costs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>send somebody to space,</v>

1848
01:15:57.621 --> 01:16:01.250
<v Speaker 3>so it's an insane 79,</v>
<v Speaker 3>70 million for ash,</v>

1849
01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.580
<v Speaker 3>a nasa astronaut to fly on a russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>shuttle.</v>

1850
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Private guy's trying to sell tickets to </v>
<v Speaker 3>places that mean phase.</v>

1851
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:10.930
<v Speaker 3>I was just trying to do at musc </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

1852
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:12.320
<v Speaker 3>but that space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>

1853
01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.900
<v Speaker 3>that's just low earth orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1854
01:16:13.901 --> 01:16:16.630
<v Speaker 3>that's still inside 400 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of them are trying to go anywhere.</v>

1855
01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.510
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they might in the future.</v>

1856
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.740
<v Speaker 3>Branson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's all same thing.</v>

1857
01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:22.170
<v Speaker 3>It's all the way through but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1858
01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.620
<v Speaker 3>but they are talking about future visits</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the moon and to mars.</v>

1859
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.630
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of times I feel like when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that,</v>

1860
01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Bush senior said that they were </v>

1861
01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:32.254
<v Speaker 3>going to go to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the moon again in like fucking </v>

1862
01:16:34.511 --> 01:16:36.460
<v Speaker 3>one was that 1990 or whatever the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was.</v>

1863
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:39.550
<v Speaker 3>But People have always said we're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go back to the moon,</v>

1864
01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:43.210
<v Speaker 3>but we haven't been back since 1972.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean that we never went?</v>

1865
01:16:43.211 --> 01:16:45.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it gets weird when you find out</v>

1866
01:16:45.881 --> 01:16:48.310
<v Speaker 3>that wernher von braun was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>nazi.</v>

1867
01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:49.930
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wernher von braun,</v>

1868
01:16:49.931 --> 01:16:50.764
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was the head of nasa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the guy who organized the moon </v>

1869
01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:56.830
<v Speaker 3>landings and though he was the head </v>
<v Speaker 3>rocket guy,</v>

1870
01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.113
<v Speaker 3>he was he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy was a legit nazi like he's </v>

1871
01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.620
<v Speaker 3>wanted by the simon wiesenthal center,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that he was alive today.</v>

1872
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:08.050
<v Speaker 3>They would prosecute him for crimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>against humanity.</v>

1873
01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:09.063
<v Speaker 3>They would hang the five slowest workers</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day in front of his berlin rocket </v>

1874
01:17:13.461 --> 01:17:14.360
<v Speaker 3>factory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1875
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:15.770
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

1876
01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:17.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they did.</v>

1877
01:17:18.370 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 3>What they did was they took this thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>was called operation paperclip,</v>

1878
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:23.383
<v Speaker 3>where when we won world war two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took all the top nazi scientists </v>

1879
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:28.723
<v Speaker 3>and they secretly brought them over to </v>
<v Speaker 3>America and they did it on the down low </v>

1880
01:17:31.591 --> 01:17:33.080
<v Speaker 3>so that no one would think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1881
01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:38.081
<v Speaker 3>why do we have a guy named wernher von </v>
<v Speaker 3>braun running the american space program</v>

1882
01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.313
<v Speaker 3>was because the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nazi scientists or insanely </v>

1883
01:17:41.721 --> 01:17:42.554
<v Speaker 3>advanced.</v>

1884
01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.330
<v Speaker 3>So the question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1885
01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:45.164
<v Speaker 3>were they really nazis or were they </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists that were under the boot of </v>

1886
01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:49.290
<v Speaker 3>the nazi administration?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1887
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1888
01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not around that,</v>

1889
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.633
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that these are the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were the head engineers and the </v>

1890
01:17:57.111 --> 01:17:57.944
<v Speaker 3>people that designed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wernher von braun's himself was saying </v>

1891
01:18:01.611 --> 01:18:02.444
<v Speaker 3>how impossible it was just years before </v>
<v Speaker 3>they did the moon landing and years </v>

1892
01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:08.720
<v Speaker 3>before operation paperclip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was impossible to go to the moon</v>

1893
01:18:08.721 --> 01:18:09.554
<v Speaker 3>or how ridiculously impossible would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but technology advanced from then to </v>

1894
01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:15.770
<v Speaker 3>when 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>69 happened to when they did it.</v>

1895
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:17.083
<v Speaker 3>I stopped saying that we never went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the moon because I really don't know </v>

1896
01:18:18.951 --> 01:18:20.910
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck I'm talking about and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

1897
01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:24.140
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of understanding these</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies is hard.</v>

1898
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:24.741
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1899
01:18:24.741 --> 01:18:28.490
<v Speaker 3>you have to really know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do I know about rocketry?</v>

1900
01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.710
<v Speaker 3>how much do I know about aerospace?</v>
<v Speaker 3>C?</v>

1901
01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm running around saying,</v>

1902
01:18:33.261 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe people went to the moon.</v>

1903
01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:38.840
<v Speaker 3>What is it based on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's based on mostly on ignorance,</v>

1904
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:39.733
<v Speaker 3>speculation and the exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the excited feeling that comes with </v>

1905
01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.080
<v Speaker 3>trying to uncover a conspiracy.</v>

1906
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a,</v>

1907
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.140
<v Speaker 1>and I think you do have to be a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit discerning on what you hear,</v>

1908
01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:53.120
<v Speaker 1>but it is frustrating and that's where a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of these conspiracy guys,</v>

1909
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:53.983
<v Speaker 1>they think they know more than they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to come to the </v>

1910
01:18:57.171 --> 01:19:00.470
<v Speaker 1>realization that you're probably never </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to know the real answer with a lot</v>

1911
01:19:00.471 --> 01:19:01.720
<v Speaker 1>of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realize that.</v>

1912
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of them come out many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1913
01:19:03.201 --> 01:19:04.490
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years later we're talking about the</v>

1914
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:07.100
<v Speaker 1>gulf of tonkin writer or operation </v>
<v Speaker 1>northwoods.</v>

1915
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.963
<v Speaker 1>Many years later it comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know there's a good likelihood </v>

1916
01:19:10.341 --> 01:19:13.220
<v Speaker 1>that I'll never know the truth on stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot about.</v>

1917
01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I think with the moon landing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way more likely that we went to the</v>

1918
01:19:15.971 --> 01:19:18.250
<v Speaker 3>moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that some of the footage is fake and</v>

1919
01:19:18.251 --> 01:19:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I think they probably did that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredibly difficult to film things</v>

1920
01:19:22.151 --> 01:19:22.984
<v Speaker 3>on the moon and I think they filmed some</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff in test runs and then tried to </v>

1921
01:19:26.141 --> 01:19:29.410
<v Speaker 3>pass that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have it Back then.</v>

1922
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:33.190
<v Speaker 3>They had these cameras that they had in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the center of their chest.</v>

1923
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:35.530
<v Speaker 3>I think they have been taking a selfie </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the moon.</v>

1924
01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:36.453
<v Speaker 3>They have the snapchat snap chatting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to take your shirt off and </v>

1925
01:19:38.201 --> 01:19:39.034
<v Speaker 3>then you would die because they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a camera that you could put in </v>

1926
01:19:42.551 --> 01:19:43.070
<v Speaker 3>front of you.</v>

1927
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.903
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have all those clicker </v>

1928
01:19:44.061 --> 01:19:47.480
<v Speaker 1>buttons they could have wIth their big </v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves on and they put the thing out and</v>

1929
01:19:47.481 --> 01:19:50.210
<v Speaker 1>then click it and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snapchat life on the moon.</v>

1930
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they said.</v>

1931
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was that they did it remotely.</v>

1932
01:19:53.541 --> 01:19:57.380
<v Speaker 3>That's how they captured the video of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the lunar module,</v>

1933
01:19:57.381 --> 01:19:58.214
<v Speaker 3>leaving the surface of the moon and </v>
<v Speaker 3>panned up and watched it go that they </v>

1934
01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:01.934
<v Speaker 3>did all that remotely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all this some squirrely footage </v>

1935
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:06.223
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the video of them jumping around it </v>

1936
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:08.500
<v Speaker 3>like they're on trampolines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that?</v>

1937
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Like they're just bouncing straight up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the air and you're like,</v>

1938
01:20:11.521 --> 01:20:13.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that?</v>

1939
01:20:13.051 --> 01:20:15.840
<v Speaker 3>How come the physics are different in </v>
<v Speaker 3>different flights?</v>

1940
01:20:15.841 --> 01:20:18.600
<v Speaker 3>Like in some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the flights like apollo 11,</v>

1941
01:20:18.601 --> 01:20:20.700
<v Speaker 3>they're barely getting off the ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>and one where they're like,</v>

1942
01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:23.700
<v Speaker 3>they're walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to do like that.</v>

1943
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:25.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's ones like that,</v>

1944
01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:27.420
<v Speaker 3>and then there's also ones where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall down.</v>

1945
01:20:27.421 --> 01:20:29.310
<v Speaker 3>It looks like the getting yanked up by </v>
<v Speaker 3>wires.</v>

1946
01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:33.060
<v Speaker 3>I think it's entirely possible that some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that stuff was fake,</v>

1947
01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:34.170
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

1948
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:35.003
<v Speaker 3>I think it's way more likely that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually went to the moon then they </v>

1949
01:20:37.171 --> 01:20:38.004
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's way sexier to think that they </v>

1950
01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:41.670
<v Speaker 3>faked the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>

1951
01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:45.120
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to think they faked the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and everybody was quiet about it.</v>

1952
01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:45.954
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neil armstrong gave this real cryptic </v>

1953
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:50.700
<v Speaker 3>speech on the 25th anniversary of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moon mission saying that,</v>

1954
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:52.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are hidden truths,</v>

1955
01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1956
01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:53.971
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1957
01:20:53.971 --> 01:20:54.950
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1958
01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:56.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the exact quote that he said?</v>

1959
01:20:57.710 --> 01:20:58.543
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the great truths that could be </v>

1960
01:21:03.181 --> 01:21:07.050
<v Speaker 3>real revealed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>removing some of truths,</v>

1961
01:21:07.051 --> 01:21:10.230
<v Speaker 3>hidden layers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was giving her away.</v>

1962
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:12.180
<v Speaker 3>It was real cryptic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1963
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:15.530
<v Speaker 3>what do you see if you could find it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Play the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might've been given it away.</v>

1965
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:20.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems if you were conspiracy theory,</v>

1966
01:21:20.191 --> 01:21:23.760
<v Speaker 3>this would give you a rock hard boner </v>
<v Speaker 3>because less than listen to this,</v>

1967
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:25.860
<v Speaker 6>neil armstrong made a rare public </v>
<v Speaker 6>appearance.</v>

1968
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:27.610
<v Speaker 6>Next generation of tax payers.</v>

1969
01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:28.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1970
01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:29.503
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just play the whole thing so you don't </v>

1971
01:21:30.121 --> 01:21:31.070
<v Speaker 3>confuse everybody.</v>

1972
01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:32.363
<v Speaker 6>In 1994,</v>
<v Speaker 6>neil armstrong mater rare public </v>

1973
01:21:34.861 --> 01:21:39.660
<v Speaker 6>appearance and held back tears as he </v>
<v Speaker 6>spoke these brief cryptic remarks before</v>

1974
01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:43.350
<v Speaker 6>the next generation of tax payers as </v>
<v Speaker 6>they toured the white house.</v>

1975
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:49.990
<v Speaker 7>Today we have with this group of </v>
<v Speaker 7>students some on america's best to you.</v>

1976
01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:56.330
<v Speaker 7>We say we have only completed a </v>
<v Speaker 7>beginning.</v>

1977
01:21:58.010 --> 01:22:01.390
<v Speaker 7>We leave you much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is under.</v>

1978
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:08.330
<v Speaker 7>There are great ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Undiscovered breakthroughs are available</v>

1979
01:22:08.331 --> 01:22:13.331
<v Speaker 7>to those who can remove one of truett's </v>
<v Speaker 7>protective layers.</v>

1980
01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:20.130
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what you supposed to say?</v>

1981
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to the moon bitch.</v>

1982
01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:26.460
<v Speaker 3>That's supposed to say breakthroughs </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1983
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.413
<v Speaker 3>Truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protective layers like I don't </v>

1984
01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:31.600
<v Speaker 3>understand what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The via the press conferences.</v>

1985
01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:34.440
<v Speaker 3>One of the more fascinating things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch the press conference again,</v>

1986
01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:36.900
<v Speaker 3>I was balls deep in this stuff for </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1987
01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:38.123
<v Speaker 3>The press conference from 1969 when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were returned from the moon is one of </v>

1988
01:22:41.431 --> 01:22:44.400
<v Speaker 3>the most cryptic weird things you'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever see.</v>

1989
01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:49.020
<v Speaker 3>these guys look like they just stole </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and they're being questioned.</v>

1990
01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.390
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1991
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:54.840
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a video where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>look like they're more full of shit.</v>

1992
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:57.720
<v Speaker 3>Then that video of the press conference </v>
<v Speaker 3>from 1969.</v>

1993
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.130
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1994
01:22:59.131 --> 01:23:02.160
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like fidgety and looking nervous</v>

1995
01:23:02.161 --> 01:23:03.510
<v Speaker 3>lIke they're getting away with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1996
01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:04.344
<v Speaker 3>Then they might have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might have been forced to say some </v>

1997
01:23:09.341 --> 01:23:11.800
<v Speaker 3>things that they didn't want to say and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be part of it.</v>

1998
01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:12.653
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely know they could have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of weirdness with the </v>

1999
01:23:15.431 --> 01:23:16.690
<v Speaker 3>moon landing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2000
01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:17.693
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to have like a conspiracy </v>

2001
01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:22.420
<v Speaker 3>that to wrap your head around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IT's exciting.</v>

2002
01:23:22.570 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best ones who benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who benefits from it?</v>

2003
01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:27.483
<v Speaker 3>The United States government did because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it showed military superiority over the </v>

2004
01:23:29.591 --> 01:23:31.240
<v Speaker 3>russian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we were able to do that,</v>

2005
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:34.720
<v Speaker 3>but also it was the nixon </v>
<v Speaker 3>administration.</v>

2006
01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.960
<v Speaker 3>People would just flat out full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2007
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:37.803
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they were just lying to people </v>

2008
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:40.030
<v Speaker 3>left and right back the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2009
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:40.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even more so then because It was </v>

2010
01:23:42.031 --> 01:23:43.840
<v Speaker 3>unchecked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no media,</v>

2011
01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:48.490
<v Speaker 3>nothing that would expose them for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this stuff.</v>

2012
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:49.803
<v Speaker 3>They would air it on tv once in 1969.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never see it again unless you </v>

2013
01:23:53.241 --> 01:23:55.210
<v Speaker 3>watched it on failed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no youtube.</v>

2014
01:23:55.211 --> 01:23:58.900
<v Speaker 3>We can go back and watch the astronauts </v>
<v Speaker 3>on trampolines video.</v>

2015
01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:00.730
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wAtch that.</v>

2016
01:24:00.731 --> 01:24:02.500
<v Speaker 3>You know what in the fuck is happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2017
01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:05.470
<v Speaker 3>These guys are bouncing up in the air </v>
<v Speaker 3>like how are they doing that?</v>

2018
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:06.663
<v Speaker 3>Like they never did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watch apollo 11 when they were </v>

2019
01:24:08.471 --> 01:24:10.300
<v Speaker 3>moving around on the surface of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moon,</v>

2020
01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.333
<v Speaker 3>it just like they're moving in slow </v>
<v Speaker 3>motion and then you go to whatever it </v>

2021
01:24:14.311 --> 01:24:17.920
<v Speaker 3>was like apollo 14 or 15 when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing the trampoline thing.</v>

2022
01:24:17.921 --> 01:24:20.740
<v Speaker 3>They fucking flying through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen it?</v>

2023
01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.593
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I had never gotten to the moon </v>

2024
01:24:22.831 --> 01:24:25.060
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flight watching this ridiculous.</v>

2025
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:26.003
<v Speaker 1>This</v>

2026
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:29.410
<v Speaker 3>and like their feet are hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

2027
01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:30.603
<v Speaker 3>Watch these guys bounced up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're on some sort of </v>

2028
01:24:32.321 --> 01:24:35.080
<v Speaker 3>wireless being yanked up into the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

2029
01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.693
<v Speaker 3>like what the fuck are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're playing like falling down </v>

2030
01:24:39.761 --> 01:24:40.594
<v Speaker 3>and it's very weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it could've been that they were </v>

2031
01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:43.624
<v Speaker 3>really on the moon and these guys were </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking cowboys and yahoos and they </v>

2032
01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:49.440
<v Speaker 3>wanted to bounce around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2033
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:51.160
<v Speaker 3>you were pacing your posted those </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos,</v>

2034
01:24:51.161 --> 01:24:52.840
<v Speaker 3>post those videos back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:53.703
<v Speaker 3>I had a debate on penn jillette's radio </v>
<v Speaker 3>show with a guy who was an astronomer </v>

2036
01:24:59.110 --> 01:25:00.880
<v Speaker 3>and he wasn't willing to admit a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2037
01:25:00.881 --> 01:25:03.070
<v Speaker 3>That was a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that wernher von braun was</v>

2038
01:25:03.071 --> 01:25:05.410
<v Speaker 3>a nazi and the fly looks was still </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2039
01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:06.573
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flag had a wire first of all on the </v>

2040
01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:10.030
<v Speaker 3>top of it that stiffened it up to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2041
01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:15.310
<v Speaker 3>but there there's videos of the flag </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving in a nonexistent breeze,</v>

2042
01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.413
<v Speaker 3>which is weird too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they try to make some logical </v>

2043
01:25:19.271 --> 01:25:20.104
<v Speaker 3>explanations for why the flAg could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving in a vacuum and some of it makes </v>

2044
01:25:23.501 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of it doesn't like the wires.</v>

2045
01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:29.470
<v Speaker 3>One is weird if you watch them fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

2046
01:25:29.471 --> 01:25:30.970
<v Speaker 3>like go to that one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

2047
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:32.463
<v Speaker 3>You like if you watch sometimes they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>falling down and when they're falling </v>

2048
01:25:36.551 --> 01:25:38.320
<v Speaker 3>down it looks like they get yanked back </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

2049
01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.710
<v Speaker 3>but I think it might not have been real </v>
<v Speaker 3>footage.</v>

2050
01:25:41.711 --> 01:25:46.090
<v Speaker 3>What they might've done is use some test</v>
<v Speaker 3>footage like right there at jamie,</v>

2051
01:25:46.091 --> 01:25:46.924
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let it go.</v>

2052
01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Like homeboy falls down and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like he is yanked back up.</v>

2053
01:25:50.801 --> 01:25:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>

2054
01:25:51.210 --> 01:25:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did not want him standing up.</v>

2055
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this that's standing up?</v>

2056
01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't stand up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2057
01:25:56.770 --> 01:26:00.370
<v Speaker 1>But you're on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth gravity.</v>

2058
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.233
<v Speaker 1>But there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing to make them go like </v>

2059
01:26:02.351 --> 01:26:03.560
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2060
01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:04.050
<v Speaker 1>You can't get</v>

2061
01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:05.100
<v Speaker 4>up without.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2062
01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:05.983
<v Speaker 4>Now we go back to mma because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>what these freaking folkstyle wrestling </v>

2063
01:26:09.171 --> 01:26:10.004
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next generation of mma you can turn </v>

2064
01:26:11.691 --> 01:26:14.300
<v Speaker 4>to your base to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't look at it.</v>

2065
01:26:14.301 --> 01:26:15.980
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How's he going to get them on?</v>

2066
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:18.920
<v Speaker 4>Mexican yanked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would have super abs.</v>

2067
01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.590
<v Speaker 4>He would have to be like a break dancer </v>
<v Speaker 4>because okay.</v>

2068
01:26:21.591 --> 01:26:23.780
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a break dancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a break dancer,</v>

2069
01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 4>but you can't get up without putting a </v>
<v Speaker 4>base down.</v>

2070
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:27.860
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2071
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:29.350
<v Speaker 4>That waS really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never saw a court.</v>

2072
01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:31.430
<v Speaker 4>watch it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch them get yanked up.</v>

2073
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got no base.</v>

2074
01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:36.500
<v Speaker 4>That little pieces played in reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost does.</v>

2075
01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.430
<v Speaker 4>It almost does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2076
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.433
<v Speaker 4>That he couldn't stand up like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing falls down right </v>

2077
01:26:40.971 --> 01:26:42.380
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't a reverse.</v>

2078
01:26:42.381 --> 01:26:45.800
<v Speaker 4>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's entirely possible that some</v>

2079
01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:46.634
<v Speaker 4>of the footage was bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't mean that they didn't go </v>

2080
01:26:48.621 --> 01:26:49.454
<v Speaker 4>to the moon.</v>

2081
01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.433
<v Speaker 4>It means that overzealous people in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He only has one sweat on the ground </v>

2082
01:26:53.331 --> 01:26:54.164
<v Speaker 4>there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2083
01:26:54.170 --> 01:26:54.981
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's true.</v>

2084
01:26:54.981 --> 01:26:56.780
<v Speaker 4>Look at this watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he stood up like,</v>

2085
01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:58.280
<v Speaker 4>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do it.</v>

2086
01:26:58.680 --> 01:26:59.501
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Foot's down.</v>

2087
01:26:59.501 --> 01:27:01.870
<v Speaker 4>His left foot's up and he just goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>straight up there.</v>

2088
01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:05.450
<v Speaker 4>That's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I've never been in one six,</v>

2089
01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:10.451
<v Speaker 4>zero gravity and neither of you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what that says.</v>

2090
01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:15.170
<v Speaker 4>We never went to the moon was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2091
01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:17.120
<v Speaker 4>the video is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's from television.</v>

2092
01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:20.750
<v Speaker 4>The video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy standing up like that.</v>

2093
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:22.250
<v Speaker 4>He got help somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2094
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:25.040
<v Speaker 4>he can't stand up like that very well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could have been on wires.</v>

2095
01:27:25.190 --> 01:27:26.023
<v Speaker 4>It could have been that they were using </v>
<v Speaker 4>that to simulate what it would be like </v>

2096
01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:32.240
<v Speaker 4>because they definitely filled a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>simulations.</v>

2097
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:34.880
<v Speaker 4>They get a lot of that because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to prepare the astronauts.</v>

2098
01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.193
<v Speaker 4>It's entirely possible that some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those simulations gotten passed off as </v>

2099
01:27:39.201 --> 01:27:41.660
<v Speaker 4>being an actual video of them on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moon.</v>

2100
01:27:41.690 --> 01:27:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2101
01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:43.580
<v Speaker 4>FaIr enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or the fake.</v>

2102
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:45.500
<v Speaker 4>The whole fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't there,</v>

2103
01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:50.750
<v Speaker 4>so pretty used to it as a privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think folkstyle wrestling is the next.</v>

2104
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:52.970
<v Speaker 4>That's the next genesis of mma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2105
01:27:52.971 --> 01:27:54.080
<v Speaker 4>We go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's next?</v>

2106
01:27:54.490 --> 01:27:55.323
<v Speaker 4>like that guy standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't realize if you watched the </v>

2107
01:27:57.591 --> 01:27:58.510
<v Speaker 4>lima roy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2108
01:27:58.511 --> 01:28:01.310
<v Speaker 4>it was incredibly frustrating to watch </v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

2109
01:28:01.730 --> 01:28:02.563
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because lima was literally just laying </v>

2110
01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:06.620
<v Speaker 4>on his back and guard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2111
01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:11.300
<v Speaker 4>and guard is almost nonexistent </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective in mma now.</v>

2112
01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:12.770
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're Brian Ortega.</v>

2113
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:14.690
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a few guys,</v>

2114
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.250
<v Speaker 4>tiny amount,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think those.</v>

2115
01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.690
<v Speaker 4>But those guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2116
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.050
<v Speaker 4>like your wrestling is so highly </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective in mna.</v>

2117
01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Some people could say you can't get by </v>
<v Speaker 4>just with breslin.</v>

2118
01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:23.991
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2119
01:28:23.991 --> 01:28:26.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a black belt in jujitsu.</v>

2120
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:29.550
<v Speaker 4>You use a lot of wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2121
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:30.620
<v Speaker 4>primarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2122
01:28:30.621 --> 01:28:32.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean It's not that Brian Ortega can </v>
<v Speaker 4>box too.</v>

2123
01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:34.260
<v Speaker 4>We could do a lot of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Strike.</v>

2124
01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:38.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a good solid striker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but his guard is so dangerous.</v>

2125
01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.140
<v Speaker 4>It's just another level of dangerous as </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposed to most mma fighters,</v>

2126
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:43.640
<v Speaker 4>including lehman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2127
01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:44.660
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2128
01:28:44.690 --> 01:28:45.523
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people actually going back to their </v>

2129
01:28:46.761 --> 01:28:47.451
<v Speaker 4>base,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2130
01:28:47.451 --> 01:28:48.910
<v Speaker 4>Which has been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been a no,</v>

2131
01:28:48.911 --> 01:28:49.940
<v Speaker 4>no forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it may,</v>

2132
01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:51.860
<v Speaker 4>you don't go back to your base because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you expose your back.</v>

2133
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:53.690
<v Speaker 4>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2134
01:28:53.691 --> 01:28:54.524
<v Speaker 4>what percentage of guys who are sitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>in guard actually get submissions from </v>

2135
01:28:56.901 --> 01:28:57.734
<v Speaker 4>the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the numbers really small really </v>

2136
01:28:59.530 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're going to have to find out now.</v>

2137
01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is so,</v>

2138
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.811
<v Speaker 1>so frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2139
01:29:04.811 --> 01:29:06.120
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lima fight,</v>

2140
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:08.670
<v Speaker 1>roy wins the first two rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's competitive,</v>

2141
01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:11.370
<v Speaker 1>but he wins pretty clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the leg kicks her state.</v>

2142
01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd never been kicked as hard by </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone's douglas lema.</v>

2143
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:16.890
<v Speaker 1>He kicked me one time in the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I freaking it and walk right for a week.</v>

2144
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.030
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>

2145
01:29:18.031 --> 01:29:19.560
<v Speaker 1>He kicks so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took so hard,</v>

2146
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:22.620
<v Speaker 1>so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm third round.</v>

2147
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:23.663
<v Speaker 1>There's this accumulation of leg kicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden roy's leg is really </v>

2148
01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:27.900
<v Speaker 1>up from getting kicked a handful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

2149
01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you to doing that low caffeine.</v>

2150
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will kick it.</v>

2151
01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.373
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of all over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The roy royster are starting to do this </v>

2152
01:29:33.271 --> 01:29:34.104
<v Speaker 1>one instead of checking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So lima starts taking control of the </v>

2153
01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:38.634
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he wins the third run in my </v>

2154
01:29:39.601 --> 01:29:40.280
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

2155
01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.113
<v Speaker 1>Fourth route in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like kicks him once and roy falls </v>

2156
01:29:44.371 --> 01:29:46.290
<v Speaker 1>down and he hops into mountain starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating him up was like,</v>

2157
01:29:46.291 --> 01:29:47.124
<v Speaker 1>holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fight might be over and then so </v>

2158
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:50.760
<v Speaker 1>recovers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the fifth round,</v>

2159
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.670
<v Speaker 1>rory goes out and shoots like a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>leg.</v>

2160
01:29:53.671 --> 01:29:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Double leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like immediate.</v>

2161
01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:58.140
<v Speaker 1>We're talking first 10 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2162
01:29:58.380 --> 01:29:59.480
<v Speaker 1>And going into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ryan,</v>

2163
01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:01.590
<v Speaker 1>you think shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might get finished this round.</v>

2164
01:30:01.591 --> 01:30:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2165
01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:05.700
<v Speaker 1>he can barely walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at his leg and so they make us take</v>

2166
01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:06.534
<v Speaker 1>it down 10 seconds into the round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he literally stayed in guard for four </v>

2167
01:30:09.901 --> 01:30:11.640
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 seconds and you're like,</v>

2168
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.910
<v Speaker 1>at some point is he going to try to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>up because he has to get.</v>

2169
01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:17.130
<v Speaker 1>If he gets up and he lands were two more</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks it out,</v>

2170
01:30:17.131 --> 01:30:18.780
<v Speaker 1>getting taken down to fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likely over.</v>

2171
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

2172
01:30:19.890 --> 01:30:24.330
<v Speaker 1>But he refuses to turn to his base </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is anti Jujitsu.</v>

2173
01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:25.164
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't turn to your base in </v>
<v Speaker 1>jujitsu because you your budget and </v>

2174
01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:27.713
<v Speaker 1>choked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2175
01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point you're losing,</v>

2176
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:31.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else are you going to do?</v>

2177
01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never tried to sweep them.</v>

2178
01:30:32.791 --> 01:30:35.040
<v Speaker 1>He never did try to submit them off my </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2179
01:30:35.041 --> 01:30:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Butterfly sweeping a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

2180
01:30:37.261 --> 01:30:39.840
<v Speaker 1>So at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even if I thought it was two,</v>

2181
01:30:39.841 --> 01:30:40.680
<v Speaker 1>two rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two rounds,</v>

2182
01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:41.500
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2183
01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:42.333
<v Speaker 1>It was in the fifth round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to try to get up at some </v>

2184
01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:44.814
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the one that did it for </v>

2185
01:30:45.871 --> 01:30:47.520
<v Speaker 1>rory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he won.</v>

2186
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:51.570
<v Speaker 1>He won 49,</v>
<v Speaker 1>46 on two scorecards in 48,</v>

2187
01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:53.330
<v Speaker 1>47 slash one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

2188
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:54.930
<v Speaker 1>It was three to one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then even more,</v>

2189
01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even more reason to get up,</v>

2190
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:59.520
<v Speaker 1>right if you're losing by that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2191
01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.110
<v Speaker 1>but yet lima refused to get up.</v>

2192
01:31:01.110 --> 01:31:01.890
<v Speaker 1>So at that point I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2193
01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:04.560
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe lima thinks he won or something.</v>

2194
01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2195
01:31:07.141 --> 01:31:10.980
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of jujitsu people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling with this fact that in modern</v>

2196
01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:11.813
<v Speaker 1>day mma you're going to have to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get up because god is no longer that </v>

2197
01:31:15.421 --> 01:31:17.910
<v Speaker 1>effective and you just get punched in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face over and over and over again.</v>

2198
01:31:17.911 --> 01:31:18.744
<v Speaker 1>And that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your feelings on going to half </v>

2199
01:31:20.101 --> 01:31:23.890
<v Speaker 1>guard and like going for an underwriter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same side and yeah,</v>

2200
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:24.930
<v Speaker 1>try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

2201
01:31:24.931 --> 01:31:25.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2202
01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:27.720
<v Speaker 1>like as me as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a top guy,</v>

2203
01:31:27.721 --> 01:31:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I would rather be in half guard than </v>
<v Speaker 1>full guard.</v>

2204
01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to land a lot of damage from </v>
<v Speaker 1>half guard.</v>

2205
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:33.503
<v Speaker 1>And then you're also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're half guard here and me trying </v>

2206
01:31:34.741 --> 01:31:37.530
<v Speaker 1>to work and you're tired and you're very</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely to sweep me.</v>

2207
01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:40.080
<v Speaker 1>So I think half guard is better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>full guard,</v>

2208
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:41.303
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think eventually where people are </v>

2209
01:31:42.811 --> 01:31:45.120
<v Speaker 1>going to have to get to is they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to actually get up.</v>

2210
01:31:45.150 --> 01:31:45.983
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna have to get up and putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>your feet on someone's hips and kicking </v>

2211
01:31:48.361 --> 01:31:51.900
<v Speaker 1>them is no longer a great solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works every once in a while,</v>

2212
01:31:51.901 --> 01:31:54.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like you can do that every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single time.</v>

2213
01:31:54.001 --> 01:31:55.200
<v Speaker 1>It just gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty rare.</v>

2214
01:31:55.290 --> 01:31:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Pretty rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he rarely.</v>

2215
01:31:56.370 --> 01:31:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's so aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2216
01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 1>So bottom bottom and top folk style </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling</v>

2217
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.490
<v Speaker 4>I think is the next genesis and mma </v>
<v Speaker 4>where people are really going to have to</v>

2218
01:32:03.491 --> 01:32:04.324
<v Speaker 4>have a deep understanding because once </v>
<v Speaker 4>you do get taken down or once you get a </v>

2219
01:32:07.631 --> 01:32:08.464
<v Speaker 4>takedown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2220
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:09.221
<v Speaker 4>and there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2221
01:32:09.221 --> 01:32:12.850
<v Speaker 4>yoel romero was the perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never did folks wrestling in America,</v>

2222
01:32:12.851 --> 01:32:14.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a very,</v>

2223
01:32:14.141 --> 01:32:14.974
<v Speaker 4>very elite freestyle wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he gets his takedowns and you can </v>

2224
01:32:17.701 --> 01:32:20.000
<v Speaker 4>always stay on top for like 15 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2225
01:32:20.170 --> 01:32:21.003
<v Speaker 4>It's like you did all that work to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy on the ground and they use let </v>

2226
01:32:23.351 --> 01:32:24.880
<v Speaker 4>him back up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what was the point?</v>

2227
01:32:25.190 --> 01:32:26.530
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the point of it?</v>

2228
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2229
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:28.913
<v Speaker 4>he smashes some guys on the ground like </v>
<v Speaker 4>machida when he got him down on the </v>

2230
01:32:31.271 --> 01:32:32.890
<v Speaker 4>ground and some of them you put them </v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

2231
01:32:33.190 --> 01:32:34.023
<v Speaker 4>He's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a freak athlete too because it's </v>

2232
01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:40.090
<v Speaker 4>hard to say hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do what he does because like,</v>

2233
01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:41.080
<v Speaker 4>no one's built.</v>

2234
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.490
<v Speaker 4>Like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy's the weird.</v>

2235
01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:44.440
<v Speaker 4>He has the weirdest body I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2236
01:32:44.441 --> 01:32:45.274
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he looks like he's 230 pounds </v>

2237
01:32:47.741 --> 01:32:51.370
<v Speaker 4>and he weighs one 85 when he weighs in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck is that one?</v>

2238
01:32:51.371 --> 01:32:52.600
<v Speaker 4>80 five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always look at him.</v>

2239
01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:53.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even understand it.</v>

2240
01:32:53.771 --> 01:32:55.690
<v Speaker 4>Like where's the weight going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you would think he's.</v>

2241
01:32:55.691 --> 01:32:57.400
<v Speaker 4>Well as guys it's on pds but looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2242
01:32:57.401 --> 01:33:02.401
<v Speaker 4>But then when you look at him like he </v>
<v Speaker 4>won a world title and 98,</v>

2243
01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:04.270
<v Speaker 4>99,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in there.</v>

2244
01:33:04.890 --> 01:33:07.800
<v Speaker 4>He looks the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the same at age 18 or 19,</v>

2245
01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:10.253
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's incredible because then you think </v>

2246
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:14.170
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well if he is a pdf that had to be prior</v>

2247
01:33:14.171 --> 01:33:15.004
<v Speaker 4>to age 18 because he looks the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well what are your thoughts on like </v>

2248
01:33:18.630 --> 01:33:21.550
<v Speaker 4>corella and cause you know the curlies </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2249
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:24.100
<v Speaker 4>but they used to call him d experiment.</v>

2250
01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his parents are tiny,</v>

2251
01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:27.580
<v Speaker 4>you know those parents are like five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>

2252
01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:28.443
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>

2253
01:33:28.630 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 4>and then he's six foot whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is a guru of man.</v>

2254
01:33:32.381 --> 01:33:33.214
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I always wondered like one day in </v>

2255
01:33:35.921 --> 01:33:36.754
<v Speaker 4>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's five years from now or 30 </v>

2256
01:33:38.831 --> 01:33:39.664
<v Speaker 4>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be genetically </v>

2257
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:42.820
<v Speaker 4>manipulated people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy,</v>

2258
01:33:42.821 --> 01:33:44.980
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We watched icarus.</v>

2259
01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:46.480
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is to,</v>

2260
01:33:46.481 --> 01:33:47.540
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had.</v>

2261
01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.680
<v Speaker 4>And that was fast thing and that pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>much just,</v>

2262
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:51.663
<v Speaker 4>I mean cemented the russian that </v>
<v Speaker 4>anti-doping program or they run every </v>

2263
01:33:54.461 --> 01:33:55.294
<v Speaker 4>single person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>state sponsored doping program for </v>

2264
01:33:57.041 --> 01:33:58.080
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for everybody,</v>

2265
01:33:58.110 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 4>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which crazy.</v>

2266
01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.590
<v Speaker 4>And it's like you had the hint that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were likely cheating,</v>

2267
01:34:02.591 --> 01:34:04.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then as someone who competed against</v>

2268
01:34:04.661 --> 01:34:05.770
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2269
01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:09.040
<v Speaker 4>that's a tough pill to swallow because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't make you feel.</v>

2270
01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now it's like,</v>

2271
01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:11.913
<v Speaker 4>well shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I should have been one way or </v>

2272
01:34:13.301 --> 01:34:14.134
<v Speaker 4>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to know that you are a leg down and </v>

2273
01:34:16.121 --> 01:34:18.280
<v Speaker 4>like going into mma now I haven't met.</v>

2274
01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.840
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was cheating for sure.</v>

2275
01:34:19.841 --> 01:34:20.674
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to fight them whether </v>

2276
01:34:21.311 --> 01:34:22.990
<v Speaker 4>they're cheating or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to pride days.</v>

2277
01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:24.850
<v Speaker 4>it was essentially sanction that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>sanctioned.</v>

2278
01:34:24.851 --> 01:34:26.170
<v Speaker 4>Like tHey would tell them like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 4>when this contract that says you can do </v>

2280
01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:29.080
<v Speaker 4>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2281
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:31.110
<v Speaker 4>How does one fc handle that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2282
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:32.920
<v Speaker 4>so they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't do drug testing yet.</v>

2283
01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:33.970
<v Speaker 4>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've been pushing them to do so,</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2286
01:34:38.201 --> 01:34:39.180
<v Speaker 4>in my time there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2287
01:34:39.181 --> 01:34:40.600
<v Speaker 4>and their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their thing is that,</v>

2288
01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:42.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these countries,</v>

2289
01:34:42.911 --> 01:34:46.600
<v Speaker 4>it's not prevalent in Indonesia or </v>
<v Speaker 4>manila or wherever.</v>

2290
01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:48.310
<v Speaker 4>So what else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to find out,</v>

2291
01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:50.220
<v Speaker 4>just get the fuck out of here with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my,</v>

2292
01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:52.060
<v Speaker 4>that's not my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not me saying that.</v>

2293
01:34:52.090 --> 01:34:55.250
<v Speaker 4>That's there joe rogan saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get the fuck out of there,</v>

2294
01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:56.770
<v Speaker 4>but I know you've sought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've,</v>

2295
01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 4>you've talked a couple of</v>

2296
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.813
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you bought their way in </v>

2297
01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:00.374
<v Speaker 1>program at one sts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is fantastic and I think </v>

2298
01:35:02.331 --> 01:35:03.164
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every mma organization should do it at </v>

2299
01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:07.610
<v Speaker 1>the high level one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you explain it?</v>

2300
01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really simple.</v>

2301
01:35:09.141 --> 01:35:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You do hydration and you do wait on </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>

2302
01:35:11.901 --> 01:35:13.790
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't cut water weight out.</v>

2303
01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2304
01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:15.350
<v Speaker 1>So it depends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrate,</v>

2305
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:17.630
<v Speaker 1>get on the scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally moments later,</v>

2306
01:35:17.631 --> 01:35:18.950
<v Speaker 1>like you go in the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you piss,</v>

2307
01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:21.320
<v Speaker 1>they test the specific gravity you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the scale.</v>

2308
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So essentially everyone moved up one way</v>

2309
01:35:23.601 --> 01:35:25.850
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every one of their champions bumped up a</v>

2310
01:35:25.851 --> 01:35:26.684
<v Speaker 1>weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like over there I fight one of the </v>

2311
01:35:27.951 --> 01:35:28.910
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2312
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:30.020
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially welter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2313
01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:30.873
<v Speaker 1>they even call it welterweight because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing because I can't cut </v>

2314
01:35:34.011 --> 01:35:35.510
<v Speaker 1>any waterway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they adjusted it.</v>

2315
01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:37.300
<v Speaker 1>So they adjusted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they moved every day.</v>

2316
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:38.183
<v Speaker 1>So I was the welterweight champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was still the way to welterweight </v>

2317
01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:40.471
<v Speaker 1>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just move,</v>

2318
01:35:40.471 --> 01:35:42.770
<v Speaker 1>the weight class is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2319
01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:47.240
<v Speaker 1>so there's the day of the fight today </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the fight for the fight.</v>

2320
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:49.460
<v Speaker 1>If you make the two days before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2321
01:35:49.461 --> 01:35:52.070
<v Speaker 1>if you make both the weight and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydration,</v>

2322
01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:54.840
<v Speaker 1>you do not have to wait test or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydration test in the last eight years,</v>

2323
01:35:54.841 --> 01:35:55.674
<v Speaker 1>you're clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you make it both those days </v>

2324
01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.273
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not going to fluctuate and </v>

2325
01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:00.800
<v Speaker 1>funding for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And listen,</v>

2326
01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:01.634
<v Speaker 1>if you can figure out how to cheat that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't figure out how someone could </v>

2327
01:36:03.511 --> 01:36:06.200
<v Speaker 1>possibly cheat that test because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they first incident I said,</v>

2328
01:36:06.201 --> 01:36:07.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is someone going to cheat on this?</v>

2329
01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:08.773
<v Speaker 1>Or how could someone cheat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what it's like they look at </v>

2330
01:36:11.121 --> 01:36:12.110
<v Speaker 1>their watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your piss,</v>

2331
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:13.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have like a withdrawn or </v>

2332
01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:14.713
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2333
01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't,</v>

2334
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can.</v>

2335
01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can.</v>

2336
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:20.263
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's fantastic because like fight </v>

2337
01:36:21.981 --> 01:36:25.610
<v Speaker 1>week then instead of making this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what I would fight at one 70,</v>

2338
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.370
<v Speaker 1>one 83 to one 85 to start my waterway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut out,</v>

2339
01:36:28.371 --> 01:36:32.600
<v Speaker 1>cut the waterway to one 70 or 71 </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on pedal or non title.</v>

2340
01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And then I would hydrate back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I don't have to do that.</v>

2341
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:36.583
<v Speaker 1>The dehydration process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally the exact same size I was </v>

2342
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:41.120
<v Speaker 1>prior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2343
01:36:41.121 --> 01:36:41.954
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>media obligations during week are </v>

2344
01:36:42.891 --> 01:36:43.724
<v Speaker 1>obviously a lot easier because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about cutting my weight or I'm </v>

2345
01:36:45.471 --> 01:36:47.740
<v Speaker 1>not feeling miserable or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2346
01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:49.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's a lot safer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2347
01:36:49.641 --> 01:36:52.580
<v Speaker 1>so if someone misses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2348
01:36:52.581 --> 01:36:53.414
<v Speaker 1>mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there find the same as in </v>

2349
01:36:54.321 --> 01:36:54.650
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2350
01:36:54.650 --> 01:36:57.440
<v Speaker 1>If you miss what you're find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you miss hydration,</v>

2351
01:36:57.870 --> 01:36:59.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so say joe,</v>

2352
01:36:59.151 --> 01:37:01.070
<v Speaker 1>you're wanting 85 and you weighed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>when a five,</v>

2353
01:37:01.071 --> 01:37:04.100
<v Speaker 1>but you're dehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't really make it right.</v>

2354
01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.560
<v Speaker 1>You have to get hydrated and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

2355
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:08.150
<v Speaker 1>So if you miss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you miss it,</v>

2356
01:37:08.151 --> 01:37:09.500
<v Speaker 1>so it's the last day you haven't made </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2357
01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.020
<v Speaker 1>You have to keep drinking until you piss</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrated.</v>

2358
01:37:12.021 --> 01:37:14.440
<v Speaker 1>And then whatever you way there is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you weigh.</v>

2359
01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:17.110
<v Speaker 1>What's the parameters when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hYdration?</v>

2360
01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Not hydration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>

2361
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:21.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the same skill they use for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in America,</v>

2362
01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:23.780
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the college </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling season or high school,</v>

2363
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:27.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to do specific every test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I might mess up a zero,</v>

2364
01:37:27.201 --> 01:37:28.490
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero,</v>

2365
01:37:28.491 --> 01:37:29.700
<v Speaker 1>two five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2366
01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Is this a specific group which I know is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same they use for hydrated,</v>

2367
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:35.780
<v Speaker 1>not hydrated In wrestling in America to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything under that you're dehydrated.</v>

2368
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:36.633
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>

2369
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:38.340
<v Speaker 1>So you want to be bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one point zero,</v>

2370
01:37:38.341 --> 01:37:38.791
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

2371
01:37:38.791 --> 01:37:39.800
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero is water.</v>

2372
01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2373
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:42.080
<v Speaker 1>So you want to be close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2374
01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.890
<v Speaker 1>And so There is like you do have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to drink some water,</v>

2375
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:47.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you drink a whole bunch of water,</v>

2376
01:37:47.241 --> 01:37:48.074
<v Speaker 1>you piss it out perfectly hydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if there have been a couple of </v>

2377
01:37:51.431 --> 01:37:53.180
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the early days they did,</v>

2378
01:37:53.210 --> 01:37:55.830
<v Speaker 1>they did tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the first two days actually just</v>

2379
01:37:55.831 --> 01:37:58.710
<v Speaker 1>testing to see where you were at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third day was the one that counted,</v>

2380
01:37:58.711 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like if you,</v>

2381
01:38:00.301 --> 01:38:01.134
<v Speaker 1>if you ate a bunch of meat or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might show up as dehydrated even </v>

2382
01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:06.060
<v Speaker 1>though that's what you walk around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single day,</v>

2383
01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.950
<v Speaker 1>so you have to make sure you drink a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water.</v>

2384
01:38:07.951 --> 01:38:09.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's coming out nice and clear.</v>

2385
01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:10.573
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a great idea because </v>

2386
01:38:12.561 --> 01:38:16.220
<v Speaker 3>I think that is one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems in mma to uriah hall.</v>

2387
01:38:16.221 --> 01:38:17.054
<v Speaker 3>And vito belfort get canceled last week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uriah hall was like literally having </v>

2388
01:38:20.871 --> 01:38:22.760
<v Speaker 3>seizures on his way to the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

2389
01:38:22.761 --> 01:38:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking insane.</v>

2390
01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:25.693
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's one of the worst parts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mma because I think mma shouldn't be </v>

2391
01:38:29.151 --> 01:38:34.151
<v Speaker 3>about who's slickest in being able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deceive the weight system.</v>

2392
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:38.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean it should be your skill versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>your opponent's skill.</v>

2393
01:38:38.690 --> 01:38:39.523
<v Speaker 3>You're both the same.</v>

2394
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Well the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole point of it is the whole point</v>

2395
01:38:41.551 --> 01:38:42.570
<v Speaker 1>of the way the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar,</v>

2396
01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:44.430
<v Speaker 1>same size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point of it.</v>

2397
01:38:44.431 --> 01:38:45.264
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so why people would fight back </v>

2398
01:38:47.131 --> 01:38:50.340
<v Speaker 1>against those system that one fc is </v>
<v Speaker 1>using is beyond me because listen,</v>

2399
01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:52.410
<v Speaker 1>the most miserable part of my weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut.</v>

2400
01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine dieting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all good.</v>

2401
01:38:54.301 --> 01:38:56.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you got to cut that last 12,</v>

2402
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:58.560
<v Speaker 1>13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 pounds of water weight out,</v>

2403
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.050
<v Speaker 1>it's miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows is miserable.</v>

2404
01:39:01.051 --> 01:39:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it affects your performance the next</v>

2405
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:03.511
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2406
01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my,</v>

2407
01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:06.540
<v Speaker 1>my thought process with affects them </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than it affects me.</v>

2408
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's just me being positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

2409
01:39:08.210 --> 01:39:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

2410
01:39:09.781 --> 01:39:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're a wrestling and pussy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not right or maybe it's just me,</v>

2411
01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:15.773
<v Speaker 1>my me psyching myself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my thought process on everythIng is </v>

2412
01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.960
<v Speaker 1>anything that goes wrong will affect my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opponent more than it'll affect me.</v>

2413
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I am more stable.</v>

2414
01:39:24.181 --> 01:39:27.960
<v Speaker 1>I can deal with shit that goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people affects them.</v>

2415
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:29.790
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe that's just me telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself that,</v>

2416
01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but that makes me feel good about it.</v>

2417
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:32.443
<v Speaker 3>People feel that way about wakening the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lightweight cutting because they think </v>

2418
01:39:34.311 --> 01:39:36.410
<v Speaker 3>that the other guy is not gonna be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to handle it as well.</v>

2419
01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Make them go through some adversity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then the next day he's gonna</v>

2420
01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:40.251
<v Speaker 1>troubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

2421
01:39:40.251 --> 01:39:41.084
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2422
01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.680
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you take that process </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

2423
01:39:42.681 --> 01:39:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes media obligations a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

2424
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:48.140
<v Speaker 1>It makes people a lot healthier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2425
01:39:48.141 --> 01:39:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many fights have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just from a business standpoint,</v>

2426
01:39:50.511 --> 01:39:52.910
<v Speaker 1>how many fights have we had canceled </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year because of the weight thing.</v>

2427
01:39:52.911 --> 01:39:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean quite a few.</v>

2428
01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Did it change your performance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How physically?</v>

2429
01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:58.150
<v Speaker 3>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would you feel?</v>

2430
01:39:58.590 --> 01:39:59.610
<v Speaker 1>I think I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2431
01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:00.453
<v Speaker 1>honestly for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they said those studies that you </v>

2432
01:40:01.771 --> 01:40:02.604
<v Speaker 1>don't really fully hydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was 36 to 48 hours after </v>

2433
01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:07.050
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt fine.</v>

2434
01:40:07.051 --> 01:40:08.080
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2435
01:40:08.250 --> 01:40:11.970
<v Speaker 1>so when I graduated college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way class in the United States for,</v>

2436
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.943
<v Speaker 1>for the olympic stuff was one 63.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would weigh roughly one slash 75 on a </v>

2437
01:40:16.621 --> 01:40:19.440
<v Speaker 1>day to day basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then water cut down to one 63.</v>

2438
01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when I was fighting in one 70,</v>

2439
01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I will be say between one eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2440
01:40:23.921 --> 01:40:28.590
<v Speaker 1>one 85 and water cut down to one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my water weight cut was very,</v>

2441
01:40:28.591 --> 01:40:32.490
<v Speaker 1>very similar every single time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was disciplined in that manner.</v>

2442
01:40:32.491 --> 01:40:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to be fluctuating.</v>

2443
01:40:34.201 --> 01:40:35.034
<v Speaker 1>And so my goal is actually to get down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to my target weight six weeks prior to </v>

2444
01:40:38.941 --> 01:40:40.380
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2445
01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:42.030
<v Speaker 1>So I'm walking around one a three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2446
01:40:42.031 --> 01:40:42.580
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one five,</v>

2447
01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:43.413
<v Speaker 1>six weeks prior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on the same exact person every </v>

2448
01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.433
<v Speaker 1>sIngle day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I think the part that a lot of </v>

2449
01:40:47.431 --> 01:40:49.950
<v Speaker 1>these people f up and it's because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not disciplined enough,</v>

2450
01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.620
<v Speaker 1>is they try to descend while they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

2451
01:40:52.621 --> 01:40:53.990
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2452
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:56.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe I get up to one 95,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a small bump.</v>

2453
01:40:56.951 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 1>Some of these guys are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>undisciplined.</v>

2454
01:40:58.481 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 1>They get way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2455
01:41:00.011 --> 01:41:00.910
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way overweight,</v>

2456
01:41:00.911 --> 01:41:01.744
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so during that last six weeks or </v>

2457
01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:06.280
<v Speaker 1>even the last couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to bring that body weight</v>

2458
01:41:06.281 --> 01:41:06.821
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2459
01:41:06.821 --> 01:41:08.380
<v Speaker 1>And so in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways to lose weight.</v>

2460
01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:11.470
<v Speaker 1>You can diet and lose body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat mass,</v>

2461
01:41:11.471 --> 01:41:12.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2462
01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:15.760
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the waterweight where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're sweating and we're taking that out</v>

2463
01:41:15.761 --> 01:41:16.301
<v Speaker 1>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2464
01:41:16.301 --> 01:41:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think a lot of guys and I,</v>

2465
01:41:19.661 --> 01:41:20.494
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever cut wait </v>

2466
01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:21.784
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know so for me it was in college </v>

2467
01:41:23.230 --> 01:41:26.530
<v Speaker 1>and in the summers I'd get really fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'd bring my weight down in the</v>

2468
01:41:26.531 --> 01:41:27.364
<v Speaker 1>fall and you feel it when you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're losing more calories than </v>

2469
01:41:29.441 --> 01:41:30.274
<v Speaker 1>you're taking in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this weird feeling in your </v>

2470
01:41:31.301 --> 01:41:32.770
<v Speaker 1>body and you feel like shit all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2471
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:34.473
<v Speaker 1>And so I think a lot of fighters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that really close to when they're </v>

2472
01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:39.723
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now the waterway cut makes you </v>

2473
01:41:41.351 --> 01:41:43.360
<v Speaker 1>feel terrible and now they're cutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything out.</v>

2474
01:41:43.361 --> 01:41:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Calorically alSo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's like a double whammy.</v>

2475
01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.193
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another thing that benefits </v>

2476
01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:50.404
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers in the wrestlers seem to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>pride in being able to push through </v>

2477
01:41:54.161 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 1>discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more miserable you are,</v>

2478
01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:00.460
<v Speaker 1>the more you just fucking bite down your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece and deal with it.</v>

2479
01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:01.593
<v Speaker 1>We're [inaudible] you get used to doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all through camps all through </v>

2480
01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.090
<v Speaker 1>college and high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always dehydrated.</v>

2481
01:42:07.091 --> 01:42:08.590
<v Speaker 1>You're always losing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2482
01:42:08.591 --> 01:42:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean the college dressing that is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2483
01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:11.463
<v Speaker 1>The way cutting is not that bad anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have the system and people are </v>

2484
01:42:13.391 --> 01:42:14.224
<v Speaker 1>starting to change a 97.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think couple people died and change </v>

2485
01:42:18.761 --> 01:42:19.650
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2486
01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:21.490
<v Speaker 1>then they institute the same thing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>one fc.</v>

2487
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:22.323
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of a portion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's once you do it in the being a </v>

2488
01:42:24.051 --> 01:42:25.360
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find your minimum weight.</v>

2489
01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:26.930
<v Speaker 1>But I think more than anything what </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

2490
01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a one ron.</v>

2491
01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:30.850
<v Speaker 1>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're dual meet is at 1:00,</v>

2492
01:42:30.851 --> 01:42:32.290
<v Speaker 1>everybody weighs in at noon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2493
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:35.070
<v Speaker 1>So what people have found out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't cut.</v>

2494
01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't go wait.</v>

2495
01:42:36.110 --> 01:42:38.710
<v Speaker 1>You wrestled like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with fighting,</v>

2496
01:42:38.711 --> 01:42:40.530
<v Speaker 1>doing that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brain injuries.</v>

2497
01:42:40.540 --> 01:42:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's I think once you'd best.</v>

2498
01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.770
<v Speaker 1>But in college wrestling you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the discomfort thing.</v>

2499
01:42:44.771 --> 01:42:45.604
<v Speaker 1>Part of that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you go to a college </v>

2500
01:42:47.411 --> 01:42:48.610
<v Speaker 1>wrestling program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2501
01:42:48.611 --> 01:42:50.140
<v Speaker 1>it's very structured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't skip,</v>

2502
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:53.020
<v Speaker 1>you have to be there every single day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right on time.</v>

2503
01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like you have 40 black </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt,</v>

2504
01:42:56.411 --> 01:42:57.520
<v Speaker 1>right jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black belts,</v>

2505
01:42:57.670 --> 01:42:58.503
<v Speaker 1>and not even just black belts like world</v>
<v Speaker 1>class 19 to 23 in their physical prime </v>

2506
01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:04.780
<v Speaker 1>ready to fight each other every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

2507
01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:05.913
<v Speaker 1>And so you get used to this grind </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with people battling people </v>

2508
01:43:08.621 --> 01:43:11.270
<v Speaker 1>discomfort every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2509
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:12.303
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of it's also dealing with </v>

2510
01:43:13.241 --> 01:43:14.074
<v Speaker 1>injuries like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2511
01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:14.913
<v Speaker 1>in charleston and talks about it a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hey and I was talking to my kids </v>

2512
01:43:17.261 --> 01:43:18.094
<v Speaker 1>was listening to national tournament for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nca is March 15th through 17th and </v>

2513
01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:24.190
<v Speaker 1>you cannot guarantee me you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be totally healthy on that date.</v>

2514
01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:27.490
<v Speaker 1>You cannot guarantee meet your and be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>not sick on that date.</v>

2515
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:30.160
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to compete March </v>
<v Speaker 1>15th through March 17th no matter what,</v>

2516
01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:30.994
<v Speaker 1>if you want to enroll a national title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so wrestlers get used to this grind </v>

2517
01:43:34.481 --> 01:43:37.870
<v Speaker 1>where you just don't see that in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>

2518
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that aspect of wrestling is</v>

2519
01:43:41.801 --> 01:43:44.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest tools that they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the octagon.</v>

2520
01:43:44.561 --> 01:43:47.140
<v Speaker 1>The mental toughness and that ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2521
01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean the grind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's again,</v>

2522
01:43:49.650 --> 01:43:52.340
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a badge of in wrestling</v>

2523
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:56.350
<v Speaker 3>to be able to handle the grind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really in kickboxing or in moy,</v>

2524
01:43:56.351 --> 01:43:57.680
<v Speaker 3>tai or any other sport.</v>

2525
01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not really forced to.</v>

2526
01:43:58.931 --> 01:43:59.764
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many kickboxing or or jujitsu </v>

2527
01:44:02.321 --> 01:44:03.011
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cuny name,</v>

2528
01:44:03.011 --> 01:44:05.160
<v Speaker 1>where there's literally 40 black belts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2529
01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.030
<v Speaker 1>it's been borne out through high school </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

2530
01:44:07.031 --> 01:44:08.190
<v Speaker 1>You go to all these national </v>
<v Speaker 1>tournaments,</v>

2531
01:44:08.191 --> 01:44:10.180
<v Speaker 1>estate terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out who the best are,</v>

2532
01:44:10.181 --> 01:44:11.014
<v Speaker 1>the best of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get recruited and they go to these </v>

2533
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:16.270
<v Speaker 1>institutions to train with the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>best of the best of the best,</v>

2534
01:44:16.690 --> 01:44:17.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

2535
01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.120
<v Speaker 1>and then in addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

2536
01:44:19.121 --> 01:44:19.954
<v Speaker 1>the post-collegiate guys who were trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the world teams and olympic </v>

2537
01:44:22.481 --> 01:44:23.680
<v Speaker 1>teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sticking around training.</v>

2538
01:44:23.681 --> 01:44:27.310
<v Speaker 1>So you have this melting pot of freaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>really great wrestlers.</v>

2539
01:44:27.311 --> 01:44:28.144
<v Speaker 1>They're trading with each other every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single day for five to plus five years </v>

2540
01:44:31.751 --> 01:44:33.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to world championships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2541
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:34.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There also seems to be like a much more </v>

2542
01:44:36.471 --> 01:44:40.220
<v Speaker 3>systematic approach to training people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot more drilling,</v>

2543
01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:42.540
<v Speaker 3>you knoW,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of jujitsu schools like gosh,</v>

2544
01:44:42.630 --> 01:44:45.710
<v Speaker 3>the arm bar from the guard here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hooked the arm.</v>

2545
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go onto here,</v>

2546
01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 3>my legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make my leg,</v>

2547
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:49.790
<v Speaker 3>I lift up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2548
01:44:49.791 --> 01:44:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Your practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody get together.</v>

2549
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:53.960
<v Speaker 3>It drives me insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives a few times.</v>

2550
01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:55.253
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll go to jujitsu classes </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes and they'll literally go over </v>

2551
01:44:57.591 --> 01:44:58.424
<v Speaker 3>to techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You drill it twice and then the last </v>

2552
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:02.540
<v Speaker 3>rest of the class is just people </v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling.</v>

2553
01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2554
01:45:03.861 --> 01:45:04.694
<v Speaker 3>five minute goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives me insane gel because I come </v>

2555
01:45:07.101 --> 01:45:09.680
<v Speaker 3>from this wrestling background and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>I also like sports.</v>

2556
01:45:09.681 --> 01:45:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Psych and</v>

2557
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:13.220
<v Speaker 1>study of high performance is like that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I love.</v>

2558
01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:14.303
<v Speaker 1>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love studying people who are the best </v>

2559
01:45:15.291 --> 01:45:19.670
<v Speaker 1>in their field at whatever they do and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know without a shadow of a doubt,</v>

2560
01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:20.533
<v Speaker 1>just saying go for five minutes is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most effective way to train someone </v>

2561
01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.260
<v Speaker 1>does not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the wrestling,</v>

2562
01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bUnch of different you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do.</v>

2563
01:45:25.821 --> 01:45:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Some days you might do matches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some days you might do a 30 minute ago,</v>

2564
01:45:28.581 --> 01:45:30.350
<v Speaker 1>some days you might do groups of three </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

2565
01:45:30.351 --> 01:45:32.570
<v Speaker 1>That goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some days you might do situations.</v>

2566
01:45:32.571 --> 01:45:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I start on the single leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started the high crotch,</v>

2567
01:45:34.401 --> 01:45:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I a friend doc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2568
01:45:35.271 --> 01:45:38.330
<v Speaker 1>And so there's all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios that we might try.</v>

2569
01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:39.164
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm coaching my academy right and </v>

2570
01:45:40.671 --> 01:45:41.504
<v Speaker 1>we're working on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we drove front headlocks or we call </v>

2571
01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.410
<v Speaker 1>methods position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got both armpits and bounce and go</v>

2572
01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.790
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

2573
01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.640
<v Speaker 1>We don't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2574
01:45:48.641 --> 01:45:50.230
<v Speaker 1>now go five minute goes because how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2575
01:45:50.231 --> 01:45:51.064
<v Speaker 1>how many tribes are they going to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>going into the maths position that are </v>

2576
01:45:52.721 --> 01:45:54.310
<v Speaker 1>the front headlock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe one,</v>

2577
01:45:54.311 --> 01:45:55.144
<v Speaker 1>maybe two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but essentially most people have used </v>

2578
01:45:56.731 --> 01:45:58.150
<v Speaker 1>say go for five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2579
01:45:58.151 --> 01:45:58.984
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not disciplined enough to make </v>

2580
01:45:59.771 --> 01:46:02.870
<v Speaker 1>themselves do new skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They revert to whatever they do best and</v>

2581
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:04.480
<v Speaker 1>then just do it over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

2582
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:05.343
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if I want a kid to be good at a </v>

2583
01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:08.213
<v Speaker 1>headlock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which if you'Re going to wrestle at a </v>

2584
01:46:09.161 --> 01:46:10.780
<v Speaker 1>high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a good for headlock,</v>

2585
01:46:10.810 --> 01:46:12.700
<v Speaker 1>period factual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have it.</v>

2586
01:46:13.090 --> 01:46:15.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put him in there 50 times </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that practice.</v>

2587
01:46:16.330 --> 01:46:17.163
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get it over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and maybe the next day </v>

2588
01:46:19.271 --> 01:46:22.000
<v Speaker 1>it's single legs and the maybe next day </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's double legs,</v>

2589
01:46:22.001 --> 01:46:23.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe some days you say,</v>

2590
01:46:23.921 --> 01:46:24.880
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for 10 minutes,</v>

2591
01:46:24.881 --> 01:46:25.880
<v Speaker 1>go wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2592
01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to change it little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>

2593
01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:28.713
<v Speaker 1>but saying go for five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single day is very much not the </v>

2594
01:46:31.811 --> 01:46:32.644
<v Speaker 1>most effective way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so insanely frustrating for me </v>

2595
01:46:35.561 --> 01:46:36.394
<v Speaker 1>to have that haPpen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost every jujitsu school on the </v>

2596
01:46:38.741 --> 01:46:39.574
<v Speaker 1>planet</v>

2597

<v Speaker 3>of the things that he says that,</v>

2599
01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:46.660
<v Speaker 3>that people just want to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rolling part real quick.</v>

2600
01:46:46.690 --> 01:46:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what they want.</v>

<v Speaker 2>those things and so you know,</v>

2626
01:47:35.041 --> 01:47:35.880
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2627
01:47:35.881 --> 01:47:38.010
<v Speaker 2>it's really funny because people choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>to in this,</v>

2628
01:47:38.011 --> 01:47:40.800
<v Speaker 2>even though mma we can go live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people choose what they value.</v>

2629
01:47:40.801 --> 01:47:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll juSt give you a simple example.</v>

2630
01:47:42.161 --> 01:47:42.994
<v Speaker 2>I'll get this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got this one kid who's probably </v>

2631
01:47:43.651 --> 01:47:45.210
<v Speaker 2>listening to this show right now because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he loves you.</v>

2632
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:47.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name is.</v>

2633
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.380
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can't give one of my kids a shout</v>

2634
01:47:49.381 --> 01:47:51.120
<v Speaker 2>out and that all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so okay.</v>

2635
01:47:51.121 --> 01:47:53.640
<v Speaker 2>But he's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna know who I'm talking about.</v>

2636
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:57.390
<v Speaker 2>He goes freaking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just boom,</v>

2637
01:47:57.391 --> 01:47:58.320
<v Speaker 2>grind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grind,</v>

2638
01:47:58.321 --> 01:47:59.610
<v Speaker 2>grind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just I couldn't eat.</v>

2639
01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.500
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't ask for a kid to work harder </v>
<v Speaker 2>joe.</v>

2640
01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:03.053
<v Speaker 2>But when I started teaching technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tunes me out and then we go to a </v>

2641
01:48:05.971 --> 01:48:07.770
<v Speaker 2>national tournament and he places but he</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>

2642
01:48:07.890 --> 01:48:10.560
<v Speaker 2>he gets scored on a whole bunch by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

2643
01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:13.020
<v Speaker 2>We were just drilling and then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey bud,</v>

2644
01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:14.393
<v Speaker 2>you just tune me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last three weeks we were just </v>

2645
01:48:15.871 --> 01:48:17.760
<v Speaker 2>drilling that thing and you got your ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicked by it.</v>

2646
01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:20.730
<v Speaker 2>And so I love the fact that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go hard,</v>

2647
01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:23.670
<v Speaker 2>but you need to also value the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique,</v>

2648
01:48:23.671 --> 01:48:24.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2649
01:48:24.210 --> 01:48:26.710
<v Speaker 2>And then there's some people who valued </v>
<v Speaker 2>the technique too much and they all do.</v>

2650
01:48:26.711 --> 01:48:28.650
<v Speaker 2>I do the technique and then when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to going hard,</v>

2651
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:30.210
<v Speaker 2>they don't go hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2652
01:48:30.211 --> 01:48:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Because in wrestling or in any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any venture you want to take in life,</v>

2653
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:35.370
<v Speaker 2>there's not just one way to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

2654
01:48:35.371 --> 01:48:39.660
<v Speaker 2>You need a bunch of different attributes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be successful and so if you overvalue</v>

2655
01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:43.440
<v Speaker 2>one or another and you devalue other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2656
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:45.420
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to be as successful as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could.</v>

2657
01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:46.293
<v Speaker 2>You might still be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not going to reach the </v>

2658
01:48:47.941 --> 01:48:50.370
<v Speaker 2>pinnacle because you're not putting </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself into the right situation.</v>

2659
01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:51.463
<v Speaker 3>It's funny because in a lot of ways it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what you were talking about </v>

2660
01:48:53.061 --> 01:48:53.894
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two sides of the coin of a fighter </v>

2661
01:48:55.401 --> 01:48:56.234
<v Speaker 3>being a wild person who doesn't care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cowboy and then the other guy who's </v>

2662
01:49:00.051 --> 01:49:02.840
<v Speaker 3>like super systematic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's controlled.</v>

2663
01:49:03.170 --> 01:49:04.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You almost have to have everything and </v>

2664
01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:05.893
<v Speaker 3>the fighters that have those really </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong attributes just have to be aware </v>

2665
01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:12.470
<v Speaker 3>that those attributes are strengthened </v>
<v Speaker 3>even further by technique.</v>

2666
01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent.</v>

2667
01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:16.240
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's both sides that quantum,</v>

2668
01:49:16.241 --> 01:49:17.700
<v Speaker 2>he and another one would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2669
01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:20.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly called beginner's mind and then</v>

2670
01:49:20.081 --> 01:49:21.450
<v Speaker 2>know it all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you come into,</v>

2671
01:49:21.490 --> 01:49:23.860
<v Speaker 2>when you come into practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to have a beginner's mind.</v>

2672
01:49:23.861 --> 01:49:24.694
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to work out with three or four </v>

2673
01:49:26.411 --> 01:49:27.244
<v Speaker 2>time world champion olympic champion </v>
<v Speaker 2>pearl's last week and he was asking me </v>

2674
01:49:29.501 --> 01:49:30.334
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this guy really cared about </v>

2675
01:49:32.170 --> 01:49:35.560
<v Speaker 2>learning from every possible source and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's already,</v>

2676
01:49:35.590 --> 01:49:38.020
<v Speaker 2>he's already at the pinnacle and still </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to learn.</v>

2677
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:38.933
<v Speaker 3>Interesting thing to dominick cruz said </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the broadcast about steep meo </v>

2678
01:49:42.031 --> 01:49:44.190
<v Speaker 3>chick that steep when he went to </v>
<v Speaker 3>alliance,</v>

2679
01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:45.690
<v Speaker 3>mma was asking everybody,</v>

2680
01:49:45.970 --> 01:49:46.910
<v Speaker 2>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2681
01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 2>But then when you go into a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have the same mindset thinking</v>

2682
01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to ask.</v>

2683
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like kids who,</v>

2684
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.600
<v Speaker 2>kids who have just the beginner's mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theY'll,</v>

2685
01:49:57.650 --> 01:49:58.910
<v Speaker 2>they're great in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they go into</v>

2686
01:49:59.210 --> 01:50:00.230
<v Speaker 4>like cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I do here,</v>

2687
01:50:00.231 --> 01:50:01.210
<v Speaker 4>what should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which I do.</v>

2688
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:02.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just go wrestle,</v>

2689
01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:04.243
<v Speaker 4>wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then kids Are coming to practice </v>

2690
01:50:06.111 --> 01:50:07.430
<v Speaker 4>like I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

2691
01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:09.700
<v Speaker 4>well that's a very unhealthy mindset </v>
<v Speaker 4>also because you.</v>

2692
01:50:09.701 --> 01:50:11.750
<v Speaker 4>And it's great when you compete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great when you compete.</v>

2693
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.180
<v Speaker 4>So you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to balance both those things,</v>

2694
01:50:14.181 --> 01:50:15.014
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't have just one because if </v>

2695
01:50:16.461 --> 01:50:17.271
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it all.</v>

2696
01:50:17.271 --> 01:50:19.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great for competition.</v>

2697
01:50:19.311 --> 01:50:21.770
<v Speaker 4>But you come into practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to stop.</v>

2698
01:50:21.771 --> 01:50:25.310
<v Speaker 4>You're learning right now when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>coaching kids,</v>

2699
01:50:25.730 --> 01:50:27.320
<v Speaker 4>how much time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if any,</v>

2700
01:50:27.321 --> 01:50:29.000
<v Speaker 4>do you spend on mindset?</v>

2701
01:50:29.650 --> 01:50:30.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so at every I added my facebook </v>

2702
01:50:32.231 --> 01:50:34.560
<v Speaker 2>every monday I do this mental monday and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I usually repeat,</v>

2703
01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:38.080
<v Speaker 2>repeat it or something fairly similar to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids at practice.</v>

2704
01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.570
<v Speaker 2>but I also think it's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2705
01:50:40.571 --> 01:50:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I think competition is where you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your really,</v>

2706
01:50:42.971 --> 01:50:46.480
<v Speaker 2>really good teachable moments because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when kids care the most.</v>

2707
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:48.610
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the kid I was talking about when he</v>

2708
01:50:48.611 --> 01:50:51.150
<v Speaker 2>loses it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't want to listen to me,</v>

2709
01:50:51.151 --> 01:50:51.471
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because say,</v>

2710
01:50:51.471 --> 01:50:51.921
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look it,</v>

2711
01:50:51.921 --> 01:50:53.650
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a great example.</v>

2712
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:55.223
<v Speaker 2>I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do private lessons with this fourth </v>

2713
01:50:56.591 --> 01:50:58.420
<v Speaker 2>and fifth grader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're brothers and uh,</v>

2714
01:50:59.170 --> 01:51:01.510
<v Speaker 2>and like five weeks in rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this wrong.</v>

2715
01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:03.280
<v Speaker 2>You're doing this wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this wrong,</v>

2716
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:05.320
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to listen,</v>

2717
01:51:05.321 --> 01:51:06.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they do it.</v>

2718
01:51:06.371 --> 01:51:09.130
<v Speaker 2>They have a match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last week they do it wrong and it didn't</v>

2719
01:51:09.131 --> 01:51:11.080
<v Speaker 2>cost them the match,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it almost costs in the match.</v>

2720
01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.233
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I can say every single time I </v>

2721
01:51:13.271 --> 01:51:14.320
<v Speaker 2>say you're doing this wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I can say,</v>

2722
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:16.840
<v Speaker 2>remember that time in that match when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you putting your back because you did it</v>

2723
01:51:16.841 --> 01:51:20.440
<v Speaker 2>wrong and you refuse to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that,</v>

2724
01:51:20.490 --> 01:51:22.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>matches create great teachable moments.</v>

2725
01:51:22.631 --> 01:51:23.464
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2726
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:24.333
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember when you wilted under the </v>

2727
01:51:25.121 --> 01:51:26.620
<v Speaker 2>pressure because you weren't tough </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

2728
01:51:26.650 --> 01:51:28.090
<v Speaker 2>will you need to practice a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder?</v>

2729
01:51:28.091 --> 01:51:28.924
<v Speaker 2>So you get used to that pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when the referee made a bad </v>

2730
01:51:32.171 --> 01:51:35.860
<v Speaker 2>call and you flipped out because he made</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bad call and they didn't think about,</v>

2731
01:51:35.861 --> 01:51:37.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have to wrestle addresses match,</v>

2732
01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:39.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there could be all these,</v>

2733
01:51:39.490 --> 01:51:40.323
<v Speaker 2>there's all these teachable moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>within competition where you can say </v>

2734
01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:44.500
<v Speaker 2>point to something very clearly and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2735
01:51:44.501 --> 01:51:48.160
<v Speaker 2>look at this and see how this affected </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and see how you would have been more</v>

2736
01:51:48.161 --> 01:51:48.850
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

2737
01:51:48.850 --> 01:51:51.850
<v Speaker 2>So I think for mental aspect it comes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot more on one,</v>

2738
01:51:51.851 --> 01:51:54.490
<v Speaker 2>on one basis and sometimes I'll use it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of the whole team.</v>

2739
01:51:54.491 --> 01:51:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like really picking on people,</v>

2740
01:51:57.620 --> 01:51:58.091
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

2741
01:51:58.091 --> 01:51:59.980
<v Speaker 2>once in awhile I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2742
01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:01.173
<v Speaker 2>but so I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's competition provides a </v>

2743
01:52:02.711 --> 01:52:04.750
<v Speaker 2>lot of teachable moments for athletes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

2744
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:06.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I stronger here?</v>

2745
01:52:06.521 --> 01:52:07.990
<v Speaker 2>What do I need to work on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because again,</v>

2746
01:52:07.991 --> 01:52:11.010
<v Speaker 2>we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say one mental aspect makes it</v>

2747
01:52:11.011 --> 01:52:13.570
<v Speaker 2>guy successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this conglomeration of many,</v>

2748
01:52:13.571 --> 01:52:15.610
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many mental aspects that will make</v>

2749
01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:17.740
<v Speaker 4>highly successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when you're coaching,</v>

2750
01:52:17.741 --> 01:52:21.220
<v Speaker 4>whether it's coaching wrestlers or mma </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter coach anymore,</v>

2751
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:22.210
<v Speaker 4>none.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>

2752
01:52:22.270 --> 01:52:23.021
<v Speaker 4>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2753
01:52:23.021 --> 01:52:23.854
<v Speaker 4>I helped a couple of buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't consider it really just </v>

2754
01:52:26.951 --> 01:52:28.090
<v Speaker 4>helps you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say,</v>

2755
01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:29.970
<v Speaker 4>just say when you're coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>

2756
01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:33.360
<v Speaker 4>do you concentrate it all on strength </v>
<v Speaker 4>and conditioning or,</v>

2757
01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:37.030
<v Speaker 4>or is it from the wrestling that you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of your strength conditioning?</v>

2758
01:52:37.210 --> 01:52:39.480
<v Speaker 4>So we only got them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2759
01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:41.620
<v Speaker 4>an hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three or four times a week.</v>

2760
01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:44.050
<v Speaker 4>And so we don't do lasting conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I,</v>

2761
01:52:44.051 --> 01:52:44.884
<v Speaker 4>I right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially with the older guard that </v>

2762
01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 4>recommend they do some</v>

2763
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.550
<v Speaker 1>on their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2764
01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:49.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a college program,</v>

2765
01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:52.520
<v Speaker 1>for high school program where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them monday through saturday,</v>

2766
01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:55.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe twice a day possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we're going to do that,</v>

2767
01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:56.210
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're an academy,</v>

2768
01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:57.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2769
01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.630
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of on our own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We give them three or four times a week,</v>

2770
01:52:59.631 --> 01:53:03.680
<v Speaker 1>so it just doesn't trump what we need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do in that short time window.</v>

2771
01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:05.043
<v Speaker 3>How do you balance it out though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you know how much strength </v>

2772
01:53:07.361 --> 01:53:10.090
<v Speaker 3>and conditioning to do versus how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique and skill work?</v>

2773
01:53:10.260 --> 01:53:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the college level?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we talking about our.</v>

2774
01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Because we do not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do know strength and conditioning and</v>

2775
01:53:14.671 --> 01:53:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I recommend kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on the road and you know,</v>

2776
01:53:16.171 --> 01:53:19.350
<v Speaker 1>and if I had 12 hours a week with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do that.</v>

2777
01:53:19.351 --> 01:53:19.981
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2778
01:53:19.981 --> 01:53:21.510
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the ability to,</v>

2779
01:53:21.810 --> 01:53:23.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think,</v>

2780
01:53:23.971 --> 01:53:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really important.</v>

2781
01:53:25.951 --> 01:53:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it truly is that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it trumps especially knowledge.</v>

2782
01:53:29.010 --> 01:53:32.110
<v Speaker 1>And then if kids wrestle really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>against each other and kill had that one</v>

2783
01:53:32.111 --> 01:53:34.350
<v Speaker 1>saying like wrestling is the best train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the condition,</v>

2784
01:53:34.351 --> 01:53:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said something.</v>

2785
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.770
<v Speaker 1>If you wrestle really hard against each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2786
01:53:37.771 --> 01:53:39.390
<v Speaker 1>you're going to develop those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2787
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I think like people when when I grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are squeezed,</v>

2788
01:53:42.481 --> 01:53:43.470
<v Speaker 1>people that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

2789
01:53:43.471 --> 01:53:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I've never felt anything like it.</v>

2790
01:53:44.940 --> 01:53:46.710
<v Speaker 1>And I think that comes from that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

2791
01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:49.230
<v Speaker 1>If you put me in a weight room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do nothing abnormal.</v>

2792
01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not abnormally strong in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

2793
01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually like on a college division </v>
<v Speaker 1>and coliseum.</v>

2794
01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm significantly less strong than most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2795
01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:57.173
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when they arrested me and </v>

2796
01:53:57.661 --> 01:53:58.321
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

2797
01:53:58.321 --> 01:53:59.154
<v Speaker 1>I never felt anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's because a lot of those </v>

2798
01:54:02.401 --> 01:54:04.140
<v Speaker 1>things that I do are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

2799
01:54:04.141 --> 01:54:04.974
<v Speaker 1>very wrestling specific and I developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that strength because when I grabbed </v>

2800
01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:10.410
<v Speaker 1>like freaking grab as hard as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I squeeze them,</v>

2801
01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:13.140
<v Speaker 1>I squeeze him as hard as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now from doing that,</v>

2802
01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:16.020
<v Speaker 1>thousands of times I've developed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>squeezer that strength.</v>

2803
01:54:16.410 --> 01:54:17.243
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I think strength condition is </v>

2804
01:54:18.431 --> 01:54:19.264
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it trumps doing other </v>

2805
01:54:20.491 --> 01:54:21.324
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I had all the time in the world </v>

2806
01:54:22.860 --> 01:54:24.660
<v Speaker 1>and these kids didn't have to go to high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school or middle school,</v>

2807
01:54:24.661 --> 01:54:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably put them through some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2808
01:54:26.250 --> 01:54:27.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have that luxury.</v>

2809
01:54:27.670 --> 01:54:29.650
<v Speaker 3>What did you do when you were finding an</v>
<v Speaker 3>mma?</v>

2810
01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:31.630
<v Speaker 3>How much did you devote to strength to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get this thing</v>

2811
01:54:31.730 --> 01:54:34.730
<v Speaker 1>twice a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kish and maybe three sometimes.</v>

2812
01:54:34.731 --> 01:54:35.564
<v Speaker 1>What kind of stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a personal trainer since I </v>

2813
01:54:37.311 --> 01:54:38.540
<v Speaker 1>moved to milwaukee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually.</v>

2814
01:54:38.541 --> 01:54:40.640
<v Speaker 1>And then I actually helped them open up </v>
<v Speaker 1>a crossfit gym.</v>

2815
01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:42.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wouldn't be not specifically </v>

2816
01:54:45.561 --> 01:54:48.170
<v Speaker 1>crossfit workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but kind of that type of work.</v>

2817
01:54:48.171 --> 01:54:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Nothing slow when I'm doing three sets </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 10 and two sets,</v>

2818
01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:51.840
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2819
01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.740
<v Speaker 1>nothing slow like that potentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2820
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:55.970
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two days.</v>

2821
01:54:55.971 --> 01:54:57.920
<v Speaker 1>We might do like a slower start and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

2822
01:54:58.280 --> 01:54:59.113
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think fighting you need to be very </v>

2823
01:55:00.681 --> 01:55:01.730
<v Speaker 1>highly active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2824
01:55:01.731 --> 01:55:04.520
<v Speaker 1>you need to be in really good shape and </v>
<v Speaker 1>move a lot of things really fast.</v>

2825
01:55:04.521 --> 01:55:08.180
<v Speaker 1>So kinda cross it type stuff I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the right direction to go.</v>

2826
01:55:08.181 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 1>And now when I go back to college </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs besides light,</v>

2827
01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:11.893
<v Speaker 1>the heavyweights that in season stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>for college programs is mostly higher </v>

2828
01:55:15.741 --> 01:55:20.600
<v Speaker 1>paced stuff which I think is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant to both wrestling and fighting.</v>

2829
01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:23.670
<v Speaker 3>So did you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were saying like you were doing</v>

2830
01:55:23.671 --> 01:55:24.504
<v Speaker 3>like crossfit style workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so are you doing like kettle bells box </v>

2831
01:55:27.601 --> 01:55:28.950
<v Speaker 3>jumps?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything?</v>

2832
01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Just so when I said that I just meant </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2833
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:32.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are moving at a high pace through a </v>

2834
01:55:33.271 --> 01:55:34.380
<v Speaker 3>lot of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2835
01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:35.730
<v Speaker 3>And it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would tell me,</v>

2836
01:55:35.731 --> 01:55:36.510
<v Speaker 3>hey diego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do some.</v>

2837
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:37.590
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do sled pushes,</v>

2838
01:55:37.591 --> 01:55:38.340
<v Speaker 3>do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that,</v>

2839
01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:39.173
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what about like your diet and </v>

2840
01:55:40.921 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 3>nutrition and supplements and things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those sites have never</v>

2841
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:47.960
<v Speaker 1>been a that much into nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2842
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I sold it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2843
01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fat when I was a little kid.</v>

2844
01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clay.</v>

2845
01:55:52.201 --> 01:55:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Too much at age 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I don't wanna be fat anymore.</v>

2846
01:55:54.841 --> 01:55:57.570
<v Speaker 1>So I went from 130 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred pounds in.</v>

2847
01:55:57.630 --> 01:56:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost 30 pounds and 11 his sixth,</v>

2848
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:01.230
<v Speaker 1>fifth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixth grade.</v>

2849
01:56:01.231 --> 01:56:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Sixth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're 100 pounds.</v>

2850
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:04.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 30 percent of your body.</v>

2851
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:04.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2852
01:56:04.891 --> 01:56:06.390
<v Speaker 1>it was fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fat as shit.</v>

2853
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Are you eating everything and you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling into.</v>

2854
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:10.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2855
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:11.783
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having some success because when </v>

2856
01:56:12.781 --> 01:56:14.640
<v Speaker 1>you're fat or there's not a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to compete against.</v>

2857
01:56:14.650 --> 01:56:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2858
01:56:16.621 --> 01:56:17.940
<v Speaker 1>so I lost 30 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixth grade.</v>

2859
01:56:17.941 --> 01:56:19.620
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped drinking soda.</v>

2860
01:56:19.890 --> 01:56:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I had this whole whole list of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of discipline at 11.</v>

2861
01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2862
01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:26.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a now when I look at kids,</v>

2863
01:56:26.551 --> 01:56:27.384
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the mental maturity is huge in </v>

2864
01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:31.140
<v Speaker 1>longterm success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to make,</v>

2865
01:56:31.141 --> 01:56:31.920
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

2866
01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:34.950
<v Speaker 1>see the future and make decisions on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do at that young age.</v>

2867
01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:39.360
<v Speaker 1>So I lost 30 pounds and so now I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly started like reintroducing lot of</v>

2868
01:56:39.361 --> 01:56:40.490
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like sodas,</v>

2869
01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:43.050
<v Speaker 1>gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't drank a soda and forever,</v>

2870
01:56:43.051 --> 01:56:43.471
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2871
01:56:43.471 --> 01:56:45.720
<v Speaker 1>they're growing fast food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cut off as food.</v>

2872
01:56:46.170 --> 01:56:47.003
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ever have any fast food in 20 </v>

2873
01:56:48.721 --> 01:56:50.340
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just disgusting,</v>

2874
01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like I eat generally healthy.</v>

2875
01:56:53.050 --> 01:56:55.530
<v Speaker 1>My wife and I cook at home a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make really healthy food.</v>

2876
01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

2877
01:56:57.510 --> 01:57:00.060
<v Speaker 1>but I don't take any supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero,</v>

2878
01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:01.890
<v Speaker 1>no multivitamin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

2879
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:02.783
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get all your nutrients from your </v>

2880
01:57:04.531 --> 01:57:05.250
<v Speaker 1>food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2881
01:57:05.250 --> 01:57:07.170
<v Speaker 1>And I just figured like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

2882
01:57:07.210 --> 01:57:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So I tried a couple of supplements in </v>
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>

2883
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:11.130
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never felt anything from them.</v>

2884
01:57:11.131 --> 01:57:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't feel any different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2885
01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:14.640
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

2886
01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I,</v>

2887
01:57:16.110 --> 01:57:17.880
<v Speaker 1>why am I going to take that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to take it.</v>

2888
01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then oBviously I became like this,</v>

2889
01:57:21.091 --> 01:57:23.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti pd crusader it,</v>

2890
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by chance.</v>

2891
01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:26.393
<v Speaker 1>And so then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now I really can't take anything </v>

2892
01:57:27.481 --> 01:57:28.314
<v Speaker 1>because if I go take something and I pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot because these idiots or putting </v>

2893
01:57:30.901 --> 01:57:32.220
<v Speaker 1>something in the supplement that should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be there,</v>

2894
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost like a total asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I literAlly,</v>

2895
01:57:35.090 --> 01:57:36.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even take protein.</v>

2896
01:57:37.610 --> 01:57:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

2897
01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:39.953
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So did you make sure that you ate the </v>

2898
01:57:41.761 --> 01:57:44.010
<v Speaker 1>proper amount of vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Green leafy vegetables.</v>

2899
01:57:44.250 --> 01:57:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I just need some food and latin script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2900
01:57:48.450 --> 01:57:50.160
<v Speaker 1>like it's like healthy food.</v>

2901
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:51.183
<v Speaker 1>We're eating salads and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not eating cake and ice cream and </v>

2902
01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:58.170
<v Speaker 1>pizza and that kind of stuff and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating healthy food at my house,</v>

2903
01:57:58.171 --> 01:57:59.004
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not measuring the grams of thIs </v>

2904
01:58:01.321 --> 01:58:03.480
<v Speaker 1>are granted that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I really think,</v>

2905
01:58:03.481 --> 01:58:06.480
<v Speaker 1>what am I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been proven by science that you</v>

2906
01:58:06.481 --> 01:58:07.314
<v Speaker 1>only have a certain amount of time every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single day to have a high amount of </v>

2907
01:58:10.051 --> 01:58:12.450
<v Speaker 1>mental focus on stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think like,</v>

2908
01:58:12.451 --> 01:58:16.260
<v Speaker 1>my training is more important than </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on nutrition and stuff and so I</v>

2909
01:58:16.261 --> 01:58:21.261
<v Speaker 1>want to really like really zoning in </v>
<v Speaker 1>really high level focus when I'm trading</v>

2910
01:58:21.391 --> 01:58:23.730
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think if I worry about all this</v>

2911
01:58:23.731 --> 01:58:24.564
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll take my focus away from that </v>

2912
01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:28.020
<v Speaker 1>right or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of how I thought about it.</v>

2913
01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a smart way to approach it and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>never really affected me.</v>

2914
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:31.703
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2915
01:58:31.710 --> 01:58:32.431
<v Speaker 1>like I said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2916
01:58:32.431 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Speaker 1>even when I took the supplements in </v>
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>

2917
01:58:34.051 --> 01:58:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I never really felt them at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2918
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:37.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I don't feel it,</v>

2919
01:58:37.861 --> 01:58:38.694
<v Speaker 1>why would I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2920
01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:39.593
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of ironic though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you were an anti-drug crusader and </v>

2921
01:58:41.771 --> 01:58:44.170
<v Speaker 1>you went to the one place that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug test I have now,</v>

2922
01:58:44.171 --> 01:58:45.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really hurt.</v>

2923
01:58:45.011 --> 01:58:47.150
<v Speaker 1>It hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2924
01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:48.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is,</v>

2925
01:58:48.911 --> 01:58:49.744
<v Speaker 1>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we talked about like Singapore being </v>

2926
01:58:51.041 --> 01:58:53.050
<v Speaker 1>so fantastic and having a really high </v>
<v Speaker 1>gdp.</v>

2927
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:55.620
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the countries over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2928
01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manila,</v>

2929
01:58:58.840 --> 01:58:59.740
<v Speaker 1>manila,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philippines,</v>

2930
01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:03.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have huge high gdps right?</v>

2931
01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're not super wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and so when we think about,</v>

2932
01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:07.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much it costs to buy a lot of the </v>

2933
01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:12.730
<v Speaker 1>steroids that are readily available in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

2934
01:59:12.731 --> 01:59:13.564
<v Speaker 1>they're just not as available and so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they do have a point and if you </v>

2935
01:59:17.291 --> 01:59:18.124
<v Speaker 1>look at the athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of athletes that look </v>

2936
01:59:19.751 --> 01:59:22.240
<v Speaker 1>like yoel romero now you'll notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not using,</v>

2937
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:26.290
<v Speaker 1>like I pointed out earlier while he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested clean except one once was tainted</v>

2938
01:59:26.291 --> 01:59:27.124
<v Speaker 1>supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they proved that it was a tainted </v>

2939
01:59:28.181 --> 01:59:28.780
<v Speaker 1>supplement.</v>

2940
01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:32.680
<v Speaker 1>So when you look at their athletes maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>except a few of the russian ones,</v>

2941
01:59:32.681 --> 01:59:36.040
<v Speaker 1>they look pretty normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's probably unlikely that they're</v>

2942
01:59:36.041 --> 01:59:39.850
<v Speaker 1>using from my for a few russian ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Russia.</v>

2943
01:59:39.851 --> 01:59:42.880
<v Speaker 1>They can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like part of the culture.</v>

2944
01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one russian,</v>

2945
01:59:45.521 --> 01:59:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the one russian guy that I fought in </v>
<v Speaker 1>april of 16,</v>

2946
01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:49.773
<v Speaker 1>he was freaking enormous and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that I think a lot of </v>

2947
01:59:53.261 --> 01:59:58.210
<v Speaker 1>mma people are using some type of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

2948
01:59:58.211 --> 01:59:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm blanking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What gives you endurance,</v>

2949
01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:00.760
<v Speaker 1>epo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epo,</v>

2950
02:00:00.761 --> 02:00:03.260
<v Speaker 1>that type of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you want to call dress edge,</v>

2951
02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:04.113
<v Speaker 1>how tired people get seven minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're fighting 25 minutes and </v>

2952
02:00:07.271 --> 02:00:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not normal.</v>

2953
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:11.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people definitely tested hot for that in</v>

2954
02:00:11.351 --> 02:00:12.184
<v Speaker 1>the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's the guy that fought mighty mouse </v>

2955
02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>of Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2956
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2957
02:00:17.950 --> 02:00:18.783
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think more people are using that </v>

2958
02:00:19.751 --> 02:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>and I think if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2959
02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:22.493
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any conclusive evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at when you started and </v>

2960
02:00:24.851 --> 02:00:25.684
<v Speaker 1>then how somebody fell down a just </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight down their bodies look </v>

2961
02:00:29.351 --> 02:00:30.520
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look different.</v>

2962
02:00:30.521 --> 02:00:31.354
<v Speaker 1>They're competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Johnny Hendricks would be one </v>

2963
02:00:32.771 --> 02:00:33.581
<v Speaker 1>that comes to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2964
02:00:33.581 --> 02:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>what's his freaking records since you </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw it ain't very good.</v>

2965
02:00:36.041 --> 02:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that much and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden you can make weight and you know,</v>

2966
02:00:39.071 --> 02:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>if you remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember.</v>

2967
02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>So obviously I watched johnny because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2968
02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:42.843
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't stand johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He beat me when we were 17 and then I </v>

2969
02:00:46.841 --> 02:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>tried to wrestle in my students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were different.</v>

2970
02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>He was one 65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was one 74 and I was wrestling for the</v>

2971
02:00:51.551 --> 02:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>all star classic and I called the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who put it on and said I want to wrestle</v>

2972
02:00:54.731 --> 02:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2973
02:00:55.390 --> 02:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turned the match down so it's,</v>

2974
02:00:57.191 --> 02:00:58.024
<v Speaker 1>I've kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get that one back and I </v>

2975
02:00:59.471 --> 02:01:01.450
<v Speaker 1>never got to get it back from when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

2976
02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:02.613
<v Speaker 1>So I've been following pretty closely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watched johnny like a constant </v>

2977
02:01:06.101 --> 02:01:10.510
<v Speaker 1>fight prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets so tired in like two rounds,</v>

2978
02:01:10.511 --> 02:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just fucking exhausted,</v>

2979
02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.233
<v Speaker 1>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of sudden he's gone these </v>

2980
02:01:14.620 --> 02:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>five round fights and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hello,</v>

2981
02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to get tired?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that exhausted in two rounds and now</v>

2982
02:01:20.441 --> 02:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>you can vote for five rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny,</v>

2983
02:01:21.731 --> 02:01:23.200
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

2984
02:01:23.230 --> 02:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his defense to a team take down.</v>

2985
02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>They implemented a pretty fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>program over there.</v>

2986
02:01:29.951 --> 02:01:30.784
<v Speaker 1>I mean they spent a lot of money on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the whole thing where they </v>

2987
02:01:32.561 --> 02:01:34.420
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were paying him.</v>

2988
02:01:34.690 --> 02:01:35.523
<v Speaker 1>Then they wanted 50 percent of his own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the same offer right out of </v>

2989
02:01:37.391 --> 02:01:39.050
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know we were both graduates?</v>

2990
02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>

2991
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.670
<v Speaker 4>I felt like he was betting as myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They paid you a $100,000</v>

2992
02:01:43.671 --> 02:01:44.504
<v Speaker 4>a year for seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got 50 percent of your career </v>

2993
02:01:46.401 --> 02:01:47.234
<v Speaker 4>earnings and I said my thought was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well if I ever make it really big I'm </v>

2994
02:01:50.721 --> 02:01:53.750
<v Speaker 4>going to make a million dollars a fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to pay him back in the one</v>

2995
02:01:53.751 --> 02:01:54.570
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2996
02:01:54.570 --> 02:01:55.403
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be like hedging your bet </v>

2997
02:01:56.721 --> 02:01:58.880
<v Speaker 4>against yourself and I don't ever bet </v>
<v Speaker 4>against myself.</v>

2998
02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:02.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for them I get it too.</v>

2999
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:06.260
<v Speaker 4>It's like they have to have some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a reason to put out there and it's a big</v>

3000
02:02:06.261 --> 02:02:08.650
<v Speaker 4>bet whether or not you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to be an absolutely.</v>

3001
02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:09.740
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you think you suck,</v>

3002
02:02:09.741 --> 02:02:13.460
<v Speaker 4>it's good to take that bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've got an obama make it dog,</v>

3003
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:15.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm okay with making it a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

3004
02:02:15.381 --> 02:02:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3005
02:02:15.930 --> 02:02:19.490
<v Speaker 4>Then it's a good bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem like the best strategy.</v>

3006
02:02:19.730 --> 02:02:21.590
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting and I think,</v>

3007
02:02:21.591 --> 02:02:23.570
<v Speaker 4>I think there's probably somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there with,</v>

3008
02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:24.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3009
02:02:24.181 --> 02:02:26.570
<v Speaker 4>I know if you manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's where you go pick out,</v>

3010
02:02:26.630 --> 02:02:27.463
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty proven that high level </v>
<v Speaker 4>called justice are going to make really </v>

3011
02:02:29.391 --> 02:02:31.210
<v Speaker 4>damn good fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty proven.</v>

3012
02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:32.053
<v Speaker 4>So go in and try to find a couple every </v>
<v Speaker 4>year spending some money on them and </v>

3013
02:02:35.241 --> 02:02:36.950
<v Speaker 4>then getting a percentage of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>earnings,</v>

3014
02:02:36.951 --> 02:02:37.784
<v Speaker 4>that's probably a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say a safe bet for the </v>

3015
02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:42.020
<v Speaker 4>people putting out the money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3016
02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:43.373
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take down,</v>

3017
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:47.390
<v Speaker 4>take down had jake rush holt who was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing wrestler and for whatever reason</v>

3018
02:02:47.391 --> 02:02:49.480
<v Speaker 4>he just didn't transition great to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>

3019
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:50.343
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was good but he wasn't great and it </v>

3020
02:02:51.921 --> 02:02:52.754
<v Speaker 4>was like for as good of a wrestlers he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was probably third is gonna be a little </v>

3021
02:02:54.651 --> 02:02:55.160
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

3022
02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think is the fact or like if</v>

3023
02:02:57.231 --> 02:02:58.064
<v Speaker 4>you had to look at it from a wrestler </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's not a lot of outliers </v>

3024
02:03:01.251 --> 02:03:03.730
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like where you don't like and,</v>

3025
02:03:03.731 --> 02:03:05.570
<v Speaker 4>and so when we talk about how good jake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3026
02:03:05.571 --> 02:03:07.880
<v Speaker 4>he still made the ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he still won some fights,</v>

3027
02:03:07.881 --> 02:03:11.650
<v Speaker 4>so it's like he wasn't a bad fighter but</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a three time ncaa champs.</v>

3028
02:03:11.651 --> 02:03:12.620
<v Speaker 4>So you expect him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3029
02:03:12.621 --> 02:03:15.050
<v Speaker 4>he'll probably go challenge for a ufc </v>
<v Speaker 4>title.</v>

3030
02:03:15.110 --> 02:03:15.650
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

3031
02:03:15.650 --> 02:03:16.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in his case,</v>

3032
02:03:16.521 --> 02:03:19.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the factor was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3033
02:03:20.630 --> 02:03:23.360
<v Speaker 4>but there's not a lot of outliers like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that where it's so there are really high</v>

3034
02:03:23.361 --> 02:03:24.980
<v Speaker 4>level wrestler and then they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>any success.</v>

3035
02:03:24.981 --> 02:03:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Mma that's really unique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't see it a lot.</v>

3036
02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:29.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

3037
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:29.833
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting like I've looked at it </v>
<v Speaker 4>from striking from if you see like </v>

3038
02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:34.573
<v Speaker 4>really high level kickboxers some have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>style that would readily translate to </v>

3039
02:03:39.141 --> 02:03:40.610
<v Speaker 4>mma and som are fantastic.</v>

3040
02:03:40.610 --> 02:03:41.443
<v Speaker 4>Kickboxers like maybe peter hertz is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good example or a nesto who's where I </v>

3041
02:03:44.631 --> 02:03:47.300
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't really think that they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>translate that well to mma.</v>

3042
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:49.070
<v Speaker 4>Whereas mirko cro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cop,</v>

3043
02:03:49.071 --> 02:03:52.960
<v Speaker 4>who might've been like a slight notch </v>
<v Speaker 4>below them in kickboxing,</v>

3044
02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.073
<v Speaker 4>translates perfectly to mma because he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>so explosive and quail and I would </v>

3045
02:03:57.450 --> 02:03:59.250
<v Speaker 4>wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Decent takedown defense too.</v>

3046
02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:01.280
<v Speaker 4>He kept it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They developed it,</v>

3047
02:04:01.281 --> 02:04:02.114
<v Speaker 4>but the thing about mirko was </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable power and speed and he </v>

3048
02:04:06.321 --> 02:04:08.210
<v Speaker 4>could just close the distance quickly </v>
<v Speaker 4>and blast.</v>

3049
02:04:08.211 --> 02:04:11.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that is a difference between</v>

3050
02:04:11.151 --> 02:04:13.610
<v Speaker 4>that and a guy who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm methodical,</v>

3051
02:04:13.611 --> 02:04:17.480
<v Speaker 4>set things those guys didn't do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't translate as well.</v>

3052
02:04:17.481 --> 02:04:19.490
<v Speaker 4>They get tooken taken down to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hustling.</v>

3053
02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:20.753
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you think would be like the </v>

3054
02:04:22.721 --> 02:04:25.670
<v Speaker 4>step mom?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different guns you don't want.</v>

3055
02:04:25.671 --> 02:04:26.504
<v Speaker 4>The other things that I think benefits </v>
<v Speaker 4>us wrestlers is the fact that jujitsu </v>

3056
02:04:28.970 --> 02:04:31.060
<v Speaker 4>people are stuck on doing jujitsu the </v>
<v Speaker 4>jujitsu way,</v>

3057
02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:31.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3058
02:04:31.550 --> 02:04:35.030
<v Speaker 4>Strikers are stuck on striking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we come into mma,</v>

3059
02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:37.230
<v Speaker 4>we know we can't win a match just by </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling.</v>

3060
02:04:37.231 --> 02:04:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we know.</v>

3061
02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:41.040
<v Speaker 4>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to add striking.</v>

3062
02:04:41.110 --> 02:04:42.030
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to add.</v>

3063
02:04:42.031 --> 02:04:43.980
<v Speaker 4>You did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm open to that idea.</v>

3064
02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:45.143
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm open to those ideas that I have to </v>

3065
02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:47.270
<v Speaker 4>add those things into my arsenal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Were jude,</v>

3066
02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:49.080
<v Speaker 4>some jujitsu guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3067
02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:50.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to submit them and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

3068
02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:52.930
<v Speaker 4>They don't develop their.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

3069
02:04:53.210 --> 02:04:56.460
<v Speaker 4>you can literally not name me joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3070
02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:57.443
<v Speaker 4>a jujitsu guy or striking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe jose aldo who has developed </v>

3071
02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:02.753
<v Speaker 4>high level wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can name a lot of wrestlers </v>

3072
02:05:05.551 --> 02:05:07.860
<v Speaker 4>who've developed high level something </v>
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>

3073
02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:10.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when you see the crossover,</v>

3074
02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:14.760
<v Speaker 4>like jon jones was a wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can strike with pretty much anyone on</v>

3075
02:05:14.761 --> 02:05:15.570
<v Speaker 4>the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3076
02:05:15.570 --> 02:05:17.610
<v Speaker 4>It means steep meo chick wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestler.</v>

3077
02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:19.590
<v Speaker 4>He can pretty much strike when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't on the planet.</v>

3078
02:05:19.591 --> 02:05:20.424
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you had these wrestlers who are </v>

3079
02:05:21.421 --> 02:05:23.460
<v Speaker 4>becoming high level with these other </v>
<v Speaker 4>skills,</v>

3080
02:05:23.461 --> 02:05:27.330
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have a lot of other skills</v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming a high level at wrestling.</v>

3081
02:05:27.331 --> 02:05:28.170
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for me,</v>

3082
02:05:28.171 --> 02:05:31.200
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the stubbornness of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who come from those other backgrounds or</v>

3083
02:05:31.201 --> 02:05:33.840
<v Speaker 4>too stubborn to want to work a lot in </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling.</v>

3084
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.430
<v Speaker 4>Whereas russell's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3085
02:05:35.550 --> 02:05:36.580
<v Speaker 4>teach power strike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3086
02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:39.300
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a recognition of what's important.</v>

3087
02:05:39.301 --> 02:05:40.134
<v Speaker 4>Like george st pierre is a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>example of a guard who started off with </v>

3088
02:05:42.031 --> 02:05:42.864
<v Speaker 4>a ql christian background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't wrestle in college or high </v>

3089
02:05:44.371 --> 02:05:46.210
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>became a fantastic wrestling.</v>

3090
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:47.190
<v Speaker 4>He's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3091
02:05:47.191 --> 02:05:50.640
<v Speaker 4>and just figured it out and realized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>realized what a critical skill it is to.</v>

3092
02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:51.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

3093
02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:54.000
<v Speaker 4>So there's a handful of very small </v>
<v Speaker 4>handful,</v>

3094
02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:57.180
<v Speaker 4>jose aldo would be like if he wasn't an </v>
<v Speaker 4>offensive wrestler,</v>

3095
02:05:57.181 --> 02:06:00.440
<v Speaker 4>but who'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was so ridiculously hard to take down</v>

3096
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:02.040
<v Speaker 4>mean fantastic takedown defense.</v>

3097
02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:03.720
<v Speaker 4>And so there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a handful but there's not a lot.</v>

3098
02:06:03.721 --> 02:06:05.270
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then if you go to wrestlers,</v>

3099
02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:09.420
<v Speaker 4>going the opposite direction into </v>
<v Speaker 4>jujitsu or striking,</v>

3100
02:06:09.421 --> 02:06:09.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3101
02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:12.450
<v Speaker 4>you can name quite a few that were able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do those things really well.</v>

3102
02:06:12.810 --> 02:06:14.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting when you see a guy like</v>

3103
02:06:14.940 --> 02:06:17.550
<v Speaker 4>khabib number grumet off and you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>fantastic.</v>

3104
02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:19.320
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In his,</v>

3105
02:06:19.410 --> 02:06:23.730
<v Speaker 4>his mauling wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3106
02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:28.410
<v Speaker 4>you see what a massive factor it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fights like the edson barboza fight.</v>

3107
02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:31.710
<v Speaker 4>Like that to me is one of the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>examples.</v>

3108
02:06:31.711 --> 02:06:32.544
<v Speaker 4>When I say look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to take the guy down and </v>

3109
02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:38.130
<v Speaker 4>control on the ground is the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'S the bottom of the pyramid.</v>

3110
02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:38.993
<v Speaker 4>It's the most important foundation </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he dictates where the fight </v>

3111
02:06:41.701 --> 02:06:42.450
<v Speaker 4>takes place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3112
02:06:42.450 --> 02:06:44.460
<v Speaker 4>You might catch him when he's coming in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and trying to get you.</v>

3113
02:06:44.490 --> 02:06:45.990
<v Speaker 4>You might,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if he gets you.</v>

3114
02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:47.610
<v Speaker 4>He was like a fricking terminator </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

3115
02:06:47.611 --> 02:06:49.380
<v Speaker 4>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to come get you.</v>

3116
02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just ate kicks and no hope.</v>

3117
02:06:53.250 --> 02:06:55.960
<v Speaker 4>Just the constant chasing him around </v>
<v Speaker 4>chasing them.</v>

3118
02:06:55.961 --> 02:06:56.461
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

3119
02:06:56.461 --> 02:06:57.810
<v Speaker 4>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3120
02:06:57.811 --> 02:06:58.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fantastic.</v>

3121
02:06:58.651 --> 02:06:59.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

3122
02:06:59.311 --> 02:07:02.070
<v Speaker 4>I would totally agree that at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the pyramid,</v>

3123
02:07:02.100 --> 02:07:02.933
<v Speaker 4>it's like the is the trump card.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If like if you're fighting a wrestler </v>

3124
02:07:04.931 --> 02:07:05.764
<v Speaker 4>and you can't stop but take down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to lose 90 percent of the </v>

3125
02:07:07.801 --> 02:07:08.540
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3126
02:07:08.540 --> 02:07:09.373
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if,</v>

3127
02:07:09.570 --> 02:07:12.360
<v Speaker 4>if you're the wrestler and you can go </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a take down really easily,</v>

3128
02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:13.740
<v Speaker 4>you're going to win 90 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3129
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:14.783
<v Speaker 4>The only wild card in that equation is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy like brian or tig fight so well off </v>

3130
02:07:19.261 --> 02:07:20.970
<v Speaker 4>his back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how many people get submissions from</v>

3131
02:07:20.971 --> 02:07:21.930
<v Speaker 4>garden?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of those?</v>

3132
02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:22.813
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me even like any of the anthony pettis </v>

3133
02:07:24.031 --> 02:07:25.220
<v Speaker 4>who got a lot of submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guard,</v>

3134
02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:29.490
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that was transitioned off of I </v>
<v Speaker 4>body kicked benson harrison.</v>

3135
02:07:29.491 --> 02:07:31.950
<v Speaker 4>I bought a kicked benson and benson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Harrison hates getting body kicks,</v>

3136
02:07:31.951 --> 02:07:33.700
<v Speaker 4>so he dives in for a take down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets armbar.</v>

3137
02:07:34.410 --> 02:07:36.120
<v Speaker 4>Gilbert melendez gets and get a teen</v>

3138
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:38.170
<v Speaker 1>show because he got jacked a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3139
02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:39.820
<v Speaker 1>So there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a handful of those,</v>

3140
02:07:39.821 --> 02:07:41.620
<v Speaker 1>but just strictly like I'd take you </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3141
02:07:41.621 --> 02:07:43.580
<v Speaker 1>You're in garden then I submit you </v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3142
02:07:44.050 --> 02:07:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Maybe for receIver doom every once in </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

3143
02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe brian or tega,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the numbers pretty damn small.</v>

3144
02:07:49.140 --> 02:07:50.180
<v Speaker 3>it is very small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3145
02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.033
<v Speaker 3>It's smaller now than I think ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>before because people understand that </v>

3146
02:07:53.301 --> 02:07:55.500
<v Speaker 3>takedown down or the guard defense.</v>

3147
02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even like this guy that I.</v>

3148
02:07:57.140 --> 02:07:57.973
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that frustrates you</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most more than anything else that </v>

3149
02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:02.600
<v Speaker 1>may bad strategy just like drives me up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall,</v>

3150
02:08:02.601 --> 02:08:03.434
<v Speaker 1>like the lima thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this freaking knucklehead to fought </v>

3151
02:08:05.361 --> 02:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Michael Chandler on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3152
02:08:07.070 --> 02:08:10.560
<v Speaker 1>on saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just see it named gordy gordy.</v>

3153
02:08:10.561 --> 02:08:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moved here.</v>

3154
02:08:11.481 --> 02:08:12.314
<v Speaker 1>I don't know his damn name is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first round he pulls guard like </v>

3155
02:08:16.130 --> 02:08:16.963
<v Speaker 1>fast gets frikking hammered on for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>four minutes and then he ends up on </v>

3156
02:08:21.561 --> 02:08:22.394
<v Speaker 1>bottom in the second round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third round he gets taken down and I </v>

3157
02:08:25.971 --> 02:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds.</v>

3158
02:08:27.260 --> 02:08:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Did he try to get up one time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

3159
02:08:29.171 --> 02:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>he just laid there and I was asked what </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance in 45 seconds.</v>

3160
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Like everyone's while to try a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's while to try to triangle,</v>

3161
02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:36.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3162
02:08:36.530 --> 02:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>you're getting your ass whipped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're down two rounds and nothing.</v>

3163
02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Try to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to do something,</v>

3164
02:08:41.001 --> 02:08:43.070
<v Speaker 1>change your strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your strategy is not working,</v>

3165
02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:44.113
<v Speaker 1>you can't just stick with the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and get your ass off for </v>

3166
02:08:45.561 --> 02:08:47.840
<v Speaker 1>another four minutes and 45 seconds I </v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a break.</v>

3167
02:08:47.841 --> 02:08:49.130
<v Speaker 1>What do you think's going to happen down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

3168
02:08:49.250 --> 02:08:50.083
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some guys get locked into a </v>

3169
02:08:50.931 --> 02:08:51.764
<v Speaker 3>defensive position,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they realize they're getting </v>

3170
02:08:53.061 --> 02:08:55.190
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed and so they just try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>

3171
02:08:55.220 --> 02:08:56.130
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3172
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:57.103
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3173
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:58.783
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that way because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>a champ and champions don't think that </v>

3174
02:09:01.071 --> 02:09:03.570
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for some people there's a.</v>

3175
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:07.210
<v Speaker 3>There's a acceptance of their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their faith as well.</v>

3176
02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:08.053
<v Speaker 3>Pin this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just getting their ass whipped </v>

3177
02:09:09.530 --> 02:09:13.370
<v Speaker 3>and so they just try to stay conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try this just to protect themselves</v>

3178
02:09:13.371 --> 02:09:14.480
<v Speaker 3>as much as they can.</v>

3179
02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like edson barboza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you know,</v>

3180
02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:21.440
<v Speaker 1>instrument edson barboza you saw once he</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized he was going to survive.</v>

3181
02:09:21.441 --> 02:09:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Like when it was like two minutes left </v>
<v Speaker 1>and third round maybe ish side the first</v>

3182
02:09:25.401 --> 02:09:25.821
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3183
02:09:25.821 --> 02:09:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get fucked up.</v>

3184
02:09:27.230 --> 02:09:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to survive.</v>

3185
02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when there was coming with us,</v>

3186
02:09:30.230 --> 02:09:30.760
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3187
02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:31.281
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3188
02:09:31.281 --> 02:09:33.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make it through this shit.</v>

3189
02:09:33.590 --> 02:09:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I might as well if I want to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this,</v>

3190
02:09:35.271 --> 02:09:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I might as well just fight back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3191
02:09:37.161 --> 02:09:38.510
<v Speaker 1>And so he started fighting back really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>

3192
02:09:38.511 --> 02:09:40.160
<v Speaker 1>like the last two minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theft tried.</v>

3193
02:09:40.190 --> 02:09:41.023
<v Speaker 1>He certainly tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a period in the middle </v>

3194
02:09:42.351 --> 02:09:44.570
<v Speaker 1>where he had resigned to just take it an</v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole open.</v>

3195
02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was just.</v>

3196
02:09:45.630 --> 02:09:46.463
<v Speaker 3>Body was just not responding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was getting so fucked up and you </v>

3197
02:09:49.111 --> 02:09:52.740
<v Speaker 3>could see the pace that habib put on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>first round,</v>

3198
02:09:52.770 --> 02:09:55.710
<v Speaker 3>like halfway into the round barboza is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3199
02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:57.630
<v Speaker 3>jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the look in his eyes,</v>

3200
02:09:57.631 --> 02:09:59.580
<v Speaker 3>got that thousand yard stare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3201
02:09:59.581 --> 02:10:01.590
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I signed up for.</v>

3202
02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:05.430
<v Speaker 3>This guy's on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he reallY is on another level.</v>

3203
02:10:05.530 --> 02:10:09.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by him fighting tony </v>
<v Speaker 3>ferguson and apparently they're going to</v>

3204
02:10:09.841 --> 02:10:11.160
<v Speaker 3>do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't happen.</v>

3205
02:10:11.190 --> 02:10:11.821
<v Speaker 3>April.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3206
02:10:11.821 --> 02:10:12.654
<v Speaker 3>They don't know if it's going to be for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the interim title or the actual title </v>

3207
02:10:14.941 --> 02:10:16.360
<v Speaker 3>within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to strip connor.</v>

3208
02:10:16.770 --> 02:10:17.603
<v Speaker 3>They're in a weird way.</v>

3209
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.823
<v Speaker 1>He beats up tony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just my end and I've </v>

3210
02:10:20.251 --> 02:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>underestimated tony before so I could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

3211
02:10:22.411 --> 02:10:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3212
02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump card.</v>

3213
02:10:25.621 --> 02:10:26.454
<v Speaker 1>I think tony's kind of of those guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's pretty good everywhere is </v>

3214
02:10:29.250 --> 02:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn solid wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high level jujitsu,</v>

3215
02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:33.313
<v Speaker 1>but I</v>

3216
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:37.040
<v Speaker 4>khabib wrestling being better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>tony's wrestling so it's going to end up</v>

3217
02:10:37.041 --> 02:10:37.874
<v Speaker 4>on the ground and I think tony is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to think he can submit him because his </v>

3218
02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:42.313
<v Speaker 4>jujitsu is very high level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think be one of the things where </v>

3219
02:10:44.151 --> 02:10:44.984
<v Speaker 4>it could be just good enough not to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>submitted and then he's going to land </v>

3220
02:10:47.751 --> 02:10:49.520
<v Speaker 4>damage and land damage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inland damage,</v>

3221
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:50.383
<v Speaker 4>inland damage and tony's going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>close to a submission and close to a </v>

3222
02:10:52.731 --> 02:10:53.564
<v Speaker 4>submission,</v>
<v Speaker 4>close to a submission but not quite get </v>

3223
02:10:55.671 --> 02:10:56.504
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all this damage is going to </v>

3224
02:10:57.291 --> 02:10:59.640
<v Speaker 4>just accumulate and accumulate and </v>
<v Speaker 4>accumulate that.</v>

3225
02:10:59.670 --> 02:11:00.503
<v Speaker 4>That's kinda how I see it going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating and I also think it's </v>

3226
02:11:02.931 --> 02:11:03.764
<v Speaker 4>fascinating now that could be but has </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed his training and has a real </v>

3227
02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:08.300
<v Speaker 4>nutritionist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had no problem making weight.</v>

3228
02:11:08.630 --> 02:11:09.463
<v Speaker 4>So all the factors that played into him </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting removed from the last time they </v>

3229
02:11:13.461 --> 02:11:15.440
<v Speaker 4>were supposed to fight pulled out of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

3230
02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:16.820
<v Speaker 4>And I thought that was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>overblown.</v>

3231
02:11:16.821 --> 02:11:18.020
<v Speaker 4>Healy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ms dot wait one time.</v>

3232
02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:21.590
<v Speaker 4>he only missed one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>WaiT one time.</v>

3233
02:11:21.591 --> 02:11:24.650
<v Speaker 4>But his body shut down when he's making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>waiting for the Michael Johnson fight in</v>

3234
02:11:24.651 --> 02:11:25.484
<v Speaker 4>a similar way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he still did the Michael Johnson </v>

3235
02:11:26.571 --> 02:11:27.230
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3236
02:11:27.230 --> 02:11:28.063
<v Speaker 4>But it was the same thing happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>during the way and it was a rough way </v>

3237
02:11:30.021 --> 02:11:30.854
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's been other guys who ms dot </v>

3238
02:11:31.731 --> 02:11:34.970
<v Speaker 4>wait many times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if we go to a Johnny Hendricks,</v>

3239
02:11:34.971 --> 02:11:38.510
<v Speaker 4>johny hendricks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>melvin gallard guests and they missed it</v>

3240
02:11:38.511 --> 02:11:39.344
<v Speaker 4>by a long list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought the thing kind of </v>

3241
02:11:40.980 --> 02:11:42.680
<v Speaker 4>overplayed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He may sway one time.</v>

3242
02:11:42.681 --> 02:11:44.060
<v Speaker 4>He had some injuries which sucked for </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

3243
02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:45.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

3244
02:11:45.351 --> 02:11:47.270
<v Speaker 4>that was happening for a world title </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

3245
02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:49.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting for the interim title.</v>

3246
02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:50.120
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mrs.</v>

3247
02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:50.901
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3248
02:11:50.901 --> 02:11:51.734
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it was one of those where he </v>

3249
02:11:52.581 --> 02:11:53.800
<v Speaker 4>probably just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

3250
02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:55.970
<v Speaker 4>okay for him to make it be difficult.</v>

3251
02:11:55.970 --> 02:11:57.920
<v Speaker 4>And he just got just a little bit too </v>
<v Speaker 4>big.</v>

3252
02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:58.793
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it for an interim title when he was </v>

3253
02:12:00.351 --> 02:12:02.540
<v Speaker 4>supposed to time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the original time.</v>

3254
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Was Kevin Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3255
02:12:03.981 --> 02:12:06.740
<v Speaker 4>That was for the world title or interim </v>
<v Speaker 4>title.</v>

3256
02:12:06.741 --> 02:12:07.780
<v Speaker 4>Job title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3257
02:12:07.781 --> 02:12:09.530
<v Speaker 4>The whole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That whole division is kind of fucked up</v>

3258
02:12:09.531 --> 02:12:10.364
<v Speaker 4>with connor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not even knowing whether or not he's </v>

3259
02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:12.710
<v Speaker 4>fighting and they're going to strip him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3260
02:12:12.711 --> 02:12:14.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mostly I think so.</v>

3261
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:15.470
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless connor says,</v>

3262
02:12:15.471 --> 02:12:16.304
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in.</v>

3263
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:18.620
<v Speaker 4>I think the best comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

3264
02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck it.</v>

3265
02:12:20.871 --> 02:12:21.704
<v Speaker 4>I want to keep me belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know the best course of action strip </v>

3266
02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:24.993
<v Speaker 4>cotter let,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let could be even tony fight it out and </v>

3267
02:12:26.391 --> 02:12:28.390
<v Speaker 4>then it kinda wants to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get my title shot.</v>

3268
02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:29.570
<v Speaker 4>That's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>

3269
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:32.990
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what would be the most lucrative</v>

3270
02:12:32.991 --> 02:12:36.560
<v Speaker 4>thing as connor versus shut up joe or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fight gsp.</v>

3271
02:12:36.590 --> 02:12:37.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do?</v>

3272
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:38.223
<v Speaker 4>The one thing I want to be number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to fight tyron because </v>

3273
02:12:40.071 --> 02:12:43.000
<v Speaker 4>we've been friends for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3274
02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:45.250
<v Speaker 4>I to fight gsp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I want to fight.</v>

3275
02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:46.113
<v Speaker 4>You think that they would set that up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would try to set up gsp versus </v>

3276
02:12:48.501 --> 02:12:49.400
<v Speaker 4>tyron.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3277
02:12:49.401 --> 02:12:51.850
<v Speaker 4>That would be the big super.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gsp doesn't want to fight him.</v>

3278
02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:54.240
<v Speaker 4>Who can hit hard because he's worried </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the brain damage?</v>

3279
02:12:54.241 --> 02:12:54.951
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3280
02:12:54.951 --> 02:12:55.784
<v Speaker 4>I don't hit that hard.</v>

3281
02:12:58.850 --> 02:13:00.980
<v Speaker 4>Interesting way of looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trained with gsp.</v>

3282
02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:01.873
<v Speaker 4>I've never changed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I've trained with almost every top </v>

3283
02:13:04.070 --> 02:13:07.250
<v Speaker 4>what the weight of this era except gsp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3284
02:13:07.310 --> 02:13:08.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well marie,</v>

3285
02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:13.340
<v Speaker 4>but a shields,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fitch diaz a couple times.</v>

3286
02:13:13.341 --> 02:13:15.030
<v Speaker 4>Tyron obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3287
02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:16.093
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go down the line of train with pretty </v>

3288
02:13:16.821 --> 02:13:17.654
<v Speaker 4>much everyone in this era.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you feel like if you do wind up </v>

3289
02:13:20.751 --> 02:13:22.790
<v Speaker 4>retiring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you feel like you'll,</v>

3290
02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:24.240
<v Speaker 4>you'll wind up doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just coaching.</v>

3291
02:13:24.450 --> 02:13:25.283
<v Speaker 4>Wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love doing it really enjoyed a lot so </v>

3292
02:13:27.861 --> 02:13:29.000
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3293
02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:31.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'd go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>collegiate level.</v>

3294
02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:32.280
<v Speaker 4>It's obviously</v>

3295
02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:33.420
<v Speaker 1>always an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3296
02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I went out for the four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I coached college wrestling.</v>

3297
02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I loved iT,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3298
02:13:37.051 --> 02:13:37.801
<v Speaker 1>and then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3299
02:13:37.801 --> 02:13:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I won the belt is making a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably try to be good at this</v>

3300
02:13:42.151 --> 02:13:45.570
<v Speaker 1>instead of just doing it halfway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I did that and then,</v>

3301
02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:46.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we opened the wrestling schools and now </v>

3302
02:13:47.701 --> 02:13:51.030
<v Speaker 1>it's going really well and I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed that a lot and you know,</v>

3303
02:13:51.031 --> 02:13:51.864
<v Speaker 1>there's positives and negatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I love coaching at the highest </v>

3304
02:13:53.971 --> 02:13:54.804
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to talk about his level to </v>

3305
02:13:55.921 --> 02:13:59.610
<v Speaker 1>the college guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I missed that part a little bit.</v>

3306
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:04.020
<v Speaker 1>But then obviously if you go work for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>institution like that,</v>

3307
02:14:04.021 --> 02:14:06.510
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be a lot of bureaucracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I worry about that.</v>

3308
02:14:06.511 --> 02:14:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love owning my own business,</v>

3309
02:14:09.001 --> 02:14:09.834
<v Speaker 1>a heavy amount of freedom and not having</v>
<v Speaker 1>to worry about what I tweet or what I </v>

3310
02:14:12.391 --> 02:14:13.224
<v Speaker 1>say or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having with telling me what to do or </v>

3311
02:14:14.881 --> 02:14:16.410
<v Speaker 1>where to be or where to dress or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3312
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:17.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't like.</v>

3313
02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:18.713
<v Speaker 1>So I love that freedom obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then running your own business has its </v>

3314
02:14:21.181 --> 02:14:23.280
<v Speaker 1>own challenges also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3315
02:14:23.281 --> 02:14:23.751
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

3316
02:14:23.751 --> 02:14:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I think I will coat dress them for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of my life,</v>

3317
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.640
<v Speaker 1>whether I fight once more where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't find once more,</v>

3318
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably call jonathan for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>

3319
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.860
