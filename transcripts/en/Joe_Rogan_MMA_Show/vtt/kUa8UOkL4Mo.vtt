<v Speaker 1>I'm Marianne.</v>

18
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>We're now July 14th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end,</v>

19
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>the century link arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you took,</v>

20
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>you took a good stretch off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.090
<v Speaker 2>A couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:38.871
<v Speaker 2>a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

23
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.160
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

24
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 2>After I fought Meesha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blew my knee and then,</v>

25
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world exploded.</v>

26
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 2>And so I had I think 18 months off </v>
<v Speaker 2>between that and fighting,</v>

27
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amanda.</v>

28
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 2>And then after I fought Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw Amanda was like September 27,</v>

29
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I fought Ronda February 28th.</v>

30
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 2>And then after Ronda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 2>took another big stretch off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought Juliana the following year,</v>

32
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>July 9th,</v>

33
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:10.070
<v Speaker 2>and then this was another big stretch </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

34
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a little bit scattered,</v>

35
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 2>but doing what I can.</v>

36
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

37
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>you are doing some crazy therapy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write some,</v>

38
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>some interesting stuff down in San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diego.</v>

39
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

40
00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:22.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

41
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 2>there's been a few things I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on,</v>

42
00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not a huge fan of western </v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine,</v>

43
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

44
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

45
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can call it alternative medicine.</v>

46
00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like original medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

47
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate looking at things like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more than you know,</v>

48
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 2>big farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

49
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:36.311
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

50
00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:38.020
<v Speaker 2>one thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting has gotten me and,</v>

52
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 2>and stuff with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

53
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I th I think it's more prevalent in </v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

54
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 2>although I'm thinking it's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>with men too,</v>

55
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 2>is like our endocrine systems are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy with these weight cuts and they're</v>

56
00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 2>not happy with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like getting hit in the head a lot.</v>

57
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.443
<v Speaker 2>Go figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

58
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go for it.</v>

59
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

60
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within all of that I've just,</v>

61
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.773
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had medical problems and things that </v>

62
00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:02.140
<v Speaker 2>like I'm constantly working on and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel really good.</v>

63
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly improving.</v>

64
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:04.390
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

65
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 2>one thing I was feeling a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck on was a wine,</v>

66
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.730
<v Speaker 2>I like some of the endocrine problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>

67
00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:10.690
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

68
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Speaker 2>like I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

69
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.350
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

70
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.760
<v Speaker 2>had I went to this facility in San Diego</v>
<v Speaker 2>is called,</v>

71
00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dang,</v>

72
00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 2>why can't I remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

73
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:22.564
<v Speaker 2>a mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually the UFC sent me there </v>

74
00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:26.530
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have you sought,</v>

75
00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have all of these things.</v>

76
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

77
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.943
<v Speaker 2>after fighting Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my head pounded for a good four </v>

78
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 2>minutes there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

79
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I had a Tbi afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was like,</v>

80
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately lowered my,</v>

81
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 2>a estrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowered my da ta,</v>

82
00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 2>my testosterone and I'm hypo thyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I will always be hyperthyroid now.</v>

83
00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I have to that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

84
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

85
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still toughed it out.</v>

86
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:51.214
<v Speaker 2>So it was trying to do what I could to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go and fight Ronda as soon as I did </v>

87
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:54.994
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

88
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of my game plan is don't get hit.</v>

89
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.113
<v Speaker 2>And which means like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just dart out her and see what </v>

90
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

91
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens when you do that.</v>

92
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tbi is traumatic brain injury.</v>

93
00:03:07.051 --> 00:03:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Just in case if someone is listening to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

94
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:10.020
<v Speaker 1>doesn't understand what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

95
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.570
<v Speaker 1>And then in the Rhonda fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people don't know about that,</v>

96
00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:14.820
<v Speaker 1>you just charged after and he got caught</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an arm bar and like,</v>

97
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.110
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very quick.</v>

98
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>14,</v>

99
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 2>it was 14 sayings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did hit her with a knee.</v>

100
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I did throw her ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she practice a little Ninja move and</v>

101
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 2>caught muddy alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was,</v>

102
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 2>it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

104
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 2>even her coaches were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

105
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:31.684
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did what you're supposed to do </v>

106
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And She just got you.</v>

107
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.503
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

108
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be an awesome fight to be </v>

109
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 2>able to revisit one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

110
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 2>she even said that we'd do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

111
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 2>who knows her career so open right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fight again.</v>

112
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.620
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

113
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.523
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't need it.</v>

114
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.301
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

117
00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:51.740
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to ask her,</v>

118
00:03:51.741 --> 00:03:54.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of lessons to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned.</v>

119
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:55.034
<v Speaker 1>And what happened to her in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of the distractions and </v>

120
00:03:58.851 --> 00:03:59.684
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood came calling and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>scripts and talk about doing road house </v>

121
00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:06.560
<v Speaker 1>and there was all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this shit going on.</v>

122
00:04:06.561 --> 00:04:08.480
<v Speaker 1>There was other than fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it was also,</v>

124
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.683
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sport has evolved so rapidly in the </v>

125
00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:15.554
<v Speaker 1>women's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's MMA has gotten so high level so </v>

126
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:19.964
<v Speaker 1>quickly and if he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you saw a man does last fight </v>

127
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.110
<v Speaker 1>with Raquel Pennington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

128
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:24.944
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was a fucking high level </v>

129
00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:32.150
<v Speaker 1>performance from her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And five rounds,</v>

130
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.163
<v Speaker 1>super high cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just put a beating down on recal </v>

131
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:36.723
<v Speaker 1>painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the toughest girls in the </v>

132
00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:38.930
<v Speaker 1>world for sure.</v>

133
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like,</v>

134
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.263
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious.</v>

135
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.280
<v Speaker 2>I was saying the same thing as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights going.</v>

136
00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I have,</v>

137
00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:46.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people in my ear next to me,</v>

138
00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:47.181
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

139
00:04:47.181 --> 00:04:48.680
<v Speaker 2>how long has it been since raquel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

140
00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:51.780
<v Speaker 2>cause she didn't look her right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her like beefiest straight.</v>

141
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:53.480
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looked a little tired.</v>

142
00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:57.530
<v Speaker 2>She looked a little like not her typical</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it was like,</v>

143
00:04:57.531 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 2>she is a year and a half off herself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

144
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:00.394
<v Speaker 2>Like right into a title fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I have to say I'm a little bit </v>

145
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:05.990
<v Speaker 2>envious of because when I beat Misha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

146
00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

147
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.780
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to coach ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter,</v>

148
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.140
<v Speaker 2>but that was all ultimately going to end</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in a title shot with Rhonda.</v>

149
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 2>And I blew my knee and my husband passed</v>
<v Speaker 2>away and there was like a long moment of</v>

150
00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:20.870
<v Speaker 2>silence in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I was able to come back,</v>

151
00:05:20.871 --> 00:05:22.640
<v Speaker 2>they made me read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earn my title shot,</v>

152
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was like,</v>

153
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.891
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

154
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.360
<v Speaker 2>we're doing that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or just like</v>

155
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>penn done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

156
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>what attractive contenders are </v>
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>

157
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:31.744
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

158
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks good.</v>

159
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

160
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was very young at that,</v>

161
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.980
<v Speaker 2>at that age or at that at the time.</v>

162
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.013
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Bantam weight right now there's </v>

163
00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:39.944
<v Speaker 1>like there's no standout contender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Raquel had beaten some really good </v>

164
00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:46.310
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looked like the next in line.</v>

165
00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And did she blow her knee out as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had some sort of surgery.</v>

166
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could</v>

167
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.283
<v Speaker 2>be lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think she gotten like some </v>

168
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:54.084
<v Speaker 2>accident with a four wheeler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rolled over and broke her leg or </v>

169
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.823
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could like totally be making that up </v>

170
00:05:59.001 --> 00:05:59.834
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could have just twisted it walking </v>

171
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:02.220
<v Speaker 2>down the street too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>

172
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Now that you're saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember something like a Bro,</v>

174
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.480
<v Speaker 1>a broken leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

175
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.290
<v Speaker 1>you'll find out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

176
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.010
<v Speaker 1>but would you a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you surprised by that fight</v>

177
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.910
<v Speaker 2>between and Amanda?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

178
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

179
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see where cal being the one to </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat her,</v>

180
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.540
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

181
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.220
<v Speaker 2>I do feel like Amanda's been working and</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing like,</v>

182
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improving,</v>

183
00:06:27.241 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she changed her camps,</v>

184
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.243
<v Speaker 2>the coaches that she's working with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried out for a while at at one point </v>

185
00:06:31.831 --> 00:06:33.960
<v Speaker 2>too when I was trying to find my spot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're legit.</v>

186
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.670
<v Speaker 2>They're very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

187
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.760
<v Speaker 2>and American top team has a lot of high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level training partners,</v>

188
00:06:38.761 --> 00:06:39.960
<v Speaker 2>both girls and guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

189
00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:42.750
<v Speaker 2>She had a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good decision made there.</v>

190
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.580
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see how she's improved.</v>

191
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with the time off with Raquel,</v>

192
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.890
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sure how it was going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also I just,</v>

193
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.143
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see where Kelby and to be </v>

194
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.940
<v Speaker 2>being the one that beats her.</v>

195
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.870
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to tell you no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

196
00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:56.704
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody on any given night at the </v>

197
00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:00.850
<v Speaker 1>highest level of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can,</v>

198
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:02.800
<v Speaker 1>when someone can be off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone can be a hard,</v>

199
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

200
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.670
<v Speaker 2>there's no math to be done in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>

201
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 2>There really isn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>math is ridiculous.</v>

202
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:08.354
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I hear like statistics on me </v>

203
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:12.740
<v Speaker 2>or definitions on me or labels on me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

204
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

205
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a known striker.</v>

206
00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd never would've thought I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>known as a striker.</v>

207
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing Jujitsu and wrestling my</v>

208
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 2>whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so me and I'll take it,</v>

209
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

210
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

211
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even that is yes.</v>

212
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in itself was like,</v>

213
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I love to wrestle and what can I do once</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've closed that distance,</v>

214
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 2>while it's those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those short and goals strikes,</v>

215
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

216
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.573
<v Speaker 2>there's needs and there's elbows there </v>
<v Speaker 2>that those are the most destructive </v>

217
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:41.440
<v Speaker 2>things I could possibly do to someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

218
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.570
<v Speaker 2>when we're that close and to do all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>work to get that close.</v>

219
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 2>But granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all influenced by my time,</v>

220
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 2>what I got to learn from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

221
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:49.634
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 2>it's all relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

223
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.713
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

225
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 2>it's always just interesting to hear how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're now being categorized.</v>

226
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is weird.</v>

227
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you are,</v>

228
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 1>you are definitely a dangerous striker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

229
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.353
<v Speaker 1>you're dangerous.</v>

230
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

231
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 2>I like it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

232
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying constantly learning and new</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like the,</v>

233
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 2>the basics were always hard for me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

234
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 2>cause I wanted to do the big girl stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

235
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

236
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 2>found my way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right in the middle of all of that.</v>

237
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:20.324
<v Speaker 2>And in found a way to use how aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am and how just like dominique </v>

238
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 2>domineering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can feel in there and all of that.</v>

239
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the,</v>

240
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I want the maximum amount of damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>without taking damage,</v>

241
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

242
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.210
<v Speaker 2>But like I want to put it into a dance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like a little,</v>

243
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:39.523
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

244
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.073
<v Speaker 1>Did you decide to go to San Diego?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're at alliance now moved from </v>

245
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Colorado to San Diego.</v>

246
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.720
<v Speaker 2>So a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of them,</v>

247
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.583
<v Speaker 2>one of them was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado is a complicated situation for </v>

248
00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:52.500
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

249
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I had gyms that they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot just happened up there.</v>

250
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love my team elevation.</v>

251
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 2>Like I love ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still close with everybody.</v>

252
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Like I go to Colorado for Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 2>holidays.</v>

253
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 2>I get still home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

254
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 2>but a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One with the head injury.</v>

255
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado is amazing for training,</v>

256
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing for building your,</v>

257
00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 2>your endurance and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is not good for healing.</v>

258
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.643
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll never see a doctor tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone with Alzheimer's or a Tbi or </v>

259
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 2>heart problems or even like massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>allergies or um,</v>

260
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.390
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

261
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.190
<v Speaker 2>arthritis arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are not,</v>

262
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good place for people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live with.</v>

263
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:32.184
<v Speaker 2>Any kind of inflammatory or like major </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that needs to be healing because </v>

264
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 2>your body's already working at such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high level because yeah,</v>

265
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 2>because the altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thin air,</v>

266
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things like that,</v>

267
00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:47.931
<v Speaker 2>it's just like I spent so much time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much money,</v>

268
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 2>like figuring out what the hell was </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with me that,</v>

269
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up at the Mayo clinic spending </v>

270
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.900
<v Speaker 2>weeks at a time going to all their like </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialized different,</v>

271
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors in situations like that for them</v>

272
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 2>to tell me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:03.324
<v Speaker 2>if you want to heal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to give yourself the best </v>

274
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:08.730
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to heal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably not going to do it up at</v>

275
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 2>altitude.</v>

276
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Like we would prefer seeing you at sea </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

277
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.603
<v Speaker 2>And so combined like I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed to almost exiled myself from </v>

278
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Colorado cause I want to love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was starting to,</v>

279
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 2>it was starting to get like less </v>
<v Speaker 2>colorful for me,</v>

280
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I felt like I had the best there </v>

281
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:26.874
<v Speaker 2>was as far as coaches and the best there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was as far as training partners and the </v>

282
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 2>situations like everything was as good </v>
<v Speaker 2>as it was going to get.</v>

283
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Like it literally was as good as it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get.</v>

284
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 2>And it was like this can't be it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't feel,</v>

285
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

286
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:42.743
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means I'm gonna have to take a </v>

287
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:44.131
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

288
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 2>And I was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a little boy,</v>

289
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.663
<v Speaker 2>like I'm taking them away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything we know and we just packed a </v>

290
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:54.651
<v Speaker 2>u haul and we left and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to San Diego in San Diego I went,</v>

291
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.733
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had written down like all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gyms I went to in showed up at like </v>

292
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.380
<v Speaker 2>anonymously to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't want them to,</v>

293
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:02.214
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to kind of catch them with </v>

294
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Speaker 2>their pants down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't want to show up and have you </v>

297
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:11.220
<v Speaker 2>have people here watching me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to put on a show,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this needs to be a fit.</v>

301
00:11:17.971 --> 00:11:18.804
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting and coaching and training is </v>

302
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 2>very intimate and it needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>authentic and real.</v>

303

<v Speaker 2>The days I'm sitting there,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

310
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.790

<v Speaker 2>learn and train with so many fighters in</v>

311
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:45.180

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 3>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So long?</v>

356
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm being a Weirdo about who </v>
<v Speaker 3>promotes me.</v>

357
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.633
<v Speaker 3>Cause my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my husband promoted me to purple belt </v>

358
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.213
<v Speaker 3>and like I really want what whoever </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes over to the lineage to be like </v>

359
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:49.930
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

360
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.390
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't want it a different one </v>
<v Speaker 3>from 10 different people.</v>

361
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:56.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I want that like I want to pick and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it be right.</v>

362
00:13:56.561 --> 00:14:01.330
<v Speaker 3>And so actually now I'm super excited </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I just started training at attos</v>

363
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.140
<v Speaker 3>and I have so much respect for Andre and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wife and Angelica,</v>

364
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.380
<v Speaker 3>there's so many good fighters come out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that gym to Great Jujitsu.</v>

365
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been changing,</v>

366
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:14.530
<v Speaker 3>they're like four weeks now and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've trained there before,</v>

367
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:15.364
<v Speaker 3>but like every day for weeks now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've only had like one day where I </v>

368
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:20.524
<v Speaker 3>walked out feeling like a rock star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rest of the days they were whooping </v>

369
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:23.890
<v Speaker 3>my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was good,</v>

370
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:26.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I needed that and it tells me,</v>

371
00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:27.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

372
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.633
<v Speaker 3>And there it's just been so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to see myself that way and to hold </v>

373
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:33.304
<v Speaker 3>people that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was legit Jujitsu me and I was </v>

374
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:38.770
<v Speaker 3>like killing it on the circuit for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time and then Emma May comes in and</v>

375
00:14:38.771 --> 00:14:41.770
<v Speaker 3>puts this pressure on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even those kinds of competitions,</v>

376
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 3>even though they're not even the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

377
00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 3>And I'm annoyed that I let that bother </v>
<v Speaker 3>me and keep me from competing in between</v>

378
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 3>fights because I left the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a big name in mma?</v>

379
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 3>You feel</v>

380
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.040
<v Speaker 2>weird about competing in Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>tournaments?</v>

381
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.943
<v Speaker 2>I think I did I or maybe I thought I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up bad habits or I would do </v>

382
00:14:58.461 --> 00:14:59.294
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because maybe other people had that </v>

383
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like for me,</v>

384
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I need to see it for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I go and I do a tournament and I</v>

385
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 2>do great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then hell yeah,</v>

386
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have higher expectations of</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself in a fight.</v>

387
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.270
<v Speaker 2>If I go and I do shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

388
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.104
<v Speaker 2>well like now I get to learn like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>competing is where I get to learn </v>

389
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 2>everything and spacing out these </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitions.</v>

390
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Especially at the time I've had to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>off in between fights.</v>

391
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not,</v>

392
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe necessarily in ring </v>
<v Speaker 2>rust,</v>

393
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:24.824
<v Speaker 2>but like when they say go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what go means until a </v>

394
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:31.334
<v Speaker 2>little bit later than I'm expecting and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's been the pattern in these last </v>

395
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:34.820
<v Speaker 2>two fights.</v>

396
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.730
<v Speaker 2>When the fight starts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still feel like,</v>

397
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:39.140
<v Speaker 2>is this really happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of.</v>

398
00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even this last night,</v>

399
00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.100
<v Speaker 2>this last fight with Caitlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we got in and I was like,</v>

400
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 2>do I remember what to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

401
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:45.770
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

402
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a throw bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole time I was just like,</v>

403
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.500
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not me there,</v>

404
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.343
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like chucking my hands at </v>

405
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:55.400
<v Speaker 2>her and hope and they land and if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't like the fuck out,</v>

406
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like out of composure.</v>

407
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until the,</v>

408
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 2>until the third round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the third round I was awake and</v>

409
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Speaker 2>ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

410
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I felt warmed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt right.</v>

411
00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was looking at the clock and backing</v>

412
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 2>up and all of this and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come here,</v>

413
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 2>come here.</v>

414
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm ready to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally,</v>

415
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:12.614
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come here.</v>

416
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

417
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:15.164
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's something to be fixed about </v>

418
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:16.830
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

419
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a secret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

420
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:20.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

421
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.613
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe something with the warmup </v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to like fully like have like a </v>

422
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.363
<v Speaker 2>respiratory exhaustion before I go in so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can simulate those first rounds being </v>

423
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.460
<v Speaker 2>the hell out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in wrestling,</v>

424
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

425
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.710
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot to it.</v>

426
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:37.544
<v Speaker 2>Like Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're bouncing around all these </v>

427
00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:41.740
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

428
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:42.683
<v Speaker 2>one thing with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that treatment center that I went </v>

429
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 2>to is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

430
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.190
<v Speaker 2>doing different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dealing with your psychology,</v>

431
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 2>dealing with like the synchrony and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

432
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having your brain function and in on the</v>

433
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:57.000
<v Speaker 2>same hurts at the same or different </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas of your brain.</v>

434
00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's therapy.</v>

435
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.670
<v Speaker 2>So it's these magnets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

436
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main people in there.</v>

437
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful.</v>

438
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Not Beautiful but beautiful to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting in the lobby waiting.</v>

439
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 2>When you see people with Alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in,</v>

440
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>like there's a man that wheels his wife </v>
<v Speaker 2>and every day and,</v>

441
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 2>and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

442
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I think at the beginning of the week she</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets like an ivy,</v>

443
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.460
<v Speaker 2>so she's like a little bit more up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chipper.</v>

444
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:23.960
<v Speaker 2>But by the end of the week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

445
00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:27.500
<v Speaker 2>she's a little bit more slow motion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories like his,</v>

446
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:29.200
<v Speaker 2>where he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

447
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before they started going in there,</v>

448
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.353
<v Speaker 2>she would just go to the bathroom all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and every day this man takes care </v>

449
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:37.130
<v Speaker 2>of his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts her makeup on her,</v>

450
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.400
<v Speaker 2>like goes and gets her hair done even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though she doesn't even know,</v>

451
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now she can at least tell him that </v>

452
00:17:43.731 --> 00:17:44.840
<v Speaker 2>she needs to go to the bathroom.</v>

453
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Like just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

454
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 2>it's time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

455
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>and he can get her there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

456
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:53.670
<v Speaker 2>kind of have like meaningful moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they haven't had in awhile for.</v>

457
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:54.773
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of veterans in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>active veterans to active military guys </v>

458
00:18:00.301 --> 00:18:01.134
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.093
<v Speaker 2>they're doing these door breaches and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they get their head rattled up too </v>

460
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:07.220
<v Speaker 2>many times and they're noticing they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have problems with some depression.</v>

461
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are high level navy seals,</v>

462
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:10.764
<v Speaker 2>high level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

463
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.370
<v Speaker 2>like special forces that need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

464
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.230
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're expensive people.</v>

465
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.083
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's millions of dollars poured into </v>

466
00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 2>these people and they're not ready to </v>
<v Speaker 2>let them go yet.</v>

467
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we fix them,</v>

468
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.420
<v Speaker 2>give them this like performance edge but</v>
<v Speaker 2>still get them like,</v>

469
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.680
<v Speaker 2>like healed enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we need,</v>

470
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.060
<v Speaker 2>we need to throw them back in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

471
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.430
<v Speaker 2>we need them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

472
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.313
<v Speaker 2>And so I've had to sit in on </v>
<v Speaker 2>appointments with the Department of </v>

473
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Defense in talk about my experience with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

474
00:18:35.641 --> 00:18:36.660
<v Speaker 2>I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

475
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

476
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.933
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some really famous people I </v>

477
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:41.094
<v Speaker 2>don't even think I get to say because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be a dick and I'm to probably be in </v>

478
00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:44.334
<v Speaker 2>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

479
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've sat in on and,</v>

480
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had their own issues with mental</v>

481
00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:51.380
<v Speaker 2>health or ptsd or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

482
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like autism,</v>

483
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.073
<v Speaker 2>different things like family members of </v>
<v Speaker 2>theirs or whatever that I've sat in on </v>

484
00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:58.044
<v Speaker 2>and kind of been helpful in talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about because I went in there on two </v>

485
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:03.720
<v Speaker 2>different antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

486
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.270
<v Speaker 2>and these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was put on at the Mayo Clinic and</v>

487
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.860
<v Speaker 1>felt like post the Nunez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

488
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.980
<v Speaker 1>this is how crazy am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean math is right.</v>

489
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.950
<v Speaker 1>You lose to Rhonda in 14 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Kao Amanda Nunez.</v>

490
00:19:18.531 --> 00:19:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez beats the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda and 48 seconds.</v>

491
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.000
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be like the perfect example.</v>

492
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Having a math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and I mean crazy.</v>

493
00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.680
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you beaten down to UFC champion.</v>

494
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I took,</v>

495
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:40.350
<v Speaker 2>it took two and a half rounds for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to sub Pennington too.</v>

496
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's nothing,</v>

497
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who is it?</v>

498
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Pennington goes toe to toe and round and</v>
<v Speaker 2>round with holly.</v>

499
00:19:49.301 --> 00:19:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Holly Knox out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda too.</v>

500
00:19:50.651 --> 00:19:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just this division</v>

501
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.840
<v Speaker 1>to his fight with Ashley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evan Smith to this day that the ending,</v>

502
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.200
<v Speaker 1>when she got her in that bulldog choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

503
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Robert and blood and finished her like </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally one second.</v>

504
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.910
<v Speaker 1>It was a violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

505
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I screamed so loud at the end of that.</v>

506
00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:11.080
<v Speaker 1>It was just fucking chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

507
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.183
<v Speaker 1>she's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's had two fights that ended like </v>

508
00:20:14.211 --> 00:20:17.030
<v Speaker 1>that with like one second ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She finishes the fight.</v>

509
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.990
<v Speaker 1>It's tough girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

510
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.240
<v Speaker 1>MMA math is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>

511
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.270
<v Speaker 1>And you might be the best example of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>

512
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.670
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you go to this,</v>

513
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:29.813
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mayo Clinic puts you on </v>

514
00:20:30.681 --> 00:20:33.290
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants because you just feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like shit.</v>

515
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:33.810
<v Speaker 1>He like</v>

516
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:34.643
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because like of the different </v>

517
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:38.890
<v Speaker 2>endocrine problems that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

518
00:20:38.891 --> 00:20:42.330
<v Speaker 2>So I can't have any of the medications </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll help that.</v>

519
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 2>So I have to be more conservative with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

520
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:45.174
<v Speaker 2>And one way they thought to do it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because my cortisol levels are really </v>

521
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

522
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.130
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

523
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.010
<v Speaker 3>and I mean granted I have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>

524
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.110
<v Speaker 3>especially like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

525
00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 3>life hasn't been easy</v>

526
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

527
00:20:55.451 --> 00:20:57.850
<v Speaker 1>your husband passes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in the toughest,</v>

528
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 1>probably the toughest sport on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

529
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be the best at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

530
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.120
<v Speaker 1>So your elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the top 10 so you're,</v>

531
00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:04.954
<v Speaker 1>you're in this weird position where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never know when you're going to fire to </v>

532
00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:09.340
<v Speaker 1>who you're going to find is a constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts to.</v>

533
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like you're making millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dollars doing it either.</v>

534
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:12.283
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well and it's expediting healing for me </v>

535
00:21:14.391 --> 00:21:16.400
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I also have a kid going through what</v>

536
00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:19.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm going through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not like I get to like split and</v>

537
00:21:19.281 --> 00:21:20.750
<v Speaker 3>cut corners and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

538
00:21:20.751 --> 00:21:23.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's maintenance to be done</v>
<v Speaker 3>at all times with that.</v>

539
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.940
<v Speaker 3>So I go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tell me,</v>

540
00:21:25.941 --> 00:21:26.774
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could probably lower your coders all </v>

541
00:21:27.531 --> 00:21:29.720
<v Speaker 3>levels if we could load or lower your </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress levels.</v>

542
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.700
<v Speaker 3>So we'll try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Antidepressants,</v>

543
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.420
<v Speaker 3>what did that make you feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flat as fuck and like I didn't,</v>

544
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.320
<v Speaker 3>am I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I say fuck on this?</v>

545
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

546
00:21:38.721 --> 00:21:42.680
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't know if I have a quota.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far I'm like a bad person.</v>

547
00:21:42.681 --> 00:21:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Like did I get handed to like a doug?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It added to a certain level,</v>

548
00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.653
<v Speaker 3>zero restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can say whatever you want in the </v>

549
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:49.583
<v Speaker 3>shit out of it.</v>

550
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.391
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

551
00:21:50.391 --> 00:21:52.880
<v Speaker 3>So there's no one listening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

552
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

554
00:21:55.441 --> 00:21:58.160

<v Speaker 3>they usually have flat flat,</v>

555
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.820
<v Speaker 3>which like all that training camp </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting ready for Juliana.</v>

556
00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>

559
00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:06.824
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel good in the fight when they say </v>

<v Speaker 3>They can't make me like,</v>

601
00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:41.653

<v Speaker 2>function and learn and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

604
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:50.870

<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

606
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.620

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

607
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:55.454
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the first round I came out </v>

608
00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:57.770
<v Speaker 2>how I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

609
00:23:57.771 --> 00:23:59.150
<v Speaker 2>and then halfway through the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

610
00:23:59.151 --> 00:23:59.984
<v Speaker 2>like it was just awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she had my old coaches in her </v>

611
00:24:04.701 --> 00:24:05.534
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's weird about that fight </v>

612
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:11.831
<v Speaker 2>is I could hear you and I could like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where the flat came in is like I</v>

613
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:13.850
<v Speaker 2>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like I was in the fight.</v>

614
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:18.851
<v Speaker 2>Like I could see herb Dean's feet and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>could hear you talking about us and I,</v>

615
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:20.983
<v Speaker 2>I saw like I could hear Juliana's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaches and it was breaking my heart </v>

616
00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:26.204
<v Speaker 2>that they were coaching against me </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were my Colorado gym and </v>

617
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:30.464
<v Speaker 2>she went and trained with them and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>know she had trained with them </v>

618
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.140
<v Speaker 2>previously.</v>

619
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.270
<v Speaker 2>So I mean before she had taken the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

620
00:24:35.271 --> 00:24:38.450
<v Speaker 2>But to me it was like fucked up to here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

621
00:24:38.451 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 2>And it hurt me in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

622
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.403
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could explain it better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like I heard them and I just </v>

623
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:46.600
<v Speaker 2>wanted to go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

624
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.710
<v Speaker 2>I look at the clock and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kittenish just be over.</v>

625
00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go back to Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to move like in,</v>

626
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I literally on this side of the cage I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had my past in Colorado,</v>

627
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I had these coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the drama with that,</v>

628
00:24:58.281 --> 00:25:01.580
<v Speaker 2>with that Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how everything went and,</v>

629
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.690
<v Speaker 2>and then on this side it was like all </v>
<v Speaker 2>new problems like San Diego,</v>

630
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Eric and then we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a lot of trading partners</v>

631
00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:08.811
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was sunny,</v>

632
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:12.090
<v Speaker 2>it was similar to Colorado at different </v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the right ways,</v>

633
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.810
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like I just want it out</v>

634
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:14.763
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were in San Diego trainer for that </v>

635
00:25:16.151 --> 00:25:17.000
<v Speaker 1>fight or no?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

636
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.980
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just flew out for it for,</v>

637
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.730
<v Speaker 1>for the training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while you flew out there,</v>

638
00:25:21.731 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 1>you were still taking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants and did it,</v>

639
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.980
<v Speaker 1>did that fight convince you to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking them?</v>

640
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:27.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

641
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Did that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to a,</v>

642
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:33.020
<v Speaker 2>what did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I went to the,</v>

643
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.273
<v Speaker 2>I was at the Pi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was working with Novinski and people </v>

644
00:25:36.921 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 2>on like what to do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even talked to Gordon and Dr.</v>

645
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Gordon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Gordon.</v>

646
00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To help me with all of that too.</v>

647
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:45.074
<v Speaker 2>Cause he thought there was a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative way to help me with those </v>

648
00:25:46.851 --> 00:25:50.390
<v Speaker 2>issues as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I knew I was talking with him,</v>

649
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I had him talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

650
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.360
<v Speaker 2>they were all trying to figure out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

651
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:54.500
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's like,</v>

652
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.520
<v Speaker 2>there's no ways to even just naturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring you up to think about retiring.</v>

653
00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

654
00:25:59.661 --> 00:26:02.450
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing is the center was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really the place that was,</v>

655
00:26:02.451 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

656
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried everything else.</v>

657
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go here and if they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fix me then then I'm,</v>

658
00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to be done.</v>

659
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.550
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fucking hard is Amanda Nunez hit?</v>

660
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.930
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She does it like she,</v>

661
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say she hits like a dude</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's kind of weird.</v>

662
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a dude.</v>

663
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.010
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

664
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:26.350
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember being surprised.</v>

665
00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:29.860
<v Speaker 2>I remember like having this open guard </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground and kind of like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she hits him,</v>

671
00:26:42.361 --> 00:26:44.240
<v Speaker 1>like where you saw it Rhonda like right </v>

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 3>There's a part in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I watched our fight after and like</v>

674
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.273
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>little twin eat tweety birds and I was </v>

678

<v Speaker 3>pumped because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the cartoons get it from.</v>

679
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Somebody explained that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly where they got it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like I couldn't get my arm back up and I</v>

682
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:15.120
<v Speaker 3>remember listening to you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

683
00:27:15.121 --> 00:27:17.190
<v Speaker 3>cousin not intelligently defending </v>
<v Speaker 3>herself.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

686
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:24.954
<v Speaker 3>And then she screwed up because she </v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbed my knee and my knee was the one </v>

687
00:27:27.691 --> 00:27:30.690
<v Speaker 3>that was like the catalyst to all my </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems over the last couple of years.</v>

688
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.250
<v Speaker 3>And it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't fucking touch that.</v>

689
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.020
<v Speaker 3>And after that it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just angry when she grabbed you in.</v>

690
00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:37.890

<v Speaker 3>Who's the wrong knee?</v>

691
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:39.510
<v Speaker 3>But I knew what she was trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

692
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

694
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:46.223
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of it was just like punishing </v>

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.350
<v Speaker 3>It's relief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I didn't like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like we lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>we get to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>

723
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.210
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

724
00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.800
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

725
00:29:14.801 --> 00:29:16.000
<v Speaker 3>it's a relief.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

726
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

727
00:29:18.521 --> 00:29:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said you lived,</v>

728
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.290
<v Speaker 1>cause that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

729
00:29:23.291 --> 00:29:24.550
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a fight.</v>

730
00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.410
<v Speaker 1>There is a referee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be saved.</v>

731
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.650
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that George Saint </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pierre said last week when he was on the</v>

732
00:29:29.651 --> 00:29:30.640
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

733
00:29:30.641 --> 00:29:33.790
<v Speaker 1>the mentality that you go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you fight,</v>

734
00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:35.650
<v Speaker 1>you are a warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

735
00:29:35.651 --> 00:29:37.390
<v Speaker 1>you know that you're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescued,</v>

736
00:29:37.391 --> 00:29:38.224
<v Speaker 1>but you are fighting for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're fighting a fucking </v>

737
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:46.230
<v Speaker 1>killer like Amanda and you get lit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you didn't survive that first round</v>

738
00:29:46.231 --> 00:29:50.380
<v Speaker 1>and then go back and stop her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where that comes from.</v>

739
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was just fucking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tense.</v>

740
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Well it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the practicality to me,</v>

741
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

742
00:29:55.511 --> 00:29:56.231
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

743
00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Speaker 2>We have a referee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have cage walls,</v>

744
00:29:58.151 --> 00:29:59.320
<v Speaker 2>we have whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

745
00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.030
<v Speaker 2>fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's entertaining people.</v>

746
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:01.864
<v Speaker 2>But like I need to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to know that like w that'd be a </v>

747
00:30:06.441 --> 00:30:07.300
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

748
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:09.930
<v Speaker 2>that'd be doing whatever that be self </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense that be,</v>

749
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.900
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck us fighting over a territory or </v>
<v Speaker 2>food or whatever.</v>

750
00:30:13.901 --> 00:30:14.734
<v Speaker 2>Like I need to know what would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if we had like that's why I want </v>

751
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:18.394
<v Speaker 2>these finishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only get 15 minutes to be able to </v>

752
00:30:20.531 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 2>tell ourselves what would have happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that situation.</v>

753
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:24.441
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

754
00:30:24.441 --> 00:30:26.950
<v Speaker 2>and when it goes to a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pissed cause I don't know,</v>

755
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't know,</v>

756
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:29.483
<v Speaker 2>especially these three round fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm waking up like these last </v>

757
00:30:32.471 --> 00:30:33.304
<v Speaker 2>couple of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like late in the fight them I'm pissed </v>

758
00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:35.854
<v Speaker 2>because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that would have been </v>

759
00:30:37.151 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Speaker 2>another 30 minutes or another two hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're scrapping in the woods.</v>

760
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Like who gets the bone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

761
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

762
00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.180
<v Speaker 2>and so that's us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

763
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.770
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy and issue practicality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sheer survival.</v>

764
00:30:47.771 --> 00:30:49.840
<v Speaker 2>And this is the way I get to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

765
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 1>That's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gets the bone?</v>

766
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn the way you just put it.</v>

767
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever heard anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it that way.</v>

768
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.530
<v Speaker 1>You need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

769
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.770
<v Speaker 1>that's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I get it.</v>

770
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where that's cream comes from.</v>

771
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.880
<v Speaker 1>You got the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

772
00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:21.000
<v Speaker 1>So you go down to San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was your short list before,</v>

773
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.770
<v Speaker 1>by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of,</v>

774
00:31:22.771 --> 00:31:23.604
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric.</v>

775
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:24.683
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance is just one of the best camps </v>

776
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.650
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think Eric Delphia was like,</v>

777
00:31:28.651 --> 00:31:29.484
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the most underrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because he doesn't toot his own </v>

778
00:31:31.291 --> 00:31:31.830
<v Speaker 1>horn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

779
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.680
<v Speaker 1>He's like in the shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid back,</v>

780
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.860
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want any intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not trying to get any attention.</v>

781
00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Like he's the last guy to like request </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

782
00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but super,</v>

783
00:31:42.751 --> 00:31:45.510
<v Speaker 1>super knowledgeable and one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys in a corner too.</v>

784
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Like his advice is always excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

785
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.780
<v Speaker 1>never heard him say the wrong thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the corner.</v>

786
00:31:51.781 --> 00:31:52.614
<v Speaker 1>He's always like on point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was your short list of places </v>

787
00:31:55.801 --> 00:31:57.140
<v Speaker 1>to go to besides the wines?</v>

788
00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.030

<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

790
00:32:02.431 --> 00:32:06.870
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like I'm not trying to walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>in on holly and like make sure it weird.</v>

791
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Then we're going to fight each other at </v>
<v Speaker 2>some point.</v>

792
00:32:08.671 --> 00:32:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Although I know I'm welcoming.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's always been nice.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They're sailing.</v>

821
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Food culture could be better there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish we could combine that food.</v>

822
00:33:23.091 --> 00:33:25.410
<v Speaker 3>Culture of culture.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a fire and meat.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

830
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:45.970

<v Speaker 3>steak.</v>

831
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.040
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great,</v>

832
00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:51.470
<v Speaker 3>I love vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can get them anywhere.</v>

833
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I can get them in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

834
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not exactly the produce </v>
<v Speaker 3>capital of the world,</v>

835
00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.020
<v Speaker 3>but you can get them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

836
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.940
<v Speaker 3>It's not the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just get a greenhouse,</v>

837
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.020
<v Speaker 3>grow some tomatoes on my spare time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

838
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you try Montreal?</v>

839
00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Did you think about five star?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

840
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.610
<v Speaker 3>I did not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

841
00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:12.080
<v Speaker 3>I thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

842
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get up to Canadia.</v>

843
00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aye.</v>

844
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.530
<v Speaker 3>I went to Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Mexico.</v>

845
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.650
<v Speaker 3>I went to you think about going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thailand.</v>

846
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

847
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean when I'm there especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like such,</v>

848
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.690
<v Speaker 3>it's a Buddhist culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are so happy.</v>

849
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have your shit.</v>

850
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.510
<v Speaker 3>They're just like you have everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

851
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:33.650
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

852
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:39.070
<v Speaker 3>like the Moyie Thai training is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the places I would go to Jujitsu,</v>

853
00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:44.320
<v Speaker 3>like the fair techs and Patios is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is coming around in,</v>

854
00:34:44.321 --> 00:34:45.154
<v Speaker 3>in pretty solid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I've been considered that for this </v>

855
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:52.070
<v Speaker 3>camp just to kind of like make some </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes cause I really want to have that</v>

856
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.880
<v Speaker 3>influence in that like exposure to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>authentic when we tag.</v>

857
00:34:55.881 --> 00:34:56.714
<v Speaker 3>And like when I looked back at my most </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful and most happy times after </v>

858
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:02.330
<v Speaker 3>these three fives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've lost three in a row.</v>

859
00:35:02.331 --> 00:35:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Like that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying,</v>

860
00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:04.911
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

861
00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:06.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm better than this.</v>

862
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:06.943
<v Speaker 3>Like something's up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know there's a lot that I need to </v>

863
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:09.980
<v Speaker 3>work on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>

864
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:10.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

865
00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:11.443
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life in general and I'm doing it and </v>

866
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:13.544
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to be doing it and I'm happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be getting the lessons even if this </v>

867
00:35:15.711 --> 00:35:17.270
<v Speaker 3>is how I have to get him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck it.</v>

868
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:18.830
<v Speaker 3>At least I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

869
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to look back and analyze like,</v>

870
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:24.830
<v Speaker 3>what was I doing when I was my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter,</v>

871
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.550
<v Speaker 3>when I was feeling the best and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like very traditional,</v>

872
00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:31.160
<v Speaker 3>thick Moitai in very traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thick Jujitsu.</v>

873
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.203
<v Speaker 3>So that this camp has been something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm gonna also be outsourcing </v>

874
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:38.430
<v Speaker 3>because I want to be like that</v>

875
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.590
<v Speaker 2>element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm doing my,</v>

876
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing an actual Moitai with John Ex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's uh,</v>

877
00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy Stevens Moitai coach I think too.</v>

878
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.960
<v Speaker 2>And then my Jujitsu with attos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

879
00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.870
<v Speaker 2>cause before it was like I would do </v>
<v Speaker 2>these separate disciplines,</v>

880
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:52.704
<v Speaker 2>put them together and drills and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sparring and then go mango people and </v>

881
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:58.770
<v Speaker 2>then like have fun with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like these little goals I had</v>

882
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:59.623
<v Speaker 2>set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this little bucket list I would </v>

883
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:01.164
<v Speaker 2>take into a fight with me and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull those things off and then go learn </v>

884
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 2>new stuff and then go try to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I was constantly evolving.</v>

885
00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Every fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the fight with Amanda and I like</v>

886
00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:11.064
<v Speaker 2>snapped her down and I had her by her </v>
<v Speaker 2>head and everyone's screaming news news </v>

887
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.770
<v Speaker 2>and like hold my beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I go on a throw her with</v>

888
00:36:17.771 --> 00:36:18.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

889
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 2>the old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it a ddt.</v>

890
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.811
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

891
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:25.380
<v Speaker 2>it was a freestyle headlock suplex but </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

892
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.873
<v Speaker 2>like I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want every fight to be different and </v>

893
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:30.360
<v Speaker 2>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like know what I have,</v>

894
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.780
<v Speaker 2>but see what else I got right thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

895
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.580
<v Speaker 2>that I don't even get to play that right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now because I'm fucking up and I'm,</v>

896
00:36:37.581 --> 00:36:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing what I want in these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

897
00:36:39.601 --> 00:36:40.434
<v Speaker 2>So I decided to take steps backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do you dial in training and </v>

898
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:45.720
<v Speaker 2>training?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

899
00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something's,</v>

900
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.330
<v Speaker 2>something's been missing and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>partially wondering if it's that,</v>

901
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:52.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like every fight I'm looking to make </v>

902
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:56.034
<v Speaker 2>improvements and change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not going to ever sit here and </v>

903
00:36:57.631 --> 00:36:59.580
<v Speaker 2>say I know everything and that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

904
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.130
<v Speaker 2>I have no excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Katelyn found a way to beat me,</v>

905
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.350
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Juliana found a way to beat me.</v>

906
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I kind of beat myself in that one too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I let my head get into my,</v>

907
00:37:07.891 --> 00:37:10.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that sucked in again,</v>

908
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.190
<v Speaker 2>another thing for me to have put time in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm happy I did,</v>

909
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:16.500
<v Speaker 2>but I mean that got me to move to San </v>
<v Speaker 2>Diego.</v>

910
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.630
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy for that message.</v>

911
00:37:18.631 --> 00:37:20.520
<v Speaker 2>It costs me a lot of money to get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>message,</v>

912
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:21.850
<v Speaker 2>but I'll take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

913
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Caitlin,</v>

914
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:24.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She found a way to beat me in,</v>

915
00:37:24.811 --> 00:37:25.644
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been beaten by Jujitsu when I feel </v>

916
00:37:27.181 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 2>very accomplished in Jujitsu that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>stung differently.</v>

917
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.013
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's done way differently than just </v>

918
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.010
<v Speaker 2>someone else getting their hand raised.</v>

919
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel when you're in training that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the same as you were before,</v>

920
00:37:37.961 --> 00:37:38.794
<v Speaker 1>when you were at your best?</v>

921
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was at my best,</v>

922
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.850
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something I'm working on like I</v>

923
00:37:43.851 --> 00:37:44.684
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I have like the hangups that I </v>

924
00:37:47.181 --> 00:37:49.550
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a ton of mental stuff,</v>

925
00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:50.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

926
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just how life happened and,</v>

927
00:37:53.301 --> 00:37:54.530
<v Speaker 2>and constantly having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

928
00:37:54.531 --> 00:37:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I had this expedited adaptation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

929
00:37:56.811 --> 00:37:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I had to get new coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to find new gyms.</v>

930
00:37:59.271 --> 00:38:03.380
<v Speaker 2>I had to do all of this while in grief </v>
<v Speaker 2>and being under like,</v>

931
00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.230
<v Speaker 2>like this isn't the most forgiving </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd,</v>

932
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when,</v>

933
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.010
<v Speaker 2>when you're having a shit day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not the worst.</v>

934
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:12.500
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because it's such a,</v>

935
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:13.893
<v Speaker 1>like you're so exposed and you're so </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable as a fighter and the fans </v>

936

<v Speaker 1>Even if it was the truth.</v>

1040
00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:41.943
<v Speaker 1>The way in which people say it and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why they're saying is because </v>

1041
00:42:45.401 --> 00:42:48.430
<v Speaker 1>they want to hurt your feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not being kind.</v>

1047
00:43:01.151 --> 00:43:03.190
<v Speaker 1>tell the facts and explain what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1048
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.730
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to cut people down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt people and it's,</v>

1049
00:43:06.731 --> 00:43:07.564
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of it has to do with </v>

1050
00:43:09.431 --> 00:43:13.600
<v Speaker 1>the fact that our fucking president does</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it seems more prevalent now</v>

1051
00:43:13.601 --> 00:43:14.440
<v Speaker 1>than ever before.</v>

1052
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:18.430
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's like a trend and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think a lot of like,</v>

1053
00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever the president is,</v>

1054
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's some people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to listen to anything he says,</v>

1055
00:43:24.671 --> 00:43:25.504
<v Speaker 1>but there's a certain amount of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going to take his actions and </v>

1056
00:43:28.871 --> 00:43:31.250
<v Speaker 1>use it as almost like a barometer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:35.470
<v Speaker 1>An example of how they should behave and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how this country behaves.</v>

1058
00:43:35.471 --> 00:43:40.471
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's the top dog and when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top dog is insulting people all the time</v>

1059
00:43:40.961 --> 00:43:43.240
<v Speaker 1>and saying shitty things and holds it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be successful.</v>

1060
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1061
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it lets people know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you want to get ahead.</v>

1062
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I want to get ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta do like him and then they,</v>

1063
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.490
<v Speaker 1>they go out and act like assholes too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1064
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

1065
00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:54.933
<v Speaker 1>you go down to San Diego and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing for you that gets </v>

1066
00:43:58.301 --> 00:44:01.420
<v Speaker 1>you off of the antidepressants and gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feeling better?</v>

1067
00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1068
00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.610
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you get in there and I mean it's,</v>

1069
00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.120
<v Speaker 2>it's scary to go again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1070
00:44:07.121 --> 00:44:07.954
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these different people in </v>

1071
00:44:09.161 --> 00:44:11.150
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the man found the,</v>

1072
00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.010
<v Speaker 2>the research on it by treating his own </v>
<v Speaker 2>autistic kid.</v>

1073
00:44:15.011 --> 00:44:15.844
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see the before and after </v>

1074
00:44:16.931 --> 00:44:18.820
<v Speaker 2>videos of this kid and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn.</v>

1075
00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:19.953
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1076
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought my son into,</v>

1077
00:44:21.431 --> 00:44:25.150
<v Speaker 2>cause he has adhd and he's off his </v>
<v Speaker 2>medication now as well.</v>

1078
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.610
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1079
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:32.700
<v Speaker 2>they do an eeg first and then they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell which of your brain are firing it,</v>

1080
00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:34.910
<v Speaker 2>what hurts in seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1081
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 2>the congruencies in like how all of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is happening or not happening.</v>

1082
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they kind of prescribed these,</v>

1083
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.480
<v Speaker 2>these different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these machines like on your,</v>

1084
00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:47.130
<v Speaker 2>on your brain that make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1085
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:51.000
<v Speaker 2>these like electric impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're magnetic to,</v>

1086
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.863
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of speed up or slow down the </v>

1087
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 2>different parts of your brain.</v>

1088
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:54.893
<v Speaker 2>So if the front of your brain is moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>slower than the back of your brain are </v>

1089
00:44:57.031 --> 00:44:59.400
<v Speaker 2>those or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1090
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're noticing obviously patterns with</v>

1091
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 2>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hockey players,</v>

1092
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:05.280
<v Speaker 2>football players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1093
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.950
<v Speaker 2>like people that are leading with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>heads basically.</v>

1094
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having like,</v>

1095
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then with the veterans that are like</v>

1096
00:45:12.061 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 2>emotional things to where I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1097
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:16.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like,</v>

1098
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having to compartmentalize as well,</v>

1099
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:21.770
<v Speaker 2>like some of the shit they see should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>upsetting me know,</v>

1100
00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:23.060
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1101
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

1102
00:45:24.091 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 2>there's different ways that we can train</v>
<v Speaker 2>our brain to,</v>

1103
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:27.443
<v Speaker 2>to drop things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then ptsd is when it's an </v>

1104
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.430
<v Speaker 2>involuntary and it all comes in and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

1105
00:45:32.431 --> 00:45:33.870
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1106
00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been diagnosed with PTSD.</v>

1107
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I had walked in there with medication </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of being depressed,</v>

1108
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:43.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the anxiety and all of that.</v>

1109
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Like my symptoms were terrible.</v>

1110
00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.580
<v Speaker 2>And I know there are a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1111
00:45:47.581 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 2>but even like my startle reflex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1112
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could hear someone come walking around</v>

1113
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:52.801
<v Speaker 2>the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1114
00:45:52.801 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 2>clap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clap,</v>

1115
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:54.330
<v Speaker 2>clap here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their shoes.</v>

1116
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:55.950
<v Speaker 2>But the second I'd see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>

1117
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:56.843
<v Speaker 2>it would stop my heart for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's like shit on your adrenal </v>

1118
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:00.810
<v Speaker 2>glands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1119
00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:01.644
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1120
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff was,</v>

1121
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:05.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an anxiety that,</v>

1122
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1123
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 2>it was hard to fall asleep at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1124
00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:13.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my memory was crap and this is all,</v>

1125
00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:13.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different stuff happening in all these </v>

1126
00:46:15.661 --> 00:46:18.120
<v Speaker 2>other fighters that I know as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1127
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:21.480
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying things so much,</v>

1128
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.860
<v Speaker 2>so much over the past few years that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get excited about and either it works or</v>

1129
00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:27.240
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1130
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point is,</v>

1131
00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:31.104
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is now I found this and I feel better </v>

1132
00:46:33.181 --> 00:46:34.014
<v Speaker 2>from this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1133
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I was so excited about all these other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1134
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:36.803
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't just start telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody of the new thing that I've </v>

1135
00:46:38.691 --> 00:46:39.524
<v Speaker 2>found because I've said that and been </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about like everything else with </v>

1136
00:46:42.511 --> 00:46:46.080
<v Speaker 2>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one's like the equal scope.</v>

1137
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.063
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1138
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.990
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1139
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.960
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like a tens machine or stem</v>

1140
00:46:51.961 --> 00:46:53.070
<v Speaker 2>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like a super,</v>

1141
00:46:53.071 --> 00:46:56.130
<v Speaker 2>super low frequency and that's bad ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like it,</v>

1142
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 2>it helped on injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1143
00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I rolled my ankle or hurt my toe,</v>

1144
00:47:00.361 --> 00:47:03.120
<v Speaker 2>like you could bring the swelling down </v>
<v Speaker 2>from this to,</v>

1145
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.313
<v Speaker 2>to normal essentially in like an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half just working on with this </v>

1146
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.060
<v Speaker 2>like tens unit on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1147
00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:09.894
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they originally used it for race horses </v>

1148
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:13.470
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for,</v>

1149
00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super expensive million dollar horses,</v>

1150
00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:19.980
<v Speaker 2>like the equipment they brought over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like 90 grand and like,</v>

1151
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.173
<v Speaker 2>like these really specific like special </v>
<v Speaker 2>metals that were put into these plates </v>

1152
00:47:25.261 --> 00:47:26.910
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do stuff like that.</v>

1153
00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:27.743
<v Speaker 2>But that wasn't working on my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was working injuries and it was </v>

1154
00:47:29.891 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 2>working on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1155
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:35.920
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it helped with like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like digestive system maybe or my,</v>

1156
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1157
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:39.423
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some other things it was helping with </v>

1158
00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:42.574
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

1159
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:43.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1160
00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.210
<v Speaker 2>I started doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1161
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:46.143
<v Speaker 2>or I was doing that when I walked into </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset and started doing that </v>

1162
00:47:48.461 --> 00:47:50.160
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what do they do it?</v>

1163
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.690
<v Speaker 2>So you sit in a chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1164
00:47:52.691 --> 00:47:53.524
<v Speaker 2>and they ha they put this prescription </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this machine and the machine has </v>

1165
00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:57.243
<v Speaker 2>kinda got like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a arm that goes on in a specific </v>

1166
00:48:00.581 --> 00:48:02.440
<v Speaker 2>part of your brain and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1167
00:48:02.441 --> 00:48:04.030
<v Speaker 2>you close your eyes and it sends us </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1168
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:08.320
<v Speaker 2>these magnetic pulses into your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

1169
00:48:08.321 --> 00:48:09.154
<v Speaker 2>you don't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you can hear what it </v>

1170
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.310
<v Speaker 2>feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know how to describe it.</v>

1171
00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:16.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sense,</v>

1172
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:18.520
<v Speaker 2>it's essential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

1173
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:20.950
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly hearing and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly feeling.</v>

1174
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1175
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.820
<v Speaker 2>And I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1176
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:27.550
<v Speaker 2>you leave the place after your </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>

1177
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go twice a day.</v>

1178
00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:29.644
<v Speaker 2>It's 45 minutes away both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I am driving a lot everyday to go to </v>

1179
00:48:35.561 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 2>do this cause I want to give it a fair </v>
<v Speaker 2>shot to do it every day.</v>

1180
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.753
<v Speaker 2>I do everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gone these past couple of </v>

1181
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.080
<v Speaker 2>weeks cause uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff with my kids.</v>

1182
00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:44.973
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scheduled school's almost out and then </v>

1183
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 2>wanting to try out different things with</v>
<v Speaker 2>different coaches.</v>

1184
00:48:49.001 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as these new disciplines go.</v>

1185
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.800
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't been there as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1186
00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:58.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the last was August I believe is,</v>

1187
00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.960
<v Speaker 2>is when I was like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really getting into it and go on twice a</v>

1188
00:49:01.961 --> 00:49:03.370
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 minutes each way.</v>

1189
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Twice a day.</v>

1190
00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1191
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.980
<v Speaker 2>So you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would spend 45 minutes one way,</v>

1192
00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:14.140
<v Speaker 2>one way and then go back again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking move closer to where the,</v>

1193
00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:18.200
<v Speaker 2>because the alliance was down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would,</v>

1194
00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I would drop my kid off at school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would run,</v>

1195
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 2>and then I would go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do my treatment.</v>

1196
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I go back to practice down in southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>San Diego,</v>

1197
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.233
<v Speaker 2>then I'd get my son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we'd go up there for the </v>

1198
00:49:30.221 --> 00:49:33.390
<v Speaker 2>afternoon session and then I'd come back</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and,</v>

1199
00:49:33.391 --> 00:49:35.800
<v Speaker 2>and we'd go to his sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'd have my second two a day.</v>

1200
00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.620
<v Speaker 2>That does not leave a lot of free time </v>
<v Speaker 2>for cats and Ghana.</v>

1201
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh Hell No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Hell No.</v>

1202
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Just that alone can be stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was seeing the results.</v>

1203
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:48.910
<v Speaker 2>That was the crazy thing is I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling better.</v>

1204
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:52.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the results when I just walked in like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like super like emotional.</v>

1233
00:50:54.981 --> 00:50:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1234
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:56.803
<v Speaker 2>I'm at my wit's end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've tried everything I can think </v>

1235
00:50:58.401 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 2>of like holistic views,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like chemical views,</v>

1236
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:03.200
<v Speaker 2>this like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1237
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:04.034
<v Speaker 2>spending money out of my pocket trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure this out because none of this </v>

1238
00:51:06.231 --> 00:51:08.080
<v Speaker 2>is covered by the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially because,</v>

1239
00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not something I claimed in a fight.</v>

1240
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought Amanda,</v>

1241
00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.880
<v Speaker 2>and if you don't claim that stuff within</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 30 days,</v>

1242
00:51:13.881 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 2>like you're on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course my head her,</v>

1243
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:18.260
<v Speaker 2>of course I'm dizzy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course the lights are bright.</v>

1244
00:51:18.261 --> 00:51:19.670
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't think.</v>

1245
00:51:19.671 --> 00:51:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got in a fist fight,</v>

1246
00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.673
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wasn't doing good in it for </v>

1247
00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:23.930
<v Speaker 2>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1248
00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:25.400
<v Speaker 2>I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1249
00:51:25.401 --> 00:51:28.220
<v Speaker 2>but then a month and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two months out when I wasn't better.</v>

1250
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.713
<v Speaker 2>It's like</v>

1251
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:30.973
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it clearly came from that </v>

1252
00:51:32.551 --> 00:51:34.650
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still don't get covered.</v>

1253
00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.910
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] what not one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's endocrine stuff too,</v>

1254
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.400
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like there's very,</v>

1255
00:51:40.401 --> 00:51:41.234
<v Speaker 2>there's like</v>

1256
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 1>how could they dispute that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it came from.</v>

1257
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Now you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1258
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:45.913
<v Speaker 1>sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to watch something and just </v>

1259
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:49.190
<v Speaker 1>play that first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

1260
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:51.740
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do you think happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1261
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.690
<v Speaker 1>But I mean if you play that video for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1262
00:51:53.691 --> 00:51:54.524
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody in the insurance business was </v>

1263
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:00.650
<v Speaker 1>denying you coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that didn't happen while you were</v>

1264
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 1>under the banner of the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're out of your fucking mind.</v>

1265
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:04.463
<v Speaker 1>Watch that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is happening while </v>

1266
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:09.920
<v Speaker 1>this fucking assassin is throwing bombs </v>
<v Speaker 1>at your face?</v>

1267
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy that that's not covered.</v>

1268
00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes me sick.</v>

1269
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's frustrating cause bye bye.</v>

1270
00:52:18.141 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Like literally you look at the papers </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it costs me more to fight then,</v>

1271
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.590
<v Speaker 2>then it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I make</v>

1272
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.553
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was dealing with a broken hand or </v>

1273
00:52:28.301 --> 00:52:30.860
<v Speaker 1>a torn ligament or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might make sense.</v>

1274
00:52:30.861 --> 00:52:31.694
<v Speaker 1>And Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does not make any fucking sense if </v>

1275
00:52:34.061 --> 00:52:34.894
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about brain injuries </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause anybody who understands how brain </v>

1276
00:52:37.511 --> 00:52:38.344
<v Speaker 1>injuries work know that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a considerable amount of time </v>

1277
00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:42.363
<v Speaker 1>after a fight where you still are </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering from symptoms and you might </v>

1278
00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:47.380
<v Speaker 1>decide 30 days later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 days later,</v>

1279
00:52:47.381 --> 00:52:49.060
<v Speaker 1>90 days later you got to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1280
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean now I know how I come out of</v>

1281
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 2>a fight and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my pinky hurts,</v>

1282
00:52:53.511 --> 00:52:55.100
<v Speaker 2>my elbow hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hair hurts,</v>

1283
00:52:55.101 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 2>my eyebrow hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when a claim all of this,</v>

1284
00:52:58.701 --> 00:53:00.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because before I was just being tough,</v>

1285
00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:02.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine with fuck it dude,</v>

1286
00:53:02.741 --> 00:53:04.700
<v Speaker 2>this is why it's so crazy and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1287
00:53:04.701 --> 00:53:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get it and I didn't know and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1288
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.823
<v Speaker 1>but they should know if they're in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the business of insuring </v>

1289
00:53:10.081 --> 00:53:10.914
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should have a larger window where </v>

1290
00:53:12.961 --> 00:53:16.140
<v Speaker 1>people can claim head injuries we talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about</v>

1291
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.253
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it kind of goes together with </v>

1292
00:53:18.581 --> 00:53:22.030
<v Speaker 2>like any kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of mental,</v>

1293
00:53:22.031 --> 00:53:23.380
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like any,</v>

1294
00:53:23.381 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 2>you talk about mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk about head injuries,</v>

1295
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 2>you talked about Tbi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all goes into that stigma of like you</v>

1296
00:53:28.531 --> 00:53:30.270
<v Speaker 2>can't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it must not be real.</v>

1297
00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:31.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

1298
00:53:31.711 --> 00:53:33.270
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1299
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:36.540
<v Speaker 2>but that's the head injury business </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

1300
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:37.374
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is to make them drop and be </v>

1301
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:40.080
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

1302
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not,</v>

1303
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:44.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not the worst thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wind with a body kick or an arm bar.</v>

1304
00:53:44.461 --> 00:53:45.294
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is what people like is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see head injuries were in the head </v>

1305
00:53:48.001 --> 00:53:49.860
<v Speaker 1>injury business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1306
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:56.750
<v Speaker 1>So how long after you starting with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment do you start to see results?</v>

1308
00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.533
<v Speaker 2>So the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say the first thing I noticed </v>

1309
00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.330
<v Speaker 2>was my motor skills in practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1310
00:54:05.331 --> 00:54:06.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go,</v>

1311
00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.690
<v Speaker 1>so you think your motor skills were </v>
<v Speaker 1>impaired?</v>

1312
00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:09.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1313
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.590
<v Speaker 2>well I just feel like I had a block.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

1314
00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was comical enemy.</v>

1315
00:54:13.691 --> 00:54:16.990
<v Speaker 2>You can even ask them at alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was funny,</v>

1316
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:21.910
<v Speaker 2>it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not to have like we're in class,</v>

1317
00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:23.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're learning,</v>

1318
00:54:23.231 --> 00:54:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching the coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they do a drill and they explain it</v>

1319
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:28.840
<v Speaker 2>and they look up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>everybody ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ready?</v>

1321
00:54:30.071 --> 00:54:30.521
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1322
00:54:30.521 --> 00:54:31.354
<v Speaker 2>three go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we clap and I have no fucking idea </v>

1323
00:54:33.341 --> 00:54:34.570
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1324
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.633
<v Speaker 2>like we walk off and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there was even a couple of times </v>

1325
00:54:38.741 --> 00:54:40.000
<v Speaker 2>where like they clap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1326

<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1328
00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:45.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three kick.</v>

1329
00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:46.660
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1330
00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:48.100
<v Speaker 2>20 pushups.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not even like,</v>

1332
00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just a bad kid like talking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1333
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.530
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm in trouble because I'm,</v>

1334
00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:55.343
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear you.</v>

1335
00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I can not lose eye contact the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1336
00:54:58.601 --> 00:55:01.960
<v Speaker 2>Like sit here and I'm like focused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1337
00:55:01.961 --> 00:55:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not retaining it and less like if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to be the last thing that they do.</v>

1338
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Like we can't talk about shit if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1339
00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.850
<v Speaker 2>if it's the last thing I see I can go do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it or I could go do it.</v>

1340
00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:14.500
<v Speaker 2>But if they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1341
00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:15.453
<v Speaker 2>and then they explained some philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it or do some movement or </v>

1342
00:55:18.551 --> 00:55:20.620
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like then I lose what we're doing.</v>

1343
00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind would just go right to something</v>

1344
00:55:22.661 --> 00:55:23.494
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a very hard time </v>

1345
00:55:24.701 --> 00:55:27.540
<v Speaker 2>concentrating and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1346
00:55:27.541 --> 00:55:29.680
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy because when I got to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>facility,</v>

1347
00:55:29.681 --> 00:55:30.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know,</v>

1348
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't necessarily know what I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking into,</v>

1349
00:55:33.191 --> 00:55:34.024
<v Speaker 2>but they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do this questionnaire and like on </v>

1350
00:55:35.741 --> 00:55:38.050
<v Speaker 2>this questionnaire is like all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1351
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:38.883
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of something like me not </v>

1352
00:55:39.731 --> 00:55:41.530
<v Speaker 2>being able to focus as part of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sleep,</v>

1353
00:55:41.531 --> 00:55:44.200
<v Speaker 2>that's part of something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This startle effect is part of something</v>

1354
00:55:44.201 --> 00:55:45.034
<v Speaker 2>like me having these like completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>like specific things that are all on </v>

1355
00:55:48.881 --> 00:55:49.714
<v Speaker 2>this was like damn okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't even want to see the eeg </v>

1356
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.160
<v Speaker 2>because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was scared.</v>

1357
00:55:54.161 --> 00:55:54.994
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1358
00:55:55.090 --> 00:55:55.923
<v Speaker 2>what if you can't fix me and now I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the shit that's wrong with me like </v>

1359
00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:59.230
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sucks.</v>

1360
00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.303
<v Speaker 2>But then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they show you different egs and they </v>

1361
00:56:02.111 --> 00:56:02.944
<v Speaker 2>show you the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they take it every single week and so </v>

1362
00:56:04.991 --> 00:56:05.824
<v Speaker 2>you actually get to see it and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see the level that you were </v>

1363
00:56:08.201 --> 00:56:09.034
<v Speaker 2>functioning at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the different parts of your </v>

1364
00:56:10.391 --> 00:56:11.224
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

1365
00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.410
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is that's awesome about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is you get to keep the results.</v>

1366
00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Like unless you go do exactly what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>did and go fuck it up again,</v>

1367
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:22.120
<v Speaker 2>you get to keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like this maintenance package,</v>

1368
00:56:22.121 --> 00:56:23.350
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1369
00:56:23.351 --> 00:56:25.900
<v Speaker 2>a problem for these pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

1370
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:26.734
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1371
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.633
<v Speaker 2>there's not a whole lot of retention on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because once people get their brains </v>

1372
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:31.774
<v Speaker 2>functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're not sitting there </v>

1373
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.410
<v Speaker 2>hitting your head against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you get to keep feeling better.</v>

1374
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these veterans get to go back to,</v>

1375
00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:39.513
<v Speaker 2>to combat or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their job is like we fighters get to go </v>

1376
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>football players get to go back.</v>

1377
00:56:44.711 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sat in with the chargers,</v>

1378
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical staff and talked about our stuff</v>

1379
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:50.230
<v Speaker 2>there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1380
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:52.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember who else there was</v>

1381
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:57.690
<v Speaker 2>people from all over the country coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>in asking about this,</v>

1382
00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:58.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1383
00:56:58.491 --> 00:56:59.670
<v Speaker 2>and needing to sit in and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1384
00:56:59.671 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 2>and they're looking at these is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>

1385
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:06.230
<v Speaker 2>So what is it doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how was it fixing it?</v>

1386
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:08.110
<v Speaker 2>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1387
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:09.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1388
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:12.970
<v Speaker 2>there's something with what goes on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain with,</v>

1389
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:16.480
<v Speaker 2>with the thyroid stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the endocrine stuff is like getting</v>

1390
00:57:16.481 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 2>your damage to your hypothalamus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1391
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:19.474
<v Speaker 2>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of directs all of the </v>

1392
00:57:23.321 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 2>information that goes to your thyroid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thyroid,</v>

1393
00:57:25.361 --> 00:57:26.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then sends out everything to your body </v>

1394
00:57:27.131 --> 00:57:29.320
<v Speaker 2>in there when there's like a disconnect </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1395
00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:30.391
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1396
00:57:30.391 --> 00:57:32.800
<v Speaker 2>it was just screws everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of it,</v>

1397
00:57:32.801 --> 00:57:36.580
<v Speaker 2>like now that we're cutting the same way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've always had to cut,</v>

1398
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.560
<v Speaker 2>but we don't get ivs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1399
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:39.483
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot 100% rehydrate your brain </v>

1400
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:44.463
<v Speaker 2>within 45 or 48 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can get your body decently </v>

1401
00:57:47.951 --> 00:57:49.000
<v Speaker 2>hydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

1402
00:57:49.001 --> 00:57:51.100
<v Speaker 2>but your brain is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's its own thing,</v>

1403
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:51.700
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1404
00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:52.533
<v Speaker 2>And so now we don't have ivs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydraulic system in our brain is down </v>

1405
00:57:55.691 --> 00:57:58.900
<v Speaker 2>and now we're rattling it even more like</v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated.</v>

1406
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to have,</v>

1407
00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:02.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger side effects,</v>

1408
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:05.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tire brains being dehydrated that now,</v>

1409
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:06.543
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the damage that comes to the </v>

1410
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:10.150
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus to the pituitary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

1411
00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:11.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thyroid,</v>

1412
00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:13.870
<v Speaker 2>all of that that goes on there like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1413
00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.090
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying that you can,</v>

1414
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:19.750
<v Speaker 2>you can get it firing back at a level </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was before it got hurt.</v>

1415
00:58:19.751 --> 00:58:20.584
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as the cells are still alive in </v>

1416
00:58:21.851 --> 00:58:24.040
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can reenergize those cells.</v>

1417
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Now if you have like just a dead party </v>
<v Speaker 2>or brain,</v>

1418
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not bringing it back to life,</v>

1419
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:29.493
<v Speaker 2>but they can um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use these magnets to kind of fluff on </v>

1420
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.050
<v Speaker 2>backup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them back their energy,</v>

1421
00:58:35.051 --> 00:58:37.810
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life and put in a,</v>

1422
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:39.183
<v Speaker 2>put them back into a functional way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was something similar to you at your </v>

1423
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:45.090
<v Speaker 2>healthiest and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make it,</v>

1424
00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean not more or less durable just </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

1425
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:48.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1426
00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

1427
00:58:49.111 --> 00:58:52.080
<v Speaker 1>when you were saying motor skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what was wrong?</v>

1428
00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's one of the things that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in fighters that have taken too many</v>

1429
00:58:55.891 --> 00:58:58.200
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start having the,</v>

1430
00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.800
<v Speaker 1>they analyze fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gates and one of the things that happens</v>

1431
00:59:01.801 --> 00:59:04.360
<v Speaker 1>is your legs get closer together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1432
00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.300
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your balance is off your,</v>

1433
00:59:06.301 --> 00:59:10.440
<v Speaker 1>your steps are shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that sort of like dynamic</v>

1434
00:59:10.441 --> 00:59:12.840
<v Speaker 1>fluid motion to your body and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a heart,</v>

1435
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:16.000
<v Speaker 1>a harder time with balance and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>motor skill.</v>

1436
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how I felt before going into there,</v>

1437
00:59:19.141 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 2>it was all I had was a gas pedal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1438
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 2>just will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1439
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:25.430
<v Speaker 2>and just fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1440
00:59:25.431 --> 00:59:26.264
<v Speaker 2>just cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't reading patterns of people </v>

1441
00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:29.984
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone leans this way a little </v>

1442
00:59:32.121 --> 00:59:32.541
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1443
00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:32.931
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1444
00:59:32.931 --> 00:59:33.764
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if they set this way or that way </v>

1445
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:38.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even meet juking them in like China,</v>

1446
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:40.660
<v Speaker 2>like faint at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1447
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:41.583
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even see the reaction I was </v>

1448
00:59:43.101 --> 00:59:43.934
<v Speaker 2>making them make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I knew what motions in my muscular </v>

1449
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:47.263
<v Speaker 2>memory to make them do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like I wasn't getting the </v>

1450
00:59:49.701 --> 00:59:51.800
<v Speaker 2>feedback because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just like wasn't,</v>

1451
00:59:52.070 --> 00:59:54.230
<v Speaker 2>so that was one of the first things I </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed was,</v>

1452
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:56.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back into practice and,</v>

1453
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 2>and watching people's angles and beating</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to it and,</v>

1454
00:59:59.661 --> 01:00:01.040
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like remembering,</v>

1455
01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:01.491
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1456
01:00:01.491 --> 01:00:02.324
<v Speaker 2>I don't just have to shoot to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can wait and do it when it's at </v>

1457
01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:09.500
<v Speaker 2>the right time or I can even like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like take advantage of,</v>

1458
01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.070
<v Speaker 2>of the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1459
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:15.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm making them step back or I can flash</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire and they're facing and jump on them</v>

1460
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:17.570
<v Speaker 2>at their knee jerk reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1461
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:18.404
<v Speaker 2>like these things of like being able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate the situation and make them </v>

1462
01:00:21.591 --> 01:00:22.424
<v Speaker 2>adjust to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I could see that again and I could </v>

1463
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you seen before?</v>

1464
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Like when I just had go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I had was good</v>

1465
01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.113
<v Speaker 1>when you didn't see movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if someone was going to spin </v>

1466
01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>and they're like reload it up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hips.</v>

1467
01:00:34.991 --> 01:00:35.771
<v Speaker 1>You didn't see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1468
01:00:35.771 --> 01:00:38.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just hit hit him first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were you seeing?</v>

1469
01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.450
<v Speaker 2>I all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

1470
01:00:39.451 --> 01:00:43.950
<v Speaker 2>all I saw was get their first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all I saw was like closed the distance.</v>

1471
01:00:43.951 --> 01:00:44.784
<v Speaker 2>Don't get hit in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like make like get down and get low and </v>

1472
01:00:48.481 --> 01:00:50.820
<v Speaker 2>just be a linebacker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1473
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.160
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hit him because I,</v>

1474
01:00:52.161 --> 01:00:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I knew I wasn't seeing that stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I tried to see it,</v>

1475
01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.330
<v Speaker 2>the more I would just sit there and wear</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1476
01:00:57.331 --> 01:00:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm like any minute now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1477
01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.050
<v Speaker 2>any minute now I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to catch the pattern,</v>

1478
01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to catch the pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't,</v>

1479
01:01:02.761 --> 01:01:04.950
<v Speaker 2>then it wasn't popping up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then all I had,</v>

1480
01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>you'd have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were just like super light sparring,</v>

1481
01:01:07.921 --> 01:01:09.540
<v Speaker 1>just moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't see it?</v>

1482
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:12.320
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1483
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.130
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1484
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1485
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.500
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1486
01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:17.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really scary.</v>

1487
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:21.170
<v Speaker 2>And like even I even get to like a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>position in Jujitsu and I'd be like,</v>

1488
01:01:21.171 --> 01:01:23.420
<v Speaker 2>I know I know stuff here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I know stuff here.</v>

1489
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.920
<v Speaker 2>But she didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

1490
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:25.671
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

1491
01:01:25.671 --> 01:01:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know stuff,</v>

1492
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.820
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like it wasn't like,</v>

1493
01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:33.260
<v Speaker 2>especially with adrenaline firing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it wasn't just happening for me.</v>

1494
01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:35.540
<v Speaker 2>And so like three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four weeks into that,</v>

1495
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:38.840
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden like that fog was </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to go down a bit.</v>

1496
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like part of it was,</v>

1497
01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:43.550
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm also sleeping better</v>

1498
01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>to goal before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like during like the first week.</v>

1499
01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.193
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause every fucking person I went to </v>

1500
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>could fix me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1501
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>And you drive in 45 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck?</v>

1502
01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1503
01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:55.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in a,</v>

1504
01:01:55.451 --> 01:01:57.310
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a car I leased.</v>

1505
01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:00.570
<v Speaker 2>So all those miles that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1506
01:02:00.571 --> 01:02:02.890
<v Speaker 2>it's like damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1507
01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.440
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was super frustrating.</v>

1508
01:02:05.441 --> 01:02:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone can fix me,</v>

1509
01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:08.680
<v Speaker 2>everyone can fix me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they don't.</v>

1510
01:02:08.681 --> 01:02:09.514
<v Speaker 2>And then my heart's broken again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I go to the next one and then my </v>

1511
01:02:11.321 --> 01:02:12.940
<v Speaker 2>heart's broken again and then it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next one.</v>

1512
01:02:12.941 --> 01:02:14.620
<v Speaker 2>So this one I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1513
01:02:14.621 --> 01:02:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even going to tell people about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because I'm sick of fucking hitting</v>

1514
01:02:18.851 --> 01:02:21.840
<v Speaker 2>up and being excited about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling them to come with me and then it</v>

1515
01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm that guy again,</v>

1516
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so going into this and then watching</v>

1517
01:02:26.011 --> 01:02:26.844
<v Speaker 2>it work and then seeing all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that was working for in there </v>

1518
01:02:29.401 --> 01:02:31.230
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were never trying to push me to</v>

1519
01:02:31.231 --> 01:02:32.700
<v Speaker 2>promote it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

1520
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:34.290
<v Speaker 2>just come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get here.</v>

1521
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.380
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you like it then till the,</v>

1522
01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:38.243
<v Speaker 2>cause the UFC was talking about getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the machines at the Pi and </v>

1523
01:02:41.581 --> 01:02:45.000
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of going to have me be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Guinea pig for it.</v>

1524
01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Ian Mccall went in there too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't like he,</v>

1525
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:48.923
<v Speaker 2>he was doing his own kind of other stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was making it so it wasn't working </v>

1526
01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:54.840
<v Speaker 2>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I was all in,</v>

1527
01:02:54.970 --> 01:02:55.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1528
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:57.250
<v Speaker 1>was making it so it wasn't working.</v>

1529
01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he was coming in often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

1530
01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.270
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is is that it does stir </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit up,</v>

1531
01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like they,</v>

1532
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:05.690
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they mess with your,</v>

1533
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:06.683
<v Speaker 2>the the levels because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to like the back of your </v>

1534
01:03:08.991 --> 01:03:11.840
<v Speaker 2>brain's running at four hertz and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and okay,</v>

1535
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:14.210
<v Speaker 2>eight is technically where like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping,</v>

1536
01:03:14.211 --> 01:03:15.044
<v Speaker 2>you're at rest like year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's part of your brains that could </v>

1537
01:03:16.431 --> 01:03:18.800
<v Speaker 2>be under your resting hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1538
01:03:18.801 --> 01:03:23.630
<v Speaker 2>While the front of your brain is running</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 12 so that's like high anxiety,</v>

1539
01:03:23.631 --> 01:03:28.310
<v Speaker 2>but like low energy and they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can almost tell you how you've been</v>

1540
01:03:28.311 --> 01:03:31.100
<v Speaker 2>feeling lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like nuts to me.</v>

1541
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could,</v>

1542
01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.530
<v Speaker 2>they can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1543
01:03:33.531 --> 01:03:34.650
<v Speaker 2>because of this and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1544
01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:35.484
<v Speaker 2>that you have some ocd tendencies versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person constantly feels like they </v>

1545
01:03:39.471 --> 01:03:40.304
<v Speaker 2>have no energy in their memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't working in their emotionally and </v>

1546
01:03:42.501 --> 01:03:45.530
<v Speaker 2>capable of like being in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1548
01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:49.400

<v Speaker 2>I believe in myself like that.</v>

1584
01:05:07.641 --> 01:05:08.474
<v Speaker 2>Like I can figure them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in find a way to not get hit </v>

1585
01:05:11.811 --> 01:05:15.110
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't get hit in my mma career,</v>

1586
01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:15.944
<v Speaker 2>significant a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not one significant significant hit and </v>

1587
01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:19.594
<v Speaker 2>tell Amanda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after that I was getting </v>

1588
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 2>fucking lit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1589
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:23.980
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not even,</v>

1590
01:05:23.981 --> 01:05:24.814
<v Speaker 2>not even Juliana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she kind of opened him bitch slap </v>

1591
01:05:26.951 --> 01:05:31.780
<v Speaker 2>me a little bit from the sides but I and</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I can find a way to,</v>

1592
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>to like still control it enough to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1593
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 2>like very effective without taking too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much damage.</v>

1594
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:40.870
<v Speaker 2>But like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that slow of my,</v>

1595
01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>my motor skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mechanics,</v>

1596
01:05:43.361 --> 01:05:44.680
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really bothering me.</v>

1597
01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:46.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's not how you go fight someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Cyborg.</v>

1598
01:05:46.931 --> 01:05:49.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't go in there with that weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your pocket.</v>

1599
01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:50.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1600
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>it's so important that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this because this is a,</v>

1601
01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.850
<v Speaker 1>this is such a factor that we don't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the outside.</v>

1602
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1603
01:05:58.991 --> 01:06:00.520
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the people that are really close to</v>

1604
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:04.060
<v Speaker 1>the talk to about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if we were seeing you fight and you</v>

1605
01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:04.894
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we see the decline of certain </v>

1606
01:06:06.521 --> 01:06:07.301
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1607
01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:08.800
<v Speaker 1>you see certain fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1608
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:12.040
<v Speaker 1>they're in a couple of really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights and then you see a decline,</v>

1609
01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:14.800
<v Speaker 1>like a real obvious decline and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills and their abilities.</v>

1610
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:16.203
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rarely are they opening up about </v>

1611
01:06:18.011 --> 01:06:20.800
<v Speaker 1>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about losing memory,</v>

1612
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:24.040
<v Speaker 1>about not being able to see patterns and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people about not,</v>

1613
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:28.210
<v Speaker 1>not having their motor skills in tune </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore that things are off.</v>

1614
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:30.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you talking about this I think is,</v>

1615
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>it's so important and it's so important </v>
<v Speaker 1>for young fighters to recognize like,</v>

1616
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is also on the table.</v>

1617
01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Like here's a great therapy for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is also a possibility of,</v>

1618
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:42.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do fight a fucking killer like </v>

1619
01:06:44.441 --> 01:06:45.274
<v Speaker 1>Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that can </v>

1620
01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:47.350
<v Speaker 1>happen to you.</v>

1621
01:06:47.350 --> 01:06:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's partially because I have man,</v>

1622
01:06:50.521 --> 01:06:51.630
<v Speaker 2>I have teammates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1623
01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:55.140
<v Speaker 2>I have people that are 10 times worse </v>
<v Speaker 2>than me that are just like,</v>

1624
01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean the stuff I hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff I see,</v>

1625
01:06:58.951 --> 01:06:59.784
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sad and it's scary and they have </v>

1626
01:07:00.961 --> 01:07:03.570
<v Speaker 2>kids and they're not going anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>

1627
01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.460
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're passing their Mris.</v>

1628
01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1629
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.220
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1630
01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.380
<v Speaker 1>their Mris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause what does the MRI really see?</v>

1631
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1632
01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:13.853
<v Speaker 1>But if they went to this place and got </v>
<v Speaker 1>all their brain mapped out and find out </v>

1633
01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:19.734
<v Speaker 1>how everything is firing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be a completely different </v>

1634
01:07:21.331 --> 01:07:22.164
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we might be retiring people way </v>

1635
01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:24.624
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least forcing them into therapy way </v>

1636
01:07:26.281 --> 01:07:28.020
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

1637
01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:29.183
<v Speaker 2>And I mean in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing is it's like the </v>

1638
01:07:31.111 --> 01:07:33.990
<v Speaker 2>risk needs to be worth the reward and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1639
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:35.063
<v Speaker 2>like right now in this sport it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>juvenile and it's not getting us like </v>

1640
01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:42.550
<v Speaker 2>this kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

1641
01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:43.423
<v Speaker 2>I can't afford to take another two years</v>
<v Speaker 2>off because I went and I fought cyborg </v>

1642
01:07:47.251 --> 01:07:49.470
<v Speaker 2>while I'm sick and something bad happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

1643
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.900
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to be sharp and if,</v>

1644
01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:52.734
<v Speaker 2>and if that means I have to take time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the time I took off off and get </v>

1645
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.740
<v Speaker 2>healthy and do all of these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapies,</v>

1646
01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:01.740
<v Speaker 2>the conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional and nontraditional,</v>

1647
01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:04.560
<v Speaker 2>like all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I can feel the way I feel now and</v>

1648
01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:07.140
<v Speaker 2>the like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pumped and I'm excited.</v>

1649
01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:08.183
<v Speaker 2>But like that is something that I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to know that people know they can </v>

1650
01:08:13.411 --> 01:08:14.190
<v Speaker 2>go do.</v>

1651
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:17.120
<v Speaker 2>And it's not vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not saying you're weak,</v>

1652
01:08:17.121 --> 01:08:18.850
<v Speaker 2>it's not something wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1653
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 2>like it's your health and your longevity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your future because that shit,</v>

1654
01:08:23.811 --> 01:08:26.300
<v Speaker 2>if you don't treat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get better.</v>

1655
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 2>And like you don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

1656
01:08:28.611 --> 01:08:29.444
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's an identity that goes away </v>

1657
01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:35.330
<v Speaker 2>with the seeming like you failed or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do it anymore or whatever.</v>

1658
01:08:35.331 --> 01:08:36.164
<v Speaker 2>Like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mental health aspect that comes </v>

1659
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:38.954
<v Speaker 2>with the physical health of your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that all that all needs to all </v>

1660
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.610
<v Speaker 2>needs to be more educated as far as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as these fighters go.</v>

1661
01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:47.720
<v Speaker 2>As far as all of it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1662
01:08:47.721 --> 01:08:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to be the Guinea pig because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm damn,</v>

1663
01:08:50.511 --> 01:08:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I just want to see everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1664
01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:52.874
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1665
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy that you're talking about it,</v>

1666
01:08:54.931 --> 01:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1667
01:08:56.610 --> 01:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>it's been something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1668
01:08:58.321 --> 01:09:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about quite a bit and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1669
01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:03.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real problems behind traumatic brain</v>

1670
01:09:03.571 --> 01:09:04.404
<v Speaker 1>injuries because I've had a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts and I've talked to a bunch of </v>

1671
01:09:06.901 --> 01:09:07.734
<v Speaker 1>neurologists and I've talked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists and people that are </v>

1672
01:09:10.650 --> 01:09:15.650
<v Speaker 1>really studying this stuff and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been real vocal about it and it's,</v>

1673
01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky situation because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I'm a commentator,</v>

1674
01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.393
<v Speaker 1>but like when someone gets knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very vocal about them taking a long </v>

1675
01:09:24.271 --> 01:09:25.104
<v Speaker 1>time off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was one of the things that </v>

1676
01:09:26.341 --> 01:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>happened after Rhonda got knocked out by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holly.</v>

1677
01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about getting her back</v>

1678
01:09:31.351 --> 01:09:32.184
<v Speaker 1>within like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like four or five months later </v>

1679
01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:35.100
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight again.</v>

1680
01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:35.963
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to have a rematch with </v>

1681
01:09:37.111 --> 01:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>holly and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are fucking crazy.</v>

1682
01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're crazy.</v>

1683
01:09:41.401 --> 01:09:44.280
<v Speaker 1>She shouldn't be doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She shouldn't be getting hit.</v>

1684
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>She shouldn't it be sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1685
01:09:46.471 --> 01:09:47.304
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she shouldn't be getting her head </v>

1686
01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:48.834
<v Speaker 1>rattled and she definitely shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting holly fucking home who just </v>

1687
01:09:51.841 --> 01:09:52.674
<v Speaker 1>kicked her into another dimension five </v>
<v Speaker 1>months later or whatever it was six </v>

1688
01:09:55.831 --> 01:09:56.491
<v Speaker 1>months later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1689
01:09:56.491 --> 01:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>there's no way this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should not be happening.</v>

1690
01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even know what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

1691
01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what kind of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1692
01:10:03.421 --> 01:10:04.254
<v Speaker 1>think of what happened with you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda did you stayed conscious at </v>

1693
01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:07.470
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1694
01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda got fucking flat lined and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>got hammer fist.</v>

1695
01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.270
<v Speaker 1>It didn't the head while she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>flatlined.</v>

1696
01:10:13.370 --> 01:10:14.010
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1697
01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:16.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the most brutal knockouts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's mma ever.</v>

1698
01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:18.563
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you saw when she came back and </v>

1699
01:10:21.241 --> 01:10:24.570
<v Speaker 1>fought Amanda and got hit like right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

1700
01:10:24.571 --> 01:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>that hesitation.</v>

1701
01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just stiff and up and the fear.</v>

1702
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>And then also Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt even before the Holly Holm fight,</v>

1703
01:10:33.841 --> 01:10:34.674
<v Speaker 1>I felt like Amanda was the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous fight for her because of her </v>

1704
01:10:37.471 --> 01:10:38.304
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Rhonda is always in this </v>

1705
01:10:40.261 --> 01:10:41.094
<v Speaker 1>position where she's closing the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's getting close to you because she </v>

1706
01:10:43.171 --> 01:10:44.004
<v Speaker 1>wants to clinch up with you and throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and take you to the ground and arm </v>

1707
01:10:46.531 --> 01:10:48.600
<v Speaker 1>bar you and what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But with Amanda,</v>

1708
01:10:48.601 --> 01:10:49.434
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a Brazilian Jiu </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jitsu black belt who knocks people </v>

1709
01:10:52.231 --> 01:10:55.560
<v Speaker 1>fucking dead with one punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a terrible match up.</v>

1710
01:10:55.561 --> 01:10:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and obviously that proved to be true,</v>

1711
01:10:59.371 --> 01:11:00.204
<v Speaker 1>but what drove me crazy was how </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismissive all these people behind the </v>

1712
01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:04.884
<v Speaker 1>scenes where all these agents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood people and all these people </v>

1713
01:11:08.161 --> 01:11:11.880
<v Speaker 1>that just have no idea what business </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in,</v>

1714
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 1>they really don't even this business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business,</v>

1715
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:16.740
<v Speaker 1>it's basically the business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we said,</v>

1716
01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.753
<v Speaker 1>of head injuries and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to sell this thing where </v>

1717
01:11:22.561 --> 01:11:23.394
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with someone who had a </v>

1718
01:11:24.061 --> 01:11:28.050
<v Speaker 1>fucking significant head injury and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pushing it back in.</v>

1719
01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:32.130
<v Speaker 1>There was someone who's really good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivering head injuries and is this,</v>

1720
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:35.220
<v Speaker 1>is this really all been mapped out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1721
01:11:35.221 --> 01:11:38.040
<v Speaker 1>what kind of training have has changed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what you,</v>

1722
01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 1>she's still with the same coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has she done anything differently?</v>

1723
01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

1724
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.790
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what result is going to be different,</v>

1725
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:46.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the downplaying of the significance </v>

1726
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:50.303
<v Speaker 1>of a fucking ruthless knock out like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I just don't think can be </v>

1727
01:11:52.711 --> 01:11:53.544
<v Speaker 1>understated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people should take a long time </v>

1728
01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 1>off when they get knocked out like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>

1729
01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1730
01:12:00.071 --> 01:12:00.904
<v Speaker 2>and I mean especially some sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>invasive treatment like from out the </v>

1731
01:12:06.011 --> 01:12:09.620
<v Speaker 2>gates for something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You studied and I mean,</v>

1732
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:10.623
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know they put a flashlight in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your eyes and ask you if you okay send </v>

1733
01:12:12.911 --> 01:12:13.990
<v Speaker 2>you to the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever.</v>

1734
01:12:13.991 --> 01:12:15.290
<v Speaker 2>But I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1735
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.490
<v Speaker 2>and I think honestly that's what the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like effort was in,</v>

1736
01:12:18.491 --> 01:12:19.324
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it and offering this information of </v>

1737
01:12:23.201 --> 01:12:25.270
<v Speaker 2>this treatment to me was to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1738
01:12:25.271 --> 01:12:28.000
<v Speaker 2>is this something that would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would benefit fighters in,</v>

1739
01:12:28.001 --> 01:12:29.920
<v Speaker 2>in a situation like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's at the Pie.</v>

1740
01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:32.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not at the Pii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they were saying is it would be</v>

1741
01:12:32.351 --> 01:12:33.850
<v Speaker 2>at the Pi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1742
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.673
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the trick with it is that it is </v>

1743
01:12:37.931 --> 01:12:39.580
<v Speaker 2>something you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to go to.</v>

1744
01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I need you to go to twice a day and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like schedule of it in that routine</v>

1745
01:12:44.771 --> 01:12:48.430
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But US says fighters like flying to only</v>

1746
01:12:48.431 --> 01:12:52.060
<v Speaker 2>vegas for it and paying our own room and</v>
<v Speaker 2>board are own flight,</v>

1747
01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:54.880
<v Speaker 2>potentially having to fly our coaches </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to have to,</v>

1748
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep us working and doing whatever while</v>

1749
01:12:57.641 --> 01:12:58.960
<v Speaker 2>we're working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just an,</v>

1750
01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1751
01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tricky business.</v>

1752
01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:04.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1753
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:05.990
<v Speaker 1>it's real tricky business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how old are you now?</v>

1754
01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:06.973
<v Speaker 1>35.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you wonder how much longer are you </v>

1755
01:13:08.781 --> 01:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>going to do this?</v>

1756
01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.900
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1757
01:13:10.901 --> 01:13:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I got like a good couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>years left.</v>

1758
01:13:13.091 --> 01:13:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still having fun,</v>

1759
01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:15.933
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like the chest of it is still fun </v>

1760
01:13:17.291 --> 01:13:21.250
<v Speaker 2>and like the training is still fun and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still learning and like enjoying it.</v>

1761
01:13:21.251 --> 01:13:23.230
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1762
01:13:23.231 --> 01:13:24.064
<v Speaker 2>like getting through everything that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting through and learning everything </v>

1763
01:13:26.771 --> 01:13:29.530
<v Speaker 2>that I'm learning is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so inspiring to me.</v>

1764
01:13:29.531 --> 01:13:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't feel done.</v>

1765
01:13:31.151 --> 01:13:31.984
<v Speaker 2>Like I still have so much fight in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart and like I really love putting my </v>

1766
01:13:35.381 --> 01:13:36.214
<v Speaker 2>hands on people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in always like advancing and improving </v>

1767
01:13:39.961 --> 01:13:42.070
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the day I stopped improving,</v>

1768
01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:43.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1769
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:46.030
<v Speaker 2>then I can look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But right now,</v>

1770
01:13:46.031 --> 01:13:46.864
<v Speaker 2>like I don't care about plan B,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about what's next because </v>

1771
01:13:48.671 --> 01:13:51.460
<v Speaker 2>that's not what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your passion for doing it,</v>

1772
01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:52.210
<v Speaker 2>it's still there.</v>

1773
01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the purpose,</v>

1774
01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:55.570
<v Speaker 2>there's the passion is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is huge.</v>

1775
01:13:55.571 --> 01:13:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I love the passion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1776
01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.680
<v Speaker 2>that to me is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the purpose,</v>

1777
01:13:59.681 --> 01:14:01.270
<v Speaker 2>like the bigger picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1778
01:14:01.271 --> 01:14:04.270
<v Speaker 2>the what I'm doing here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was born to do,</v>

1779
01:14:04.271 --> 01:14:07.870
<v Speaker 2>what I was born to get through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I have to get through this,</v>

1780
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:11.080
<v Speaker 2>like I want to get through this and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting through this.</v>

1781
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:14.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching myself and that is like,</v>

1782
01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:17.800
<v Speaker 2>it's bad ass to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting to me.</v>

1783
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:18.610
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1784
01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:20.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what I'm doing here,</v>

1785
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I am,</v>

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:30.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm all in like in and I can make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just make things for myself that,</v>

1787
01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:31.923
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to show myself every single day </v>

1788
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.430
<v Speaker 2>that like no one could have ever told </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1789
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all stuff that I know firsthand </v>

1790
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.840
<v Speaker 2>from my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my world,</v>

1791
01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 2>from me trying things from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>risking things like all of that and,</v>

1792
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:45.963
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand myself and to know myself </v>

1793
01:14:50.081 --> 01:14:53.230
<v Speaker 2>like it's been the biggest reward out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this.</v>

1794
01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Know yourself through the struggles and </v>
<v Speaker 2>know yourself through the fights.</v>

1795
01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:58.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

1796
01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even how much you get to learn,</v>

1797
01:15:01.211 --> 01:15:02.740
<v Speaker 2>just even going into a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1798
01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Like realizing so going into a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being on antidepressants like,</v>

1799
01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:07.871
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll wake up,</v>

1800
01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what this will do.</v>

1801
01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:11.620
<v Speaker 2>I feel flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel flat.</v>

1802
01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:13.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll be okay with these people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be,</v>

1803
01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:15.370
<v Speaker 2>I won't be okay with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people here,</v>

1804
01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:16.204
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all of that is very clear about </v>

1805
01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.253
<v Speaker 2>things that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has my attention whether I know it </v>

1806
01:15:23.411 --> 01:15:24.244
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's something in my life that </v>

1807
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.823
<v Speaker 2>needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to be looked at and needs to be </v>

1808
01:15:27.971 --> 01:15:28.631
<v Speaker 2>addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1809
01:15:28.631 --> 01:15:29.464
<v Speaker 2>There's direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all I ever want is understanding </v>

1810
01:15:32.531 --> 01:15:34.120
<v Speaker 2>and direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just want to know,</v>

1811
01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:35.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1812
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:37.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to deal with that,</v>

1813
01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:39.610
<v Speaker 2>that that leads me to come to San Diego.</v>

1814
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:40.443
<v Speaker 2>San Diego is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a new chapter in my life that I get </v>

1815
01:15:42.131 --> 01:15:43.600
<v Speaker 2>to name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1816
01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:46.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also for my kid and myself.</v>

1817
01:15:46.361 --> 01:15:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1818
01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:50.020
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a reveal so much to myself through</v>

1819
01:15:50.021 --> 01:15:50.854
<v Speaker 2>trying different things and to just kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like letting life take me down the </v>

1820
01:15:54.491 --> 01:15:59.110
<v Speaker 2>path that I'm supposed to without me </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting here freaking out about control,</v>

1821
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 2>freaking out about things that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do nothing about.</v>

1822
01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:03.873
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to walk away from all of </v>

1823
01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:10.990
<v Speaker 2>this like content and happy with how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1824
01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Whether that means I never have my hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised again.</v>

1825
01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I beating these girls,</v>

1826
01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:20.710
<v Speaker 2>having the belt that is not a pipe </v>
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>

1827
01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.270
<v Speaker 2>I already beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1828
01:16:22.271 --> 01:16:23.104
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I'm incapable of that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just wishing I got my fingers </v>

1829
01:16:26.201 --> 01:16:26.891
<v Speaker 2>crossed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1830
01:16:26.891 --> 01:16:27.724
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that my whole journey of my </v>

1831
01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:33.790
<v Speaker 2>life in sports from being a kid was to </v>
<v Speaker 2>meet my highest,</v>

1832
01:16:33.791 --> 01:16:35.770
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be my highest good.</v>

1833
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.903
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is what's driven me the whole </v>

1834
01:16:40.331 --> 01:16:43.960
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at these girls and I respect them</v>

1835
01:16:43.961 --> 01:16:45.970
<v Speaker 2>because they're here doing what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

1836
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:48.790
<v Speaker 2>We're all just out here trying to be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best at it.</v>

1837
01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:50.830
<v Speaker 2>We're all trying to participate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all trying to,</v>

1838
01:16:51.210 --> 01:16:52.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find ourselves in it and learn what we </v>

1839
01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:55.090
<v Speaker 2>can learn and go implement it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1840
01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:56.080
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so for that,</v>

1841
01:16:56.081 --> 01:16:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I have respect for every single one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1842
01:16:57.671 --> 01:17:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Some of them I like less than others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are like more than others,</v>

1843
01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:02.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really like we're building this stage </v>

1845
01:17:05.441 --> 01:17:07.030
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this together,</v>

1846

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I would never have learned them any </v>

1856
01:17:36.111 --> 01:17:38.000
<v Speaker 3>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I get to handle them.</v>

1857

<v Speaker 3>like relate and understand people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see things differently because I get it,</v>

1859
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:50.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe not exactly word for word pinpoint</v>

1860
01:17:50.691 --> 01:17:52.490
<v Speaker 3>per pinpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>going to make me fall over.</v>

01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:57.524
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1892
01:18:59.811 --> 01:19:00.644
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not looking towards what's next </v>

1893
01:19:02.451 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 3>because right now I'm here.</v>

1894
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:05.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1895
01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:05.864
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you want to hear from </v>

1896
01:19:06.591 --> 01:19:08.150
<v Speaker 1>someone who's fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1897
01:19:08.151 --> 01:19:11.840
<v Speaker 1>fighting should be all in that study is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way to approach it.</v>

1898
01:19:11.841 --> 01:19:15.320
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fighter and you're also a </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurosurgeon and a part time real estate</v>

1899
01:19:15.321 --> 01:19:17.200
<v Speaker 1>salesman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good fucking luck.</v>

1900
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:21.040
<v Speaker 3>You don't have 100% to give everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got one,</v>

1901
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.890
<v Speaker 3>100%.</v>

1902
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.963
<v Speaker 1>Especially with something like fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just such a crazy way to make </v>

1903
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.823
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really have to be 100% committed to </v>

1904
01:19:29.001 --> 01:19:30.170
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be your life.</v>

1905
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1906
01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:36.300
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1907
01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.720
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like everything I'm doing right now,</v>

1908
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:41.670
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like all of that will be part</v>

1909
01:19:41.671 --> 01:19:42.504
<v Speaker 3>of what's next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I like that that'll manifest that </v>

1910
01:19:44.941 --> 01:19:48.060
<v Speaker 3>it'll figure itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not to,</v>

1911
01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:49.590
<v Speaker 3>not the like hippy way of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1912
01:19:49.591 --> 01:19:50.790
<v Speaker 3>everything will be great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1913
01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Like when it's time I'll look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1914
01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.110
<v Speaker 3>But right now this is what I'm looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>

1915
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:56.203
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of drive and discipline and </v>

1916
01:19:57.921 --> 01:19:58.754
<v Speaker 1>work ethic that you showed to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>top level MMA fighter and a national </v>

1917
01:20:02.151 --> 01:20:02.984
<v Speaker 1>champion in wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do anything with that and </v>

1918
01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.860
<v Speaker 1>whatever you set your mind to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>

1919
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:08.694
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest problem that </v>

1920
01:20:09.331 --> 01:20:14.100
<v Speaker 1>fighters have when they retire is </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding a thing to put their energy too.</v>

1921
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:14.934
<v Speaker 1>And then their identity because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity is of a fighter and when that </v>

1922
01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.660
<v Speaker 1>is taken away from them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that.</v>

1923
01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:24.270
<v Speaker 1>And also the thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

1924
01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:29.280
<v Speaker 1>you guys are experiencing a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement and intensity.</v>

1925
01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're talking about two weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1926
01:20:32.191 --> 01:20:33.960
<v Speaker 1>you're crying in the fetal position and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

1927
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:34.794
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that all builds up to these moments </v>

1928
01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:43.410
<v Speaker 1>like that crazy primal scream after you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped Amanda Nunez.</v>

1929
01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.433
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a experience that very few </v>
<v Speaker 1>people other than people fight to the </v>

1930
01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 1>death are feeling.</v>

1931
01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:51.480
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something,</v>

1932
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.613
<v Speaker 1>there's something that you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing that unless you're the </v>

1933
01:20:56.161 --> 01:20:58.200
<v Speaker 1>person in the woods fighting over that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bone,</v>

1934
01:20:58.350 --> 01:21:00.270
<v Speaker 1>you really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1935
01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:03.690
<v Speaker 1>And then for you to go to regular life </v>
<v Speaker 1>after that,</v>

1936
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:07.380
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be hard and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be hard for a lot of fighters.</v>

1937
01:21:07.381 --> 01:21:08.214
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for a lot of </v>

1938
01:21:09.151 --> 01:21:12.960
<v Speaker 1>fighters to find another thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>excites them.</v>

1939
01:21:12.961 --> 01:21:17.010
<v Speaker 1>The way finding excites them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a crazy pursuit.</v>

1940
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.473
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with what you're dealing </v>

1941
01:21:20.491 --> 01:21:22.290
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're dealing with it publicly.</v>

1942
01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:23.940
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a,</v>

1943
01:21:23.941 --> 01:21:24.774
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a great service to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody when you talking about your </v>

1944
01:21:27.211 --> 01:21:28.044
<v Speaker 1>problems and your issues because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many fighters that you know that </v>

1945
01:21:31.051 --> 01:21:33.630
<v Speaker 1>you're experiencing this and that I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are experiencing this.</v>

1946
01:21:33.631 --> 01:21:34.464
<v Speaker 1>And you know everybody who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's done any sort of martial </v>

1947
01:21:38.941 --> 01:21:42.900
<v Speaker 1>arts competition and been in gyms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see people that have,</v>

1948
01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:46.080
<v Speaker 1>that have taken too many shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just part of the game.</v>

1949
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:47.880
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1950
01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.240
<v Speaker 1>it's what you're doing by talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it so openly.</v>

1951
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:54.690
<v Speaker 1>While you're still a top level fighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>is I think,</v>

1952
01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:56.280
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important for everybody.</v>

1953
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:57.703
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

1954
01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying man.</v>

1955
01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.520
<v Speaker 2>It's been a lot of trying things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do,</v>

1956
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I do feel value in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1957
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:09.590
<v Speaker 2>and I mean exactly when people are done </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1958
01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some pride in,</v>

1959
01:22:11.331 --> 01:22:13.910
<v Speaker 2>in having to go get a nine to five or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1960
01:22:13.911 --> 01:22:15.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after being a,</v>

1961
01:22:15.011 --> 01:22:18.170
<v Speaker 2>a level of fighter at this level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind you should,</v>

1962
01:22:18.171 --> 01:22:20.930
<v Speaker 2>you not have the fucking brain cells to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in life.</v>

1963
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.943
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I got high functioning thing that </v>

1964
01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:24.950
<v Speaker 2>you can be proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1965
01:22:24.951 --> 01:22:25.784
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be really stressful to not live </v>

1966
01:22:28.251 --> 01:22:30.350
<v Speaker 2>up to the capability that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1967
01:22:30.351 --> 01:22:31.184
<v Speaker 2>you have what you're just not like </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that wall or that fog or </v>

1968
01:22:33.051 --> 01:22:33.681
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1969
01:22:33.681 --> 01:22:34.514
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think people maintaining </v>

1970
01:22:36.471 --> 01:22:38.240
<v Speaker 2>themselves and doing everything they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

1971
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:40.760
<v Speaker 2>however vulnerable it feels like fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1972
01:22:40.761 --> 01:22:41.594
<v Speaker 2>Do it like</v>

1973
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:44.830
<v Speaker 1>both that they could spread this therapy</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the country.</v>

1974
01:22:44.831 --> 01:22:45.610
<v Speaker 1>And how big are these?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1975
01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:47.500
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1976
01:22:47.501 --> 01:22:48.760
<v Speaker 2>they look like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

1977
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:50.350
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1978
01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.810
<v Speaker 2>like mobile units.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1979
01:22:52.811 --> 01:22:53.644
<v Speaker 2>like it would need to be on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's on some sort of </v>

1980
01:22:55.751 --> 01:22:58.720
<v Speaker 2>route or whatever that people would need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to show up to or what.</v>

1981
01:22:58.721 --> 01:23:00.790
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1982
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.863
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1983
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:03.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1984
01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:03.973
<v Speaker 2>I know they have one in Indiana know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they're going to have one in </v>

1985
01:23:06.971 --> 01:23:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Colorado soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think relative to the training center.</v>

1986
01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:10.643
<v Speaker 1>And when you say mobile units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how big are these mobile units and </v>

1987
01:23:13.051 --> 01:23:14.960
<v Speaker 1>are they as effective as the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going?</v>

1988
01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a creeper van.</v>

1989
01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:17.523
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a little dish of candy in </v>

1990
01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:23:21.851 --> 01:23:23.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like you get in and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1992
01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:25.660
<v Speaker 2>it's the same exact chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1993
01:23:25.661 --> 01:23:27.870
<v Speaker 2>and then they have their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trained,</v>

1994
01:23:27.871 --> 01:23:29.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1995
01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.940
<v Speaker 2>nurse nowhere to put it on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1996
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.800
<v Speaker 2>and then even the Eeg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1997
01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:34.900
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a wireless eeg,</v>

1998
01:23:34.901 --> 01:23:38.260
<v Speaker 2>so I know that every week they make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do the eeg,</v>

1999
01:23:38.261 --> 01:23:41.410
<v Speaker 2>like same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a relatively the same time,</v>

2000
01:23:41.411 --> 01:23:42.244
<v Speaker 2>so they can keep good track of what your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain is doing and how to prescribe the </v>

2001
01:23:45.761 --> 01:23:48.700
<v Speaker 2>levels to be at what on your head.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have one in Arizona.</v>

2003
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.450
<v Speaker 2>I know there's one in Texas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jim could get and how is it </v>

2009

<v Speaker 2>Josh Ford.</v>

2192
01:31:19.490 --> 01:31:20.323
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen him before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got like a tattoo goatee on his </v>

2193
01:31:21.891 --> 01:31:22.724
<v Speaker 2>face?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2194
01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.990
<v Speaker 2>he's been doing my nutrition and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2195
01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:28.670
<v Speaker 2>he's known me since all I did was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

2196
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:30.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's been around,</v>

2197
01:31:30.261 --> 01:31:31.094
<v Speaker 2>he knows my style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows me as a crazy fighter and all </v>

2198
01:31:33.501 --> 01:31:37.190
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So between Lauren and Lauren,</v>

2199
01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Lando and Josh Ford there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're putting it together based off of</v>

2200
01:31:39.981 --> 01:31:41.570
<v Speaker 2>what they've seen out of me in the past.</v>

2201
01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:42.473
<v Speaker 1>But if you're going to Jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a lot of Jujitsu training </v>

2202
01:31:44.641 --> 01:31:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and then you're going to Moitai doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muay Thai training,</v>

2203
01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:50.190
<v Speaker 1>when do you get together and do mma </v>
<v Speaker 1>training?</v>

2204
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2205
01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:54.240
<v Speaker 2>That'll be the sparring days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there'll be a light sparse,</v>

2206
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:56.340
<v Speaker 2>like kinda drill day in the middle in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there too.</v>

2207
01:31:56.440 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 1>So are you sparring Moy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tai and sparring mma?</v>

2208
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:01.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be swearing mme.</v>

2209
01:32:01.770 --> 01:32:04.270
<v Speaker 3>So that'll be where I mixed together the</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

2210
01:32:04.271 --> 01:32:05.104
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of how I like it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I like doing the disciplines </v>

2211
01:32:07.291 --> 01:32:08.124
<v Speaker 3>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then and then me finding where to </v>

2212
01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:11.854
<v Speaker 3>put them in in a lot of times that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>where my freestyle wrestling just ties </v>

2213
01:32:14.231 --> 01:32:14.870
<v Speaker 3>it all together.</v>

2214
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:18.230
<v Speaker 1>So you're more Thai training would </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically just be technique drills,</v>

2215
01:32:18.330 --> 01:32:22.610
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] a Ninja moves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that and your moves.</v>

2216
01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:25.850
<v Speaker 3>And then Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going gear?</v>

2217
01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:26.703
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay.</v>

2218
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:30.890
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know beef or I did g for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the past four weeks and yeah,</v>

2219
01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.460
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit hurts your feelings.</v>

2220
01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:38.460
<v Speaker 3>But then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's more practical to do the,</v>

2221
01:32:38.530 --> 01:32:41.280
<v Speaker 3>to do the Nogi and now they took the g </v>
<v Speaker 3>off of me and me.</v>

2222
01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a thousand miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so happy with myself.</v>

2223
01:32:44.011 --> 01:32:45.000
<v Speaker 3>Slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2224
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Can I grab my shirt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what about wrestling?</v>

2225
01:32:49.271 --> 01:32:50.104
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing any rustling?</v>

2226
01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:52.180
<v Speaker 3>That part?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2227
01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:53.213
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still got to figure out down in San </v>

2228
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Diego I want a freestyle wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like,</v>

2229
01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:01.090
<v Speaker 3>I got a great shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at shots and whatever,</v>

2230
01:33:01.091 --> 01:33:03.820
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm way more about throws.</v>

2231
01:33:03.821 --> 01:33:07.010
<v Speaker 3>Like I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much more efficient from,</v>

2232
01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:09.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got awesome hips for him and it's just</v>

2233
01:33:09.821 --> 01:33:11.110
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2234
01:33:11.111 --> 01:33:12.760
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're high risk,</v>

2235
01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:14.440
<v Speaker 3>high reward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's my funky style.</v>

2236
01:33:14.441 --> 01:33:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Like I just get them done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2237
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:16.833
<v Speaker 3>And it's so much less effort when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>taught someone over their head on the </v>

2238
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:21.250
<v Speaker 3>ground and they don't know where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are for a minute.</v>

2239
01:33:21.251 --> 01:33:22.084
<v Speaker 3>There's so much to capitalize on there </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the equilibrium just off and like </v>

2240
01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:26.440
<v Speaker 3>those are things I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I count on,</v>

2241
01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:27.453
<v Speaker 3>so I need to find that freestyle </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation yet I have good freestyle </v>

2242
01:33:31.451 --> 01:33:33.190
<v Speaker 3>wrestling myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but obviously like,</v>

2243
01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.680
<v Speaker 3>like it's good to stay on top of those.</v>

2244
01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Like it's my strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I need to keep my strength strong.</v>

2245
01:33:38.801 --> 01:33:41.560
<v Speaker 3>So I'm looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make that happen.</v>

2246
01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:42.633
<v Speaker 3>So what do you walk around that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now I'm like one 55 when 56 72 45 </v>

2247
01:33:48.851 --> 01:33:50.590
<v Speaker 3>is a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2248
01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:51.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2249
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've wanted to go there as well.</v>

2250
01:33:53.441 --> 01:33:54.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2251
01:33:54.071 --> 01:33:57.970
<v Speaker 3>not having that fluid on our brains when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we fight kind of bugs me.</v>

2252
01:33:57.971 --> 01:34:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Like if I can walk down at one 45 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat breakfast,</v>

2253
01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:01.624
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2254
01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:02.523

2258
01:34:10.631 --> 01:34:12.910

<v Speaker 1>winter,</v>

2259
01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:15.520
<v Speaker 1>which didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't even a weight class for one</v>

2260
01:34:15.521 --> 01:34:16.410
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>doing with her or they were trying to </v>

2262
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:23.440
<v Speaker 1>prime her for one 35 or seeing if she </v>
<v Speaker 1>could make one 35.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she really,</v>

2291
01:35:27.701 --> 01:35:32.530
<v Speaker 1>she probably be fighting one 65 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there there's a 55 you know,</v>

2294
01:35:34.570 --> 01:35:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2295

<v Speaker 1>there's only so many 40 fives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2296
01:35:38.171 --> 01:35:39.004
<v Speaker 1>she's obviously got the belt at 45 but I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think even 45 is a brutal struggle for </v>

2297
01:35:42.401 --> 01:35:44.170
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:47.200
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could only do that so many times.</v>

2299
01:35:47.201 --> 01:35:50.110
<v Speaker 1>It's taking a little bit of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you do that,</v>

2300
01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're chipping away at Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2302
01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.413
<v Speaker 2>And I just remember like I remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming into mma and like I used to cut </v>

2303
01:35:57.481 --> 01:36:01.010
<v Speaker 2>to one 25 like dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying and that,</v>

2304
01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.033
<v Speaker 2>so I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be ranked number one at one </v>

2305
01:36:04.861 --> 01:36:07.530
<v Speaker 2>25 that it was my goal before I moved up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like I,</v>

2306
01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.720
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was ranked number one,</v>

2307
01:36:09.721 --> 01:36:10.554
<v Speaker 2>their beat everybody I can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it was just kind of like the </v>

2308
01:36:12.781 --> 01:36:15.450
<v Speaker 2>last time I made one 25 I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2309
01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:16.293
<v Speaker 2>I fought a girl named to k Ohashi from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan and I remember it was like last </v>

2310
01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:22.553
<v Speaker 2>minute cause I suppose to fight a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something happened to her and then they </v>

2311
01:36:24.421 --> 01:36:25.254
<v Speaker 2>replaced her with Tko and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember being so happy that we were at </v>

2312
01:36:29.641 --> 01:36:34.270
<v Speaker 2>altitude because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I had a heat stroke at the,</v>

2313
01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.273
<v Speaker 2>the water cut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the bathtub cut because I was in </v>

2314
01:36:37.411 --> 01:36:42.411
<v Speaker 2>the water for like 20 minutes and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember at 10 minutes I was like,</v>

2315
01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:43.650
<v Speaker 2>something's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something's wrong,</v>

2316
01:36:43.651 --> 01:36:44.100
<v Speaker 2>something's wrong.</v>

2317
01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:45.150
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to stay,</v>

2318
01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you have to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the 20 minute line,</v>

2319
01:36:48.361 --> 01:36:49.194
<v Speaker 2>I like dove like a salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like out of the water and I passed out </v>

2320
01:36:52.741 --> 01:36:57.210
<v Speaker 2>on my floor and they gave no shits that </v>
<v Speaker 2>my managers there and I'm naked and like</v>

2321
01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2322
01:36:58.771 --> 01:37:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm out to the point where they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the knuckle rub on my sternum,</v>

2323
01:37:02.071 --> 01:37:02.904
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to get me up and then I'd rub on </v>

2324
01:37:05.821 --> 01:37:06.571
<v Speaker 2>your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2325
01:37:06.571 --> 01:37:08.720
<v Speaker 2>trying to wake you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they wake you up.</v>

2326
01:37:08.721 --> 01:37:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like in your sternum.</v>

2327
01:37:09.870 --> 01:37:10.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like something with the </v>

2328
01:37:11.191 --> 01:37:13.270
<v Speaker 2>nerves hero like hit your adrenaline </v>
<v Speaker 2>awake.</v>

2329
01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.980
<v Speaker 2>She was crisis so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm up and I'm like,</v>

2330
01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:17.873
<v Speaker 2>you know your hands and arms are </v>
<v Speaker 2>tingling and everything cause you're </v>

2331
01:37:19.591 --> 01:37:20.670
<v Speaker 2>like waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2332
01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:21.893
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get back in that </v>

2333
01:37:22.921 --> 01:37:23.490
<v Speaker 2>bathtub.</v>

2334
01:37:23.490 --> 01:37:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Like put the sauna suit on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like put it on me.</v>

2335
01:37:26.401 --> 01:37:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2336
01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:31.320
<v Speaker 2>so not that that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean health wise I was not okay,</v>

2337
01:37:31.321 --> 01:37:32.970
<v Speaker 2>but it was like I'm not getting back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2338
01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:37.260
<v Speaker 2>So they put this on a suit on me and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands are like freaking out,</v>

2339
01:37:37.261 --> 01:37:42.261
<v Speaker 2>like doing this weird shaky like t rex </v>
<v Speaker 2>arm thing and cramping so bad in my feet</v>

2340
01:37:43.381 --> 01:37:44.970
<v Speaker 2>were doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was like,</v>

2341
01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:46.163
<v Speaker 2>like they had to cover me in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blankets and put all of the stuff on me </v>

2342
01:37:48.991 --> 01:37:49.824
<v Speaker 2>to keep me hot cause I was not getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in that hot tub or the bathtub is </v>

2343
01:37:53.461 --> 01:37:55.140
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after that,</v>

2344
01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:57.420
<v Speaker 2>like I remember I felt it in the fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

2345
01:37:57.421 --> 01:38:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad we're at altitude cause I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel horrible.</v>

2346
01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I went up to 35.</v>

2347
01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2348
01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It is the worst part of fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

2349
01:38:08.951 --> 01:38:11.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so unnecessary.</v>

2350
01:38:11.290 --> 01:38:12.130
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2351
01:38:12.131 --> 01:38:14.290
<v Speaker 1>what one FC is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got some,</v>

2352
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:15.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2353
01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:18.190
<v Speaker 1>they're eliminating weight cuts by doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydration tests and,</v>

2354
01:38:18.250 --> 01:38:20.860
<v Speaker 1>and testing people several times during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the camp,</v>

2355
01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:24.220
<v Speaker 1>finding out what your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out what your actual weight is.</v>

2356
01:38:24.221 --> 01:38:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And Ben ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went into uh,</v>

2357
01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.333
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2358
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:31.090
<v Speaker 1>the way they're doing it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in detail when I did a podcast with him,</v>

2359
01:38:31.091 --> 01:38:34.750
<v Speaker 1>but that seems to be the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they made everybody move up a weight</v>

2360
01:38:34.751 --> 01:38:35.610
<v Speaker 1>class essentially.</v>

2361
01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:36.391
<v Speaker 2>Jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2362
01:38:36.391 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing is I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2363
01:38:37.681 --> 01:38:38.514
<v Speaker 2>like contract contracts can still exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you're just contracted as a </v>

2364
01:38:42.151 --> 01:38:45.690
<v Speaker 2>fighter and you have to fight certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of time a year or or whatever.</v>

2365
01:38:45.691 --> 01:38:48.480
<v Speaker 2>But to have people contracted to weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes is like,</v>

2366
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:49.343
<v Speaker 2>it's hurting the sport and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously hurting fighters individually </v>

2367
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.310
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like</v>

2368
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:55.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Well you should do is fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are weight classes,</v>

2370
01:38:58.740 --> 01:38:59.573
<v Speaker 1>there should be more weight classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's more opportunities and you </v>

2371
01:39:02.401 --> 01:39:04.800
<v Speaker 1>should be fighting for what you are when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're healthy.</v>

2372
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:06.260
<v Speaker 1>It's hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2373
01:39:06.570 --> 01:39:08.460
<v Speaker 2>and I think especially because the sport</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2374
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.370
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very blatantly clear that it's,</v>

2375
01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.130
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a bracketed sport.</v>

2376
01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:15.053
<v Speaker 2>Like this is an entertainment sports now</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clear like we're doing what puts </v>

2377
01:39:18.391 --> 01:39:19.530
<v Speaker 2>butts in the seats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2378
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:22.470
<v Speaker 2>We're doing what's best for the fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at that point,</v>

2379
01:39:22.471 --> 01:39:25.080
<v Speaker 2>what are these divisions really matter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the matchup,</v>

2380
01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:26.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can throw a belt on it,</v>

2381
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.120
<v Speaker 2>any fight these days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2382
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:31.350
<v Speaker 2>so I think if we're going to evolve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport to,</v>

2383
01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:35.160
<v Speaker 2>to having entertaining fights or </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainment type fights,</v>

2384
01:39:35.161 --> 01:39:38.640
<v Speaker 2>like we should just evolve the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the contracts to that as well.</v>

2385
01:39:38.641 --> 01:39:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2386
01:39:39.450 --> 01:39:40.283
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll still save the entertainment </v>

2387
01:39:41.911 --> 01:39:42.480
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2388
01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:43.313
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get,</v>

2389
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:46.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or catch weights even.</v>

2390
01:39:46.021 --> 01:39:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you guys want to agree on?</v>

2391
01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:48.530
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2392
01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Like who's down for what?</v>

2393
01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:52.080
<v Speaker 1>If you had an ideal weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it be</v>

2394
01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:53.930
<v Speaker 2>to find out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2395
01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:55.513
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2396
01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:59.210
<v Speaker 2>probably 45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45.</v>

2397
01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm skinny enough that I'm </v>

2398
01:40:02.511 --> 01:40:04.320
<v Speaker 2>like flying squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flexible stuff,</v>

2399
01:40:04.570 --> 01:40:05.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2400
01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:07.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still a hell of a strong,</v>

2401
01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:09.470
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2402
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:12.350
<v Speaker 1>but when you're dealing with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Cyborg is coming down from one 80.</v>

2403
01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is me healthy.</v>

2404
01:40:14.971 --> 01:40:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Like it don't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2405
01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:19.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the water,</v>

2406
01:40:19.051 --> 01:40:19.920
<v Speaker 2>she's a rock,</v>

2407
01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:21.803
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

2408
01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:24.450
<v Speaker 2>that's something I remember thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was going into 20 fives.</v>

2409
01:40:24.451 --> 01:40:25.284
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be huge against all these </v>

2410
01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:28.200
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2411
01:40:28.201 --> 01:40:30.750
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may not be as dehydrated and fucked</v>

2412
01:40:30.751 --> 01:40:32.730
<v Speaker 2>up is me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can hold them down.</v>

2413
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:33.571
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2414
01:40:33.571 --> 01:40:34.404
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can do what I want and eventually </v>

2415
01:40:35.431 --> 01:40:36.630
<v Speaker 2>break them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2416
01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:38.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2417
01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:39.241
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2418
01:40:39.241 --> 01:40:41.380
<v Speaker 2>she's got that in her back pocket too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:42.990
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2420
01:40:42.991 --> 01:40:43.824
<v Speaker 2>you get the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2421
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I I thought watching the Tonya Avenger </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

2422
01:40:46.831 --> 01:40:48.630
<v Speaker 2>like there was a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2423
01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:49.853
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw in that fight against Chris and I </v>

2424
01:40:51.631 --> 01:40:52.291
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

2425
01:40:52.291 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that right</v>

2426
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:54.670
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2427
01:40:54.670 --> 01:40:55.210
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2428
01:40:55.210 --> 01:40:56.043
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something I could do there just </v>

2429
01:40:57.090 --> 01:40:57.923
<v Speaker 1>fine to me seemed like Chris is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>very cautious and conservative and that </v>

2430
01:41:02.441 --> 01:41:06.340
<v Speaker 1>she was just picking her shots and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just trying to be very professional.</v>

2431
01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Like the way she was fighting was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this marauding rampaging destroy or</v>

2432
01:41:11.621 --> 01:41:13.240
<v Speaker 1>like we've seen in some of her other </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

2433
01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:14.074
<v Speaker 1>She fought much more technical and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Tanya evenger was throwing wild </v>

2434
01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:21.790
<v Speaker 1>fucking bar stool type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was just,</v>

2435
01:41:22.090 --> 01:41:23.650
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her hands were down.</v>

2436
01:41:23.651 --> 01:41:26.740
<v Speaker 1>She's whinging big bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knew she had to go for broke and you</v>

2437
01:41:26.741 --> 01:41:27.521
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tonya,</v>

2438
01:41:27.521 --> 01:41:29.740
<v Speaker 1>every juror's tough as fuck just to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>

2439
01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:31.113
<v Speaker 1>I mean the difference in size was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparent between the two of them when </v>

2440
01:41:33.211 --> 01:41:35.780
<v Speaker 1>you saw them inside the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2441
01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.140
<v Speaker 1>tom is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a really tough woman.</v>

2442
01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:39.573
<v Speaker 1>But her style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was just trying to be unpredictable </v>

2443
01:41:41.921 --> 01:41:43.390
<v Speaker 1>and wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2444
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:47.020
<v Speaker 1>And cyborg was just moving in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just real,</v>

2445
01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 1>real professional and technical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like she was cautious.</v>

2446
01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a big fight for her too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2447
01:41:52.570 --> 01:41:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2448
01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.340
<v Speaker 1>That was the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the first belt defense?</v>

2449
01:41:58.330 --> 01:41:59.520
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2450
01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:03.080
<v Speaker 1>that was the first ballot because her </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning the belt for the belt.</v>

2451
01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't happen again.</v>

2452
01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

2453
01:42:06.941 --> 01:42:10.240
<v Speaker 1>see Ya Germain de Randamie is like not </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested.</v>

2454
01:42:10.770 --> 01:42:11.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2455
01:42:11.521 --> 01:42:12.460
<v Speaker 1>does she go there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

2456
01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:15.550
<v Speaker 1>oh she's still fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well she remember right after the fight,</v>

2457
01:42:15.551 --> 01:42:17.830
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed her after she won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2458
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:21.160
<v Speaker 1>that fight bothered me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It bothered me a lot cause she hit holly</v>

2459
01:42:21.161 --> 01:42:25.720
<v Speaker 1>after the bell twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hard and really rocked her.</v>

2460
01:42:26.110 --> 01:42:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And I watched that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2461
01:42:27.161 --> 01:42:29.440
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a big shot.</v>

2462
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:30.303
<v Speaker 1>And like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say you accidentally did it </v>

2463
01:42:31.961 --> 01:42:32.290
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

2464
01:42:32.290 --> 01:42:33.123
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she did it twice and one time hurt </v>

2465
01:42:35.471 --> 01:42:39.730
<v Speaker 1>her bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even so when I watched the fight,</v>

2466
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

2467
01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:41.353
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the times when she hurt holly was after </v>

2468
01:42:43.451 --> 01:42:44.284
<v Speaker 1>the bell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but holly fucked her up twice in that </v>

2469
01:42:46.151 --> 01:42:47.590
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hit her with that question.</v>

2470
01:42:47.591 --> 01:42:48.424
<v Speaker 1>Mark kick cracked her and rocked her and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she hit her with a straight left </v>

2471
01:42:51.341 --> 01:42:52.174
<v Speaker 1>hand and dropped her too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like holly deserved the nod in </v>

2472
01:42:54.551 --> 01:42:55.384
<v Speaker 1>that fight and I definitely think she </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserved the nod if you take points </v>

2473
01:42:57.941 --> 01:42:59.920
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I definitely think she should have</v>

2474
01:42:59.921 --> 01:43:01.810
<v Speaker 1>taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She hadn't points taken away from her.</v>

2475
01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I just think I just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't sit with me well,</v>

2476
01:43:04.930 --> 01:43:07.870
<v Speaker 1>and then after the fight she said she </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed,</v>

2477
01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.540
<v Speaker 1>when I asked her about Cyborg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

2478
01:43:10.541 --> 01:43:11.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting surgery.</v>

2479
01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:12.461
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

2480
01:43:12.461 --> 01:43:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I got something wrong with my thumb or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2481
01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:15.370
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2482
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:17.410
<v Speaker 1>she's going to get some surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

2483
01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:18.363
<v Speaker 1>Then it became a ped issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said the Cyborg is a lifetime ped </v>

2484
01:43:21.311 --> 01:43:22.144
<v Speaker 1>cheater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she's a performance enhancing drug </v>

2485
01:43:23.411 --> 01:43:26.110
<v Speaker 1>user and that everybody knows it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's not going to fight her.</v>

2486
01:43:26.770 --> 01:43:30.340
<v Speaker 1>So she basically just gave up her title </v>
<v Speaker 1>and went back down to 35 I think.</v>

2487
01:43:31.570 --> 01:43:35.050
<v Speaker 1>So she is fighting again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she went and got surgery</v>

2488
01:43:35.051 --> 01:43:38.980
<v Speaker 1>on whatever was going on with her hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she is going to fight again,</v>

2489
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:43.250
<v Speaker 1>but she hasn't since I don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so either.</v>

2490
01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.820
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jermaine Duran to me.</v>

2491
01:43:45.821 --> 01:43:47.350
<v Speaker 1>See what she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who she's fighting next.</v>

2492
01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.040
<v Speaker 1>She hasn't tweeted since November about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fight then.</v>

2493
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

2495
01:43:54.610 --> 01:43:55.443

<v Speaker 1>that's the person not investing in </v>

2496

<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

2498
01:44:00.941 --> 01:44:02.890
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not interested in this.</v>

2499

2550
01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.880
<v Speaker 1>Cyborg got ahold of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like one of those things where</v>

2551
01:46:16.881 --> 01:46:17.714
<v Speaker 1>when Cyborg starts landing on girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the look on their face and in </v>

2553
01:46:24.650 --> 01:46:25.483

<v Speaker 1>I was most impressed with Cyborg on her </v>

2554
01:46:27.441 --> 01:46:30.860
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing loss when she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she fought Zarina barge.</v>

2555
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:34.910

01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:37.323
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't need her from across the </v>

2558
01:46:38.781 --> 01:46:39.614
<v Speaker 1>room in the face bars knocked her down </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a front kick to the face and she </v>

2559
01:46:43.701 --> 01:46:44.534
<v Speaker 1>dropped her and time still cyborg was </v>
<v Speaker 1>still chasing after her for every </v>

2560
01:46:48.231 --> 01:46:49.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that girl's lid.</v>

2562
01:46:50.610 --> 01:46:51.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

2563
01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:56.100
<v Speaker 1>she's big and she's strong and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mentally she's tough too.</v>

01:46:56.190 --> 01:46:57.023
<v Speaker 1>Like she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to just a fight that girl at </v>

2565
01:46:59.371 --> 01:47:00.204
<v Speaker 1>during the bars had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had I think almost three years </v>

2566
01:47:03.961 --> 01:47:04.794
<v Speaker 1>without a fight where she couldn't get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight cause nobody wants to find her </v>

2567
01:47:07.230 --> 01:47:12.030
<v Speaker 1>because she's just a fucking bad ass Moy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thai fighter real long and tall and just</v>

2570
01:47:19.050 --> 01:47:19.883
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she was like the most feared mma </v>

<v Speaker 2>like be with the animals and feed them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like you can try to rehabilitate </v>

2667
01:51:32.131 --> 01:51:33.840
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are scary man,</v>

2668
01:51:33.841 --> 01:51:34.674
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's cool cause they're actually </v>

2669
01:51:35.311 --> 01:51:36.144
<v Speaker 2>like something really to be scared of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like half the shit we're afraid of is </v>

2670
01:51:38.281 --> 01:51:39.114
<v Speaker 2>just in our head anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's this like gigantic animal </v>

<v Speaker 2>That's taken some of my time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been cool.</v>

2675
01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:53.710
<v Speaker 1>That is weird with horses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2676
01:51:53.711 --> 01:51:54.544
<v Speaker 1>Like you could break them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can lasso them and they'll let you </v>

2677
01:51:56.591 --> 01:52:00.190
<v Speaker 1>ride them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like wild horses.</v>

2678
01:52:00.191 --> 01:52:03.400
<v Speaker 1>People go out and catch wild horses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride them around.</v>

2679
01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Like what other fucking animal can you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that too?</v>

01:52:06.850 --> 01:52:09.640
<v Speaker 1>That's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2681
01:52:09.850 --> 01:52:12.730

2682
01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.380
<v Speaker 1>He got them in the bar and the horse was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2689
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:26.343
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have weird relationship people </v>

2690
01:52:27.611 --> 01:52:31.570
<v Speaker 1>have with fucking horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2694
01:52:40.451 --> 01:52:41.950
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a connection with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

2695
01:52:41.951 --> 01:52:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It has to feel you like not a satellite.</v>

<v Speaker 3>saddle on and she doesn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she rescued this horse and she'd </v>

<v Speaker 2>like I was trying to get this because my</v>

2705
01:53:07.271 --> 01:53:08.104
<v Speaker 2>brain was working in all these ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I got really excited about that </v>

01:53:26.590 --> 01:53:29.290
<v Speaker 2>like it's awesome because after a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>months of being there,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes if all you do at this place </v>

01:53:49.961 --> 01:53:50.794
<v Speaker 2>they've all been mistreated at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point or they were trained to be </v>

2726
01:53:53.501 --> 01:53:55.690
<v Speaker 2>something that they never graduated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:29.843
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's put up here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put up your umbrella and like a special </v>

2763
01:55:31.771 --> 01:55:33.630
<v Speaker 3>angle and you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just climb.</v>

2764
01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:36.780
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't seem like it's impossible </v>
<v Speaker 3>to come on.</v>

2765
01:55:37.650 --> 01:55:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the best climber in the world by</v>

2766
01:55:39.391 --> 01:55:41.310
<v Speaker 3>fucking guarantee you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could make it over that fence.</v>

2767
01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:43.260
<v Speaker 3>100% look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2768
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:44.170
<v Speaker 3>you just grab a whole</v>

2769
01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:45.003
<v Speaker 1>the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some gloves on so you don't fuck you're </v>

2770
01:55:45.901 --> 01:55:48.240
<v Speaker 1>hands on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to do some soft</v>

2771
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:51.130
<v Speaker 2>soft sand Shane and cause that sprint </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>

2772
01:55:51.131 --> 01:55:51.964
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burn your leg.</v>

2773
01:55:52.130 --> 01:55:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sports world,</v>

2774
01:55:53.970 --> 01:55:56.570
<v Speaker 1>but unless they're on Dune buggies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to catch you.</v>

2775
01:55:56.571 --> 01:55:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Those fat fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2776
01:55:58.850 --> 01:56:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I feel like swimming is the move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why climate?</v>

2777
01:56:01.731 --> 01:56:03.220
<v Speaker 1>You just swim a couple of hundred yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2778
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2779
01:56:03.751 --> 01:56:05.280
<v Speaker 2>It's like 200 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2780
01:56:05.370 --> 01:56:07.340
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go left and then come back.</v>

2781
01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:11.570
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird that like bill dot wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>build that wall.</v>

2782
01:56:11.571 --> 01:56:14.450
<v Speaker 1>People are so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is so strange.</v>

2783
01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I think one day we're going to look back</v>
<v Speaker 1>on countries like the human race one.</v>

2784
01:56:18.650 --> 01:56:19.483
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to the human race for sure is </v>

2785
01:56:21.591 --> 01:56:23.870
<v Speaker 1>that we're getting closer to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting,</v>

2786
01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:24.763
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'll read tweets that someone will </v>

2787
01:56:27.351 --> 01:56:28.184
<v Speaker 1>post in Spanish or in Chinese or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever and you just press translate </v>

2788
01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.010
<v Speaker 1>and then you get to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2789
01:56:34.011 --> 01:56:35.270
<v Speaker 1>translate to English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2790
01:56:35.271 --> 01:56:36.080
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

2791
01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:36.913
<v Speaker 1>I could read this guy words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have this thing called the </v>

2792
01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Google Pixel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2793
01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:41.451
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2794
01:56:41.451 --> 01:56:45.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a phone and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have these pixel buds,</v>

2795
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:49.100
<v Speaker 1>these earbuds and these ear buds will </v>
<v Speaker 1>translate in real time.</v>

2796
01:56:49.130 --> 01:56:49.963
<v Speaker 1>Like you could say some shit to me in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and it'll translate it in </v>

2797
01:56:52.101 --> 01:56:53.780
<v Speaker 1>realtime to English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2798
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:54.703
<v Speaker 1>And how long is it going to be before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's way better and we're going to </v>

2799
01:56:57.741 --> 01:56:59.240
<v Speaker 1>realize that countries are stupid.</v>

2800
01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:00.313
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

2801
01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:03.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean I agree on that on the social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media side that I feel like social media</v>

2802
01:57:03.471 --> 01:57:07.760
<v Speaker 2>has made that connection for us on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that I guess mental,</v>

2803
01:57:07.761 --> 01:57:09.740
<v Speaker 2>social side or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as,</v>

2804
01:57:09.741 --> 01:57:12.080
<v Speaker 2>as humans individually like here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2805
01:57:12.081 --> 01:57:14.480
<v Speaker 2>right next to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I feel a huge disconnect.</v>

2806
01:57:14.481 --> 01:57:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Like look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a century ago,</v>

2807
01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:21.320
<v Speaker 2>more than less than like you knew who </v>
<v Speaker 2>the town butcher was,</v>

2808
01:57:21.490 --> 01:57:23.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew who the blacksmith was.</v>

2809
01:57:23.661 --> 01:57:25.940
<v Speaker 2>You knew who the mayor was like you knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2810
01:57:26.210 --> 01:57:27.043
<v Speaker 2>and everybody had their position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your kids were safe to run around like </v>

2811
01:57:29.511 --> 01:57:30.344
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone knew and there was value </v>

2812
01:57:32.781 --> 01:57:35.200
<v Speaker 2>to every single person for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what it is that they're,</v>

2813
01:57:35.210 --> 01:57:38.570
<v Speaker 2>their craft was or who they are and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knows anyone.</v>

2814
01:57:38.810 --> 01:57:40.880
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't want to like,</v>

2815
01:57:41.150 --> 01:57:43.880
<v Speaker 2>like I almost feel weird sometimes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2816
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:45.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kids,</v>

2817
01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:46.273
<v Speaker 2>my kid doesn't see all of the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures that I see because I have </v>

2818
01:57:49.251 --> 01:57:50.084
<v Speaker 2>facebook and he doesn't or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not ready like to have my kid </v>

2819
01:57:53.751 --> 01:57:56.690
<v Speaker 2>exposed to the library right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2820
01:57:56.690 --> 01:57:58.760
<v Speaker 2>And it's a terrible thing for kids to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to.</v>

2821
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:59.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2822
01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:00.830
<v Speaker 2>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2823
01:58:01.130 --> 01:58:01.963
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like shoulder to shoulder person a </v>

2824
01:58:03.411 --> 01:58:05.810
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like a bit of a disconnect,</v>

2825
01:58:05.811 --> 01:58:07.340
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But social media,</v>

2826
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:10.730
<v Speaker 2>like we get to share information </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes not good information.</v>

2827
01:58:10.731 --> 01:58:11.564
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you get information like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that people are communicating I </v>

2828
01:58:14.391 --> 01:58:15.950
<v Speaker 2>think is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2829
01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:17.990
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's making people take stands on things</v>

2830
01:58:17.991 --> 01:58:19.580
<v Speaker 2>that they're all finding out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2831
01:58:19.581 --> 01:58:21.410
<v Speaker 2>you believe that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or I think that too,</v>

2832
01:58:21.411 --> 01:58:23.510
<v Speaker 2>like cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can find my people,</v>

2833
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:26.180
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the actual like oxytocin,</v>

2834
01:58:26.181 --> 01:58:27.014
<v Speaker 2>like social side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people actually getting to know each </v>

2835
01:58:28.551 --> 01:58:31.190
<v Speaker 2>other like those like intimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

2836
01:58:31.191 --> 01:58:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel like that part is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is suffering a little bit from it.</v>

2837
01:58:35.410 --> 01:58:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's suffering a little bit in</v>

2838
01:58:37.391 --> 01:58:38.360
<v Speaker 1>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2839
01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.990
<v Speaker 1>because people were in cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in traffic,</v>

2840
01:58:41.140 --> 01:58:41.973
<v Speaker 1>isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they go to work and then a cubicle </v>

2841
01:58:43.391 --> 01:58:44.224
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'd get home and they're in </v>

2842
01:58:44.771 --> 01:58:46.720
<v Speaker 1>their apartment or their house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2843
01:58:46.721 --> 01:58:51.060
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of like interaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people and it's just stinked.</v>

2844
01:58:51.061 --> 01:58:53.770
<v Speaker 1>This is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a side effect of modern life.</v>

2845
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2846
01:58:54.610 --> 01:58:57.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's weird that there's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in La,</v>

2847
01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:58.113
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people next to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and almost nobody knows their </v>

2848
01:59:00.191 --> 01:59:02.080
<v Speaker 1>neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange,</v>

2849
01:59:02.110 --> 01:59:02.943
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm talking about is I think </v>

2850
01:59:03.971 --> 01:59:06.340
<v Speaker 1>countries are stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like states.</v>

2851
01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I think countries like states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think we should build a wall over</v>

2852
01:59:09.431 --> 01:59:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Florida before we should build a wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Mexico.</v>

2853
01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida's a state,</v>

2854
01:59:15.461 --> 01:59:19.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Florida is just as alien as like say</v>

2855
01:59:19.451 --> 01:59:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Finland or something like that.</v>

2856
01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:21.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

2857
01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:24.580
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that you can move out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida and like,</v>

2858
01:59:24.581 --> 01:59:25.241
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2859
01:59:25.241 --> 01:59:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to move to Atlanta.</v>

2860
01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And he'd go up there and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody stops you.</v>

2861
01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:32.440
<v Speaker 1>You just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're in Tiawana like you,</v>

2862
01:59:32.441 --> 01:59:34.630
<v Speaker 1>like no dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fence up here,</v>

2863
01:59:34.650 --> 01:59:36.220
<v Speaker 1>pitch like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2864
01:59:36.370 --> 01:59:37.203
<v Speaker 1>there's no crossing did to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that seems like super fucking </v>

2865
01:59:39.671 --> 01:59:40.504
<v Speaker 1>strange and almost like guaranteeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that those spots are fucked forever and </v>

2866
01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:44.953
<v Speaker 1>the only way those anythings ever going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to level out is if you let anybody </v>

2867
01:59:48.011 --> 01:59:48.844
<v Speaker 1>travel wherever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nobody's willing to do that because </v>

2868
01:59:51.101 --> 01:59:54.160
<v Speaker 1>it might fuck up the good spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like la Jolla would be like,</v>

2869
01:59:54.210 --> 01:59:54.791
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2870
01:59:54.791 --> 01:59:55.690
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just like,</v>

2871
01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:56.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not.</v>

2872
01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:57.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

2873
01:59:57.650 --> 01:59:59.830
<v Speaker 1>you can't just come over from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think about it,</v>

2874
01:59:59.831 --> 02:00:02.740
<v Speaker 1>La Jolla has some of the wealthiest real</v>
<v Speaker 1>estate in the world,</v>

2875
02:00:02.741 --> 02:00:04.960
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unbelievable.</v>

2876
02:00:04.961 --> 02:00:05.794
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could walk to Mexico from La </v>

2877
02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Jolla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could walk,</v>

2878
02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:12.033
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the distance between Tijuana and </v>

2879
02:00:13.661 --> 02:00:15.070
<v Speaker 1>La Jolla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's guess.</v>

2880
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Let me guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say it's 50 miles.</v>

2881
02:00:17.770 --> 02:00:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Is it 50</v>

2882
02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:19.353
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say 50 no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I it's not that many cause it's already </v>

2883
02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:23.410
<v Speaker 3>depending on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah.</v>

2884
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:26.320
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's a 30 minute drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2885
02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:28.960
<v Speaker 3>like moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Normal speed limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2887
02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:31.930
<v Speaker 3>No traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>35 maybe.</v>

2888
02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:35.110
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's 30 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a marathon,</v>

2889
02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>like a marathon run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which people do.</v>

2956
02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:17.803
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2957
02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:18.693
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance has been like real helpful on </v>

2958
02:03:22.251 --> 02:03:23.084
<v Speaker 2>my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wouldn't say there's a ton of </v>

2959
02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:26.360
<v Speaker 2>improvement as far as that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2960
02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:28.520
<v Speaker 2>and I never really focused on boxing </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

2961
02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:29.413
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked Muay Thai and kickboxing and </v>

2962
02:03:32.570 --> 02:03:34.550
<v Speaker 2>between Dutch and tie sal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2963
02:03:34.551 --> 02:03:37.260
<v Speaker 2>and then to go there and have my hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharpened was,</v>

2964
02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:39.030
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2965
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I just never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2966
02:03:41.690 --> 02:03:46.690
<v Speaker 2>it was hard for me to like to relate </v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing to any sport I'd ever done.</v>

2967
02:03:47.961 --> 02:03:49.880
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

2968
02:03:49.881 --> 02:03:52.670
<v Speaker 2>as a athlete growing up as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I don't,</v>

2969
02:03:52.730 --> 02:03:54.800
<v Speaker 2>if I can't understand something that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning,</v>

2970
02:03:54.801 --> 02:03:55.634
<v Speaker 2>I try to relate it back to some like </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle memory of some motion I've done </v>

2971
02:03:58.641 --> 02:03:59.474
<v Speaker 2>before in some other sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like volleyball or swimming or like </v>

2972
02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:04.460
<v Speaker 2>what's the mechanics of how I've moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2973
02:04:04.461 --> 02:04:08.420
<v Speaker 2>something that I can even dance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like turn into getting like some kind of</v>

2974
02:04:08.421 --> 02:04:09.254
<v Speaker 2>value out of so I can learn this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like boxing was not like anything </v>

2975
02:04:12.321 --> 02:04:13.154
<v Speaker 2>that I'd ever done before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've never had a predominantly </v>

2976
02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:18.890
<v Speaker 2>hands on sport that I was good at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's been the,</v>

2977
02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:22.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most,</v>

<v Speaker 3>of dance,</v>

2992
02:04:53.011 --> 02:04:54.240
<v Speaker 3>of all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that,</v>

2993
02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:58.650
<v Speaker 3>that contributed I think easily and </v>
<v Speaker 3>translated easily over to that.</v>

2994
02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:00.750
<v Speaker 3>But boxing was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2995
02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:02.250
<v Speaker 3>not so much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2996
02:05:02.251 --> 02:05:04.620
<v Speaker 3>but part of me also thinks like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2997
02:05:04.650 --> 02:05:07.140
<v Speaker 3>some of that had to come with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with learning.</v>

2998
02:05:07.141 --> 02:05:07.974
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get hit to realize you don't </v>

2999
02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:12.090
<v Speaker 3>want to get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not ready.</v>

3000
02:05:12.091 --> 02:05:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get hit.</v>

3001
02:05:14.191 --> 02:05:15.024
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3002
02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3003
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:19.970
<v Speaker 1>And slip and roll was shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3004
02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:24.700
<v Speaker 3>It hurts my feelings and get punched in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the face and I'm happy.</v>

3005
02:05:24.701 --> 02:05:26.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm the kind of person that it pisses </v>
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>

3006
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:27.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3007
02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:30.160
<v Speaker 3>so it makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes me fight harder,</v>

3008
02:05:30.190 --> 02:05:31.810
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

3009
02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:34.090
<v Speaker 3>it's stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's stunning.</v>

3010
02:05:34.091 --> 02:05:34.924
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you get one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>good ones in the nose and now your eyes </v>

3011
02:05:36.881 --> 02:05:40.490
<v Speaker 3>are watering but you're not crying like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3012
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Weird stinging sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3013
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Learning all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3014
02:05:45.550 --> 02:05:49.330
<v Speaker 3>that all was definitely within the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>few years and it's been,</v>

3015
02:05:49.690 --> 02:05:52.630
<v Speaker 3>it's been fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been not fun but fun.</v>

3016
02:05:52.631 --> 02:05:54.540
<v Speaker 3>When you see like the evolution,</v>

3017
02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:57.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fighters are getting into yoga.</v>

3018
02:05:57.081 --> 02:05:57.914
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fighters are doing yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fighters are finding that they </v>

3019
02:06:01.051 --> 02:06:01.884
<v Speaker 1>have like real benefits and protecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>their back and strengthening a lot of </v>

3020
02:06:07.231 --> 02:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>their joints and their ligaments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

3021
02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:10.793
<v Speaker 3>It's supplemental towards like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiology of it or because it's </v>

3022
02:06:13.961 --> 02:06:16.420
<v Speaker 3>something as far as adding to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>combative side,</v>

3023
02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think both.</v>

3024
02:06:17.790 --> 02:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I think for sure it's good for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental endurance because it's,</v>

3025
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:23.623
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like something that </v>

3026
02:06:24.691 --> 02:06:26.290
<v Speaker 1>should be very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear about Yoga,</v>

3027
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3028
02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:30.240
<v Speaker 1>housewives do that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do it 100% in,</v>

3029
02:06:30.241 --> 02:06:31.074
<v Speaker 1>especially hot yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck in that fucking box at 104 </v>

3030
02:06:33.931 --> 02:06:36.090
<v Speaker 1>degrees for 90 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweating your ass off,</v>

3031
02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:39.680
<v Speaker 3>pissed at about 60 minutes and that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:06:39.681 --> 02:06:42.640
<v Speaker 3>So there's definitely some mental </v>
<v Speaker 3>toughness that goes into the night</v>

3033
02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:46.030
<v Speaker 1>you endure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You endure a 90 minute hot yoga class.</v>

3034
02:06:46.031 --> 02:06:46.864
<v Speaker 1>But I think for your joints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your range of motion and </v>

3035
02:06:49.811 --> 02:06:50.644
<v Speaker 1>flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's almost nothing better because </v>

3036
02:06:51.851 --> 02:06:55.180
<v Speaker 1>you're so hot and sweaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's loosened up and you can get</v>

3037
02:06:55.181 --> 02:06:58.320
<v Speaker 1>into like deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep stretches and deep poses and,</v>

3038
02:06:58.321 --> 02:07:01.810
<v Speaker 1>and also like for your foot strength and</v>
<v Speaker 1>posture and balance,</v>

3039
02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:05.200
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing for your back,</v>

3040
02:07:05.230 --> 02:07:07.090
<v Speaker 1>strengthening your back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your knees.</v>

3041
02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really good for Jujitsu fighters.</v>

3042
02:07:10.190 --> 02:07:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Mean Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love it.</v>

3043
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:15.070
<v Speaker 1>So one of the best things for Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Jujitsu,</v>

3044
02:07:15.071 --> 02:07:16.390
<v Speaker 1>so static,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3045
02:07:16.391 --> 02:07:20.920
<v Speaker 1>so much of it is like holding on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to advance position in slowly.</v>

3046
02:07:20.921 --> 02:07:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And then there's these bursts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3047
02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive movements.</v>

3048
02:07:25.121 --> 02:07:29.530
<v Speaker 1>But so much of it is just clenching and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah.</v>

3049
02:07:29.531 --> 02:07:30.364
<v Speaker 1>So much of it is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you really benefit from </v>

3050
02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:34.380
<v Speaker 1>being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3051
02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:38.110
<v Speaker 1>in these yoga poses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding these poses for 30 seconds.</v>

3052
02:07:38.111 --> 02:07:39.910
<v Speaker 1>When you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's burning and you're,</v>

3053
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3054
02:07:40.871 --> 02:07:43.330
<v Speaker 1>you're having a difficult time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up.</v>

3055
02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I think adding the heat component to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

3056
02:07:46.571 --> 02:07:48.500
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a weight cutting </v>
<v Speaker 2>finder,</v>

3057
02:07:48.520 --> 02:07:52.570
<v Speaker 2>like getting to know your body and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching it how to sweat,</v>

3058
02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:53.433
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This last training camp was pretty </v>

3059
02:07:55.451 --> 02:07:57.970
<v Speaker 2>awesome with that because I got a sauna </v>
<v Speaker 2>for my,</v>

3060
02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.193
<v Speaker 2>when I got us on a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was using a red light for healing and </v>

3061
02:08:03.011 --> 02:08:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I was using the sauna because I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can naturally boost your,</v>

3062
02:08:06.611 --> 02:08:08.850
<v Speaker 2>a growth hormone if you're in that every</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and,</v>

3063
02:08:08.890 --> 02:08:10.930
<v Speaker 2>and help yourself before you go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

3064
02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:16.320
<v Speaker 2>So I was in that every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to go in for like 45 minutes and</v>

3065
02:08:16.930 --> 02:08:20.560
<v Speaker 2>that was so helpful in going into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight week wait,</v>

3066
02:08:20.561 --> 02:08:21.640
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was like,</v>

3067
02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:24.760
<v Speaker 2>I know what it feels like when it's time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the fuck out.</v>

3068
02:08:24.761 --> 02:08:25.594
<v Speaker 2>And I know what it feels like when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that I'm like that sound like when </v>

3069
02:08:29.141 --> 02:08:29.974
<v Speaker 2>I'm dripping like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still got another good 20 minutes of </v>

3070
02:08:32.771 --> 02:08:35.590
<v Speaker 2>me sitting here like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3071
02:08:35.591 --> 02:08:38.080
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's really hard on fighters</v>

3072
02:08:38.081 --> 02:08:42.190
<v Speaker 2>when they're not in a sauna or that hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their entire camp and then they just</v>

3073
02:08:42.191 --> 02:08:45.100
<v Speaker 2>expect that out of their body the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>before a fight.</v>

3074
02:08:45.190 --> 02:08:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

3075
02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:48.790
<v Speaker 1>This is rolling real good benefits as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

3076
02:08:48.791 --> 02:08:51.580
<v Speaker 1>two for recovery or reducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

3077
02:08:53.070 --> 02:08:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was hopeful.</v>

3078
02:08:54.781 --> 02:08:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I got a portable sauna to bring up my </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights with me.</v>

3079
02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:58.373
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it one climb into and like just your </v>

3080
02:09:00.481 --> 02:09:01.314
<v Speaker 2>little head sticks out is uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>as hell cause you can't lean against </v>

3081
02:09:03.841 --> 02:09:04.674
<v Speaker 2>anything or it'll burn your ass in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chair and the chair is like this little </v>

3082
02:09:07.711 --> 02:09:09.960
<v Speaker 2>half chair and by that point you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3083
02:09:09.961 --> 02:09:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Oregon's are so depleted in and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like leaning all weird anyway.</v>

3084
02:09:13.591 --> 02:09:15.120
<v Speaker 2>So it was just hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

3085
02:09:15.121 --> 02:09:16.560
<v Speaker 2>it gets it off and you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave your home.</v>

3086
02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nice too.</v>

3087
02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're doing something on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

3088
02:09:20.341 --> 02:09:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Like who was it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3089
02:09:23.550 --> 02:09:28.470
<v Speaker 1>somebody that somebody was fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and they didn't have hot water</v>

3090
02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:30.850
<v Speaker 1>and they couldn't make weight cause they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the,</v>

3091
02:09:30.851 --> 02:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>the bathtub?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a fuck.</v>

3092
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think of who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas have been stressful.</v>

3093
02:09:39.450 --> 02:09:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

3094
02:09:40.351 --> 02:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I think they were fighting in Brazil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no hot water for some reason.</v>

3095
02:09:43.561 --> 02:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Like the hot water was down and they all</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3096
02:09:45.511 --> 02:09:46.950
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they couldn't,</v>

3097
02:09:46.951 --> 02:09:47.810
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why not?</v>

3098
02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Not Making weight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who it was.</v>

3099
02:09:51.930 --> 02:09:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't there for that event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember thinking like,</v>

3100
02:09:54.331 --> 02:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the real problems with </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing these,</v>

3101
02:09:56.761 --> 02:09:58.310
<v Speaker 1>some of these gigs in the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3102
02:09:58.340 --> 02:09:59.173
<v Speaker 1>you're traveling to these places and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking hot water if there's </v>

3103
02:10:03.031 --> 02:10:05.860
<v Speaker 1>no sauna and no hot water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How he's supposed to make weight.</v>

3104
02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:06.963
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's awkward to be in a sauna with </v>

3105
02:10:07.781 --> 02:10:10.620
<v Speaker 2>your opponent to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and why I fought Carina Damn.</v>

3106
02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3107
02:10:13.001 --> 02:10:15.490
<v Speaker 2>as a 2,425,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a few years ago,</v>

3108
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:19.540
<v Speaker 1>there is Eric Anderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3109
02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Cheetah was very respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

3110
02:10:23.010 --> 02:10:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3111
02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:25.450
<v Speaker 2>The is Brazilian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows.</v>

3112
02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

3113
02:10:27.690 --> 02:10:28.523
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were in North Dakota and we had </v>

3114
02:10:30.851 --> 02:10:33.440
<v Speaker 2>to go in and the same song and it became</v>
<v Speaker 2>a competition there.</v>

3115
02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh my</v>

3116
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:34.930
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not getting out.</v>

3117
02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:37.700
<v Speaker 3>And when she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she,</v>

3118
02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:41.330
<v Speaker 3>like there was a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm sitting there with my coach and</v>

3119
02:10:41.331 --> 02:10:43.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like biting down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know how long we were in,</v>

3120
02:10:43.971 --> 02:10:45.980
<v Speaker 3>but it was like a hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was rough.</v>

3121
02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:47.950
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda,</v>

3122
02:10:47.970 --> 02:10:48.591
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3123
02:10:48.591 --> 02:10:50.450
<v Speaker 3>Like who's going to break first?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's gonna go first?</v>

3124
02:10:50.451 --> 02:10:52.250
<v Speaker 3>And she ended up being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

3125
02:10:52.251 --> 02:10:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And she goes and she gets out and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3126
02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have quit in you.</v>

3127
02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:59.540
<v Speaker 3>And I already knew I wanted to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't knew I won the fight.</v>

3128
02:10:59.541 --> 02:11:01.460
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw everything I needed to see.</v>

3129
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:02.803
<v Speaker 3>We're good.</v>

3130
02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so true.</v>

3131
02:11:05.491 --> 02:11:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3132
02:11:06.811 --> 02:11:08.100
<v Speaker 1>there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3133
02:11:08.101 --> 02:11:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you definitely don't want to die in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3134
02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:11.393
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's moments when you're in the </v>

3135
02:11:12.541 --> 02:11:13.620
<v Speaker 1>sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3136
02:11:13.621 --> 02:11:17.100
<v Speaker 1>I have one here and there's this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens at like 30 minutes.</v>

3137
02:11:17.101 --> 02:11:19.020
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck am I doing?</v>

3138
02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start fucking weird now you're like,</v>

3139
02:11:21.301 --> 02:11:22.260
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get Outta here.</v>

3140
02:11:22.290 --> 02:11:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like claustrophobia.</v>

3141
02:11:25.090 --> 02:11:25.923
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that if you just opened that </v>

3142
02:11:27.391 --> 02:11:29.320
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cold air and you're going to feel</v>

3143
02:11:29.410 --> 02:11:30.243
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just want someone that domain just lost </v>

3144
02:11:31.991 --> 02:11:32.820
<v Speaker 3>someone that asks you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay</v>

3145
02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:33.630
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hoping.</v>

3146
02:11:33.630 --> 02:11:35.780
<v Speaker 1>It just opens the door for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's open a door.</v>

3147
02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:36.653
<v Speaker 1>Let me run out that door right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is what creates those heat </v>

3148
02:11:40.921 --> 02:11:41.754
<v Speaker 1>shock proteins is that your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes that it's in this terrible </v>

3149
02:11:44.071 --> 02:11:44.904
<v Speaker 1>situation where your way overheated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your body starts creating these </v>

3150
02:11:48.061 --> 02:11:51.630
<v Speaker 1>anti-inflammatory proteins and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's so good for your body.</v>

3151
02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:53.880
<v Speaker 1>They did a study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in,</v>

3152
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:55.920
<v Speaker 1>was it Norway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A doctor,</v>

3153
02:11:55.921 --> 02:11:56.754
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda Patrick brought it up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast that they showed a 40% decrease </v>

3154
02:12:00.451 --> 02:12:04.560
<v Speaker 1>in mortality from all causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from use of daily Sauna,</v>

3155
02:12:05.190 --> 02:12:08.040
<v Speaker 1>40% decrease in heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke,</v>

3156
02:12:08.041 --> 02:12:10.020
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything across the board.</v>

3157
02:12:10.230 --> 02:12:12.900
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably good for you to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>

3158
02:12:12.930 --> 02:12:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because your body in reaction,</v>

3159
02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:17.233
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the response that your body has in </v>

3160
02:12:18.841 --> 02:12:19.674
<v Speaker 1>reaction to that extreme temperature is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to create all these anti </v>

3161
02:12:22.981 --> 02:12:25.890
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory properties and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>so good for your body.</v>

3162
02:12:26.130 --> 02:12:26.963
<v Speaker 1>Inflammation is just the root of so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>different diseases and problems that we </v>

3163
02:12:30.211 --> 02:12:31.044
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3164
02:12:31.380 --> 02:12:33.180
<v Speaker 3>so do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is like the temperature,</v>

3165
02:12:33.181 --> 02:12:34.870
<v Speaker 3>induration duration recommended for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3166
02:12:34.990 --> 02:12:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 170 degrees in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 20 minutes is what they want.</v>

3167
02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:44.640
<v Speaker 1>They want 20 minutes at 107 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>170 degrees for four,</v>

3168
02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I believe the test protocol was four </v>
<v Speaker 1>days a week.</v>

3169
02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Is that the same statistic for say like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a Red Light Sauna?</v>

3170
02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:55.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't use a red light's on or they</v>

3171
02:12:55.191 --> 02:12:57.740
<v Speaker 1>didn't use an infrared sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traditional say just use the traditional</v>

3172
02:12:57.741 --> 02:13:00.860
<v Speaker 1>sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the theory is that it doesn't matter</v>

3173
02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:01.813
<v Speaker 1>because what matters is your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>reacting to the temperature change and </v>

3174
02:13:04.731 --> 02:13:06.350
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't matter how it's getting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3175
02:13:06.410 --> 02:13:08.420
<v Speaker 1>They used a regular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hot rock sauna.</v>

3176
02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:10.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular hot rock sauna.</v>

3177
02:13:10.610 --> 02:13:11.443
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what really matters is just </v>

3178
02:13:13.101 --> 02:13:13.934
<v Speaker 1>extreme temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people believe in </v>

3179
02:13:16.011 --> 02:13:17.900
<v Speaker 1>those infrared saunas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're better.</v>

3180
02:13:18.110 --> 02:13:18.943
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3181
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I just know your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body likes sauna.</v>

3182
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel better.</v>

3183
02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Sleep all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's better.</v>

3184
02:13:25.641 --> 02:13:28.520
<v Speaker 1>It just feels better for my brain to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel better about everything.</v>

3185
02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:29.953
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's just like getting your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body heat it up like that and then it </v>

3186
02:13:32.281 --> 02:13:34.110
<v Speaker 1>cools off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just chills everything out.</v>

3187
02:13:34.460 --> 02:13:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Just everything feels looser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A quiet.</v>

3188
02:13:37.050 --> 02:13:38.970
<v Speaker 1>There's like a quiet afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3189
02:13:39.090 --> 02:13:40.290
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

3190
02:13:40.291 --> 02:13:42.730
<v Speaker 1>everything feels like it works better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3191
02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:45.150
<v Speaker 1>And then when I do it on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>

3192
02:13:45.570 --> 02:13:46.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel the same way about </v>

3193
02:13:47.071 --> 02:13:47.904
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy when I do cryotherapy on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular basis to everything seems to </v>

3194
02:13:50.701 --> 02:13:51.400
<v Speaker 1>work better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3195
02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:52.233
<v Speaker 3>See I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only do cryo therapy a couple times </v>

3196
02:13:54.731 --> 02:13:59.410
<v Speaker 3>and it hurt my boobs like so much that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3197
02:13:59.411 --> 02:14:00.550
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3198
02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:01.653
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go all ice bath and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean the thing is I'll get an ice bath </v>

3199
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:07.143
<v Speaker 3>and I'm really like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get in but I'm complaining the </v>

3200
02:14:10.121 --> 02:14:11.320
<v Speaker 3>whole way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3201
02:14:11.321 --> 02:14:14.620
<v Speaker 3>like not not saying one nice thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you or your Mama.</v>

3202
02:14:14.621 --> 02:14:18.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm getting in there and I'll do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm ready and oh man,</v>

3203
02:14:18.850 --> 02:14:20.380
<v Speaker 3>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awful.</v>

3204
02:14:20.381 --> 02:14:23.860
<v Speaker 3>And those cryotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like I appreciate the speed.</v>

3205
02:14:23.861 --> 02:14:24.694
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like do you really feel that they </v>

3206
02:14:28.061 --> 02:14:28.894
<v Speaker 3>get through all of those layers of skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like down to the optimal level on your </v>

3207
02:14:32.051 --> 02:14:32.884
<v Speaker 3>tissue?</v>

3208
02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

3209
02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:36.710
<v Speaker 1>It's cold shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is,</v>

3210
02:14:36.711 --> 02:14:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they really got it through </v>
<v Speaker 1>your skin,</v>

3211
02:14:38.091 --> 02:14:39.240
<v Speaker 1>you'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3212
02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:40.093
<v Speaker 1>They're really got through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is that your body produces </v>

3213
02:14:43.611 --> 02:14:44.444
<v Speaker 1>these cold shock proteins in response to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's over are under 150 </v>

3214
02:14:48.981 --> 02:14:50.900
<v Speaker 1>degrees below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sweet spot.</v>

3215
02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Apparently when you hit that 150 degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>below zero,</v>

3216
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:57.380
<v Speaker 1>your body produces all these massive in </v>
<v Speaker 1>antiinflammatory properties.</v>

3217
02:14:57.381 --> 02:14:58.214
<v Speaker 1>Cause again it thinks it's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like freaking out and people </v>

3218
02:15:02.181 --> 02:15:03.014
<v Speaker 1>with arthritis and people with severe </v>
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune issues where they have a lot </v>

3219
02:15:07.071 --> 02:15:08.390
<v Speaker 1>of inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

3220
02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:10.700
<v Speaker 1>real problems with their joints in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

3221
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.960
<v Speaker 1>They have huge results from cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a bunch of people that go to</v>

3222
02:15:14.961 --> 02:15:15.794
<v Speaker 1>my place that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that it's really essentially </v>

3223
02:15:18.021 --> 02:15:18.854
<v Speaker 1>change their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just in pain all the time and </v>

3224
02:15:20.511 --> 02:15:22.850
<v Speaker 1>now they know all they have to do is go </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3225
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:26.420
<v Speaker 1>step in that thing for three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave and they're going to feel better.</v>

3226
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:30.440
<v Speaker 1>And they just feel looser and relaxed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatever their flare ups and instead</v>

3227
02:15:30.441 --> 02:15:32.690
<v Speaker 1>of their condition deteriorating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're conditioned,</v>

3228
02:15:32.691 --> 02:15:34.220
<v Speaker 1>improved and stabilized.</v>

3229
02:15:34.690 --> 02:15:35.523
<v Speaker 3>Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's about your body in the chemical </v>

3230
02:15:37.061 --> 02:15:39.280
<v Speaker 3>value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the cold itself.</v>

3231
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:41.710
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about your body freaking out.</v>

3232
02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:42.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yag Go,</v>

3233
02:15:42.890 --> 02:15:46.360
<v Speaker 3>what does this bitch doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 150 degrees below zero.</v>

3234
02:15:46.510 --> 02:15:47.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3235
02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:50.330
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel so good.</v>

3236
02:15:50.331 --> 02:15:53.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what does it for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I get out all my God,</v>

3237
02:15:53.871 --> 02:15:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this rush of,</v>

3238
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it called,</v>

3239
02:15:59.991 --> 02:16:01.850
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3240
02:16:02.150 --> 02:16:04.310
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this rush of it in your brain.</v>

3241
02:16:04.311 --> 02:16:07.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just took an awesome drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's feel fantastic.</v>

3242
02:16:07.431 --> 02:16:09.080
<v Speaker 1>I get out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun feels great,</v>

3243
02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:11.660
<v Speaker 1>people look better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything just feels better.</v>

3244
02:16:11.850 --> 02:16:14.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do two sessions too.</v>

3245
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:15.103
<v Speaker 1>I do three minutes and then I go out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes and then I go back in for </v>

3246
02:16:17.871 --> 02:16:20.330
<v Speaker 1>another three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how many times a week.</v>

3247
02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:21.433
<v Speaker 1>I try to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how many times I'd do the </v>

3248
02:16:23.571 --> 02:16:27.080
<v Speaker 1>sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do one or the other four times</v>

3249
02:16:27.081 --> 02:16:27.914
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So either I'm doing the sauna or I'm </v>

3250
02:16:29.411 --> 02:16:30.244
<v Speaker 1>doing cryo.</v>

3251
02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 2>So you don't do both in the same day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some temperature manipulation.</v>

3252
02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3253
02:16:34.930 --> 02:16:36.310
<v Speaker 1>four time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four days a week.</v>

3254
02:16:36.370 --> 02:16:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And if I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do hot yoga,</v>

3255
02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:39.693
<v Speaker 1>which is another form of temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulation obviously cause you're 104 </v>

3256
02:16:42.311 --> 02:16:44.950
<v Speaker 1>degrees and you know you're there for 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

3257
02:16:44.951 --> 02:16:49.000
<v Speaker 1>sweating it out and that it mean it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not as hot in the room,</v>

3258
02:16:49.001 --> 02:16:49.834
<v Speaker 1>but your body absolutely has that same </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that it has inside the sauna </v>

3259
02:16:53.231 --> 02:16:56.530
<v Speaker 1>where you just let claustrophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get the fuck out of here.</v>

3260
02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3261
02:16:57.770 --> 02:16:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will try.</v>

3262
02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna send you this Emoji.</v>

3263
02:17:04.151 --> 02:17:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how you'll know I'm there </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>

3264
02:17:06.491 --> 02:17:08.240
<v Speaker 2>One Sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

3265
02:17:08.241 --> 02:17:09.950
<v Speaker 2>I sit in there and I just turn up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jams.</v>

3266
02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Well if you look good,</v>

3267
02:17:11.090 --> 02:17:15.200
<v Speaker 1>the song and just stick with a sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think they're both really good.</v>

3268
02:17:15.380 --> 02:17:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3269
02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:18.790
<v Speaker 2>What if I get in the cold shower after </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sauna?</v>

3270
02:17:18.791 --> 02:17:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Is that count?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this thing.</v>

3271
02:17:19.841 --> 02:17:20.860
<v Speaker 2>I like doing that too.</v>

3272
02:17:21.470 --> 02:17:22.303
<v Speaker 1>Doing that after yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the winter when the water </v>

3273
02:17:24.051 --> 02:17:24.884
<v Speaker 1>gets real cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to get in that fucking cold </v>

3274
02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:27.950
<v Speaker 1>shower and just really large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3275
02:17:27.951 --> 02:17:28.784
<v Speaker 1>I feel the two of them and you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC has that set up to where they have </v>

3276
02:17:32.961 --> 02:17:36.320
<v Speaker 1>the Jacuzzi right next to the cold bath </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they got that cold plunge.</v>

3277
02:17:36.321 --> 02:17:39.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like set to below 50 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hop in there,</v>

3278
02:17:39.561 --> 02:17:41.990
<v Speaker 1>freeze your ass off and then hop in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sauna.</v>

3279
02:17:42.170 --> 02:17:43.003
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's like really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits to doing that back and forth </v>

3280
02:17:45.021 --> 02:17:45.854
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3281
02:17:45.910 --> 02:17:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was um,</v>

3282
02:17:47.530 --> 02:17:49.930
<v Speaker 2>the last fight out there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3283
02:17:50.250 --> 02:17:53.500
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting in that hot tub and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I didn't have the sauna,</v>

3284
02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:54.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hooked up.</v>

3285
02:17:54.461 --> 02:17:55.294
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to go in the hot tub and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I laid on like the partition </v>

3286
02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:58.713
<v Speaker 2>and I had like one leg dangling in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold pool and one leg dangling and then </v>

3287
02:18:01.090 --> 02:18:03.430
<v Speaker 2>the water's really good looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

3288
02:18:03.770 --> 02:18:06.820
<v Speaker 2>But when you're just starving and dying </v>
<v Speaker 2>and give no fucks anymore,</v>

3289
02:18:06.821 --> 02:18:07.654
<v Speaker 2>it's just like I'm laying there like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Mackenzie dern was laying over </v>

3290
02:18:10.121 --> 02:18:12.730
<v Speaker 2>there look a little worse than me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

3291
02:18:13.130 --> 02:18:13.963
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3292
02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.410
<v Speaker 1>What did you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would she miss weight by seven pounds?</v>

3293
02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Dutch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy,</v>

3294
02:18:17.671 --> 02:18:18.180
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

3295
02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:20.220
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3296
02:18:20.250 --> 02:18:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I was literally sitting in the locker </v>
<v Speaker 2>room with her,</v>

3297
02:18:22.890 --> 02:18:27.150
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're giggling at UFC two to 22 like,</v>

3298

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3299

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you do about that?</v>

3302

<v Speaker 2>do you really want to like,</v>

3303

<v Speaker 2>what was the date of that?</v>

3307
02:18:47.550 --> 02:18:52.550
<v Speaker 2>March 3rd and then to come down much </v>
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

3308
02:18:52.741 --> 02:18:55.530
<v Speaker 2>like she got her fight right away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>announced right away,</v>

3309
02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:57.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she was fighting me.</v>

3310
02:18:57.060 --> 02:18:58.740
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 19th or something.</v>

3311
02:18:59.250 --> 02:19:02.370
<v Speaker 2>And it was just like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you have that data in mind,</v>

3312
02:19:02.371 --> 02:19:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted,</v>

3313
02:19:03.451 --> 02:19:05.560
<v Speaker 2>it's not me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's her,</v>

3314
02:19:05.561 --> 02:19:06.810
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have her body.</v>

3315
02:19:06.811 --> 02:19:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't have her problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have her life.</v>

3316
02:19:08.261 --> 02:19:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3317
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:09.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not my,</v>

3318
02:19:09.930 --> 02:19:10.763
<v Speaker 2>not doesn't mean anything to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to know you have a fight and it's </v>

3319
02:19:16.111 --> 02:19:18.870
<v Speaker 2>signed up and it's ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like at that point it's maintenance.</v>

3320
02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3321
02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:20.333
<v Speaker 2>it's maintenance like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not even doing anything </v>

3322
02:19:22.621 --> 02:19:23.670
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just maintenance.</v>

3323
02:19:23.671 --> 02:19:26.970
<v Speaker 2>But like these weight cuts are harder </v>
<v Speaker 2>and harder on us.</v>

3324
02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:28.280
<v Speaker 2>We get older.</v>

3325
02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what her body's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3326
02:19:30.590 --> 02:19:31.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

3327
02:19:31.011 --> 02:19:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I think she's 25.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's young and I don't,</v>

3328
02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that,</v>

3329
02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:36.373
<v Speaker 3>to make 115 pounds asks of her and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if she's on her period </v>

3330
02:19:39.861 --> 02:19:40.694
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno if that makes a difference to </v>

3331

3355
02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:39.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's good.</v>

3356
02:20:39.571 --> 02:20:41.310
<v Speaker 3>We competed against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3357
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was beating her ass.</v>

3358
02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it was rough.</v>

3359
02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:49.350
<v Speaker 3>It was rough because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I it was worlds,</v>

3360
02:20:49.351 --> 02:20:51.630
<v Speaker 3>we were both purple belts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the open division.</v>

3361
02:20:51.631 --> 02:20:52.464
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was heavier than her by the next </v>

3362
02:20:54.121 --> 02:20:56.170
<v Speaker 3>weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3363
02:20:57.810 --> 02:20:58.643
<v Speaker 3>I went to take her down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I double leg dural big and then like </v>

3364
02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:04.410
<v Speaker 3>where we landed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if this is like the square,</v>

3365
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:05.423
<v Speaker 3>we landed like right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they called it out and so they </v>

3366
02:21:09.001 --> 02:21:10.320
<v Speaker 3>reset us in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So no points.</v>

3367
02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:11.173
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we get in the middle because she's </v>

3368
02:21:12.841 --> 02:21:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Mckenzie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darren,</v>

3369
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:18.230
<v Speaker 3>because I'm not resilient enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would,</v>

3370
02:21:18.231 --> 02:21:19.620
<v Speaker 3>they start us again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3371
02:21:19.621 --> 02:21:20.370
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3372
02:21:20.370 --> 02:21:21.090
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

3373
02:21:21.090 --> 02:21:22.590
<v Speaker 3>don't go near that line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3374
02:21:22.591 --> 02:21:25.470
<v Speaker 3>So I go and I shoot another double </v>
<v Speaker 3>picker up.</v>

3375
02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:27.300
<v Speaker 3>Go take her down again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing,</v>

3376
02:21:27.301 --> 02:21:28.134
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's out of bounds again because it was </v>

3377
02:21:30.871 --> 02:21:32.760
<v Speaker 3>too close because my double is like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tackle,</v>

3378
02:21:32.761 --> 02:21:33.540
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3379
02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:34.560
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3380
02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:38.940
<v Speaker 3>so we go back in the middle and we shake</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands and we go.</v>

3381
02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:39.893
<v Speaker 3>So this time I go shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pick her up and I look at the ref </v>

3382
02:21:41.731 --> 02:21:42.361
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like here.</v>

3383
02:21:42.361 --> 02:21:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this good?</v>

3384
02:21:43.450 --> 02:21:44.190
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put it down here.</v>

3385
02:21:44.190 --> 02:21:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So put her down,</v>

3386
02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:49.590
<v Speaker 3>go to pass her guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I passed.</v>

3387
02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:50.930
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3388
02:21:51.780 --> 02:21:55.200
<v Speaker 3>I think she had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sat back for a straight ankle lock and</v>

3389
02:21:55.201 --> 02:21:57.780
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they disqualified me.</v>

3390
02:21:58.020 --> 02:21:59.190
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

3391
02:21:59.191 --> 02:22:00.300

02:23:55.701 --> 02:23:56.534
<v Speaker 3>And so they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave me the points and then I pass </v>

3448
02:23:58.731 --> 02:23:59.564
<v Speaker 3>and they give me the points and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>sit back for that and now I'm </v>

3449
02:24:01.371 --> 02:24:05.840
<v Speaker 3>disqualified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like it is.</v>

3450
02:24:06.620 --> 02:24:08.270
<v Speaker 3>And I like her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3451
02:24:08.271 --> 02:24:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I like her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her dad was at my gym teaching a seminar</v>

3452
02:24:11.721 --> 02:24:14.360
<v Speaker 3>at my gym in Colorado like months </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>

3453
02:24:14.361 --> 02:24:17.930
<v Speaker 3>And so when the match is over and we go </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're like standing next to them,</v>

3454
02:24:17.931 --> 02:24:19.700
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

3455
02:24:20.490 --> 02:24:21.323
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3456
02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:22.193
<v Speaker 1>did you see that so many men on </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram of her after one day in </v>

3457
02:24:25.471 --> 02:24:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Liverpool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3458
02:24:28.350 --> 02:24:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you know people make fun of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>accent but it's not real?</v>

3459
02:24:30.930 --> 02:24:31.763
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jujitsu just told me that </v>

3460
02:24:33.241 --> 02:24:35.280
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She apparently,</v>

3461
02:24:35.730 --> 02:24:36.563
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people accents or weird to begin </v>

3462
02:24:39.091 --> 02:24:39.924
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why do people talk the way they </v>

3463
02:24:40.501 --> 02:24:41.334
<v Speaker 1>talk in the first place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the sound with the people around </v>

3464
02:24:43.081 --> 02:24:44.190
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geographical.</v>

3465
02:24:44.250 --> 02:24:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

3466
02:24:45.211 --> 02:24:46.044
<v Speaker 1>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a video that somebody made </v>

3467
02:24:47.191 --> 02:24:48.024
<v Speaker 1>of Mckinsey during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after one day in Liverpool and it's </v>

3468
02:24:49.801 --> 02:24:53.400
<v Speaker 1>basically her talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Darren tills voice instead.</v>

3469
02:24:55.980 --> 02:24:57.570
<v Speaker 1>It's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rough.</v>

3470
02:24:57.571 --> 02:24:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not playing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't play a JV.</v>

3471
02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't even pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not do that to her.</v>

3472
02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:06.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3473
02:25:06.931 --> 02:25:09.270
<v Speaker 1>because I was super confused when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed her.</v>

3474
02:25:09.410 --> 02:25:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when she won in the UFC,</v>

3475
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:17.810
<v Speaker 3>they wanted a translator and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

3476
02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Like she speaks perfect English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is really bizarre.</v>

3477
02:25:21.571 --> 02:25:24.730
<v Speaker 1>So George Greer Gel came in with me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3478
02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:26.500
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in case she gets messed up anymore,</v>

3479
02:25:26.501 --> 02:25:26.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

3480
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even question it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3481
02:25:28.001 --> 02:25:29.650
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was confused.</v>

3482
02:25:29.651 --> 02:25:30.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

3483
02:25:30.430 --> 02:25:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I know she speaks perfect English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is ridiculous.</v>

3484
02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Raised in Arizona right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she fucking speaks perfect English.</v>

3485
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:41.250
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if they were selling it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3486
02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whose idea it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3487
02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:45.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

3488
02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:47.740
<v Speaker 1>But the fucking Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

3489
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:48.623
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3490
02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:51.633
<v Speaker 3>Maybe</v>

3491
02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:53.630
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was like,</v>

3492
02:25:53.631 --> 02:25:56.120
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't question it.</v>

3493
02:25:56.121 --> 02:25:56.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3494
02:25:56.601 --> 02:25:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm just here to interviewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want her to,</v>

3495
02:25:58.371 --> 02:25:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wants to speak in Portuguese.</v>

3496
02:25:59.791 --> 02:26:01.790
<v Speaker 1>She wants to speak in English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

3497
02:26:01.791 --> 02:26:03.800
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you need a translator?</v>

3498
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

3499
02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know all that either.</v>

3500
02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:10.873
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She definitely speaks English really </v>

3501
02:26:12.351 --> 02:26:13.050
<v Speaker 1>well though.</v>

3502
02:26:13.050 --> 02:26:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a benefit to Brazilian?</v>

3503
02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:17.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3504
02:26:17.131 --> 02:26:19.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously that's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>demographic.</v>

3505
02:26:19.561 --> 02:26:20.394
<v Speaker 3>And his sport huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Primarily the biggest other than an </v>

3506
02:26:24.930 --> 02:26:26.020
<v Speaker 3>American American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3507
02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:29.970
<v Speaker 3>But I'm curious if there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit or a marketing.</v>

3508
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's or something to that would,</v>

3509
02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:33.090
<v Speaker 3>that would make that more,</v>

3510
02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:37.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilians have immense national pride,</v>

3511
02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:38.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her being a Brazilian and the </v>

3512
02:26:40.721 --> 02:26:43.940
<v Speaker 1>daughter of a Brazilian Jujitsu legend </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3513
02:26:43.941 --> 02:26:46.690
<v Speaker 1>and speaking perfect Portuguese and </v>
<v Speaker 1>English and I'm just,</v>

3514
02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe that's the idea behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3515
02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:50.010
<v Speaker 1>She's</v>

3516
02:26:50.010 --> 02:26:50.843
<v Speaker 3>killing it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like technically and with her style and </v>

3517
02:26:53.790 --> 02:26:57.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean like everything that she brings </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the table is,</v>

3518
02:26:57.960 --> 02:26:59.430
<v Speaker 3>is already good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3519
02:26:59.431 --> 02:27:02.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like don't fuck that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't effect of with some,</v>

3520
02:27:02.780 --> 02:27:03.613
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3521
02:27:04.430 --> 02:27:05.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3522
02:27:05.201 --> 02:27:06.990
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes when I get around people,</v>

3523
02:27:06.991 --> 02:27:10.250
<v Speaker 3>like I feel bad because like I try to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like really empathetic and,</v>

3524
02:27:10.251 --> 02:27:11.084
<v Speaker 3>and when I'm around like foreigners and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I will totally slow down my </v>

3525
02:27:15.931 --> 02:27:16.764
<v Speaker 3>speaking so they will get it to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where sometimes I think I look </v>

3526
02:27:19.561 --> 02:27:20.890
<v Speaker 3>condescending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3527
02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:21.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'm like,</v>

3528
02:27:21.690 --> 02:27:22.523
<v Speaker 3>I just want this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is easy as possible for you because </v>

3529
02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm already awkward and like let me help</v>
<v Speaker 3>you out.</v>

3530
02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:29.940
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a different thing,</v>

3531
02:27:29.970 --> 02:27:30.803
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you remember when Madonna </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a fake English accent and everybody </v>

3532
02:27:32.981 --> 02:27:33.720
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pitch,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're from Brooklyn or wherever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you're from,</v>

3534
02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:38.580
<v Speaker 3>not from England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't do that.</v>

3535
02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:39.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3536
02:27:39.961 --> 02:27:41.760
<v Speaker 3>depending on who she's around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

3537
02:27:41.761 --> 02:27:42.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

3538
02:27:42.750 --> 02:27:43.583
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're around people that have </v>

3539
02:27:45.930 --> 02:27:46.980
<v Speaker 3>that accent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>

3540
02:27:46.981 --> 02:27:48.320
<v Speaker 3>you will pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3541
02:27:48.730 --> 02:27:50.830
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely had a Boston accent,</v>

3542
02:27:50.831 --> 02:27:55.720
<v Speaker 1>but I heard myself talk on tv once when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 19 it was a Boston guy.</v>

3543
02:27:56.810 --> 02:27:58.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get rid of that.</v>

3544
02:27:58.820 --> 02:27:59.653
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did I pick that up so quick and my </v>

<v Speaker 3>I get that and it will stick around for </v>

3547
02:28:05.691 --> 02:28:07.280
<v Speaker 3>a few weeks for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like the way they talk and Liverpool </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus the way they would talk and like </v>

3563
02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:49.190
<v Speaker 3>say London and let y'all sounded English</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

3564
02:28:49.191 --> 02:28:52.760
<v Speaker 3>You might as well be Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>

3565
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:54.980
<v Speaker 3>I get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sound different than me.</v>

3566
02:28:56.090 --> 02:28:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't get what's happening though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3567
02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:00.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't get the accent until like </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody like clue.</v>

3568
02:29:01.290 --> 02:29:05.870
<v Speaker 3>Like Darren tills clearly has like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Liverpool accent.</v>

3569
02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:08.150
<v Speaker 3>It's so clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>

3570
02:29:08.151 --> 02:29:09.800
<v Speaker 3>I still don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

3571
02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:12.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say he's from London.</v>

3572
02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:12.891
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3573
02:29:12.891 --> 02:29:13.724
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool English because English is it like </v>

3574
02:29:17.220 --> 02:29:18.053
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or like whoever was a ringing there had </v>

3575
02:29:20.061 --> 02:29:20.990
<v Speaker 3>like a list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3576
02:29:20.991 --> 02:29:21.824
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then that ended up being the </v>

3577
02:29:24.201 --> 02:29:25.034
<v Speaker 3>people picked up as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it a compliment or just how it </v>

3578
02:29:26.901 --> 02:29:27.734
<v Speaker 3>happened because that's how things were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like pronounced when they were being </v>

3579
02:29:29.991 --> 02:29:30.950
<v Speaker 3>explained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3580
02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:32.113
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's some kind of like speech </v>

3581
02:29:33.441 --> 02:29:36.160
<v Speaker 3>impediment that went along with every </v>
<v Speaker 3>different dialect.</v>

3582
02:29:36.161 --> 02:29:38.400
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean with,</v>

3583
02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:39.370
<v Speaker 3>with Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3584
02:29:39.371 --> 02:29:43.910
<v Speaker 3>the way they pronounce certain words is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because like some fucking king somewhere</v>

<v Speaker 3>along the line had a lisp.</v>
