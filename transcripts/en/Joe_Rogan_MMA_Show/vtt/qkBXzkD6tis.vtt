00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.113
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And we live John,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donna her.</v>

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very nice to see you.</v>

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 2>It's my pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nice to be with a fellow fanny pack</v>

6
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:15.654
<v Speaker 2>proponent as well and a now you have one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the beautiful higher primate leather </v>

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 2>bags like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

8
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan has just given me one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most beautiful fanny pics than I've ever</v>

9
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 2>seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

10
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I wear a very cheap fanny pack and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a thing of beauty.</v>

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.463
<v Speaker 2>I was just telling Joe About my student </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gordon Ryan was recently given a Gucci </v>

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.553
<v Speaker 2>Fanny Pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's literally the most beautiful thing </v>

13
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he wears it around me,</v>

14
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 2>I get insanely jealous and which you buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those.</v>

15
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like an $800 just on the principal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just on principle.</v>

16
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:51.384
<v Speaker 2>I can't buy an $800 fanny pack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could definitely step Gordon Ryan </v>

17
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 2>in the back with a knife and steal it </v>
<v Speaker 2>from and blamed it on Nicky Ryan.</v>

18
00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easily blame on his brother.</v>

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great TV series.</v>

20
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.193
<v Speaker 2>The fanny pack is making a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a slow comeback that a lot of </v>

21
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 2>people are reluctant to join there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're scared.</v>

22
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.153
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they worry about their position in the </v>

23
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 2>sexual food chain and with good reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

24
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.633
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like anybody that won't fuck you </v>

25
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 2>because you have a fanny pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to fuck them.</v>

26
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:23.950
<v Speaker 2>They're too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strong point.</v>

27
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.913
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always a battle of a appearance </v>

28
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 2>versus function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fanny,</v>

30
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 2>pex cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

31
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 2>very low on a parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but very high on function.</v>

32
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that one bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trend.</v>

33
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right between this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Gucci,</v>

34
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.243
<v Speaker 2>we've got something going on yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a video that I put up the other </v>

35
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 2>day of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

36
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 2>archery game is techno hunt thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is this big crazy elaborate thing.</v>

37
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.103
<v Speaker 2>I got more comments on the fact that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was wearing a fanny pack in the video </v>

38
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 2>than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were they positive or negative comments?</v>

39
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.093
<v Speaker 2>Negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

40
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 2>but that's my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's just the internet.</v>

41
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 2>The Internet is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet is extremely angry.</v>

42
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing you learned about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet.</v>

43
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 2>They you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could literally save a baby's life,</v>

44
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.653
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from and the 80% of the Internet we'll </v>

45
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 2>call you an asshole for doing so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

46
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what you do at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet is very angry.</v>

47
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.393
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Internet is is it shows what </v>

48
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 2>people are like when there's no social </v>
<v Speaker 2>cues.</v>

49
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.154
<v Speaker 2>When they're not in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to deal with like </v>

50
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:25.944
<v Speaker 2>looking you in the eye and what little </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird little hidden demons of jealousy </v>

51
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:31.164
<v Speaker 2>and anger and resentment and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty sad stories in it if that's what </v>

52
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:37.040
<v Speaker 2>we're really like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

53
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 2>it's not looking good for the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

54
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.143
<v Speaker 2>The kind of people that comment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general and what it shows you is that </v>

55
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:44.604
<v Speaker 2>99% of what we call human goodness and </v>
<v Speaker 2>politeness really comes out of fear of </v>

56
00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:49.374
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that for sure because </v>

57
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 2>there's no consequences when you talk on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line,</v>

58
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.843
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's the quality of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are making those kinds of </v>

59
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:56.544
<v Speaker 2>comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would say like if you look at </v>

60
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Youtube comments like Michael Jordan is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not leaving</v>

61
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.053
<v Speaker 3>youtube comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that leave Youtube Commons </v>

62
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:04.444
<v Speaker 3>and bitch and complain about things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually everything's not going so </v>

63
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:07.654
<v Speaker 3>fantastic in their own life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they have this forum now when they </v>

64
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.030
<v Speaker 3>feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

65
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 3>if there's a video that has 3 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>downloads,</v>

66
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 3>they also are on that video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are at the,</v>

67
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.570
<v Speaker 3>they're there in the comments section.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to them,</v>

68
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 3>they're a part of that unqualified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one asked him to be there.</v>

69
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Literally all you have to do is make an </v>
<v Speaker 3>account.</v>

70
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 3>No one has to know anything about your </v>
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>

71
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 3>the way your mind works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you've done with your life,</v>

72
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 3>what mistakes you've made doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter.</v>

73
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 3>You are old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck 66 and that's your name and you can</v>

74
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 3>say whatever you want and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

75
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.240
<v Speaker 3>your comments are right there with </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>

76
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.953
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very gal tarian but in a lot of </v>

77
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 3>ways it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

78
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

79
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's the best way</v>

80
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.430
<v Speaker 4>to get your information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

81
00:03:55.431 --> 00:03:57.650
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of truth to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

82
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.840
<v Speaker 4>So John,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

83
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 4>you are</v>

84
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.410
<v Speaker 3>one of the most fascinating characters </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the world of Jujitsu and the world of</v>

85
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:09.690
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for people who are not aware of your</v>

86
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:12.150
<v Speaker 3>background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you started out,</v>

87
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:14.010
<v Speaker 3>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you started out,</v>

88
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

89
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.663
<v Speaker 4>a philosophy student that's great days </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you were working as a bouncer and </v>

90
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 4>you were jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

91
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 4>You're a power lifter at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

92
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.710
<v Speaker 3>And you wanted to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend yourself.</v>

93
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.803
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't really a question of wanting </v>

94
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.581
<v Speaker 4>to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

95
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:29.271
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

96
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:30.390
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

97
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.160
<v Speaker 4>a pretty simple design that I had when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>grew up in New Zealand.</v>

98
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.220
<v Speaker 4>Martial arts was almost entirely based </v>
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>

99
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>striking pro is,</v>

100
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.090
<v Speaker 4>you'll back me up on this joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

101
00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 4>we're similar age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

102
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 4>when we grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

103
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.313
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's no exaggeration to say that the </v>

104
00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:50.630
<v Speaker 4>study of martial arts in English </v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking countries,</v>

105
00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:51.920
<v Speaker 4>North America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>western Europe,</v>

106
00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:55.560
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was absolutely dominated by the striking</v>

107
00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:56.930
<v Speaker 4>odds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

108
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.793
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you ask the average person who was </v>

109
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:04.040
<v Speaker 4>the best fighter in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would typically say whoever was the</v>

110
00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:06.380
<v Speaker 4>best boxer in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in the 1980s,</v>

111
00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:08.300
<v Speaker 4>Mike Tyson wasn't just the best boxer in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

112
00:05:08.301 --> 00:05:09.134
<v Speaker 4>He was the best fighter in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People always equated prowess and </v>

113
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 4>fighting with the ability to strike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

114
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.760
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in that time period.</v>

115
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.690
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

116
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.140
<v Speaker 4>I grew up doing a study setting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing as a,</v>

117
00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:24.974
<v Speaker 4>as a teenager in New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came to United States and for the </v>

118
00:05:27.591 --> 00:05:28.424
<v Speaker 4>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no wrestling culture in my </v>

119
00:05:29.451 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand has no wrestling culture.</v>

120
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.650
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the few countries that has </v>
<v Speaker 4>no indigenous raceland culture.</v>

121
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.910
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were,</v>

122
00:05:34.911 --> 00:05:37.370
<v Speaker 4>but it was kind of lost in the sands of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

123
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I grew up,</v>

124
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.780
<v Speaker 4>wrestling was something I saw once every</v>
<v Speaker 4>four years at the Olympics on TV.</v>

125
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.160
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

126
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.080
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even associate it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

127
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.660
<v Speaker 4>to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I disorders these strange sport with two</v>

128
00:05:50.661 --> 00:05:52.700
<v Speaker 4>guys tackled each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

129
00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:54.350
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I came to the United States and I was</v>

130
00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:56.270
<v Speaker 4>working as a bouncer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

131
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 4>America has much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more of a wrestling culture in it.</v>

132
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 4>In,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in New Zealand,</v>

133
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 4>when I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you fought,</v>

134
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 4>you were expected to fight with fists.</v>

135
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.353
<v Speaker 4>And if it went to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the two guys stood up and there was in </v>

136
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You stood up and he fought like a man.</v>

137
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 4>That was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

138
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

139
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 4>in the United States when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>bouncing,</v>

140
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.863
<v Speaker 4>I was absolutely shocked and impressed </v>
<v Speaker 4>by the prowess of judo players and </v>

141
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 4>wrestlers in street fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>working as a bounce.</v>

142
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 4>I worked alongside them and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>massively impressed.</v>

143
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 4>What year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is in the early 1990s.</v>

144
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:30.310
<v Speaker 4>I ride the United States in 1991.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

145
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 4>so I started working late night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a late 1991,</v>

146
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in New York City.</v>

147
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York is a very,</v>

148
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different city back then.</v>

149
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

150
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

151
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.093
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like two different cities </v>
<v Speaker 4>from what it is to be amazing how much </v>

152
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:46.064
<v Speaker 4>it's checked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a transformation is night and </v>

153
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's become like a giant Tgi Fridays now</v>

154
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.320
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty much what I did.</v>

155
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.600
<v Speaker 4>To give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

156
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 4>I used to live on West End Avenue on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>upper west side.</v>

157
00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.353
<v Speaker 4>When I would come home from working in </v>
<v Speaker 4>nightclubs at five 30 in the morning to </v>

158
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:04.184
<v Speaker 4>go to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there would be large numbers of street </v>

159
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 4>walking prostitutes on my block,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my avenue,</v>

160
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.463
<v Speaker 4>if that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you saw even a single street walking </v>

161
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.583
<v Speaker 4>prostitute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that area today would be front page </v>

162
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 4>news of the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be so shocking,</v>

163
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:26.084
<v Speaker 4>so completely out of people's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it would literally just people's </v>

164
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.990
<v Speaker 4>minds score is the best example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm square is an extreme example because</v>

165
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 4>times square used to be all CD peep </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows,</v>

166
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 4>nothing but cd peep shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's like Guy Fieri restaurants.</v>

167
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 4>It's all television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the transformation is huge.</v>

168
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 4>So that was the New York that I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>into and uh,</v>

169
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a violent New York.</v>

170
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.513
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1991 I believe was the year with the </v>

171
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 4>highest murder rate in recorded history </v>
<v Speaker 4>of New York City.</v>

172
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.880
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

173
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.600
<v Speaker 4>it was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different New York City.</v>

174
00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 4>It's not what you see today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I came into this environment,</v>

175
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:03.970
<v Speaker 4>I saw all these people were incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>adept and,</v>

176
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 4>and they were using grant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>linkedin,</v>

177
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:07.250
<v Speaker 4>nick to do to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this impressed me a lot.</v>

178
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.713
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>

179
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shortly after that time,</v>

180
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was always working.</v>

181
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started to hear,</v>

182
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 4>talk about this show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this ultimate fighting show.</v>

183
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 4>And there was this Brazilian guy who had</v>
<v Speaker 4>beaten everyone.</v>

184
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 4>He was wrestling people and strangling </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and locking their arms,</v>

185
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 4>things like desk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that I'd never heard of.</v>

186
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

187
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 4>I'd heard this and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

188
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 4>one day I was teaching at Columbia </v>
<v Speaker 4>University in a close friend of mine who</v>

189
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 4>was also in the phd program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>came into my office.</v>

190
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 4>It was office hours and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

191
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:36.764
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you work as a balance them and I </v>

192
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

193
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 4>you look at night and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

194
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Speaker 4>I started doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this martial art,</v>

195
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:49.661
<v Speaker 4>it's called Brazilian Jujitsu and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's mostly fall on the ground.</v>

196
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:50.744
<v Speaker 4>I remember you said most of the flights </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get into people who put down on the </v>

197
00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 4>ground and they wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

198
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:57.084
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was wondering if you would be </v>

199
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:58.674
<v Speaker 4>interested in doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and </v>

200
00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 4>yet I never associated marshawn's with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazil for me,</v>

201
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 4>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

202
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 4>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Korea,</v>

203
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.850
<v Speaker 4>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what do they got capital wearing,</v>

204
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.743
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

205
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.190
<v Speaker 4>Who is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

206
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 4>It isn't you to see like Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what does it,</v>

207
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.360
<v Speaker 4>isn't it like a contradiction of terms </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Brazil,</v>

208
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

209
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.993
<v Speaker 4>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time I was around 230 pounds and </v>

210
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.413
<v Speaker 4>this guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't be more than 140 and he'd only </v>

211
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.960
<v Speaker 4>been training two weeks.</v>

212
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

213
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.130
<v Speaker 4>he goes to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

214
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.403
<v Speaker 4>we go in the ground and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we wrestle on the ground and I was </v>

215
00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:36.534
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

216
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 4>let me put you in a headlock and let's </v>
<v Speaker 4>see what you can do.</v>

217
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.010
<v Speaker 4>So I shut the door of the office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cleared out the furniture,</v>

218
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 4>chat support,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get on the ground.</v>

219
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.193
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

220
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.010
<v Speaker 4>I had the only thing I knew how to do on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground in those,</v>

221
00:09:49.011 --> 00:09:50.160
<v Speaker 4>this was headlock be run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

222
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:51.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a strong guy.</v>

223
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.320
<v Speaker 4>It pretty nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Headlock and I'm,</v>

224
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.660
<v Speaker 4>so I grabbed my poor little friend and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and throttle them with,</v>

225
00:09:56.661 --> 00:09:57.494
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

226
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>basically,</v>

227
00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids get time,</v>

228
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.640
<v Speaker 4>may type headlock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

229
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to my shock and horror,</v>

230
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 4>he started slipping around behind me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>started holding hotter and hotter.</v>

231
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:09.054
<v Speaker 4>And then about two minutes when guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I really had no real control over </v>

232
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 4>him and he was starting to get around </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind me.</v>

233
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 4>Now I didn't know back attacks where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>had complete naive at the,</v>

234
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:17.274
<v Speaker 4>on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I could feel something bad was </v>

235
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone getting behind you.</v>

236
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.950
<v Speaker 4>It never a good thing in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

237
00:10:20.951 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was getting tired,</v>

238
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 4>my arms were getting tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no control of the guy.</v>

239
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 4>And finally he slept at night to stand </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and run away.</v>

240
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.050
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you kidding me?</v>

241
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm twice your size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've been training to goddamn weeks.</v>

242
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:33.030
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if this was a real fight,</v>

243
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 4>he would have got away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm tired.</v>

244
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 4>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was just saying,</v>

245
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 4>if he did this in two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what could you do?</v>

246
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:41.850
<v Speaker 4>Some training?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was fascinated.</v>

247
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:43.620
<v Speaker 4>I went down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

248
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 4>got completely destroyed on my first </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

249
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or it was hilarious.</v>

250
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 4>Who was there on this first thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt Serra was the most,</v>

251
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a blue belt at the time.</v>

252
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so even on that first day you met people</v>

253
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:58.590
<v Speaker 4>that would become very important in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life later on.</v>

254
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.983
<v Speaker 4>And I vowed to the moon and the stars </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I would at least become competent </v>

255
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.013
<v Speaker 4>and the game I couldn't live with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that I was incompetent at an </v>

256
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 4>important element of fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to be a world champ.</v>

257
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 4>I didn't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to be competent and um,</v>

258
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.603
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that would make my bouncing </v>

259
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:20.580
<v Speaker 4>work significantly easier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was absolutely true.</v>

260
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.360
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within a very,</v>

261
00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:25.860
<v Speaker 4>very short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>balancing got massively easier for me.</v>

262
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.140
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've bought,</v>

263
00:11:28.141 --> 00:11:28.974
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you always get this cliched Jujitsu </v>

264
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 4>saves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Judas was saved my life.</v>

265
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.890
<v Speaker 4>How many people need to hear people say </v>
<v Speaker 4>that all the time?</v>

266
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can think of without any question.</v>

267
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:38.814
<v Speaker 4>There are four times in my life that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu actually did save my life </v>

268
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.580
<v Speaker 4>balance.</v>

269
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 4>I can say that with complete honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

270
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a cliche for most people.</v>

271
00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:46.770
<v Speaker 4>It for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

272
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.600
<v Speaker 4>it did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

273
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.900
<v Speaker 4>so it made a massive difference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I still saw it as it was interesting</v>

274
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.413
<v Speaker 4>and something I just wanted to gain </v>
<v Speaker 4>competence in that fundamentally </v>

275
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is really,</v>

276
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 4>at that point I wanted to finish my phd </v>
<v Speaker 4>and become a professor.</v>

277
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:06.220
<v Speaker 4>That's what was my original goal when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>came to United States.</v>

278
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but things started to change when,</v>

279
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.863
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the three senior students at the hands </v>

280
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:13.234
<v Speaker 4>of Gracie Academy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he caught all made a met Sarah and hold </v>

281
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Rio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gracie all went their separate ways.</v>

282
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.853
<v Speaker 4>They had to go out and start their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>schools and Hindou was busy fighting </v>

283
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 4>professionally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japan,</v>

284
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.340
<v Speaker 4>so he couldn't be at the academy all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

285
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 4>And he came to and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

286
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to be a teacher.</v>

287
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no one else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how long have you been Tryna,</v>

288
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe if I go to the,</v>

289
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.933
<v Speaker 4>it was around four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe I was a purple belt when I </v>

290
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 4>first started teaching at hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those,</v>

291
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't quote me on that,</v>

292
00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 4>but I'll have to go back and check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I believe that's,</v>

293
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.140
<v Speaker 4>and why did he come to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

294
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 4>probably because he felt sorry for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

295
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

296
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 4>I was there a lot and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

297
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe he saw some enthusiasm </v>
<v Speaker 4>while you are obsessed.</v>

298
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.270
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like you were there daily.</v>

299
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That became much more so when I become a</v>

300
00:12:57.821 --> 00:13:00.130
<v Speaker 4>teacher because I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

301
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.353
<v Speaker 4>I'm filling big shoes here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You must remember all three of those </v>

302
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:05.830
<v Speaker 4>names that I just mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All three were world champions.</v>

303
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These were good,</v>

304
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 4>good people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for that time they were,</v>

305
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.300
<v Speaker 4>they would kill us.</v>

306
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:15.930
<v Speaker 4>And here I am a phd student.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I've got to fill in these shoes.</v>

307
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.610
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to get serious about this.</v>

308
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 4>So I made a commitment to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

309
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.010
<v Speaker 4>to becoming the best possible teacher I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could.</v>

310
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 4>Now you must remember I went in as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>teacher.</v>

311
00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 4>That was my first assignment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

312
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.040
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I decided my primary focus in Jujitsu</v>

313
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.080
<v Speaker 4>would be upon teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

314
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.033
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fortunate I came from an academic </v>

315
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:38.980
<v Speaker 4>background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had many brilliant,</v>

316
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.250
<v Speaker 4>brilliant professors coming through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophy programs,</v>

317
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:44.260
<v Speaker 4>both in New Zealand and the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>

318
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.723
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Columbia University had a fantastic PhD </v>

319
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:48.430
<v Speaker 4>program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

320
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.920
<v Speaker 4>so I was very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

321
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.950
<v Speaker 4>experience and the art of teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in an academic context.</v>

322
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:55.383
<v Speaker 4>And I thought maybe this has given me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>faith has given me this angle where I </v>

323
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:05.020
<v Speaker 4>can use an academic approach to teaching</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a sports environment.</v>

324
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:06.783
<v Speaker 4>And that has really become one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>patterns of my approach to teaching a </v>

325
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:11.914
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu.</v>

326
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.750
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

327
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.890
<v Speaker 3>in the 90s and you are a purple belt at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

328
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.430
<v Speaker 3>When did you develop this leg lock </v>
<v Speaker 3>system that has become so legendary?</v>

329
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:24.994
<v Speaker 3>So for people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the uninitiated that have never </v>

330
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 3>heard of you or understand what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about here,</v>

331
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.773
<v Speaker 3>for the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu was primarily attacks on the </v>

332
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:39.520
<v Speaker 3>arms and the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty much it.</v>

333
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 3>And there were known attacks on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>legs,</v>

334
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.310
<v Speaker 3>but they were frowned upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

335
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something happened you,</v>

336
00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:49.600
<v Speaker 3>you got to see some of those techniques </v>
<v Speaker 3>in mma,</v>

337
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:52.460
<v Speaker 3>you got to see some heel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally foot locks.</v>

338
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a few guys are lawsky pulled off</v>
<v Speaker 3>a a foot lock in the UFC against Tim.</v>

339
00:14:56.871 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Sylvia has a few guys that were pulling </v>
<v Speaker 3>these off.</v>

340
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 3>This is pre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some are Paul Harris,</v>

341
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.103
<v Speaker 3>but you all of a sudden came along with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this very effective system that there </v>

342
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 3>was rumblings many years ago about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>where a lot of people were talking about</v>

343
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:17.820
<v Speaker 3>it and a lot of people were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

344
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.673
<v Speaker 3>John Danaher has this insane leg lock </v>
<v Speaker 3>system and then you started developing </v>

345
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.400
<v Speaker 3>all these chat for people don't know the</v>
<v Speaker 3>top grapplers in the ward.</v>

346
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.233
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of top grapplers in the </v>

347
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:32.000
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is incredibly competitive,</v>

348
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:32.834
<v Speaker 3>but you're recognized as being one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the premiere coaches of the most </v>

349
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 3>promising young people like Gordon Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you're talking about before,</v>

350
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:43.960

<v Speaker 3>Garry Tonin,</v>

351
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Nikki Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Cummings.</v>

352
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.023
<v Speaker 3>You have an incredible crew of world </v>
<v Speaker 3>class strangle artists who are also </v>

353
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:56.270
<v Speaker 3>known to be some of the very best leg </v>
<v Speaker 3>lockers in the world.</v>

354
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 3>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did that,</v>

355
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.130
<v Speaker 3>how did that all take place?</v>

356
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go through,</v>

357
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should talk about the history of,</v>

358
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.521
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let,</v>

359
00:16:05.521 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 4>let,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let Habu you've actually asked about six</v>

360
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:08.234
<v Speaker 4>different questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

361
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.520
<v Speaker 4>It's good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we can answer them in turn.</v>

362
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 4>So let's go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's the first question.</v>

363
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:13.910
<v Speaker 4>Your first question was a historical </v>
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>

364
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.030
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did it happen?</v>

365
00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

366
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.340
<v Speaker 4>first off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

367
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.750
<v Speaker 4>there was nothing in my early,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

368
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:22.580
<v Speaker 4>learnings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

369
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.720
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Jujitsu,</v>

370
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:25.280
<v Speaker 4>which suggested leg logs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

371
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.270
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

372
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.290
<v Speaker 4>hinder would teach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

373
00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 4>I should say my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

374
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 4>my sensei throughout my entire career </v>
<v Speaker 4>has been hindered.</v>

375
00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:32.190
<v Speaker 4>Gracie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

376
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 4>I never left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He ends up,</v>

377
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 4>he taught me from white belt to black </v>
<v Speaker 4>belt and I never left as academy.</v>

378
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.593
<v Speaker 4>I'm the only one of his students who </v>
<v Speaker 4>stayed with them from white belt to </v>

379
00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:42.800
<v Speaker 4>black belt and never left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

380
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so hence it would teach leg,</v>

381
00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:45.754
<v Speaker 4>lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was taught in always the same </v>

382
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.390
<v Speaker 4>fashion that everyone else that here's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>move has a fig of auto.</v>

383
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Speaker 4>Here's a heel hook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't achilles lock.</v>

384
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.521
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>

385
00:16:54.521 --> 00:16:56.420
<v Speaker 4>the moves themselves when no one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

386
00:16:56.421 --> 00:16:58.370
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were there.</v>

387
00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.213
<v Speaker 4>They were in existence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like I invented he hawks or </v>

388
00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:02.690
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea.</v>

389
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they weren't emphasized.</v>

390
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.390
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

391
00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very uh,</v>

392
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.150
<v Speaker 4>talented and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

393
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.193
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>influential figure in my life was a guy </v>

394
00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:19.820
<v Speaker 4>that I only knew for three days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that sounds,</v>

395
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.820
<v Speaker 4>that sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

396
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 4>How can you learn something from someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>in three days?</v>

397
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.613
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually the influence he had occurred </v>

398
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:26.384
<v Speaker 4>in three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big believer in the idea that </v>

399
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:30.374
<v Speaker 4>someone can come into your life for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very short period of time and have a </v>

400
00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:39.641
<v Speaker 4>massive influence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I truly believe that in my case it was a</v>

401
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.300
<v Speaker 4>great American graphical dean list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dean lister was invited by Matt Serra to</v>

402
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:46.400
<v Speaker 4>come to the Hansa Gracie Academy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

403
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.590
<v Speaker 4>don't quote me on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I believe dean was a brown butter at</v>

404
00:17:48.591 --> 00:17:48.890
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

405
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure matt was a brown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the time too.</v>

406
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.043
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bought him in for around three days </v>

407
00:17:53.901 --> 00:17:54.734
<v Speaker 4>and he trained mostly with Matt Serra </v>
<v Speaker 4>and preparation for a grappling </v>

408
00:17:56.551 --> 00:17:57.300
<v Speaker 4>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I,</v>

409
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.680
<v Speaker 4>if I remember correctly now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dean was one,</v>

410
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:03.900
<v Speaker 4>mostly in those days for his Achilles </v>
<v Speaker 4>lock.</v>

411
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 4>It later on he would become a heel hook </v>
<v Speaker 4>specialists.</v>

412
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 4>But in those days it was mostly an </v>
<v Speaker 4>Achilles lock.</v>

413
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.950
<v Speaker 4>And he came to the academy role with </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people and he did a,</v>

414
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.190
<v Speaker 4>he was doing a logs and getting some </v>
<v Speaker 4>success.</v>

415
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.470
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

416
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.700
<v Speaker 4>went both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

417
00:18:16.701 --> 00:18:18.360
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

418
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't really get his stuff to work</v>

419
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:21.324
<v Speaker 4>on Matt Serra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Matt Serra could get his stuff to work </v>

420
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:24.030
<v Speaker 4>on him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

421
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.223
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was doing something which was </v>

422
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.833
<v Speaker 4>unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I talked with them just briefly </v>

423
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.690
<v Speaker 4>after clients and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

424
00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:31.973
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting what you're doing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>these achilles lungs cause I don't </v>

425
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:35.070
<v Speaker 4>really do that at all.</v>

426
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 4>It's not something I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said one sentence,</v>

427
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 4>which completely changed my outlook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He cause why would you ignore 50% of the</v>

428
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 4>human body?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One sentence,</v>

429
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.530
<v Speaker 4>why would you ignore 50% of the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>body?</v>

430
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.480
<v Speaker 4>And I looked and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why,</v>

431
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.673
<v Speaker 4>why would you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes no sense and we never talked </v>

432
00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:02.240
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he went back to California.</v>

433
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:05.790
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to become too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too time adcc champion mostly with Laila</v>

434
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:06.790
<v Speaker 4>lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

435
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.980
<v Speaker 4>but what Dean gave me was not technique,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't show me a single technique,</v>

436
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:16.080
<v Speaker 4>but he gave me at point of view as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>give a man a point of view,</v>

437
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.870
<v Speaker 4>you can change them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

438
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.550
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can work from there.</v>

439
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.510
<v Speaker 4>That was the influence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

440
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 4>my Sensei Henzel Gracie was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely,</v>

441
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberal minded professor of Jujitsu.</v>

442
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 4>He would let us do whatever we wanted.</v>

443
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't one of those guys,</v>

444
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:34.674
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one in my academy studying lake </v>

445
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:36.510
<v Speaker 4>walks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was never like that.</v>

446
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:37.344
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would allow students to go in any </v>

447
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:39.744
<v Speaker 4>direction they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>provided they could prove it was </v>

448
00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:43.720
<v Speaker 4>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

449
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.663
<v Speaker 4>so I started studying leg locks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where I'm going to come to the </v>

450
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:50.220
<v Speaker 4>second question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you asked,</v>

451
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.760
<v Speaker 4>which is why did lake walls have such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad reputation?</v>

452
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 4>And you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it says curious,</v>

453
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:55.734
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't think about this way about our </v>

454
00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.363
<v Speaker 4>mugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to run through the main </v>

455
00:19:59.371 --> 00:20:01.740
<v Speaker 4>criticisms and your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be my witness on this jury.</v>

456
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:03.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've heard the same criticism</v>
<v Speaker 4>a thousand times.</v>

457
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.950
<v Speaker 4>You would always hear people refer to </v>
<v Speaker 4>leg locks in the following way first.</v>

458
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.500
<v Speaker 4>The first criticism level too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

459
00:20:10.501 --> 00:20:12.210
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you allow people to do leg walks,</v>

460
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.880
<v Speaker 4>everyone would be entered in a week and </v>
<v Speaker 4>units would be impossible.</v>

461
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.220
<v Speaker 4>So that was the first quarter than we </v>
<v Speaker 4>would always hear.</v>

462
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.010
<v Speaker 4>The second great criticism is they </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't work.</v>

463
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

464
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.000
<v Speaker 4>you might be to tap out a white belt </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a heel hook,</v>

465
00:20:24.001 --> 00:20:25.950
<v Speaker 4>but if you are a world championship </v>
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>

466
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.440
<v Speaker 4>you never got to tap anybody that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>work at high levels.</v>

467
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:29.723
<v Speaker 4>That by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those two criticisms seemed to go in </v>

468
00:20:31.081 --> 00:20:31.980
<v Speaker 4>opposite directions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they're,</v>

469
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.440
<v Speaker 4>if they're really that dangerous but </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't work,</v>

470
00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.300
<v Speaker 4>how does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do those through Gel,</v>

471
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:37.134
<v Speaker 4>they are either incredibly dangerous to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the point where they can't be practice </v>

472
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:42.330
<v Speaker 4>or they don't work that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The two arguments contradict each other.</v>

473
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.583
<v Speaker 4>Then you hear other arguments that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were positionally unsound that if you </v>

474
00:20:47.351 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 4>were in top position</v>

475
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.640
<v Speaker 5>and you went for a leg lock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would lose position and that was his</v>

476
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.720
<v Speaker 5>Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

477
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.613
<v Speaker 5>That's a criticism with no merit because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it that Chris St criticism applies to </v>

478
00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.590
<v Speaker 5>guillotines on bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

479
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:02.310
<v Speaker 5>You can be mounted on someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go for an arm lock in the loose position</v>

480
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.500
<v Speaker 5>ended up on bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no one criticizes ambos.</v>

481
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.073
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so as I went through the reasons why </v>

482
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 5>people criticized leg logging,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of them really made sense.</v>

483
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 5>So I started asking myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

484
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.693
<v Speaker 5>often the reasons people give as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 5>to what the real reasons are a very </v>

485
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the more I thought about it,</v>

486
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.490
<v Speaker 5>the more I thought the real reason </v>
<v Speaker 5>people donate leg,</v>

487
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:32.491
<v Speaker 5>lungs runs much deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's understand Jujitsu for what it is.</v>

488
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.260
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu is a systems based approach to </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting.</v>

489
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.773
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the system of Brazilian Jiu </v>

490
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.233
<v Speaker 5>Jitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 5>While it can be described in a few </v>

491
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:44.734
<v Speaker 5>different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to give you one rendition </v>

492
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Speaker 5>which is pretty simple and will resonate</v>
<v Speaker 5>with most of your listeners.</v>

493
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:56.250
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu is a system based around four </v>
<v Speaker 5>distinct steps.</v>

494
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.360
<v Speaker 5>You can add steps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can subtract steps,</v>

495
00:21:58.361 --> 00:21:59.194
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rendition I'm going to give you now </v>

496
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:02.530
<v Speaker 5>is probably probably the most widely </v>
<v Speaker 5>known.</v>

497
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:04.623
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say a friend of yours asked for </v>

498
00:22:06.761 --> 00:22:07.594
<v Speaker 5>advice on fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows you're a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu </v>

499
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:10.773
<v Speaker 5>expert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a black belt in Brazilian </v>

500
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said to me,</v>

501
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 5>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell me I didn't know anything.</v>

502
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.000
<v Speaker 5>I want to fight someone else using your </v>
<v Speaker 5>procedures.</v>

503
00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.530
<v Speaker 5>What are the steps?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was only just said,</v>

504
00:22:22.531 --> 00:22:24.340
<v Speaker 5>what's the system that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

505
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.203
<v Speaker 5>what is a system that had a spouses?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to see always that step </v>

506
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:30.940
<v Speaker 5>number one is take your opponent to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>

507
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why was he,</v>

508
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.010
<v Speaker 5>why do you think the ground is so </v>
<v Speaker 5>special?</v>

509
00:22:36.011 --> 00:22:39.550
<v Speaker 5>Why did rezone Cios who choose the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground as step number one of its system,</v>

510
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.713
<v Speaker 5>why do you think,</v>

511
00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all came out of judo,</v>

512
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:45.443
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Brazilian Jujitsu took the effective </v>

513
00:22:47.401 --> 00:22:49.890
<v Speaker 2>submission techniques of judo and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>just refine them.</v>

514
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.480
<v Speaker 2>That's these dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason,</v>

515
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.120
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the mechanical physical reason?</v>

516
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Because you can control someone on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground far better,</v>

517
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can control people.</v>

518
00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.273
<v Speaker 2>Loma Chenko control suite from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing position with angle and </v>

519
00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:01.860
<v Speaker 2>distance is different ways to control </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

520
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In boxing,</v>

521
00:23:04.471 --> 00:23:08.250
<v Speaker 2>if you only are boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why the ground?</v>

522
00:23:08.251 --> 00:23:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Why did they choose the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the mechanical reason?</v>

523
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.123
<v Speaker 2>What happens when you take a human being</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the ground while there's a whole </v>

524
00:23:13.921 --> 00:23:16.620
<v Speaker 2>barrier behind them that you can press </v>
<v Speaker 2>them against?</v>

525
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:17.843
<v Speaker 2>What about if you're in bottom position?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you could use that barrier as </v>

526
00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:21.624
<v Speaker 2>leverage?</v>

527
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.553
<v Speaker 5>True,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's something that occurs when </v>

528
00:23:25.351 --> 00:23:26.184
<v Speaker 5>someone goes down to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's something big that you may be </v>

529
00:23:27.871 --> 00:23:28.860
<v Speaker 5>missing here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What am I missing?</v>

530
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.770
<v Speaker 5>What's the most explosive event and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Olympic Games?</v>

531
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.633
<v Speaker 5>The the event that probably requires </v>
<v Speaker 5>more transfer of energy and development </v>

532
00:23:41.971 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 5>of kinetic energy than any other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch you name,</v>

533
00:23:45.531 --> 00:23:47.960
<v Speaker 5>but one of them for me is always going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be the javelin throw.</v>

534
00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.560
<v Speaker 5>The javelin throw involves a full </v>
<v Speaker 5>powered sprint,</v>

535
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.373
<v Speaker 5>a jump,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a massive explosive tuning of both hips </v>

536
00:23:58.431 --> 00:23:59.264
<v Speaker 5>and shoulders and a throw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the quintessential explosive </v>

537
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:04.874
<v Speaker 5>elements of the human body are involved </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the javelin throw probably to a </v>

538
00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:12.410
<v Speaker 5>greater degree than any other Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 5>event and as a result,</v>

539
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:17.411
<v Speaker 5>people can throw a javelin 80 90 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would happen if you took those same</v>

540
00:24:18.261 --> 00:24:22.700
<v Speaker 5>javelin throwers and made them perform </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same event on the knees?</v>

541
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.353
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't be so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably couldn't throw it more </v>

542
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:30.440
<v Speaker 5>than 10 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

543
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:32.720
<v Speaker 5>and what's changed?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The closer they get to the ground,</v>

544
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.290
<v Speaker 5>the less they can employ explosive </v>
<v Speaker 5>force.</v>

545
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.190
<v Speaker 5>What's the first thing cowboys do when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they go to brand is steer.</v>

546
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.110
<v Speaker 5>Take it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

547
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 5>They lock up into lakes and they put it </v>
<v Speaker 5>down on the ground.</v>

548
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.210
<v Speaker 5>Nobody tries to brand as standing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still,</v>

549
00:24:47.211 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get killed because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>can employ explosive dynamic movement to</v>

550
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 5>hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You put them on the ground.</v>

551
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.010
<v Speaker 5>Dynamic explosive movement is massively </v>
<v Speaker 5>curtailed.</v>

552
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.790
<v Speaker 5>It takes away the single riskiest </v>
<v Speaker 5>element of fighting,</v>

553
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 5>which is quick dynamic movement that can</v>
<v Speaker 5>generate kinetic energy.</v>

554
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:07.933
<v Speaker 5>So step number one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was going to do it so it was get it </v>

555
00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:11.360
<v Speaker 5>to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's inherently safer.</v>

556
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.530
<v Speaker 5>Less things can go catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lee,</v>

557
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.560
<v Speaker 5>wrong on the ground and in the standing </v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

558
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.090
<v Speaker 5>What step number two?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Secure.</v>

559
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:24.020
<v Speaker 5>Dominant position control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Control.</v>

560
00:25:24.021 --> 00:25:26.000
<v Speaker 5>Too vague.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's many ways to control people.</v>

561
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.310
<v Speaker 5>There's a definite step.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've just taken the guy down.</v>

562
00:25:28.311 --> 00:25:29.530
<v Speaker 5>What's your first thing and was on </v>
<v Speaker 5>units?</v>

563
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.373
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

564
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I would try to do is get</v>

565
00:25:33.191 --> 00:25:35.080
<v Speaker 2>to a dominant position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by that?</v>

566
00:25:35.081 --> 00:25:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Be My pass to side control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try to match it.</v>

567
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.311
<v Speaker 2>You just sounds it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It right.</v>

568
00:25:39.311 --> 00:25:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Then get past his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his legs.</v>

569
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Why legs are strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I carry you around.</v>

570
00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.450
<v Speaker 2>You could hold a person in position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

571
00:25:49.451 --> 00:25:52.000
<v Speaker 2>they're very good defensively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They dangerous.</v>

572
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Too dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

573
00:25:53.411 --> 00:25:55.360
<v Speaker 2>If I end up inside your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a skilled,</v>

574
00:25:55.361 --> 00:25:57.090
<v Speaker 2>juicy play can unlock me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Lake Logan,</v>

575
00:25:57.091 --> 00:25:59.470
<v Speaker 2>we can strangle me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you were an untrained,</v>

576
00:25:59.471 --> 00:26:00.580
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could up kick me.</v>

577
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.473
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mania man has been knocked out by an </v>

578
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.590
<v Speaker 2>upkick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even an untutored guy conforming up.</v>

579
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Get sure lakes are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So step number two is get pasta.</v>

580
00:26:08.231 --> 00:26:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Those dangerous lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What state number three?</v>

581
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Go for submission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

582
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.103
<v Speaker 2>he must be a 10th planet backbone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I hate to throw that in some rigid </v>

583
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.460
<v Speaker 2>step number three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

584
00:26:24.461 --> 00:26:26.170
<v Speaker 2>you're failing on pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

585
00:26:26.171 --> 00:26:27.970
<v Speaker 2>I pass the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

586
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to control.</v>

587
00:26:29.351 --> 00:26:32.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to either a mount or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

588
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:35.950
<v Speaker 2>side control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're on the right track trying to work</v>

589
00:26:35.951 --> 00:26:38.170
<v Speaker 2>your way through a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions.</v>

590
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to go to neon belly.</v>

591
00:26:39.551 --> 00:26:42.060
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go so I can draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to transition to mount.</v>

592
00:26:42.061 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 2>You going to transition to ray?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depending upon</v>

593
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.790
<v Speaker 5>my game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

594
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:45.623
<v Speaker 5>This is sequence of pins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once you get past your opponent's legs </v>

595
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 5>and Jujitsu encourages you to go through</v>
<v Speaker 5>those various pins.</v>

596
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:53.363
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the sport of Jiu Jitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pins score different amounts of </v>

597
00:26:56.161 --> 00:26:58.740
<v Speaker 5>points.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Neon belly scores,</v>

598
00:26:58.741 --> 00:27:01.500
<v Speaker 5>a certain amount.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mount position.</v>

599
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 5>School is more ray mountain school is </v>
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

600
00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.233
<v Speaker 5>Why you have a wonder about then why do </v>
<v Speaker 5>we score the pins of Jujitsu </v>

601
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:11.010
<v Speaker 5>differently?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

602
00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:14.520
<v Speaker 5>there's more available from rear mount.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course you have a,</v>

603
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 5>you can of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can tack the neck.</v>

604
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.650
<v Speaker 5>You can also attack the arms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

605
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:24.651
<v Speaker 5>you have a positional advantage where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't be attacked your,</v>

606
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.613
<v Speaker 5>you're behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's one of the most superior </v>

607
00:27:28.231 --> 00:27:30.840
<v Speaker 5>positions to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very good.</v>

608
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.860
<v Speaker 5>What about the Mount Mount?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the striking involves phenomenal.</v>

609
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:38.423
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you just put your finger on it </v>

610
00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:40.674
<v Speaker 5>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

611
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.170
<v Speaker 5>every one of the pins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you did soon,</v>

612
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 5>the value of it is measured by your </v>
<v Speaker 5>potential to strike your opponent on the</v>

613
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:49.884
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>

614
00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:51.530
<v Speaker 6>Okay?</v>

615
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.840
<v Speaker 5>That's why their school more your own </v>
<v Speaker 5>belly scores more.</v>

616
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.833
<v Speaker 5>It's I control because from distance of </v>
<v Speaker 5>neon belly you can strike with more </v>

617
00:27:58.221 --> 00:28:00.530
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's inherently unstable,</v>

618
00:28:00.531 --> 00:28:02.580
<v Speaker 5>however,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so at scores less than mount,</v>

619
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.080
<v Speaker 5>which is inherently more stable and </v>
<v Speaker 5>office the same punching platform.</v>

620
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:08.623
<v Speaker 5>Step number three of Judas who was to </v>
<v Speaker 5>work your way through a hierarchy of </v>

621
00:28:10.611 --> 00:28:11.444
<v Speaker 5>pins with a pins,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a graded in value according to your </v>

622
00:28:15.681 --> 00:28:18.260
<v Speaker 5>ability to strike with a fixed on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>

623
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:19.723
<v Speaker 5>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so far we've got three elements in the </v>

624
00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:24.410
<v Speaker 5>system of Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Step number one,</v>

625
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.110
<v Speaker 5>get to fight down to the ground were </v>
<v Speaker 5>explosive.</v>

626
00:28:27.111 --> 00:28:30.200
<v Speaker 5>Kinetic energy is less likely to do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>valid by a dangerous opponent.</v>

627
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.590
<v Speaker 5>Step number two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get past this dangerous legs.</v>

628
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.963
<v Speaker 5>Step number three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>work your way through this hierarchy of </v>

629
00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:37.874
<v Speaker 5>pins with the pins are understood in </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of the potential to harm your </v>

630
00:28:41.391 --> 00:28:45.020
<v Speaker 5>opponent with strikes on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What step number four?</v>

631
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.520
<v Speaker 5>Step number four is try to secure a </v>
<v Speaker 5>position where you can submit them.</v>

632
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.590
<v Speaker 5>You've already got the position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what's that number four attack with a</v>

633
00:28:54.591 --> 00:28:56.240
<v Speaker 5>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>

634
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:02.690
<v Speaker 5>So we've just described a zoned unit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a four step system.</v>

635
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.290
<v Speaker 5>It's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's elegant and it's deadly effective.</v>

636
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.680
<v Speaker 5>Step number one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take the fight to the ground.</v>

637
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Take away the danger of explosive </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinetic energy.</v>

638
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.830
<v Speaker 5>Step number two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get past as dangerous lakes.</v>

639
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.053
<v Speaker 5>Step number three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>work your way through a hierarchy of </v>

640
00:29:18.501 --> 00:29:19.334
<v Speaker 5>pins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Each one graded upon your ability to </v>

641
00:29:21.801 --> 00:29:22.634
<v Speaker 5>harm your opponent with strikes on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground and set up step number four </v>

642
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:25.933
<v Speaker 5>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now the question that needs to be </v>

643
00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:32.660
<v Speaker 5>asked with a lake lungs fit into that </v>
<v Speaker 5>system</v>

644
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.320
<v Speaker 5>and where do they fit in?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't allow,</v>

645
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:39.920
<v Speaker 5>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>

646
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:44.350
<v Speaker 5>Traditionally leg walks fit into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>system in only one way.</v>

647
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:46.563
<v Speaker 5>When the system has failed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the system's not working and you </v>

648
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:54.580
<v Speaker 5>can't take your opponent down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't pass his God.</v>

649
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.833
<v Speaker 5>You can't maintain a dominant position </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can't get the regular </v>

650
00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 5>submissions to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

651
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:00.550
<v Speaker 5>Try a leg lock.</v>

652
00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

653
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're seeing.</v>

654
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.833
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lake logs was seen for generations as a </v>

655
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:09.514
<v Speaker 5>signal of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you couldn't get the system to </v>

656
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:15.730
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had to resort to leg logs.</v>

657
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.940
<v Speaker 5>It meant you were a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you did sue player.</v>

658
00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:19.723
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't impose the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 5>system of Jujitsu and so you chicken </v>

659
00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:27.550
<v Speaker 5>down and you went to lake lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they were despised.</v>

660
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.963
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the real reason why for </v>

661
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:33.670
<v Speaker 5>generations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lake logs were dismissed.</v>

662
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:36.363
<v Speaker 5>You don't think it was because so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>people were injured by them that they </v>

663
00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:39.790
<v Speaker 5>were absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People get injured.</v>

664
00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:40.863
<v Speaker 5>The worst injuries in Jiu Jitsu don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>come from submission holds the worst </v>

665
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:43.600
<v Speaker 5>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>injuries,</v>

666
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.430
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu come from falling bodyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

667
00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.680
<v Speaker 5>and people jumped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

668
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:50.960
<v Speaker 5>when people accidentally poorly </v>
<v Speaker 5>performed takedowns.</v>

669
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:51.813
<v Speaker 5>That's where you see catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 5>injuries send units is we sued career </v>

670
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:56.980
<v Speaker 5>ending injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the joint locks of missions.</v>

671
00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.810
<v Speaker 5>You're out for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two weeks,</v>

672
00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>catastrophic injuries.</v>

673
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.093
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I see it go on Youtube and put in </v>

674
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:06.010
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paul gone wrong.</v>

675
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.280
<v Speaker 5>You'll see catastrophic injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see career ending injuries there.</v>

676
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.740
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to see from Aamaz he'll</v>
<v Speaker 5>hoax,</v>

677
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:13.540
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll see people getting hurt,</v>

678
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.910
<v Speaker 5>but it's a contact sport you expect </v>
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

679
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.860
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

680
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.710
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

681
00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.510
<v Speaker 5>a very simple elegant system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</v>

682
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.373
<v Speaker 5>We just saw one rendition of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the four step approach and you clearly </v>

683
00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:30.430
<v Speaker 5>see leg locks don't fit comfortably into</v>
<v Speaker 5>that system.</v>

684
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.130
<v Speaker 5>What I did is I tried to find an avenue </v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

685
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:39.650
<v Speaker 5>I could come in and the results were </v>
<v Speaker 5>surprising.</v>

686
00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.610
<v Speaker 5>The first thing is al forced it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rendition of you did.</v>

687
00:31:43.611 --> 00:31:44.444
<v Speaker 5>Sue looked at Jujitsu from top position </v>
<v Speaker 5>where we took our opponent down to the </v>

688
00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:52.580
<v Speaker 5>ground and we were on top of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But my study,</v>

689
00:31:52.581 --> 00:31:53.414
<v Speaker 5>if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he didn't start from top position </v>

690
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:55.543
<v Speaker 5>started from bottom position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at my students in </v>

691
00:31:57.951 --> 00:31:58.784
<v Speaker 5>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will notice that around 80% of the </v>

692
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:02.563
<v Speaker 5>entries into lake logs come from bottom </v>
<v Speaker 5>position or with their opponent behind </v>

693
00:32:06.711 --> 00:32:08.820
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words from water,</v>

694
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.820
<v Speaker 5>supposedly inferior positions.</v>

695
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:17.770
<v Speaker 5>So for me it was never a question of </v>
<v Speaker 5>losing position when I went for the logs</v>

696
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.690
<v Speaker 5>because I was already underneath my </v>
<v Speaker 5>opponent.</v>

697
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.950
<v Speaker 5>I started underneath how can I end up on</v>
<v Speaker 5>born by going fairly,</v>

698
00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:23.813
<v Speaker 5>I'm already on board them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So most of my early work in Lagos was </v>

699
00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.343
<v Speaker 5>how to get into leg and disadvantageous </v>
<v Speaker 5>positions from underneath or when </v>

700
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:37.310
<v Speaker 5>someone is behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I never have felt this problem.</v>

701
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:37.791
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

702
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:38.624
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to lose position if I go for </v>

703
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:40.994
<v Speaker 5>like long.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I could still play a conventional </v>

704
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:44.720
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu game and have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very strong leg or can you,</v>

705
00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:47.360
<v Speaker 5>that was the first avenue of leg </v>
<v Speaker 5>locking,</v>

706
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.010
<v Speaker 5>but things became more interesting when </v>
<v Speaker 5>I got further into the leg lock game and</v>

707
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:57.011
<v Speaker 5>I started to realize that as you add </v>
<v Speaker 5>lake logs into the game,</v>

708
00:32:57.471 --> 00:33:00.770
<v Speaker 5>you change the very nature of the sport.</v>

709
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.510
<v Speaker 5>If you look at Jujitsu as it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>ordinarily practiced,</v>

710
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:09.453
<v Speaker 5>it's a single direction game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone is in front of me and I'm </v>

711
00:33:13.781 --> 00:33:14.614
<v Speaker 5>standing over them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu is all about movement from the </v>

712
00:33:17.771 --> 00:33:22.330
<v Speaker 5>legs towards the head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm supposed to pass the guard,</v>

713
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:23.913
<v Speaker 5>worked my way up to chase the chase </v>
<v Speaker 5>contact and get my head next to their </v>

714
00:33:27.821 --> 00:33:29.860
<v Speaker 5>head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>either in front of them or behind them,</v>

715
00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 5>either mounted or remounted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So did you,</v>

716
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:33.524
<v Speaker 5>did so always goes in one direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were to get stopped or you lose </v>

717
00:33:37.451 --> 00:33:39.550
<v Speaker 5>position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just start the process over again.</v>

718
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.623
<v Speaker 5>It's a monodirectional sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It always goes from the legs to the </v>

719
00:33:42.881 --> 00:33:46.540
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once you start adding leg walks into the</v>

720
00:33:46.541 --> 00:33:47.374
<v Speaker 5>game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu becomes a two directional sport </v>

721
00:33:49.931 --> 00:33:52.030
<v Speaker 5>where you can go from the head down to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the legs.</v>

722
00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:52.923
<v Speaker 5>You can go in both directions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if I'm passing someone's guard and I </v>

723
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.453
<v Speaker 5>simply can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can fall back and go back into the </v>

724
00:34:00.101 --> 00:34:00.430
<v Speaker 5>legs.</v>

725
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.310
<v Speaker 5>If I'm site control on someone and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>start to recompose the god,</v>

726
00:34:03.311 --> 00:34:04.144
<v Speaker 5>I can fall back into the legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going from the upper body down to </v>

727
00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:07.444
<v Speaker 5>the lower body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Traditional chiefs who always goes from </v>

728
00:34:09.491 --> 00:34:11.950
<v Speaker 5>the lower body directionally up to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>upper body.</v>

729
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:14.770
<v Speaker 5>So ended up head to head with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>opponent.</v>

730
00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:16.203
<v Speaker 5>But once you start adding league logs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you just see for the first time </v>

731
00:34:19.181 --> 00:34:21.850
<v Speaker 5>becomes a two directional score instead </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a one directional sport.</v>

732
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.373
<v Speaker 5>And you can play your opponent's </v>
<v Speaker 5>reactions between the threat of lower </v>

733
00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:31.231
<v Speaker 5>body and upper body in ways it opens up </v>
<v Speaker 5>submissions so much more easily than the</v>

734
00:34:31.301 --> 00:34:32.140
<v Speaker 5>traditional game.</v>

735
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.990
<v Speaker 2>So if I take you back to the moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>where Dean Lester says to you,</v>

736
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.690
<v Speaker 2>why would you ignore 50% of the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>body?</v>

737
00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.910
<v Speaker 2>You go back and think about this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is your next step?</v>

738
00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.773
<v Speaker 2>Do you just start looking at students </v>
<v Speaker 2>and looking at what you're teaching and </v>

739
00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:53.330
<v Speaker 2>analyzing positions and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still rolling at the time.</v>

740
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.860
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

741
00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.890
<v Speaker 5>the first thing that I started to look </v>
<v Speaker 5>at it as,</v>

742
00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.910
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who out there is doing a good job of leg</v>

743
00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:05.430
<v Speaker 5>walking and the owner starts or was </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone went,</v>

744
00:35:05.431 --> 00:35:06.264
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you would see is random success </v>

745
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:10.920
<v Speaker 5>with leg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lungs.</v>

746
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.830
<v Speaker 5>You'd see a guy wins a match.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here we got wins a match there.</v>

747
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.780
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

748
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:16.643
<v Speaker 5>most of the imminent leg lock is of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>generation are actually coming out of </v>

749
00:35:19.021 --> 00:35:21.180
<v Speaker 5>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have people like Romina Sato had a</v>

750
00:35:21.181 --> 00:35:22.740
<v Speaker 5>decent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll hook for that time.</v>

751
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm an Ra,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm an Ra.</v>

752
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.020
<v Speaker 5>That was a little bit preliminary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The mnr came slightly after solder.</v>

753
00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:28.890
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

754
00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.390
<v Speaker 5>they fought each other and grappling </v>
<v Speaker 5>matches.</v>

755
00:35:30.391 --> 00:35:31.740
<v Speaker 5>A couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one was younger than the other.</v>

756
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.750
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

757
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:34.860
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

758
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had some success,</v>

759
00:35:35.941 --> 00:35:39.280
<v Speaker 5>I believe even soccer finished newton </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a knee bar.</v>

760
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.250
<v Speaker 5>So the knowledge was there.</v>

761
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.533
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there was nothing systematic about </v>

762
00:35:44.191 --> 00:35:44.610
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was,</v>

763
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 5>there wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there weren't people who were coming out</v>

764
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:50.880
<v Speaker 5>and just systematically finishing people</v>
<v Speaker 5>with one move.</v>

765
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.530
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

766
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:54.203
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there wasn't much in terms of people </v>

767
00:35:56.701 --> 00:36:00.140
<v Speaker 5>to study.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the first thing I started to ask is,</v>

768
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:00.901
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the,</v>

769
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 5>what is the nature of leg lock in what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

770
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.210
<v Speaker 5>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

771
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.490
<v Speaker 5>it seems to have some problems </v>
<v Speaker 5>associated with it.</v>

772
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.940
<v Speaker 5>It's not as controlling as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditional methods of Jujitsu.</v>

773
00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 5>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really the keyword there.</v>

774
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:13.143
<v Speaker 5>Control on Cam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do people favor things that rain </v>

775
00:36:15.771 --> 00:36:16.830
<v Speaker 5>naked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>strangled so much?</v>

776
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:17.664
<v Speaker 5>Because it's such a controlling position</v>
<v Speaker 5>where amount as an incredibly </v>

777
00:36:19.231 --> 00:36:22.450
<v Speaker 5>controlling position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do people favor things like cardiac?</v>

778
00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the they,</v>

779
00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.873
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>triangle because this too is a very </v>

780
00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:30.090
<v Speaker 5>inherently controlling position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the most high percentage,</v>

781
00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:33.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>finishing holes in injured,</v>

782
00:36:33.761 --> 00:36:36.850
<v Speaker 5>it's who all have control as their </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominant feature.</v>

783
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.111
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hot.</v>

784
00:36:38.111 --> 00:36:39.220
<v Speaker 5>People were going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a result,</v>

785
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.660
<v Speaker 5>one person can continue to use the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>move that illogically of success,</v>

786
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.010
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

787
00:36:45.011 --> 00:36:47.200
<v Speaker 5>over time against the wide array of </v>
<v Speaker 5>opponents.</v>

788
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.160
<v Speaker 5>So everything I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every question I asked ultimately always</v>

789
00:36:51.161 --> 00:36:51.994
<v Speaker 5>came back to control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the one thing you would see with </v>

790
00:36:54.311 --> 00:36:58.720
<v Speaker 5>regards to the use of lake logs in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>late 1990s and early two thousands was a</v>

791
00:36:58.721 --> 00:36:59.740
<v Speaker 5>lack of control.</v>

792
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:06.370
<v Speaker 5>So all of my studies and immediately </v>
<v Speaker 5>went to the notion of control.</v>

793
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.193
<v Speaker 5>Now there are many forms of leg lock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the ones that interest me the most </v>

794
00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:17.090
<v Speaker 5>always come out of what the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 5>call mushy go.</v>

795
00:37:17.091 --> 00:37:18.760
<v Speaker 5>Rami,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Asha groms had generic term.</v>

796
00:37:18.761 --> 00:37:20.880
<v Speaker 5>It just means tangled legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

797
00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.170
<v Speaker 5>There are many different forms of ashy </v>
<v Speaker 5>growing ashy.</v>

798
00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.013
<v Speaker 5>Grameen is a mechanism by which I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>use to have my legs to control my </v>

799
00:37:30.171 --> 00:37:31.350
<v Speaker 5>opponents legs and hips.</v>

800
00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:32.283
<v Speaker 6>Oops.</v>

801
00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:39.120
<v Speaker 5>When I started to do was make a deep </v>
<v Speaker 5>study of this notion of ashy grammy.</v>

802
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:40.743
<v Speaker 5>How am I going to use my legs to control</v>
<v Speaker 5>the real estate between my opponent's </v>

803
00:37:42.911 --> 00:37:45.520
<v Speaker 5>knee and his hips?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Preferably on both sides?</v>

804
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.503
<v Speaker 5>Probably the single biggest cliche that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll hear about Jujitsu is it its </v>

805
00:37:51.001 --> 00:37:51.834
<v Speaker 5>position before submission.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the time I was primary interest in </v>

806
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:55.644
<v Speaker 5>the idea of control before submission </v>
<v Speaker 5>control is a much deeper and wider </v>

807
00:37:59.521 --> 00:38:02.900
<v Speaker 5>concept.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the basic points,</v>

808
00:38:02.901 --> 00:38:07.070
<v Speaker 5>structure based positional position for </v>
<v Speaker 5>submission model a of Jujitsu.</v>

809
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:07.913
<v Speaker 5>It is many ways to control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People have very little to do with with </v>

810
00:38:09.691 --> 00:38:11.040
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

811
00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:14.790
<v Speaker 5>ashy rom itself scores nothing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu but done well.</v>

812
00:38:14.791 --> 00:38:17.890
<v Speaker 5>It can control an opponent just as well </v>
<v Speaker 5>as rare mount can.</v>

813
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.033
<v Speaker 5>So I started to see that there are many </v>
<v Speaker 5>forms of control that went outside of </v>

814
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:26.800
<v Speaker 5>the traditional basic positional </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy of resigned you to sue Washi.</v>

815
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:27.743
<v Speaker 5>He was one of them.</v>

816
00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 5>Probably the single greatest key in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>development of my leg lock system.</v>

817
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:38.583
<v Speaker 5>Again came from a simple realization </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the greatest mistake that people </v>

818
00:38:42.111 --> 00:38:47.111
<v Speaker 5>had made in lake log work prior to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>arrival of the squad was it.</v>

819
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:49.774
<v Speaker 5>They made no distinction between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanism of breaking and the mechanism </v>

820
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:58.150
<v Speaker 5>of control she go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rami was the mechanism of control.</v>

821
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.823
<v Speaker 5>The lock itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it be a heel hook and Achilles </v>

822
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:03.320
<v Speaker 5>lock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a figure for a toe hold.</v>

823
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:08.430
<v Speaker 5>That was the mechanism of braking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you watch 99% of the people out there</v>

824
00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 5>who claim to be experts in leg locking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't distinguish between the two.</v>

825
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:15.490
<v Speaker 5>They see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

826
00:39:15.491 --> 00:39:20.380
<v Speaker 5>he'll hooking as a single skill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the lock on the legs,</v>

827
00:39:20.381 --> 00:39:22.900
<v Speaker 5>the ashy grammy or whatever term they </v>
<v Speaker 5>use for it,</v>

828
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:25.510
<v Speaker 5>and the lock itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not distinguished.</v>

829
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:26.523
<v Speaker 5>That taught is a single skill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't differentiate the ashy grammy </v>

830
00:39:29.861 --> 00:39:33.250
<v Speaker 5>and the lock and you'll see people </v>
<v Speaker 5>teaching in this manner.</v>

831
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.863
<v Speaker 5>What I did was to destroy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>only distinguished between the two so </v>

832
00:39:37.931 --> 00:39:38.764
<v Speaker 5>that my students could all hold an ashy </v>
<v Speaker 5>grammy position and switched from one </v>

833
00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:46.840
<v Speaker 5>now grommet to another and hope people </v>
<v Speaker 5>for extended periods of time and inhibit</v>

834
00:39:46.841 --> 00:39:47.674
<v Speaker 5>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I can inhibit movement for long </v>

835
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:53.260
<v Speaker 5>periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can break you at will.</v>

836
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:58.950
<v Speaker 5>I can take my time when I come to break </v>
<v Speaker 5>you because the control is there.</v>

837
00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.300
<v Speaker 5>The control is prime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To break a second,</v>

838
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 5>the most people is just trolling the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ashy grameen immediately go for the law.</v>

839
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.303
<v Speaker 5>They don't even have so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ashy grammy is described as part of </v>

840
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.140
<v Speaker 5>the heel hook.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't distinguish between the two.</v>

841
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.790
<v Speaker 5>Once I made that realization in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>early two thousands,</v>

842
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.320
<v Speaker 5>that's when the ball started rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when,</v>

843
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.100
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

844
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.280
<v Speaker 5>a significant amount of progress was </v>
<v Speaker 5>made.</v>

845
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.633
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that you'll question was an </v>

846
00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:29.290
<v Speaker 5>interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

847
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.450
<v Speaker 5>You had the inside list.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They gave you the insight.</v>

848
00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:32.853
<v Speaker 5>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what started you going for it was the </v>

849
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:35.943
<v Speaker 5>making first a critical distinction </v>
<v Speaker 5>between control and submission and the </v>

850
00:40:38.981 --> 00:40:39.814
<v Speaker 5>case of leg logging between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanism of control or Shiga Rami and </v>

851
00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.950
<v Speaker 5>the mechanism a breaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the lock itself.</v>

852
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:46.660
<v Speaker 5>In my case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hug.</v>

853
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:49.463
<v Speaker 2>Oh really good example of this is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective it's been implemented by your </v>

854
00:40:56.011 --> 00:40:56.844
<v Speaker 2>students against real world class </v>
<v Speaker 2>presents Jiu and competitors who don't </v>

855
00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.403
<v Speaker 2>use these methods like a good one is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gordon Ryan versus Cyborg Cyborg who is </v>

856
00:41:08.521 --> 00:41:12.270
<v Speaker 2>a fucking beast of a man and just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical specimen.</v>

857
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:17.360
<v Speaker 2>A real freak and is known for his </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tornado Guard is,</v>

858
00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:19.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is no stranger to leg locks,</v>

859
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:24.030
<v Speaker 2>is no stranger to any of the positions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Nogi or gay Jujitsu.</v>

860
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.133
<v Speaker 2>But when I watched Gordon wrap him up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and control him and before he got the </v>

861
00:41:29.911 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 2>submission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see Cyborg look befuddled.</v>

862
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loses the match was over roughly 30 </v>

863
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 2>seconds before the submission was </v>
<v Speaker 2>applied.</v>

864
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just trying to figure out a way </v>

865
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:46.361
<v Speaker 2>out of it and just was no way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it terrifying position to be in for a</v>

866
00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:50.120
<v Speaker 2>real world class Brazilian jujitsu black</v>
<v Speaker 2>belt,</v>

867
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:53.240
<v Speaker 2>like Cyborg when you watch that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that match.</v>

868
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is stunning because Gordon is what,</v>

869
00:41:56.451 --> 00:41:57.284
<v Speaker 2>21 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is amazing and Cyborgs in his </v>

870
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.790
<v Speaker 2>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

871
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:04.610
<v Speaker 2>I think Cyborg has been a blight belt </v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

872
00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:06.980
<v Speaker 2>many years longer than Gordon is even </v>
<v Speaker 2>being doing Jujitsu.</v>

873
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.940
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the best guys in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>

874
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:12.833
<v Speaker 2>you look at how well Gordon Dismantle </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim on the ground using the strategy </v>

875
00:42:17.361 --> 00:42:22.130
<v Speaker 2>that you just described it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just see if we could find that.</v>

876
00:42:22.131 --> 00:42:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Actually see if he can find Gordon Ryan </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus uh,</v>

877
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.640
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his actual name is,</v>

878
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I believe you pronounce it a brew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you do it's the carto approved.</v>

879
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.540
<v Speaker 2>He caught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

880
00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.510
<v Speaker 2>Cybil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abreu.</v>

881
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:36.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a lot of cyborgs in the Jiu Jitsu </v>

882
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:41.120
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a male Cyborg and MMA.</v>

883
00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a female Cyborg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Cyborg and pitfalls.</v>

884
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:47.223
<v Speaker 2>So we're watching it here now and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see Cyborg who's this fucking tank of a </v>

885
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:57.560
<v Speaker 2>man and Gordon Ryan who's quite a </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical specimen himself,</v>

886
00:42:57.561 --> 00:42:59.900
<v Speaker 2>but much younger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't.</v>

887
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 2>How long has John Gordon Been Doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu?</v>

888
00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:05.230
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's between six and a half </v>
<v Speaker 4>and seven years total now.</v>

889
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.540
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

890
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:08.320
<v Speaker 2>and immediately he dives under,</v>

891
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:11.183
<v Speaker 7>gets low</v>

892
00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:16.600
<v Speaker 2>using butterfly guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so his,</v>

893
00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.210
<v Speaker 2>what he's trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

894
00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Gordon is trying to do what with cyborgs</v>
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>

895
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.153
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first thing that Gordon Ryan needs </v>

896
00:43:23.031 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 4>to do is establish inside position with </v>
<v Speaker 4>his feet.</v>

897
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.700
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

898
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.860
<v Speaker 4>probably the single biggest uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

899
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.710
<v Speaker 4>starting point for any kind of ashy </v>
<v Speaker 4>grammy based game.</v>

900
00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 4>If you want to remember anything about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

901
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.040
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember this,</v>

902
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.983
<v Speaker 4>whenever you go into lake lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the person whose feet dominate the </v>

903
00:43:43.081 --> 00:43:46.620
<v Speaker 4>inside position will always dominate the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ashy grammy game.</v>

904
00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.870
<v Speaker 4>That's the heuristic that I teach all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>my students called.</v>

905
00:43:48.871 --> 00:43:50.610
<v Speaker 4>And Ryan has just established inside </v>
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>

906
00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just pulled him in,</v>

907
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:53.703
<v Speaker 2>which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyborg literally pulled him in with his </v>

908
00:43:56.381 --> 00:43:57.214
<v Speaker 2>feet inside.</v>

909
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:58.363
<v Speaker 4>You have a Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his feet were positioned in a way where </v>

910
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.040
<v Speaker 4>they could own the end up in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the inside position.</v>

911
00:44:02.041 --> 00:44:04.620
<v Speaker 4>So that's the first thing he's got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>establish inside position with the feet.</v>

912
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:07.410
<v Speaker 4>He knows damn well if his feet occupied </v>
<v Speaker 4>the inside position,</v>

913
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.570
<v Speaker 4>wherever they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to get to the,</v>

914
00:44:09.571 --> 00:44:11.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ashy grammy and his opponent.</v>

915
00:44:11.371 --> 00:44:13.470
<v Speaker 4>What about a stop now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we freeze it there?</v>

916
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.410
<v Speaker 4>Pass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

917
00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.480
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you go back a little bit with,</v>

918
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:20.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with overshot to sell at all?</v>

919
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.910
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right about here again,</v>

920
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.050
<v Speaker 4>initially there's a battle going on here</v>
<v Speaker 4>for inside foot position.</v>

921
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 4>Cyborg is an extremely well trained and </v>
<v Speaker 4>upon it,</v>

922
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 5>and he's doing a good job of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>backstage it with his left leg.</v>

923
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.293
<v Speaker 5>He knows that if he keeps both of us </v>
<v Speaker 5>feet on the lefthand side of Gordon </v>

924
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.253
<v Speaker 5>Ryan's body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he will be able to prevent his opponent </v>

925
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:43.860
<v Speaker 5>getting inside position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's doing the right thing.</v>

926
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:45.480
<v Speaker 5>He is doing a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had cyborgs,</v>

927
00:44:45.481 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 5>not naive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

928
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 5>as you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a multi time world champion.</v>

929
00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:49.470
<v Speaker 5>He's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very good.</v>

930
00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 5>He's not lake locking someone who </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't understand what's going on.</v>

931
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.410
<v Speaker 5>He knows what Gordon Ryan wants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

932
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.450
<v Speaker 5>there's a battle here for inside foot </v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

933
00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.070
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg is doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going into a back step.</v>

934
00:45:00.071 --> 00:45:02.520
<v Speaker 5>He's going to post his right hand on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>floor and try backstep out.</v>

935
00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 5>Let's go just a little further forward </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the video.</v>

936
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:09.480
<v Speaker 5>Got Freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go back just a fraction.</v>

937
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.233
<v Speaker 5>Just a little more.</v>

938
00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.080
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is Gordon's right,</v>

939
00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:23.830
<v Speaker 5>right foot have uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

940
00:45:23.831 --> 00:45:26.350
<v Speaker 5>his right foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it's hard to see here,</v>

941
00:45:26.351 --> 00:45:28.990
<v Speaker 5>but it looks like he's got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got inside position with one foot.</v>

942
00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:30.243
<v Speaker 5>He's got inside position with one foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The whole question is what's going to </v>

943
00:45:32.171 --> 00:45:33.004
<v Speaker 5>happen with cyborgs left leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we've got a battle between Gordon </v>

944
00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.340
<v Speaker 5>Ryans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>left leg and cyborgs.</v>

945
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.020
<v Speaker 5>Left leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

946
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.350
<v Speaker 5>How the battle goes from here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll come down to one thing.</v>

947
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:47.210
<v Speaker 5>Who Wins that battle?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

948
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.350
<v Speaker 5>go forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a little more hook.</v>

949
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.300
<v Speaker 5>Slump right away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

950
00:45:52.301 --> 00:45:55.540
<v Speaker 5>Colen Ryan just won the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Essentially at this point,</v>

951
00:45:55.541 --> 00:45:56.374
<v Speaker 5>the fight is over.</v>

952
00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:02.830
<v Speaker 5>The only question is how long is it </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to take?</v>

953
00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:04.870
<v Speaker 5>Why am I so confident?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Am I,</v>

954
00:46:04.871 --> 00:46:07.540
<v Speaker 5>am I an asshole?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Am I saying this because I'm an asshole?</v>

955
00:46:07.541 --> 00:46:08.374
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying cause I know what's </v>

956
00:46:09.161 --> 00:46:09.994
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gave you one of the keynotes of the </v>

957
00:46:14.151 --> 00:46:14.984
<v Speaker 5>leg walking game already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say it again because it's so </v>

958
00:46:17.261 --> 00:46:18.094
<v Speaker 5>important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The man whose feet dominate the inside </v>

959
00:46:20.621 --> 00:46:24.190
<v Speaker 5>position will always dominate the ashy </v>
<v Speaker 5>go rami game.</v>

960
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:30.040
<v Speaker 5>Now the second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever you go to a tech,</v>

961
00:46:30.041 --> 00:46:30.874
<v Speaker 5>someone's leg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>90% of the resistance on the leg you're </v>

962
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.980
<v Speaker 5>attacking comes from the other leg.</v>

963
00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.570
<v Speaker 5>It's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say it to you again.</v>

964
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.420
<v Speaker 5>Whenever I go to a tech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my opponent's right leg,</v>

965
00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.900
<v Speaker 5>90% of the resistance is going to come </v>
<v Speaker 5>from his left leg.</v>

966
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:51.933
<v Speaker 5>We talked about control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The foundational principle of control </v>

967
00:46:55.201 --> 00:46:56.034
<v Speaker 5>and leg logging in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As a principal I refer to as double </v>

968
00:46:57.551 --> 00:46:58.384
<v Speaker 5>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Double trouble is a simple idea that if </v>

969
00:47:00.911 --> 00:47:05.820
<v Speaker 5>I control both of my opponent's legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he no longer has the opportunity.</v>

970
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.880
<v Speaker 5>Use a second leg to defend the first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the amount of trouble that you've put</v>

971
00:47:09.881 --> 00:47:12.160
<v Speaker 5>them in is literally doubled in a matter</v>
<v Speaker 5>of seconds.</v>

972
00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:17.700
<v Speaker 5>Gordon Ryan has a hold of Cyborgs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right leg with his left arm and he has a</v>

973
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:25.670
<v Speaker 5>hold of cyborgs left leg with his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why was I so confident that the match is</v>

974
00:47:26.861 --> 00:47:30.460
<v Speaker 5>over at this point?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because of cyborgs.</v>

975
00:47:30.461 --> 00:47:35.461
<v Speaker 5>Legs are now controlled by Golden Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He is just attained double trouble.</v>

976
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.553
<v Speaker 5>Now let's slowly advance the video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you see how cyborgs legs are in a </v>

977
00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 5>straight line?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's having a very,</v>

978
00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:51.940
<v Speaker 5>very hard time holding his base.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is the con stop.</v>

979
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:54.860
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you go back just a fraction</v>

980
00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:00.450
<v Speaker 5>right about here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freeze.</v>

981
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:06.620
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Al Whole approach to Jiu is based around</v>

982
00:48:06.751 --> 00:48:07.584
<v Speaker 5>the idea of putting wages around our </v>
<v Speaker 5>opponent's body so that we can inhibit </v>

983
00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:13.200
<v Speaker 5>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A wage functions just as,</v>

984
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.273
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at doorstopper stops the door from </v>

985
00:48:15.931 --> 00:48:16.764
<v Speaker 5>moving in a breeze on Cam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only thing better than a wage is a </v>

986
00:48:19.651 --> 00:48:22.800
<v Speaker 5>reinforced wage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where the wage is locked in place</v>

987
00:48:22.801 --> 00:48:23.634
<v Speaker 5>by another part of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Golden Ryan currently has inside </v>

988
00:48:26.881 --> 00:48:30.100
<v Speaker 5>position with the right leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has control of sidewalks,</v>

989
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:30.953
<v Speaker 5>other leg with his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So both legs have some degree of </v>

990
00:48:32.941 --> 00:48:33.774
<v Speaker 5>control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's about to massively reinforced </v>

991
00:48:36.481 --> 00:48:40.740
<v Speaker 5>that control by locking a triangle or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Sankaku around his opponent's leg.</v>

992
00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:41.813
<v Speaker 5>In order for that to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to have to lift his hips </v>

993
00:48:42.901 --> 00:48:45.630
<v Speaker 5>slightly off the floor so that he can </v>
<v Speaker 5>elevate over cyborgs.</v>

994
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.060
<v Speaker 5>Left knee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch the video.</v>

995
00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:51.270
<v Speaker 5>There's the elevation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's the lock.</v>

996
00:48:51.271 --> 00:48:52.560
<v Speaker 5>Freeze,</v>
<v Speaker 5>freeze.</v>

997
00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.320
<v Speaker 5>Now he's got cyborgs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two legs in a straight line.</v>

998
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:56.303
<v Speaker 5>That means cyborgs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only mechanism of posting or saving his </v>

999
00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.850
<v Speaker 5>balances,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his left arm,</v>

1000
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:04.050
<v Speaker 5>that's all he's got left at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fight is done.</v>

1001
00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:09.990
<v Speaker 5>Cyborgs right leg is controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 5>Golden Ryan's left arm.</v>

1002
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.513
<v Speaker 5>Cyborgs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Left leg is controlled by a reinforced </v>

1003
00:49:13.861 --> 00:49:16.210
<v Speaker 5>wage to strength of both Gordon riots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1004
00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:17.243
<v Speaker 5>legs locked up in a triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyborgs actually a weight division </v>

1005
00:49:20.101 --> 00:49:21.510
<v Speaker 5>heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe then Gordon,</v>

1006
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.870
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both hips a controlled.</v>

1007
00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:25.883
<v Speaker 5>This is a full state of double trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both legs controlled and a breaking </v>

1008
00:49:31.261 --> 00:49:34.260
<v Speaker 5>mechanism in place is an asha grammy on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the leg.</v>

1009
00:49:34.261 --> 00:49:35.094
<v Speaker 5>You can break someone from their cyborg </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows his only method of not being </v>

1010
00:49:39.331 --> 00:49:42.240
<v Speaker 5>finished is to keep his hips over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gordon Ryan's hips.</v>

1011
00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:45.960
<v Speaker 5>So the next battle is how has Gordon </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ryan going to put sidewalks,</v>

1012
00:49:45.961 --> 00:49:49.950
<v Speaker 5>hips on the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What saving Cyborg is his left hand.</v>

1013
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:55.430
<v Speaker 5>Let's see how the battle goes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The battle just got lost.</v>

1014
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.750
<v Speaker 5>The hips went down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why was it so easy?</v>

1015
00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 5>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why was it so easy?</v>

1016
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:03.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell me.</v>

1017
00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:06.760
<v Speaker 5>Do you see that right knee?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1018
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:07.893
<v Speaker 5>That's what pushed him over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The right knee went into the pocket of </v>

1019
00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 5>cyborgs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Left hip.</v>

1020
00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:14.853
<v Speaker 5>That made a directionality of force,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was slightly away from the one base of </v>

1021
00:50:18.551 --> 00:50:21.490
<v Speaker 5>support that Cyborg had left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was his left hand.</v>

1022
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.310
<v Speaker 5>So he got sat on his hips.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now go forward.</v>

1023
00:50:25.311 --> 00:50:26.144
<v Speaker 5>Just a little</v>

1024
00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:33.450
<v Speaker 5>and freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you see Joe?</v>

1025
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:37.130
<v Speaker 5>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>

1026
00:50:37.131 --> 00:50:40.370
<v Speaker 5>what do you want me to look out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you see?</v>

1027
00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:42.800
<v Speaker 5>Both legs are wrapped up but be more </v>
<v Speaker 5>precise?</v>

1028
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:43.723
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well he has incredible control with his </v>

1029
00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:46.750
<v Speaker 5>right leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1030
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:47.773
<v Speaker 5>the way he's got his right leg and his </v>
<v Speaker 5>left leg triangled he's got the cyborgs </v>

1031
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:56.530
<v Speaker 5>right foot talk deep under his arm and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he also has the left foot there as well.</v>

1032
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:00.170
<v Speaker 5>So he's completely wrapped up with his </v>
<v Speaker 5>legs and his arms.</v>

1033
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.130
<v Speaker 5>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1034
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 5>let's bring in a few points here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First,</v>

1035
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 5>if you want to immobilize a human being </v>
<v Speaker 5>and preventing it from moving,</v>

1036
00:51:05.961 --> 00:51:09.800
<v Speaker 5>and what are the best things you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever do is lock their legs together.</v>

1037
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.590
<v Speaker 5>You get a dangerous prisoner with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fish.</v>

1038
00:51:11.591 --> 00:51:13.390
<v Speaker 5>Can you do handcuff his feet together </v>
<v Speaker 5>and handcuff him?</v>

1039
00:51:13.391 --> 00:51:15.680
<v Speaker 5>Saying hands together and he's no longer</v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous.</v>

1040
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:16.900
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He has.</v>

1041
00:51:16.901 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg is one of the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>Judas who plays in the world,</v>

1042
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:20.660
<v Speaker 5>but with the two of his feet slunk </v>
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>

1043
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:21.553
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's effectively neutralized oncom </v>

1044
00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.880
<v Speaker 5>pants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most importantly,</v>

1045
00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:26.763
<v Speaker 5>we've got a very interesting distinction</v>
<v Speaker 5>here between what we call a primary and </v>

1046
00:51:29.211 --> 00:51:33.740
<v Speaker 5>a secondary leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which leg is the Asha Rami locked up on?</v>

1047
00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:41.070
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got the left leg is was triangle.</v>

1048
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.120
<v Speaker 5>You to sound it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>

1049
00:51:42.121 --> 00:51:42.954
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you Rami Lake,</v>

1050
00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:48.390
<v Speaker 5>we called it the primary leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ashy go Rami has locked on cyborgs.</v>

1051
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Left leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the primary leg.</v>

1052
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.080
<v Speaker 5>The other leg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>remember our principal of [inaudible],</v>

1053
00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.390
<v Speaker 5>90% of all resistance comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>second leg.</v>

1054
00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:04.130
<v Speaker 5>The arm controls to secondary leg and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the legs control the primary leg.</v>

1055
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.233
<v Speaker 5>So the resistance from the secondary leg</v>
<v Speaker 5>is pushing off and trying to separate </v>

1056
00:52:09.571 --> 00:52:10.404
<v Speaker 5>the lock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This numerous things he could Paul mold </v>

1057
00:52:11.491 --> 00:52:12.324
<v Speaker 5>with foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He could put his foot on the floor and </v>

1058
00:52:13.201 --> 00:52:14.430
<v Speaker 5>turn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could invert his body.</v>

1059
00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:17.460
<v Speaker 5>There's a thousand things you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's not doing any of them.</v>

1060
00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.010
<v Speaker 5>If you control that leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Betsy,</v>

1061
00:52:20.011 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Speaker 5>important theme.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Golden Bar,</v>

1062
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.240
<v Speaker 5>Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ryan's up the body.</v>

1063
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:27.900
<v Speaker 5>His left arm controls the secondary leg </v>
<v Speaker 5>and his lower body,</v>

1064
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.240
<v Speaker 5>the ashy grammy controls the primary </v>
<v Speaker 5>leg.</v>

1065
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:33.090
<v Speaker 5>As a result.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you think of cyborgs?</v>

1066
00:52:33.091 --> 00:52:35.970
<v Speaker 5>Ability to move is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's completely nullified.</v>

1067
00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:37.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1068
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.520
<v Speaker 5>let's go a little further.</v>

1069
00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.740
<v Speaker 5>Freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now cyborg is doing.</v>

1070
00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:49.860
<v Speaker 5>All he can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Movement has been taken away from him,</v>

1071
00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.770
<v Speaker 5>so his only option is to fight the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands.</v>

1072
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:58.700
<v Speaker 5>Gordon Ryan understands that he has </v>
<v Speaker 5>control of the secondary leg,</v>

1073
00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.390
<v Speaker 5>but he needs to make a transition to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>primary leg.</v>

1074
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:04.343
<v Speaker 5>In order to break Cyborg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to have to release the </v>

1075
00:53:07.531 --> 00:53:10.890
<v Speaker 5>secondary league.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that's a,</v>

1076
00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.740
<v Speaker 5>that's a scary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you release a secondary leg,</v>

1077
00:53:13.741 --> 00:53:15.690
<v Speaker 5>then your opponent cosat defended </v>
<v Speaker 5>himself again.</v>

1078
00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:20.250
<v Speaker 5>So he's got a measure how he releases </v>
<v Speaker 5>the secondary leg.</v>

1079
00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:25.020
<v Speaker 5>So it is a battle for angle here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg is battling for the hands,</v>

1080
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:28.920
<v Speaker 5>but Gordon Ryan hasn't even started the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hand fight yet.</v>

1081
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.080
<v Speaker 5>He still in the control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>

1082
00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.830
<v Speaker 5>His only interest is in holding the </v>
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

1083
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:41.490
<v Speaker 5>Go a little further.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freeze.</v>

1084
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 5>Why did golden switch his right hand to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the knee?</v>

1085
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:50.100
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the leg that can control,</v>

1086
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.080
<v Speaker 5>or a secondary list.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Secondary Leg,</v>

1087
00:53:52.081 --> 00:53:53.910
<v Speaker 5>which can defend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1088
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:54.803
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine he's distracting him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why his Golden Ryan's head leaning to </v>

1089
00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:01.070
<v Speaker 5>the right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why.</v>

1090
00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.960
<v Speaker 5>Because that society needs to take </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cybil.</v>

1091
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:08.250
<v Speaker 5>If cyborg turns his head to the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>side.</v>

1092
00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.190
<v Speaker 5>When Gordon Ryan releases the secondary </v>
<v Speaker 5>leg,</v>

1093
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.053
<v Speaker 5>he's going to be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a battle for angle now that no </v>

1094
00:54:15.901 --> 00:54:20.790
<v Speaker 5>one sees Gordon Ryan's head tells the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole story here.</v>

1095
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:23.543
<v Speaker 5>Let's go a little further.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freeze and Ryan is already beginning to </v>

1096
00:54:30.421 --> 00:54:35.370
<v Speaker 5>transition to the primary leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a way he's got it locked up.</v>

1097
00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:39.150
<v Speaker 5>It's just so horrific to yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the two of them crossed over each other.</v>

1098
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:43.350
<v Speaker 5>Now at some point he's got uncross the </v>
<v Speaker 5>legs to get to the primary leg.</v>

1099
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:49.850
<v Speaker 5>Let's go a little further.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg still engage in the hand fight.</v>

1100
00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.620
<v Speaker 5>Now Gordon is about to make his </v>
<v Speaker 5>transition to the hand fight.</v>

1101
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:06.960
<v Speaker 5>Freeze Gordon Ryan's made the critical </v>
<v Speaker 5>release of the secondary leg.</v>

1103
00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:11.710
<v Speaker 5>This is where things start to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

1104
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:18.160
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg has perhaps tragically sat on his</v>
<v Speaker 5>right hip,</v>

1105
00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:22.900
<v Speaker 5>which means he has no ability to use his</v>
<v Speaker 5>secondary leg to escape,</v>

1106
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.810
<v Speaker 5>and because he's holding Gordon Ryan's </v>
<v Speaker 5>arm,</v>

1107
00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:29.860
<v Speaker 5>he has no ability now to one his body </v>
<v Speaker 5>and go into a attorney and escape.</v>

1108
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.840
<v Speaker 5>Now Gordon reinders needs to release the</v>
<v Speaker 5>right arm.</v>

1109
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:40.950
<v Speaker 5>Let's go further.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freeze.</v>

1110
00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:53.610
<v Speaker 5>Go back just to here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1111
00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:58.760
<v Speaker 5>Gordon Ryan is about to release a </v>
<v Speaker 5>secondary leg freeze right there.</v>

1112
00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:00.500
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very slowly.</v>

1113
00:56:00.501 --> 00:56:04.280
<v Speaker 5>Take it forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watch Gordon Ryan's left elbow freeze.</v>

1114
00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.060
<v Speaker 5>Why did he put the elbow there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1115
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:10.903
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1116
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:11.833
<v Speaker 5>It's a wage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a mobilizing the leg he really </v>

1117
00:56:15.561 --> 00:56:16.394
<v Speaker 5>wants to attack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He switched his arm position from </v>

1118
00:56:18.861 --> 00:56:22.820
<v Speaker 5>controlling the secondary leg,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which he hasn't yet fully,</v>

1119
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:25.743
<v Speaker 5>but he's put his elbow in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>toes of the primary leg to keep that </v>

1120
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 5>primary life from extending.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Correct,</v>

1121
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:32.583
<v Speaker 5>and to be able to transition if it </v>
<v Speaker 5>honestly and to the Loc or he needs now </v>

1122
00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 5>is to release the right arm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg knows if he loses the right arm,</v>

1123
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:43.833
<v Speaker 5>the fight is lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Continuing Gordon goes back to our </v>

1124
00:56:55.251 --> 00:56:56.084
<v Speaker 5>position.</v>

1125
00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.240
<v Speaker 5>Freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freeze.</v>

1126
00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:04.510
<v Speaker 5>Go back just to here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why did Gordon Ryan,</v>

1127
00:57:06.451 --> 00:57:11.451
<v Speaker 5>when the hand five battle freeze go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyborg is one of the strongest people in</v>

1128
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.153
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got two hands on a guy in a weight </v>

1129
00:57:18.821 --> 00:57:21.130
<v Speaker 5>division lower than him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why can't he hold,</v>

1130
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:25.870
<v Speaker 5>why did he lose the arm?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why Watch Gordon Ryan's right elbow?</v>

1131
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:36.820
<v Speaker 5>What did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sent,</v>

1132
00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:37.683
<v Speaker 5>let me say that again.</v>

1133
00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:45.060
<v Speaker 5>He's just lifting it up and pulling it </v>
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>

1134
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:48.450
<v Speaker 5>What is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He changed the angle through the elbow.</v>

1135
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.550
<v Speaker 5>There's a grip over and a grip under.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you just pull,</v>

1136
00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:55.110
<v Speaker 5>you'll never release the arm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1137
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:56.153
<v Speaker 5>He changed the elbow position so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>one grip was lost and then a push poll </v>

1138
00:58:00.901 --> 00:58:05.040
<v Speaker 5>with the elbow and a slip once continued</v>
<v Speaker 5>forward.</v>

1139
00:58:05.041 --> 00:58:05.874
<v Speaker 5>Now he's got the left arm set.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as the hands touch and sidebar </v>

1140
00:58:10.771 --> 00:58:11.604
<v Speaker 5>just taps before he even gets a chance </v>
<v Speaker 5>to extend it because he knows the games </v>

1141
00:58:15.511 --> 00:58:16.460
<v Speaker 5>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1142
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:18.270
<v Speaker 5>he knew the game was last long before </v>
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

1143
00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:21.690
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty God damn impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>

1144
00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:22.883
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And yet you'll see this with almost all </v>

1145
00:58:24.661 --> 00:58:25.494
<v Speaker 5>of my students.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have seen that was almost all your </v>

1146
00:58:26.881 --> 00:58:27.714
<v Speaker 5>students.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is so bizarre now how many people </v>

1147
00:58:31.171 --> 00:58:36.171
<v Speaker 5>are recognizing the system and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>mimic it or trying to find out some sort</v>

1148
00:58:37.951 --> 00:58:39.060
<v Speaker 5>of a counter attack to it?</v>

1149
00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:40.860
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an interesting question.</v>

1150
00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:41.723
<v Speaker 5>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm told is actually kind of like an </v>

1151
00:58:42.931 --> 00:58:47.130
<v Speaker 5>industry of people who tried to break </v>
<v Speaker 5>what we do down and mimic it.</v>

1152
00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:48.173
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know there's people putting out </v>

1153
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:54.950
<v Speaker 5>numerous instructionals they've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've watched what uh,</v>

1154
00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.060
<v Speaker 5>the squad does and tries to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

1155
00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.830
<v Speaker 5>to break it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1156
00:58:58.860 --> 00:58:59.700
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>

1157
00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:01.060
<v Speaker 5>And it's natural.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1158
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:01.943
<v Speaker 5>I'd be doing the same thing if someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>else was coming out and we're making </v>

1159
00:59:03.421 --> 00:59:05.610
<v Speaker 5>people with a given me a lot studying </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they're doing to.</v>

1160
00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:08.040
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

1161
00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:08.874
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there does seem to be an industry of </v>

1162
00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:10.500
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1163
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:11.843
<v Speaker 5>the question is how successful I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you see any other groups of people </v>

1164
00:59:15.811 --> 00:59:20.220
<v Speaker 5>coming out and just exclusively </v>
<v Speaker 5>clinician people with the same moves?</v>

1165
00:59:20.221 --> 00:59:21.890
<v Speaker 5>Time and time again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>years at a time,</v>

1166
00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 5>at</v>

1167
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.000
<v Speaker 4>all levels of competition?</v>

1168
00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:24.150
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1169
00:59:24.151 --> 00:59:26.790
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing more 10th planet guys do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that now.</v>

1170
00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.200
<v Speaker 3>10th Planet guys have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1171
00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:32.280
<v Speaker 3>and given you all the credit in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world by the way that they've,</v>

1172
00:59:32.281 --> 00:59:33.114
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started transitioning to a lot more leg </v>

1173
00:59:34.471 --> 00:59:35.670
<v Speaker 3>lock attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leg lock,</v>

1174
00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:36.623
<v Speaker 3>fence</v>

1175
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:38.790
<v Speaker 4>trading on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1176
00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:40.590
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1177
00:59:41.070 --> 00:59:46.070
<v Speaker 4>what we find is most people definitely </v>
<v Speaker 4>struggle with defending it and,</v>

1178
00:59:46.711 --> 00:59:48.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1179
00:59:48.001 --> 00:59:48.834
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this has been around for quite a while </v>

1180
00:59:49.351 --> 00:59:50.184
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been five years since the school </v>

1181
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:54.990
<v Speaker 4>really started pushing this publicly </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1182
00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:56.460
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1183
00:59:56.461 --> 00:59:58.740
<v Speaker 4>it seems that there's still going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

1184
00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.410
<v Speaker 4>eventually people will figure things </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

1185
01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.250
<v Speaker 4>It's just the way progress works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1186
01:00:05.251 --> 01:00:06.120
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1187
01:00:06.121 --> 01:00:06.954
<v Speaker 4>I think at this point it's pretty clear </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people have changed their minds </v>

1188
01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:11.004
<v Speaker 4>about leg walks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People I think are recognizing that </v>

1189
01:00:12.301 --> 01:00:13.590
<v Speaker 4>there's something different going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

1190
01:00:13.591 --> 01:00:17.910
<v Speaker 4>that this is a control based approach to</v>
<v Speaker 4>leg locks rather than a,</v>

1191
01:00:17.911 --> 01:00:19.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a speed and power boast,</v>

1192
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.800
<v Speaker 4>a approach to leg logs and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1193
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:24.083
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the evidence for its success really </v>

1194
01:00:25.531 --> 01:00:27.330
<v Speaker 4>comes from the nature of the squad </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

1195
01:00:27.331 --> 01:00:29.520
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the three founding </v>
<v Speaker 4>members of the squat,</v>

1196
01:00:29.521 --> 01:00:30.560
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Cummins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon,</v>

1197
01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:33.690
<v Speaker 4>Ryan and Gary Taunton,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all three have very,</v>

1198
01:00:33.691 --> 01:00:35.310
<v Speaker 4>very different body types.</v>

1199
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.820
<v Speaker 4>All three have very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different personalities and yet all</v>

1200
01:00:38.821 --> 01:00:42.270
<v Speaker 4>three use a very similar game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1201
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:45.390
<v Speaker 4>two of those three athletes came from </v>
<v Speaker 4>nowhere.</v>

1202
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:49.110
<v Speaker 4>They had no competition record before </v>
<v Speaker 4>they started training.</v>

1203
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:51.750
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with me at the hands of Gracie Academy.</v>

1204
01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:55.020
<v Speaker 4>One of them had a competition record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a,</v>

1205
01:00:55.021 --> 01:00:56.910
<v Speaker 4>I believe Gary [inaudible] was a brown </v>
<v Speaker 4>belt,</v>

1206
01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.260
<v Speaker 4>a competitor in the g and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had no legal game.</v>

1207
01:01:01.261 --> 01:01:02.094
<v Speaker 4>He was a guy who was essentially no one </v>
<v Speaker 4>for scrambling from bottom half guard </v>

1208
01:01:05.051 --> 01:01:07.500
<v Speaker 4>and using randek naked strangles and out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of scrambles,</v>

1209
01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.290
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strangles out of scrambles.</v>

1210
01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:11.750
<v Speaker 4>My God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we have such a tongue twister.</v>

1211
01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.290
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1212
01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:14.124
<v Speaker 4>so gary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom was a particularly interesting case </v>

1213
01:01:15.961 --> 01:01:18.420
<v Speaker 4>because he came to me is an already </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed athlete.</v>

1214
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.160
<v Speaker 4>He's trained under a very good friend of</v>
<v Speaker 4>mine,</v>

1215
01:01:20.161 --> 01:01:21.930
<v Speaker 4>Tom to blast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1216
01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:23.183
<v Speaker 4>and completely changed his game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that showed something very </v>

1217
01:01:26.071 --> 01:01:26.904
<v Speaker 4>interesting that showed that someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>could already have a developed game and </v>

1218
01:01:30.181 --> 01:01:31.014
<v Speaker 4>then take on this and change the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was a particularly interesting </v>

1219
01:01:33.301 --> 01:01:35.730
<v Speaker 4>case with the case of Eddie Cummings and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon Ryan.</v>

1220
01:01:35.731 --> 01:01:37.830
<v Speaker 4>They came to me early in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>development.</v>

1221
01:01:37.831 --> 01:01:38.910
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1222
01:01:38.911 --> 01:01:41.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they took it on wholesale as it were.</v>

1223
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:43.573
<v Speaker 3>I think this style and approach and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things that's so fascinating </v>

1224
01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:52.331
<v Speaker 3>about it is it really requires someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you to systematically break it down</v>

1225
01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:55.700
<v Speaker 3>the way you have described it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1226
01:01:56.150 --> 01:02:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I've done Jujitsu for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd never stopped and thought of all</v>

1227
01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:05.600
<v Speaker 3>the positions in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the steps in the system,</v>

1228
01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.940
<v Speaker 3>take the fight to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get past the dangerous legs,</v>

1229
01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:08.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1230
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:11.240
<v Speaker 3>achieve some sort of a dominant position</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go for the submission.</v>

1231
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.670
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew,</v>

1232
01:02:13.671 --> 01:02:14.504
<v Speaker 3>I knew.</v>

1233
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:15.583
<v Speaker 4>What I find with most utis supplies is </v>
<v Speaker 4>they know what they're doing on an </v>

1234
01:02:17.931 --> 01:02:19.440
<v Speaker 4>unconscious level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1235
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 4>My job</v>

1236
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 5>as a coach is to make it conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1237
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.880
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now for me,</v>

1238
01:02:23.881 --> 01:02:24.714
<v Speaker 5>the most interesting thing when I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I first had to think about Jujitsu </v>

1239
01:02:27.301 --> 01:02:28.320
<v Speaker 5>is a system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1240
01:02:28.321 --> 01:02:32.130
<v Speaker 5>I did that when I wrote a book for my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for my Sensei Henzel Gracie.</v>

1241
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:33.533
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he asked me to write a book and I </v>

1242
01:02:34.381 --> 01:02:35.650
<v Speaker 5>started thinking deeply about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1243
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.100
<v Speaker 5>what is this thing that I study?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I spend all day on a man's,</v>

1244
01:02:38.101 --> 01:02:40.030
<v Speaker 5>what am I doing exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1245
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 5>when you start consciously thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>

1246
01:02:41.761 --> 01:02:42.594
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>breaking it down to steps you see </v>

1247
01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:46.980
<v Speaker 5>presented gets was a step by step </v>
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

1248
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.180
<v Speaker 5>My question was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can I go further than that?</v>

1249
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 5>If you did sue as a simple single </v>
<v Speaker 5>system,</v>

1250
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.053
<v Speaker 5>what about if he divided Jujitsu up into</v>
<v Speaker 5>niche areas and instead of having one </v>

1251
01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:04.253
<v Speaker 5>overall system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had an overall system with many </v>

1252
01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:12.030
<v Speaker 5>subsystems within it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he had a lake system,</v>

1253
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.800
<v Speaker 5>a bag system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the front headlock system,</v>

1254
01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:16.680
<v Speaker 5>a Kimora system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My approach that you did,</v>

1255
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:18.920
<v Speaker 5>sue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it,</v>

1256
01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:19.754
<v Speaker 5>I had recognized it much of the success </v>
<v Speaker 5>of early procedures who came from it's </v>

1257
01:03:23.481 --> 01:03:27.380
<v Speaker 5>systematic nature of the fact that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a systems based approach to Jujitsu.</v>

1258
01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.760
<v Speaker 5>And I took</v>

1259
01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.900
<v Speaker 5>various niche areas and created systems </v>
<v Speaker 5>within systems.</v>

1260
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:38.290
<v Speaker 5>Then things start to get interesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I started integrating the system so</v>

1261
01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:41.440
<v Speaker 5>that one subsystem failed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could transfer to another.</v>

1262
01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:47.730
<v Speaker 5>That meant that my students could put </v>
<v Speaker 5>opponents who were trained much,</v>

1263
01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:50.830
<v Speaker 5>much longer than they head into a niche </v>
<v Speaker 5>area,</v>

1264
01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.490
<v Speaker 5>which my students had so much knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

1265
01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:57.070
<v Speaker 5>So much training in that isolated niche </v>
<v Speaker 5>domain.</v>

1266
01:03:57.490 --> 01:03:59.980
<v Speaker 5>To take a take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who had trained three,</v>

1267
01:03:59.981 --> 01:04:04.300
<v Speaker 5>four times longs in themselves and have </v>
<v Speaker 5>more knowledge in that one domain,</v>

1268
01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:06.760
<v Speaker 5>then they're much more experienced </v>
<v Speaker 5>opponent did.</v>

1269
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:11.710
<v Speaker 5>And so what you saw with the squad was </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredibly speedy progress.</v>

1270
01:04:11.711 --> 01:04:12.544
<v Speaker 5>Whether we're getting wins against </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are trained to three to four </v>

1271
01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.393
<v Speaker 5>times longer than they had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this idea of what I call integrated </v>

1272
01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:22.960
<v Speaker 5>subsystems instead of having to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it was just one simple single system.</v>

1273
01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:26.260
<v Speaker 5>You keep the overall system of Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have subsistence within it.</v>

1274
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.740
<v Speaker 5>Each one integrated with the other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that one's one system fails,</v>

1275
01:04:29.741 --> 01:04:33.370
<v Speaker 5>you can pass off to another and it goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>back and forth until you get the wind.</v>

1276
01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.510
<v Speaker 5>That was my approach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do Jujitsu.</v>

1277
01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:38.200
<v Speaker 5>That's one I want to do as him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I can innovate.</v>

1278
01:04:38.201 --> 01:04:39.460
<v Speaker 5>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in any given direction,</v>

1279
01:04:39.461 --> 01:04:41.380
<v Speaker 5>that's probably the one I would push </v>
<v Speaker 5>them angst.</v>

1280
01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.693
<v Speaker 5>Now throughout this time your dealing </v>
<v Speaker 5>with some pretty significant injuries </v>

1281
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.710
<v Speaker 5>and physical limitations that you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>had.</v>

1282
01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:52.630
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell me about those,</v>

1283
01:04:52.631 --> 01:04:55.210
<v Speaker 5>what those were and what and how those </v>
<v Speaker 5>hindered you.</v>

1284
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:56.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1285
01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was in my early teens,</v>

1286
01:04:58.271 --> 01:04:59.410
<v Speaker 5>I was involved in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1287
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:03.400
<v Speaker 5>a rugby injury where my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my knee was massively injured.</v>

1288
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:06.190
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>over the next uh,</v>

1289
01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.100
<v Speaker 5>six years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1290
01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:12.070
<v Speaker 5>I would dislocate my knee ligaments </v>
<v Speaker 5>appeared to be,</v>

1291
01:05:12.071 --> 01:05:13.050
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1292
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.930
<v Speaker 5>severely compromised every six months or</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I get a fresh,</v>

1293
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 5>which would be</v>

1294
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:18.903
<v Speaker 4>severe and not be on crutches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spent a significant amount of my </v>

1295
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.890
<v Speaker 4>teenage years on crutches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1296
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:29.530
<v Speaker 4>around the age of 19.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had one last injury and uh,</v>

1297
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:33.940
<v Speaker 4>my knee just seem to have no power and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like,</v>

1298
01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:36.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I walk with a limp and um,</v>

1299
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:41.540
<v Speaker 4>you must remember this is in the 1980s </v>
<v Speaker 4>in New Zealand and this is pre Mris,</v>

1300
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:43.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pre orthoscopic surgery.</v>

1301
01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:46.360
<v Speaker 4>The doctors said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1302
01:05:46.361 --> 01:05:47.194
<v Speaker 4>we can do an operation where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>shortened the ligaments so there's less </v>

1303
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.560
<v Speaker 4>looseness in there and hopefully your </v>
<v Speaker 4>knee will be strong again.</v>

1304
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:58.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm an operation was performed and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately the ligaments were cut too</v>

1305
01:05:58.751 --> 01:06:00.630
<v Speaker 4>short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as a result,</v>

1306
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.380
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my leg never straightened again.</v>

1307
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:04.083
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I developed a severe case of </v>

1308
01:06:09.971 --> 01:06:14.290
<v Speaker 4>arthrofibrosis where my knee actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>became deformed and doesn't straighten.</v>

1309
01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>simple actions like walking,</v>

1310
01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:21.700
<v Speaker 4>kneeling are extremely painful for me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and have been my whole life.</v>

1311
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:26.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm just walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just walking is painful neediness,</v>

1312
01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.690
<v Speaker 4>extremely painful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1313
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not easy to do Jiu Jitsu.</v>

1314
01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.920
<v Speaker 4>We did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of kneeling and also there</v>

1315
01:06:32.921 --> 01:06:33.754
<v Speaker 4>were other kind of structural problems </v>
<v Speaker 4>as they got older because I walk with a </v>

1316
01:06:36.191 --> 01:06:39.910
<v Speaker 4>limp and one leg significantly bent and </v>
<v Speaker 4>one straight.</v>

1317
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:43.540
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tend to be completely out of balance,</v>

1318
01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:44.374
<v Speaker 4>out of sync with my body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I as soon developed a considerable </v>

1319
01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:49.150
<v Speaker 4>hip and back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1320
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.250
<v Speaker 4>so this was something I carried with me </v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole life.</v>

1321
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.600
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1322
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:54.203
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I started unit two at the age of </v>

1323
01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:56.540
<v Speaker 4>28,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1324
01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.453
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1325
01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:58.750
<v Speaker 4>there was a concern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1326
01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:00.400
<v Speaker 4>am I going to have to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1327
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:01.234
<v Speaker 4>fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ground grappling as a rule is generally </v>

1328
01:07:04.211 --> 01:07:07.240
<v Speaker 4>easier on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then standing martial arts,</v>

1329
01:07:07.241 --> 01:07:09.940
<v Speaker 4>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

1330
01:07:09.941 --> 01:07:10.840
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with my leg,</v>

1331
01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:14.020
<v Speaker 4>I could even become moderately effective</v>
<v Speaker 4>at more title taekwondo.</v>

1332
01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 4>It was something we had to get a jump </v>
<v Speaker 4>and land.</v>

1333
01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.620
<v Speaker 4>I just couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1334
01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.810
<v Speaker 4>whereas a Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's on the ground,</v>

1335
01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:21.160
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can become pretty good.</v>

1336
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I battled through that and uh,</v>

1337
01:07:25.391 --> 01:07:28.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I developed a,</v>

1338
01:07:28.931 --> 01:07:30.950
<v Speaker 4>a satisfactory degree of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1339
01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.013
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a blight belt from Henzel gracie </v>

1340
01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:33.844
<v Speaker 4>and I became one of his main teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you train with such a compromised </v>

1341
01:07:38.351 --> 01:07:39.080
<v Speaker 4>knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1342
01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.960
<v Speaker 4>you just figure out a way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just,</v>

1343
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:43.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do sit down?</v>

1344
01:07:43.590 --> 01:07:45.220
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never thought,</v>

1345
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:47.020
<v Speaker 4>well boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucked my knee up.</v>

1346
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to fuck my other knee up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1347
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:52.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think at that point you,</v>

1348
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.140
<v Speaker 4>you just got to go forward and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a choice.</v>

1349
01:07:56.141 --> 01:07:58.030
<v Speaker 4>You got to sit down and feel sorry for </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

1350
01:07:58.031 --> 01:08:00.250
<v Speaker 4>where you're going to do the best you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can with what you've gone.</v>

1351
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 4>And how limited was your game because </v>
<v Speaker 4>your knee,</v>

1352
01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:03.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were you able to,</v>

1353
01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:04.643
<v Speaker 4>standing position was difficult for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but will you ever do triangles and all </v>

1354
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:08.584
<v Speaker 4>sorts of different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1355
01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:09.730
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1356
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 4>every week or so I would tweak it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be in pain for a day.</v>

1357
01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:14.250
<v Speaker 4>I developed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1358
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:16.700
<v Speaker 4>a strong for Ibuprofen throughout my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1359
01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.080
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1360
01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 4>other problems started to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You switched to the lower back?</v>

1361
01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:25.700
<v Speaker 4>Lower back is a big issue and gave me </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>

1362
01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:26.534
<v Speaker 4>My whole animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listo now I have a machine I have to </v>

1363
01:08:29.601 --> 01:08:30.470
<v Speaker 4>show you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1364
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:33.260
<v Speaker 4>That's a called the reverse hyper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of it?</v>

1365
01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:34.123
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1366
01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:37.220
<v Speaker 4>I believe they were used by a guy called</v>
<v Speaker 4>Louis Simmons.</v>

1367
01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.373
<v Speaker 4>Tom?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1368
01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:41.630
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1369
01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:42.523
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't use one now because they have a </v>

1370
01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:45.800
<v Speaker 4>hip replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you go up,</v>

1371
01:08:45.801 --> 01:08:48.110
<v Speaker 4>it puts extreme shearing force on a hip </v>
<v Speaker 4>replacement.</v>

1372
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:51.110
<v Speaker 4>So I can do it with body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can't do it with a weight.</v>

1373
01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.393
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1374
01:08:52.450 --> 01:08:54.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm aware of what they are.</v>

1375
01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.003
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know many people speak very highly of </v>

1376
01:08:56.481 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm so yeah,</v>

1377
01:08:58.731 --> 01:09:01.020
<v Speaker 4>I had this problem and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1378
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:06.250
<v Speaker 4>things didn't really become critical </v>
<v Speaker 4>until my mid to early forties.</v>

1379
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.233
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a result of walking my whole life </v>

1380
01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:12.890
<v Speaker 4>with a limp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my left hip started to become completely</v>

1381
01:09:12.891 --> 01:09:13.724
<v Speaker 4>bone on bone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then the problem's doubled because </v>

1382
01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:19.250
<v Speaker 4>now I had a completely screwed up knee </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a hip,</v>

1383
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:20.443
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't get any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>operations because George St Pierre was </v>

1384
01:09:23.901 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Weidman was fighting.</v>

1385
01:09:25.431 --> 01:09:27.210
<v Speaker 4>They both had great goals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1386
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:29.510
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I delayed the,</v>

1387
01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:30.344
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hip operation as long as they could </v>

1388
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:35.540
<v Speaker 4>until George had his first retirement </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Chris Weidman,</v>

1389
01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 4>we became a world champion and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>moved further away to long island.</v>

1390
01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.940
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't training with me so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1391
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.220
<v Speaker 4>at that time I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1392
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.710
<v Speaker 4>I started training the squad and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1393
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my first,</v>

1394
01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:50.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>active competitive grappling student was</v>

1395
01:09:50.661 --> 01:09:52.490
<v Speaker 4>80 cummings and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1396
01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:53.773
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was able to work effectively with him </v>

1397
01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:00.200
<v Speaker 4>as best I could with my hip problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1398
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:02.840
<v Speaker 4>and of course the original lake problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1399
01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:07.010
<v Speaker 4>and then at some point I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it got to a point where I literally,</v>

1400
01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:08.893
<v Speaker 4>if I walked down in New York City block,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have to stop several times and </v>

1401
01:10:11.961 --> 01:10:12.794
<v Speaker 4>just stand on the side of the road and </v>
<v Speaker 4>wait for my hip to stop hurting so I </v>

1402
01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:19.460
<v Speaker 4>could walk in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just became impossible to work with.</v>

1403
01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:21.190
<v Speaker 4>And I ended up getting a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1404
01:10:21.191 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 4>a full hip replacement and that's when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they shear off the top of your head.</v>

1405
01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:26.113
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the screw bolt down in there with a new </v>

1406
01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:29.060
<v Speaker 4>hip and that's correct.</v>

1407
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.250
<v Speaker 4>And how does it feel now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pain free,</v>

1408
01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.070
<v Speaker 4>which is a wonderful thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1409
01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:35.610
<v Speaker 4>like any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1410
01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.640
<v Speaker 4>fake Hep is never going to be as strong </v>
<v Speaker 4>as your real hip.</v>

1411
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:39.200
<v Speaker 4>There's limitations on what I can do </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1412
01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.393
<v Speaker 4>The only problem was that shortly after </v>
<v Speaker 4>the hip replacement wind and then my </v>

1413
01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:47.090
<v Speaker 4>knee finally collapsed after 30 years of</v>
<v Speaker 4>of problems.</v>

1414
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:49.820
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm going to have to get a knee </v>
<v Speaker 4>replacement on the same leg.</v>

1415
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who and how do they do that?</v>

1416
01:10:53.721 --> 01:10:54.554
<v Speaker 4>One?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A knee replacements a little bit tricky </v>

1417
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 4>because you don't have as much bone mass</v>
<v Speaker 4>to work with.</v>

1418
01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:58.633
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>general generally the longevity of knee </v>

1419
01:11:00.651 --> 01:11:02.660
<v Speaker 4>replacements is not as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1420
01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.760
<v Speaker 4>cause there's much more movement and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>need.</v>

1421
01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:08.450
<v Speaker 4>And there there was in the hip there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>much greater range of motion,</v>

1422
01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.780
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this less bone to a fixed two.</v>

1423
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 4>They generally don't have the longevity </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>

1424
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:16.560
<v Speaker 4>a hip replacement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1425
01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.740
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1426
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 50 years old,</v>

1427
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 4>so ideally you would want a replacement </v>
<v Speaker 4>that outlived you,</v>

1428
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:27.690
<v Speaker 4>but I would probably have to get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>second knee replacement when I get older</v>

1429
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:31.260
<v Speaker 4>to replace the first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not ideal,</v>

1430
01:11:31.261 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 4>but I probably gonna have to do it.</v>

1431
01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.893
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what kind of crazy technology </v>

1432
01:11:35.671 --> 01:11:37.620
<v Speaker 2>they'll have down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

1433
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I have to give me some kind of superhero</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg that turns things around for me.</v>

1434
01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you never know.</v>

1435
01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of the hip replacement,</v>

1436
01:11:45.971 --> 01:11:50.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's so brutally invasive,</v>

1437
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:51.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sheering off the top of the hip and </v>

1438
01:11:52.711 --> 01:11:53.544
<v Speaker 2>then the rod that's inserted deep into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bone of the hip and then all that </v>

1439
01:11:58.801 --> 01:11:59.880
<v Speaker 2>jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1440
01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot going on there.</v>

1441
01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:03.003
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1442
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:04.390
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to answer your question,</v>

1443
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:06.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the early days it was a,</v>

1444
01:12:06.491 --> 01:12:08.290
<v Speaker 4>it was an impediment that I worked </v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

1445
01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as I got older,</v>

1446
01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to,</v>

1447
01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:15.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do a first operation and now a second,</v>

1448
01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:16.781
<v Speaker 4>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

1449
01:12:16.781 --> 01:12:18.970
<v Speaker 4>I was actually scheduled to get my knee </v>
<v Speaker 4>replacement tomorrow.</v>

1450
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:21.580
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1451
01:12:21.581 --> 01:12:25.990
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do it because Gary Toner and is</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be fighting his first MMA fight</v>

1452
01:12:25.991 --> 01:12:29.730
<v Speaker 4>and much 26 no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is He fighting for one FC One FC?</v>

1453
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:32.770
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I got the knee replacement now,</v>

1454
01:12:32.771 --> 01:12:35.360
<v Speaker 4>I would not be able to help them get </v>
<v Speaker 4>ready for us to first MMA fight,</v>

1455
01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:37.420
<v Speaker 4>which I thought would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1456
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:39.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not fear on my part in it,</v>

1457
01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:39.910
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1458
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:42.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I delayed it until,</v>

1459
01:12:42.071 --> 01:12:43.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after that fight.</v>

1460
01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:46.120
<v Speaker 4>Why did he decide on one MC?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting question.</v>

1461
01:12:46.121 --> 01:12:46.720
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to ask.</v>

1462
01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:49.420
<v Speaker 4>Gary told him to be certain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1463
01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

1464
01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.353
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of his main fears was that </v>

1465
01:12:54.281 --> 01:12:58.450
<v Speaker 4>if he went through the amateur route and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then worked his way towards the UFC,</v>

1466
01:12:58.900 --> 01:12:59.733
<v Speaker 4>there would be problems because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>already an established name in </v>

1467
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:02.794
<v Speaker 4>grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think he was concerned that it </v>

1468
01:13:04.541 --> 01:13:07.420
<v Speaker 4>would be difficult for him to get people</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fight amateur,</v>

1469
01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1470
01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:12.520
<v Speaker 4>and then eventually make its way to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC.</v>

1471
01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:17.660
<v Speaker 4>Whereas one FC is a fairly well known </v>
<v Speaker 4>organization and they were pretty open.</v>

1472
01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.553
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did a grappling match for them and </v>

1473
01:13:19.541 --> 01:13:20.770
<v Speaker 4>they loved it and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1474
01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:23.710
<v Speaker 4>are you interested in mma?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he could,</v>

1475
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:25.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as it were,</v>

1476
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:30.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go into a fairly high level of mma right</v>

1477
01:13:30.521 --> 01:13:34.060
<v Speaker 4>from the start as opposed to do a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>circuitous amateur route and then battle</v>

1478
01:13:34.061 --> 01:13:36.250
<v Speaker 4>his way into the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

1479
01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.720
<v Speaker 4>don't quote me on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I leave.</v>

1480
01:13:37.721 --> 01:13:38.370
<v Speaker 4>That was the logic</v>

1481
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:41.960
<v Speaker 2>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now are you a book?</v>

1482
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:46.470
<v Speaker 2>So when you're demonstrating techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're demonstrating them verbally.</v>

1483
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:48.830
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the hip replacement,</v>

1484
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I could only do it verbally and I had to</v>
<v Speaker 4>trust and,</v>

1485
01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

1486
01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:54.620
<v Speaker 4>my students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 cummings,</v>

1487
01:13:54.621 --> 01:13:55.431
<v Speaker 4>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom and Gordon,</v>

1488
01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Ryan and others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian Glick isn't,</v>

1489
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:59.480
<v Speaker 4>no one knows him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's one of my,</v>

1490
01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:00.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great students.</v>

1491
01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:01.880
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

1492
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:04.430
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>point with a stick and,</v>

1493
01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:07.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would do the most for me.</v>

1494
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:08.203
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since then I've gotten a little better </v>

1495
01:14:09.501 --> 01:14:12.780
<v Speaker 4>and I like to demonstrate as best can </v>
<v Speaker 4>these days when I,</v>

1496
01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:14.620
<v Speaker 4>I can barely walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1497
01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:15.454
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on those days I'll have the students go </v>

1498
01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:17.464
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes there's certain standard </v>

1499
01:14:18.781 --> 01:14:19.614
<v Speaker 4>techniques that I had a little risky for</v>
<v Speaker 4>me to do and I'll have students </v>

1500
01:14:21.881 --> 01:14:23.560
<v Speaker 4>demonstrate those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1501
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:25.090
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1502
01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:26.063
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do what I can on the days that I </v>

1503
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:29.370
<v Speaker 4>teach.</v>

1504
01:14:29.370 --> 01:14:30.203
<v Speaker 2>It is quite fascinating that a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was catastrophic injuries of his leg is </v>

1505
01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:40.671
<v Speaker 2>one who is known for being an innovator </v>
<v Speaker 2>and crushing people's lives.</v>

1506
01:14:40.911 --> 01:14:41.744
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is something kind of a strange </v>

1507
01:14:43.501 --> 01:14:44.430
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1508
01:14:44.431 --> 01:14:46.080
<v Speaker 2>You were joking around about it being </v>
<v Speaker 2>revenge.</v>

1509
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is missing my revenge against the </v>

1510
01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:50.610
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If God took away my leg,</v>

1511
01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking away everybody else's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1512
01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.360
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1513
01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:54.841
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1514
01:14:54.841 --> 01:14:57.810
<v Speaker 2>there was something ironic about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1515
01:14:57.811 --> 01:15:01.710
<v Speaker 2>when your teaching this system and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1516
01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:02.573
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1517
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:05.560
<v Speaker 2>showing all the guys in the squad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Donna,</v>

1518
01:15:05.561 --> 01:15:08.070
<v Speaker 2>her death squad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have,</v>

1519
01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:08.963
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like do you have it worked out to the </v>

1520
01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.250
<v Speaker 2>point where it's like you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>curriculum?</v>

1521
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:15.383
<v Speaker 2>Like do you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like the word curriculum because </v>

1522
01:15:17.191 --> 01:15:18.890
<v Speaker 2>that kind of implies that it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked out and yeah.</v>

1523
01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Violence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's done step by step.</v>

1524
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:25.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I come in on any given day and I'm,</v>

1525
01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.213
<v Speaker 4>I'm there seven days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watch all of my athletes every single </v>

1526
01:15:29.071 --> 01:15:29.904
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't do anything without me </v>

1527
01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:32.003
<v Speaker 4>watching them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I know at the end of every day what </v>

1528
01:15:34.651 --> 01:15:36.750
<v Speaker 4>they need to work on tomorrow because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm there.</v>

1529
01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.430
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like a set curriculum early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1530
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.780
<v Speaker 4>I know that on April 13 I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1531
01:15:42.781 --> 01:15:46.260
<v Speaker 4>And it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I saw you train yesterday.</v>

1532
01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:48.480
<v Speaker 4>I saw where you fucked up and I saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you were good.</v>

1533
01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:50.370
<v Speaker 4>So tomorrow we're working this.</v>

1534
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:51.403
<v Speaker 2>What an amazing resource for those guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have someone like you standing over </v>

1535
01:15:54.831 --> 01:15:55.664
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching them and analyzing their </v>

1536
01:15:57.321 --> 01:15:59.450
<v Speaker 2>positions and techniques and progress.</v>

1537
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.700
<v Speaker 4>That's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's generous of you to say.</v>

1538
01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.713
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I always feel that my students are </v>

1539
01:16:06.891 --> 01:16:09.290
<v Speaker 4>more of a resource to me than I am to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1540
01:16:09.710 --> 01:16:10.543
<v Speaker 4>I've been blessed through my entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>coaching career to have some truly </v>

1541
01:16:13.431 --> 01:16:17.390
<v Speaker 4>remarkable students,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of whom are famous and known to you</v>

1542
01:16:17.391 --> 01:16:19.700
<v Speaker 4>and many others who aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1543
01:16:19.701 --> 01:16:21.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1544
01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:26.260
<v Speaker 4>whatever debt they owe to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel I owe at least as much to them.</v>

1545
01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.113
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my students literally give me </v>

1546
01:16:31.011 --> 01:16:31.950
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1547
01:16:31.951 --> 01:16:34.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm a notoriously difficult person to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get along with them,</v>

1548
01:16:34.431 --> 01:16:36.500
<v Speaker 4>demanding I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a perfectionist.</v>

1549
01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:39.590
<v Speaker 4>I can be downright unpleasant when my </v>
<v Speaker 4>body's in pain,</v>

1550
01:16:39.591 --> 01:16:41.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm short tempered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1551
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:45.770
<v Speaker 4>and yet they're like angels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They based stick in there and they tough</v>

1552
01:16:45.771 --> 01:16:48.440
<v Speaker 4>it out and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they give so much time,</v>

1553
01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:50.090
<v Speaker 4>so much effort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much thought.</v>

1554
01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:53.840
<v Speaker 4>And as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever resource I am to them,</v>

1555
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:55.640
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they give it right back.</v>

1556
01:16:55.641 --> 01:16:56.630
<v Speaker 4>There are a resource to me.</v>

1557
01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:57.983
<v Speaker 2>Well that that attitude is why you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a fantastic coach in the first </v>

1558
01:17:00.421 --> 01:17:01.430
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1559
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:02.303
<v Speaker 2>I remember one of the first times I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>started talking to you is when you were </v>

1560
01:17:05.311 --> 01:17:10.311
<v Speaker 2>working with George.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what's interesting is you had a very</v>

1561
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:15.430
<v Speaker 3>interesting approach and even the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you describe things you would talk about</v>

1562
01:17:15.651 --> 01:17:16.640
<v Speaker 3>shoot boxing.</v>

1563
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:17.623
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

1564
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Describe that because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't talk when like I remember,</v>

1565
01:17:22.541 --> 01:17:23.374
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of our first long </v>

1566
01:17:24.401 --> 01:17:25.234
<v Speaker 3>conversations with at some weird denny's</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something somewhere and one of those </v>

1567
01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:33.370
<v Speaker 3>weird roadshows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like will it just sat down where you are</v>

1568
01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:33.970
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1569
01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:38.770
<v Speaker 3>That was the first time we met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a long conversation and um,</v>

1570
01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.680
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about the principles of</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot boxing.</v>

1571
01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.930
<v Speaker 5>Please explain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1572
01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:48.580
<v Speaker 5>one of the strange things about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sport of mixed martial arts is so young.</v>

1573
01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:53.380
<v Speaker 5>There's still so much to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1574
01:17:53.381 --> 01:17:57.370
<v Speaker 5>Even the way people understand mixed </v>
<v Speaker 5>martial arts to me is interesting.</v>

1575
01:17:58.780 --> 01:17:59.613
<v Speaker 5>99% of people who look at mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>arts see mixed martial arts as an </v>

1576
01:18:04.301 --> 01:18:07.420
<v Speaker 5>eclectic sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

1577
01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:11.320
<v Speaker 5>it's a conglomeration of different </v>
<v Speaker 5>martial arts kind of banded together and</v>

1578
01:18:11.321 --> 01:18:14.650
<v Speaker 5>then you've got mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a mix of martial arts and there you</v>

1579
01:18:14.651 --> 01:18:16.380
<v Speaker 5>have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get two guys in a cage.</v>

1580
01:18:16.381 --> 01:18:17.214
<v Speaker 5>And what mixed martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never saw mixed martial arts as an </v>

1581
01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:25.150
<v Speaker 5>eclectic sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see it as a transcendent sport.</v>

1582
01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.333
<v Speaker 5>What I mean by that is there were four </v>
<v Speaker 5>distinct skill areas of mixed martial </v>

1583
01:18:32.471 --> 01:18:37.471
<v Speaker 5>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any one of those skill areas always goes</v>

1584
01:18:37.901 --> 01:18:41.740
<v Speaker 5>beyond the component martial arts that </v>
<v Speaker 5>make it up.</v>

1585
01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:44.043
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the skill area transcends the various </v>

1586
01:18:47.471 --> 01:18:48.304
<v Speaker 5>martial arts that make it up and create </v>
<v Speaker 5>something bigger and different from the </v>

1587
01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:54.910
<v Speaker 5>core components that originally built </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1588
01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:57.880
<v Speaker 5>When you look at the sport of mixed </v>
<v Speaker 5>martial arts,</v>

1589
01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:00.460
<v Speaker 5>you see there were four dominant skill </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas.</v>

1590
01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:02.613
<v Speaker 5>The first occurs when they first come </v>
<v Speaker 5>out and the two athletes who have no </v>

1591
01:19:06.161 --> 01:19:08.830
<v Speaker 5>connection with each other and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>dancing around the cage.</v>

1592
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.010
<v Speaker 5>This is the so called shoot boxing </v>
<v Speaker 5>phase,</v>

1593
01:19:15.011 --> 01:19:17.950
<v Speaker 5>which involves skills drawn from western</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing,</v>

1594
01:19:17.951 --> 01:19:21.250
<v Speaker 5>Muay Thai karate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a freestyle wrestling,</v>

1595
01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.413
<v Speaker 5>and various other martial arts with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>two athletes are jockeying for position </v>

1596
01:19:26.021 --> 01:19:29.020
<v Speaker 5>and typically they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>determine the direction of the fight.</v>

1597
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:34.120
<v Speaker 5>Would it go down or would it stay up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one skill area.</v>

1598
01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:36.333
<v Speaker 5>The second skill area as a skill area of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the clinch with the two athletes are </v>

1599
01:19:39.491 --> 01:19:40.324
<v Speaker 5>both still standing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now they've got a hold on each </v>

1600
01:19:41.801 --> 01:19:42.634
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They no longer moving around will this </v>

1601
01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:50.530
<v Speaker 5>has its key components come and drill </v>
<v Speaker 5>them from Moitai,</v>

1602
01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.580
<v Speaker 5>Greco,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roman wrestling,</v>

1603
01:19:51.581 --> 01:19:52.840
<v Speaker 5>freestyle wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>judo,</v>

1604
01:19:52.841 --> 01:19:53.674
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

1605
01:19:55.330 --> 01:20:00.330
<v Speaker 5>Then there's a third key skill area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The area of fence fighting fence.</v>

1606
01:20:04.771 --> 01:20:07.860
<v Speaker 5>Boxing with a two athletes are in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>clinch,</v>

1607
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.113
<v Speaker 4>but they're locked on the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which dramatically changes the skills </v>

1608
01:20:12.421 --> 01:20:14.610
<v Speaker 4>required for success than if you're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the open.</v>

1609
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:19.350
<v Speaker 4>And then you have a fourth skill area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the ground.</v>

1610
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:22.320
<v Speaker 4>And of course that's divided into top </v>
<v Speaker 4>and bottom position.</v>

1611
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:27.210
<v Speaker 4>So there were four skill areas of mixed </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts.</v>

1612
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:30.260
<v Speaker 4>You could add more or less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1613
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:31.643
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could add in the idea of the </v>

1614
01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:34.890
<v Speaker 4>geography of the cage can add a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>

1615
01:20:34.891 --> 01:20:37.140
<v Speaker 4>but let's stick with that fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>four for now.</v>

1616
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:41.550
<v Speaker 4>If you show me any one of those skill </v>
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>

1617
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:47.270
<v Speaker 4>yes you can derive skills from those </v>
<v Speaker 4>component martial arts,</v>

1618
01:20:48.691 --> 01:20:49.880
<v Speaker 4>from Moitai,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Judah,</v>

1619
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:50.873
<v Speaker 4>whatever you choose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that skill here is going to have </v>

1620
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.073
<v Speaker 4>other elements that are not part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those original martial arts that has </v>

1621
01:20:58.291 --> 01:21:02.460
<v Speaker 4>something different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something unique and something above the</v>

1622
01:21:02.461 --> 01:21:04.620
<v Speaker 4>various component martial arts that made</v>
<v Speaker 4>it up</v>

1623
01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:08.013
<v Speaker 4>when you're fighting on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of what you do is the ride from </v>

1624
01:21:10.871 --> 01:21:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Brazilian Jujitsu and modern mixed </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts.</v>

1625
01:21:12.581 --> 01:21:14.600
<v Speaker 4>Most of the athletes come from a to two </v>
<v Speaker 4>background.</v>

1626
01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:16.053
<v Speaker 4>When they work ground skills they they </v>
<v Speaker 4>work on in a kind of a Jujitsu </v>

1627
01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:21.400
<v Speaker 4>framework,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but many of the things going on down,</v>

1628
01:21:21.401 --> 01:21:22.234
<v Speaker 4>there are a mix of things that are far </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of your daily training and </v>

1629
01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:30.240
<v Speaker 4>designed units.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can bring in things from Moitai,</v>

1630
01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:31.870
<v Speaker 4>you're throwing Moitai al was on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground,</v>

1631
01:21:31.871 --> 01:21:33.940
<v Speaker 4>but on the ground the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always have a very different feel from</v>

1632
01:21:33.941 --> 01:21:35.160
<v Speaker 4>the standing position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've,</v>

1633
01:21:35.170 --> 01:21:37.090
<v Speaker 4>a mechanics behind them is significantly</v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

1634
01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:38.403
<v Speaker 4>You're throwing hooks on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the mechanics of and hooks on the </v>

1635
01:21:41.951 --> 01:21:42.784
<v Speaker 4>ground have very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different from the mechanics of </v>

1636
01:21:43.721 --> 01:21:46.570
<v Speaker 4>throwing hooks in the standing position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1637
01:21:46.571 --> 01:21:48.720
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're bringing skills in from box,</v>

1638
01:21:48.721 --> 01:21:51.860
<v Speaker 4>but you're adapting them to God.</v>

1639
01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.790
<v Speaker 4>So the way to look at the sport of mixed</v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts is not just like,</v>

1640
01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.653
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to rope together some race </v>

1641
01:21:56.831 --> 01:21:57.664
<v Speaker 4>lanes and boxing and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rather you're developing skills in four </v>

1642
01:22:03.911 --> 01:22:05.770
<v Speaker 4>distinct areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a minimum of four,</v>

1643
01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.510
<v Speaker 4>and the skills you ultimately develop go</v>
<v Speaker 4>beyond.</v>

1644
01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:15.580
<v Speaker 4>And I'd significantly different from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>core components that you started with.</v>

1645
01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:17.493
<v Speaker 4>And so ultimately the skills of a mixed </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial artist at the highest levels </v>

1646
01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:24.520
<v Speaker 4>transcend the various corps martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 4>that made the sport up.</v>

1647
01:22:24.521 --> 01:22:29.230
<v Speaker 4>You're going to something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going further when you fight in a</v>

1648
01:22:29.231 --> 01:22:31.090
<v Speaker 4>mixed martial arts fighter in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu fighter,</v>

1649
01:22:31.091 --> 01:22:34.630
<v Speaker 4>huge in a lot more than just you did sir</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the various other boxing styles,</v>

1650
01:22:34.631 --> 01:22:35.770
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera that you used.</v>

1651
01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.220
<v Speaker 4>In the case of shute box and and George </v>
<v Speaker 4>St Pierre,</v>

1652
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:42.850
<v Speaker 4>everyone always talks about George's </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling.</v>

1653
01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Now George is a very good wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's wrestler a long time with very good</v>

1654
01:22:48.001 --> 01:22:53.001
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but 90% of the success of his ability to</v>

1655
01:22:53.931 --> 01:22:54.764
<v Speaker 4>take people down goes far beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling and has to do with the </v>

1656
01:22:59.510 --> 01:23:03.770
<v Speaker 4>precursors to the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What wrestling teachers,</v>

1657
01:23:03.771 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 4>he drew a mixed martial arts is how to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot.</v>

1658
01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 5>It gives you the body mechanics to </v>
<v Speaker 5>finish the shot,</v>

1659
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:15.180
<v Speaker 5>but the sit ups completely different </v>
<v Speaker 5>from wrestling.</v>

1660
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.073
<v Speaker 5>I can show you endless examples of good </v>
<v Speaker 5>liz who went into mixed martial arts </v>

1661
01:23:20.081 --> 01:23:20.914
<v Speaker 5>competition with no background in mixed </v>
<v Speaker 5>martial arts and couldn't take anybody </v>

1662
01:23:23.561 --> 01:23:25.750
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That distance is different.</v>

1663
01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:27.370
<v Speaker 5>The standards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different emotion is different.</v>

1664
01:23:27.371 --> 01:23:29.950
<v Speaker 5>The set ups are completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The context is different.</v>

1665
01:23:29.951 --> 01:23:31.330
<v Speaker 5>You've been punched sort of grappling.</v>

1666
01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.553
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1667
01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.550
<v Speaker 5>George,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion,</v>

1668
01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:44.610
<v Speaker 5>throughout his career had a level of </v>
<v Speaker 5>skill and technical insight and the,</v>

1669
01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.393
<v Speaker 5>the art of boxing kickboxing into take </v>
<v Speaker 5>downs that no one else has even come </v>

1670
01:23:51.961 --> 01:23:52.794
<v Speaker 5>close to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Much of what he did in that area came </v>

1671
01:23:59.071 --> 01:24:01.320
<v Speaker 5>from himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did he have good wrestling coaches?</v>

1672
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:03.450
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did he have good boxing coaches?</v>

1673
01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.150
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

1674
01:24:06.151 --> 01:24:08.040
<v Speaker 5>Moitai coaches 100%.</v>

1675
01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:09.980
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1676
01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:14.980
<v Speaker 5>But the skills he was exhibiting went </v>
<v Speaker 5>beyond any one of those teachers or even</v>

1677
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:16.783
<v Speaker 5>them as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The act of tying together all of those </v>

1678
01:24:21.381 --> 01:24:25.640
<v Speaker 5>disparate skills came from him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The integration of skills.</v>

1679
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:29.720
<v Speaker 5>And so you have someone who had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling background,</v>

1680
01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.150
<v Speaker 5>had a boxing background,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had a Moitai background,</v>

1681
01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:32.984
<v Speaker 5>but ultimately what he was doing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>something bigger than all of those put </v>

1682
01:24:35.241 --> 01:24:36.074
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a sign of just to get fit here </v>

1683
01:24:37.671 --> 01:24:38.450
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1684
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:40.920
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sum was,</v>

1685
01:24:41.150 --> 01:24:44.270
<v Speaker 5>was somehow greater than the components </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1686
01:24:44.370 --> 01:24:46.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>individually made it up.</v>

1687
01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:48.860
<v Speaker 5>And that's what I mean when I talk about</v>
<v Speaker 5>a trans in and support.</v>

1688
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:54.440
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>George St Pierre was largely responsible</v>

1689
01:24:54.650 --> 01:24:55.483
<v Speaker 5>through individual experimentation </v>
<v Speaker 5>starting in his late teens and going </v>

1690
01:24:59.361 --> 01:25:02.270
<v Speaker 5>through his entire career in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>development of shoot box.</v>

1691
01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.153
<v Speaker 3>Now when you work as a coach for George,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you weren't just working as a Jujitsu </v>

1692
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:11.703
<v Speaker 3>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were working in almost like a </v>

1693
01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:18.841
<v Speaker 3>mastermind sort of a position you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I saw some conversations that you</v>

1694
01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:24.640
<v Speaker 3>had with him where you discussed various</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and in fact one of the things you</v>

1695
01:25:24.641 --> 01:25:25.474
<v Speaker 3>came to me about was you asked me if I </v>
<v Speaker 3>knew anyone who was proficient at the </v>

1696
01:25:30.071 --> 01:25:34.480
<v Speaker 3>spinning back kick and that's how I got </v>
<v Speaker 3>to working with George.</v>

1697
01:25:35.010 --> 01:25:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1698
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:40.550
<v Speaker 3>your coaching with him was not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>simply like the,</v>

1699
01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.200
<v Speaker 3>these are the principles of Jiu Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I want you to work on.</v>

1700
01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.213
<v Speaker 3>When the fight goes to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were working on a lot of different </v>

1701
01:25:48.761 --> 01:25:50.860
<v Speaker 3>aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you are a guy,</v>

1702
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:51.703
<v Speaker 3>they'd sort of put it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when you don't have a background in </v>

1703
01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:57.580
<v Speaker 3>striking and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1704
01:25:57.710 --> 01:25:58.543
<v Speaker 3>you were looking at all of these various</v>
<v Speaker 3>disciplines and trying to formulate a </v>

1705
01:26:01.991 --> 01:26:06.230
<v Speaker 3>strategy for a guy who just such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>supreme athlete like George,</v>

1706
01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.080
<v Speaker 3>how did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you formulate that?</v>

1707
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.943
<v Speaker 3>Did you do it based on the individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>and based on their physical strengths </v>

1708
01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:14.054
<v Speaker 3>and limitations and sort of formulate </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you think would be the best </v>

1709
01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:17.774
<v Speaker 3>approach?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you work it out with him in </v>

1710
01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:20.240
<v Speaker 3>conjunction?</v>

1711
01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1712
01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:24.490
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when George comes to train with me this,</v>

1713
01:26:24.491 --> 01:26:26.060
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of considerations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1714
01:26:26.061 --> 01:26:28.040
<v Speaker 4>George lives in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in New York.</v>

1715
01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:30.090
<v Speaker 4>So time is always an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1716
01:26:30.091 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 4>he does go down there because then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite often,</v>

1717
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:33.380
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1718
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:35.930
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like a squat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The squat like seven days a week,</v>

1719
01:26:35.931 --> 01:26:37.490
<v Speaker 4>three times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>George was never liked that.</v>

1720
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1721
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:44.690
<v Speaker 4>so in the time available we'll work on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1722
01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:45.800
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on what we can,</v>

1723
01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:47.050
<v Speaker 4>so everything's always done with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Georgia.</v>

1724
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:48.103
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much time is available and what is </v>

1725
01:26:49.311 --> 01:26:51.200
<v Speaker 4>the scenario that's coming up for </v>
<v Speaker 4>George?</v>

1726
01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:52.400
<v Speaker 4>Almost always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

1727
01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:53.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1728
01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.910
<v Speaker 4>an upcoming mixed martial arts fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1729
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a lot of people often ask me to say,</v>

1730
01:26:58.171 --> 01:26:58.431
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1731
01:26:58.431 --> 01:27:00.950
<v Speaker 4>how can we didn't teach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>teach George Saint Pierre Lake logs,</v>

1732
01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:04.340
<v Speaker 4>why wasn't he leg lock and everyone in </v>
<v Speaker 4>mma?</v>

1733
01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.260
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's,</v>

1734
01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:07.610
<v Speaker 4>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1735
01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:09.320
<v Speaker 4>first off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1736
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:11.263
<v Speaker 4>leg locking as you saw from the Gordon </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ryan Clip requires if it's not done </v>

1737
01:27:16.581 --> 01:27:17.414
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>leg log in is one of those things where </v>

1738
01:27:18.201 --> 01:27:19.490
<v Speaker 4>if it's done well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing,</v>

1739
01:27:19.491 --> 01:27:20.324
<v Speaker 4>but if it's done badly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the worst looking thing in the </v>

1740
01:27:21.531 --> 01:27:23.630
<v Speaker 4>world and said disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1741
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:25.280
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1742
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:26.143
<v Speaker 4>secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Georgia's game because his down to so </v>

1743
01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.310
<v Speaker 4>strong as almost always done from top </v>
<v Speaker 4>position on the ground.</v>

1744
01:27:31.311 --> 01:27:33.800
<v Speaker 4>Is it rare for George to be in bottomed </v>
<v Speaker 4>session on the ground?</v>

1745
01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in a fight situation,</v>

1746
01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:37.364
<v Speaker 4>if you're already on top of someone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got the striking prowess of </v>

1747
01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:41.510
<v Speaker 4>George St Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was happy to,</v>

1748
01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 4>to coach him more and what we call a </v>
<v Speaker 4>grapple boxing.</v>

1749
01:27:44.661 --> 01:27:45.494
<v Speaker 4>Just the skill of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of grappling to punching on the ground </v>

1750
01:27:47.911 --> 01:27:50.390
<v Speaker 4>that just made more sense for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1751
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.313
<v Speaker 4>he's competent and leg logging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's not like Gary Thompson and </v>

1752
01:27:54.710 --> 01:27:56.060
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Cummings or Gordon Ryan.</v>

1753
01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:57.950
<v Speaker 4>It could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he finished most black belts.</v>

1754
01:27:57.951 --> 01:27:58.784
<v Speaker 4>He absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But why would you stake a fight where </v>

1755
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:03.650
<v Speaker 4>literally millions of dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean 40 is a legacy on the line.</v>

1756
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:04.753
<v Speaker 4>Why would you take that risk when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could just stay on time to punch him </v>

1757
01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:07.364
<v Speaker 4>out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peggy did was say John Fetch for </v>

1758
01:28:07.941 --> 01:28:08.810
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1759
01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:11.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it didn't really make sense that push</v>

1760
01:28:11.671 --> 01:28:13.610
<v Speaker 4>that hard on George.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1761
01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.930
<v Speaker 4>your question though was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1762
01:28:14.931 --> 01:28:17.840
<v Speaker 4>well what about these other skills?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about standing position?</v>

1763
01:28:17.841 --> 01:28:18.740
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1764
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:19.603
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated not just by judges who </v>

1765
01:28:20.641 --> 01:28:24.820
<v Speaker 4>are my martial arts in general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've always believed all the various</v>

1766
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:25.663
<v Speaker 4>sport martial arts in the world have </v>
<v Speaker 4>areas where they are particularly </v>

1767
01:28:28.911 --> 01:28:29.840
<v Speaker 4>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>

1768
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:31.940
<v Speaker 4>I've always people make fun of </v>
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo,</v>

1769
01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:32.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are,</v>

1770
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:34.420
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to just talk with him and him</v>

1771
01:28:34.421 --> 01:28:36.730
<v Speaker 4>and me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll back me up on this joke.</v>

1772
01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:40.700
<v Speaker 4>There are some taekwondo players out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there at Olympic level who can kick with</v>

1773
01:28:40.701 --> 01:28:43.550
<v Speaker 4>a skill level that most people can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even imagine.</v>

1774
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:45.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1775
01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:46.753
<v Speaker 4>I've seen people like heard Perez </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicking demonstrations where you're </v>

1776
01:28:51.231 --> 01:28:52.064
<v Speaker 4>looking at it as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the most impressive </v>

1777
01:28:52.701 --> 01:28:55.370
<v Speaker 4>things I've ever seen in my life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is as the guy who,</v>

1778
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:57.380
<v Speaker 4>if he hits you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to take your head off.</v>

1779
01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.710
<v Speaker 4>It's impressive to borrowers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There wouldn't hurt.</v>

1780
01:28:59.711 --> 01:29:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Pres was in his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched him.</v>

1781
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a few people.</v>

1782
01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:04.853
<v Speaker 2>I watched him Kao uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the u s national champions with </v>

1783
01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:10.560
<v Speaker 2>an ax care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the worst Kaos have ever seen in</v>

1784
01:29:10.561 --> 01:29:11.394
<v Speaker 2>my life came from taekwondo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they tend to involve a jump </v>

1785
01:29:14.821 --> 01:29:17.400
<v Speaker 2>spinning kicks with is just huge amounts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1786
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:19.270
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of kinetic energy being developed.</v>

1787
01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.153
<v Speaker 2>You see the same thing can point </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting crises and terrible knock outs </v>

1788
01:29:22.011 --> 01:29:24.360
<v Speaker 2>and point finding because people make </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun of these sports.</v>

1789
01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Acting on their own is the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the issue.</v>

1790
01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:29.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the issue on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got problems.</v>

1791
01:29:29.311 --> 01:29:31.420
<v Speaker 2>But if you can integrate that into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door,</v>

1792
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:33.420
<v Speaker 2>well developed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete skillset,</v>

1793
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:34.283
<v Speaker 2>they could be incredibly effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I always saw tremendous potential </v>

1794
01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.240
<v Speaker 2>for Tae Kwon dos jumps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning back kick.</v>

1795
01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:42.510
<v Speaker 2>No one does spinning back x better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo.</v>

1796
01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the main things.</v>

1797
01:29:44.581 --> 01:29:45.690
<v Speaker 2>And they do it incredibly well.</v>

1798
01:29:45.690 --> 01:29:48.510
<v Speaker 2>The set ups are fantastic that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>application and mechanics,</v>

1799
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:51.660
<v Speaker 2>everything's super impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I always thought that would be a,</v>

1800
01:29:51.661 --> 01:29:53.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George had a good spinning back kick,</v>

1801
01:29:53.491 --> 01:29:54.990
<v Speaker 2>but I thought that would be a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>addition.</v>

1802
01:29:54.991 --> 01:29:58.410
<v Speaker 2>You always want to be building new </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills into upon or you don't,</v>

1803
01:29:58.530 --> 01:29:59.363
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be that predictable </v>
<v Speaker 2>guide where everyone knows what you're </v>

1804
01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:02.610
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1805
01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:03.613
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know you came from taekwondo </v>

1806
01:30:04.501 --> 01:30:05.334
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I thought that would be an </v>

1807
01:30:06.451 --> 01:30:08.310
<v Speaker 2>interesting thing for you to work on </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him.</v>

1808
01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a funny conversation because that</v>

1809
01:30:11.161 --> 01:30:12.750
<v Speaker 2>was my specialty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1810
01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.880
<v Speaker 2>And so when you brought in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to talk to you.</v>

1811
01:30:14.881 --> 01:30:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I was fuck found your fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he came up to me and you said,</v>

1812
01:30:18.061 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 2>do you know anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like a trick question.</v>

1813
01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:21.600
<v Speaker 2>It was a trick question.</v>

1814
01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone besides your aunt,</v>

1815
01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 2>what I sat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1816
01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:28.860
<v Speaker 2>I was hesitant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1817
01:30:28.861 --> 01:30:30.540
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to believe this.</v>

1818
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:34.140
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew you had a good jump spinning back</v>

1819
01:30:34.141 --> 01:30:35.340
<v Speaker 2>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to subtly,</v>

1820
01:30:35.410 --> 01:30:36.243
<v Speaker 2>did you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1821
01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:40.950
<v Speaker 2>How did you know word gets around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were just fucking with me.</v>

1822
01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1823
01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I felt like when I was telling you I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like man I don't even want to,</v>

1824
01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:48.470
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew someone who did it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>two ls.</v>

1825
01:30:48.930 --> 01:30:49.763
<v Speaker 2>You should have just been like yeah I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>got the best jump spinning back kick in </v>

1826
01:30:51.631 --> 01:30:52.464
<v Speaker 2>the fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did jump spinning back kick quite a </v>

1827
01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:56.610
<v Speaker 2>bit but I prefer a regular spinning </v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1828
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I want my foot on the ground cause I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>just going off of that foot.</v>

1829
01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:01.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a significant amount of force in</v>

1830
01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:05.610
<v Speaker 2>the left leg forcing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing off that back.</v>

1831
01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:06.653
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly you've seen some some guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there now having good success and </v>

1832
01:31:09.721 --> 01:31:12.060
<v Speaker 2>even maybe staying back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I remember seeing Michael Page had</v>

<v Speaker 2>a beautiful one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got everything that guy can very </v>

1834
01:31:14.761 --> 01:31:15.594

<v Speaker 2>you've seen him in Beltour kickbox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1845
01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:42.870
<v Speaker 2>and you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the integration of the two.</v>

1846
01:31:42.871 --> 01:31:44.100
<v Speaker 2>It's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1847
01:31:44.101 --> 01:31:44.934
<v Speaker 2>he could just do things physically that </v>
<v Speaker 2>most kickboxer just really don't know </v>

1848
01:31:48.781 --> 01:31:50.190
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll,</v>

1849
01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:54.990
<v Speaker 2>he'll jump up and do what's called like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a touch spinning back kick.</v>

1850
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll jump up and touch you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the front leg.</v>

1851
01:31:58.410 --> 01:32:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit it in a glorified I believe.</v>

1852
01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.450
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1853
01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.080
<v Speaker 2>he's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's phenomenal.</v>

1854
01:32:05.081 --> 01:32:05.914
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1855
01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:11.020
<v Speaker 2>when you see that it's like those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>by themselves,</v>

1856
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:13.240
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to get taken to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground and smashed.</v>

1857
01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:14.074
<v Speaker 2>And most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you land one of those </v>

1858
01:32:16.301 --> 01:32:18.220
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic spinning back kicks right </v>
<v Speaker 2>away,</v>

1859
01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.530
<v Speaker 2>the the odds are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1860
01:32:20.531 --> 01:32:24.700
<v Speaker 2>you need all those other things as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to be particularly effective,</v>

1861
01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:29.120
<v Speaker 2>which is why George was such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was a,</v>

1863
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:32.223
<v Speaker 2>that was a fun moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an interesting because like I've </v>

1864
01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:36.010
<v Speaker 2>always wanted to like show somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1865
01:32:36.330 --> 01:32:38.380
<v Speaker 2>It's cause it's a weird little thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I know how to do.</v>

1866
01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:41.010
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going back to your original question,</v>

1867
01:32:41.011 --> 01:32:41.844
<v Speaker 4>the idea of Georgian and shoot box,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will see that Georgia's entire </v>

1868
01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:45.053
<v Speaker 4>methodology in a standing position is </v>
<v Speaker 4>built around the concept of a dilemma </v>

1869
01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:54.060
<v Speaker 4>that the Lemur is always between his jet</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his takedown.</v>

1870
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:59.520
<v Speaker 4>People always talk about proactive and </v>
<v Speaker 4>reactive takedowns.</v>

1871
01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:00.923
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's are reactive to discuss a </v>

1872
01:33:02.041 --> 01:33:02.874
<v Speaker 4>proactive takedown guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing about George is he would use </v>

1873
01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:08.093
<v Speaker 4>his jab proactively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he would use his takedowns </v>

1874
01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:12.383
<v Speaker 4>reactively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that's interesting because George </v>

1875
01:33:15.631 --> 01:33:17.910
<v Speaker 4>would literally provoke people.</v>

1876
01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:19.740
<v Speaker 2>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take down,</v>

1877
01:33:19.810 --> 01:33:20.643
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to point this out past </v>

1878
01:33:21.821 --> 01:33:24.900
<v Speaker 2>tense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying this like,</v>

1879
01:33:24.901 --> 01:33:26.190
<v Speaker 2>you know something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1880
01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:26.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1881
01:33:26.670 --> 01:33:27.503
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's George just won the middleweight </v>

1882
01:33:29.221 --> 01:33:30.990
<v Speaker 2>title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relinquished the title,</v>

1883
01:33:30.991 --> 01:33:33.570
<v Speaker 2>and then the great speculation is will </v>
<v Speaker 2>George fight again?</v>

1884
01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.453
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The truth is no one knows because it </v>

1885
01:33:35.691 --> 01:33:37.700
<v Speaker 4>comes down some medical problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>George has,</v>

1886
01:33:37.701 --> 01:33:38.534
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1887
01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:39.453
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a problem on his stomach and </v>

1888
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:44.110
<v Speaker 4>colitis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is and what,</v>

1889
01:33:44.111 --> 01:33:45.510
<v Speaker 4>what is that exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1890
01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.433
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to claim to be a medical </v>

1891
01:33:47.301 --> 01:33:48.134
<v Speaker 4>expert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of the most frustrating </v>

1892
01:33:49.401 --> 01:33:50.234
<v Speaker 4>things that George has had to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 4>where there are certain parts of the </v>

1893
01:33:53.181 --> 01:33:55.640
<v Speaker 4>human body to just out of your control </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the stomach is one of them.</v>

1894
01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:58.070
<v Speaker 4>Just things happening in your stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't control it.</v>

1895
01:33:58.071 --> 01:33:59.990
<v Speaker 4>Things like stress seem to make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>

1896
01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1897
01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the truth is that no one really knows at</v>

1898
01:34:04.521 --> 01:34:05.600
<v Speaker 4>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1899
01:34:05.601 --> 01:34:07.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever this doubt,</v>

1900
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:08.083
<v Speaker 4>my</v>

1901
01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.620
<v Speaker 2>instinct is to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1902
01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:12.180
<v Speaker 2>you really want to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George,</v>

1903
01:34:12.181 --> 01:34:15.930
<v Speaker 2>you've done all this and what a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to cap off a career too.</v>

1904
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:17.570
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in person.</v>

1905
01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he came back,</v>

1906
01:34:19.681 --> 01:34:21.660
<v Speaker 2>this is what was really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that fight.</v>

1907
01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:24.090
<v Speaker 2>George had said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm better,</v>

1908
01:34:24.091 --> 01:34:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm a better martial artists than I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

1909
01:34:27.090 --> 01:34:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And he looked better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1910
01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:32.400
<v Speaker 2>he definitely looked like he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little out of competition.</v>

1911
01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:33.503
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a moment he should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many fighters do you know came back </v>

1912
01:34:36.571 --> 01:34:38.490
<v Speaker 2>up to a four year layoff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few.</v>

1913
01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:39.953
<v Speaker 2>But skill wise he looked phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean his striking looked incredibly </v>

1914
01:34:44.641 --> 01:34:49.641
<v Speaker 2>smooth and I think you could see it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>bisping's face like pretty early on.</v>

1915
01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:51.173
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a rusty George Saint Pierre </v>

1916
01:34:53.530 --> 01:34:56.220
<v Speaker 2>is not a small welterweight who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1917
01:34:56.221 --> 01:34:58.460
<v Speaker 2>making his way in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he looked huge.</v>

1918
01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.410
<v Speaker 3>He looked phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

1919
01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:04.460
<v Speaker 3>his technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he was landing leg kicks and his</v>

1920
01:35:04.461 --> 01:35:05.294
<v Speaker 3>Sharp Jab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then ultimately that left hand that </v>

1921
01:35:07.461 --> 01:35:09.410
<v Speaker 3>he used to stun bisbing and get him on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>

1922
01:35:09.411 --> 01:35:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks sensational.</v>

1923
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:11.600
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1924
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1925
01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.653
<v Speaker 4>you were there the night George went </v>
<v Speaker 4>into his first retirement and you'll </v>

1926
01:35:16.701 --> 01:35:19.340
<v Speaker 4>recall the whole retirement thing was </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>

1927
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:20.840
<v Speaker 4>the speech was vague.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't,</v>

1928
01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.730
<v Speaker 4>it was confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because he did,</v>

1929
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:25.610
<v Speaker 4>in truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't know if he wanted to retire.</v>

1930
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:26.833
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing was actually contrived </v>

1931
01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:31.940
<v Speaker 4>in the octagon right there in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1932
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:33.770
<v Speaker 4>I would be in a hard fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1933
01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:35.760
<v Speaker 4>training camp hadn't been the best camp </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1934
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:37.360
<v Speaker 4>The fight for Hendricks was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1935
01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:39.350
<v Speaker 4>George was unclear if he wanted to fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all.</v>

1936
01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:40.184
<v Speaker 4>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all kinds of controversies </v>

1937
01:35:40.881 --> 01:35:42.610
<v Speaker 4>involved in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1938
01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:44.090
<v Speaker 4>then when the fight was over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1939
01:35:44.091 --> 01:35:46.400
<v Speaker 4>it was a very close fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1940
01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:48.820
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1941
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:52.370
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't sure what he wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some language miscommunication</v>

1942
01:35:53.210 --> 01:35:54.043
<v Speaker 4>and ultimately he essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he walked away from the game and he </v>

1943
01:35:57.081 --> 01:35:58.220
<v Speaker 4>walked away for four years.</v>

1944
01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:01.550
<v Speaker 4>That's a long time to be out of a sport </v>
<v Speaker 4>that as young as him or main,</v>

1945
01:36:01.551 --> 01:36:03.230
<v Speaker 4>which is evolving all the time every </v>
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>

1946
01:36:03.231 --> 01:36:04.490
<v Speaker 4>the sport changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1947
01:36:04.650 --> 01:36:07.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the belts tend to change hands very,</v>

1948
01:36:07.041 --> 01:36:08.840
<v Speaker 4>very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1949
01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:13.520
<v Speaker 4>so when George started talking to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the idea of,</v>

1950
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to come back,</v>

1951
01:36:14.811 --> 01:36:17.240
<v Speaker 4>I think I've still got conveyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to come back.</v>

1952
01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.460
<v Speaker 4>This a desire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>passion.</v>

1953
01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:23.810
<v Speaker 4>My point to him was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first off you show you really want to do</v>

1954
01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:24.260
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1955
01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.870
<v Speaker 4>you know the last two fight camps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's tough.</v>

1956
01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:29.360
<v Speaker 4>You didn't seem to have the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>drives.</v>

1957
01:36:29.361 --> 01:36:30.920
<v Speaker 4>He used to have you show you want to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1958
01:36:30.921 --> 01:36:31.754
<v Speaker 4>Is this like a middle aged fantasy he </v>
<v Speaker 4>going through here and he said none of </v>

1959
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:36.050
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel this,</v>

1960
01:36:36.051 --> 01:36:36.884
<v Speaker 4>I want to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my question to him was if you're </v>

1961
01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:43.790
<v Speaker 4>going to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just going to do the same thing.</v>

1962
01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:46.850
<v Speaker 4>You just going to come back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>welterweight and do what you always did,</v>

1963
01:36:46.851 --> 01:36:51.020
<v Speaker 4>which has come out and beat the base </v>
<v Speaker 4>well to weights and just hold a title.</v>

1964
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:53.000
<v Speaker 4>It's used to going to be doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1965
01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:57.980
<v Speaker 4>I thought if he gonna come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do something significant.</v>

1966
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.903
<v Speaker 4>Something you haven't done before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the way I put it to him was what </v>

1967
01:37:03.021 --> 01:37:03.854
<v Speaker 4>are the three most persistent criticisms</v>
<v Speaker 4>you always hear about George Saint </v>

1968
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Pierre?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number one,</v>

1969
01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:11.750
<v Speaker 4>you never fought up a weight class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never went up.</v>

1970
01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:14.420
<v Speaker 4>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fought.</v>

1971
01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:15.313
<v Speaker 4>So tactically sound was such an emphasis</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a strategy and techniques or what </v>

1972
01:37:21.531 --> 01:37:24.590
<v Speaker 4>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That matches could become dull.</v>

1973
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:27.380
<v Speaker 4>That the average fan was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1974
01:37:27.381 --> 01:37:27.871
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1975
01:37:27.871 --> 01:37:29.420
<v Speaker 4>he's winning easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dominant,</v>

1976
01:37:29.421 --> 01:37:31.340
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't do it for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not excited.</v>

1977
01:37:31.341 --> 01:37:34.520
<v Speaker 4>No drama in the funds on gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1978
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:37.130
<v Speaker 4>so he had this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1979
01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:39.530
<v Speaker 4>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1980
01:37:39.850 --> 01:37:40.683
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was very technically sound </v>

1981
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:42.224
<v Speaker 4>strategically deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fights weren't as exciting as </v>

1982
01:37:45.711 --> 01:37:46.544
<v Speaker 4>they ought to be.</v>

1983
01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:49.700
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that he'd never gone up,</v>

1984
01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:50.553
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a weight category and the third most </v>

1985
01:37:51.801 --> 01:37:53.690
<v Speaker 4>persistent Chris and we didn't finish </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>

1986
01:37:54.590 --> 01:37:55.131
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He at,</v>

1987
01:37:55.131 --> 01:37:57.630
<v Speaker 4>he was a very skilled fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't finishing fights.</v>

1988
01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:00.150
<v Speaker 4>So my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1989
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.013
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do it in a way where you address </v>

1990
01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.060
<v Speaker 4>those three things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1991
01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:10.070
<v Speaker 4>George is always concerned about his </v>
<v Speaker 4>legacy as a fighter.</v>

1992
01:38:10.071 --> 01:38:12.840
<v Speaker 4>And if there were three persistent </v>
<v Speaker 4>criticisms of George NPS legacy,</v>

1993
01:38:12.841 --> 01:38:14.790
<v Speaker 4>it was those three things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not finishing fights.</v>

1994
01:38:14.791 --> 01:38:17.130
<v Speaker 4>You never went up a weight class and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're too tactical.</v>

1995
01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:18.653
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not providing the drama that a </v>

1996
01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:22.620
<v Speaker 4>fight should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I said,</v>

1997
01:38:22.621 --> 01:38:27.621
<v Speaker 4>let's change things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got in that four years.</v>

1998
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.640
<v Speaker 4>Previous to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever I was training George,</v>

1999
01:38:29.641 --> 01:38:32.370
<v Speaker 4>I was training him for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was not with fire fighting.</v>

2000
01:38:32.371 --> 01:38:33.960
<v Speaker 4>Nick Diaz is finding cars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>condos,</v>

2001
01:38:33.961 --> 01:38:34.530
<v Speaker 4>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2002
01:38:34.530 --> 01:38:35.363
<v Speaker 4>whoever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was always getting him ready for </v>

2003
01:38:36.601 --> 01:38:38.340
<v Speaker 4>a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Find Matt Hughes in two months,</v>

2004
01:38:38.341 --> 01:38:39.174
<v Speaker 4>let's get ready now you're a tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to train you to find some </v>

2005
01:38:43.561 --> 01:38:48.561
<v Speaker 4>dude going to train you in Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Freddie Roach.</v>

2006
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.160
<v Speaker 4>It's going to train you in boxing</v>

2007
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:55.363
<v Speaker 4>in this sense we could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we hit the time now to start working on </v>

2008
01:38:59.031 --> 01:38:59.864
<v Speaker 4>finishing skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A significant change occurred where my </v>

2009
01:39:03.381 --> 01:39:04.214
<v Speaker 4>primary emphasis in training George in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that four year layoff was in </v>

2010
01:39:07.671 --> 01:39:10.940
<v Speaker 4>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now happily that happened at what time?</v>

2011
01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:13.100
<v Speaker 4>The time the school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was coming out.</v>

2012
01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:14.653
<v Speaker 4>So I had a group of some of the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>submission peoples in the world for </v>

2013
01:39:17.631 --> 01:39:18.464
<v Speaker 4>George to work with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was submission started getting </v>

2014
01:39:20.151 --> 01:39:21.860
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suddenly George Saint Pierre,</v>

2015
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:25.460
<v Speaker 4>he got on your back is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's submitting people in the gym.</v>

2016
01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:29.270
<v Speaker 4>I could run off some names.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't do it because it's not the thing</v>

2017
01:39:29.271 --> 01:39:30.104
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I could run off some names of </v>

2018
01:39:30.651 --> 01:39:32.450
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He submitted an agenda would shock you,</v>

2019
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:33.703
<v Speaker 4>like well known Judah to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for the first time he's our primary </v>

2020
01:39:37.161 --> 01:39:39.500
<v Speaker 4>versus wasn't on grapple walks in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was submission.</v>

2021
01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:44.810
<v Speaker 4>Freddie Roach was working on what was on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mechanics of punching.</v>

2022
01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:48.320
<v Speaker 4>George always had good in out movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was head like that karate movement.</v>

2023
01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:49.790
<v Speaker 4>The um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability,</v>

2024
01:39:49.791 --> 01:39:53.090
<v Speaker 4>he always had a strong jab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now he's teaching them how to sit on</v>

2025
01:39:53.091 --> 01:39:54.890
<v Speaker 4>a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>70 George had a left hook.</v>

2026
01:39:57.150 --> 01:39:59.220
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're a guy who can integrate left,</v>

2027
01:39:59.610 --> 01:40:00.443
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left hand chip between jab and lift or </v>

2028
01:40:01.941 --> 01:40:05.020
<v Speaker 4>gets a dangerous man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2029
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:06.420
<v Speaker 4>everyone was worried,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2030
01:40:06.421 --> 01:40:09.390
<v Speaker 4>there's so much overreaction to George's</v>
<v Speaker 4>jab is suddenly left talk.</v>

2031
01:40:09.391 --> 01:40:12.060
<v Speaker 4>Opportunities are opening up and now he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was sitting on that left hook and people</v>

2032
01:40:12.061 --> 01:40:12.894
<v Speaker 4>getting hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now for the first time you got a guy </v>

2033
01:40:15.151 --> 01:40:18.360
<v Speaker 4>who's got submissions and he's hitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>with genuine power.</v>

2034
01:40:23.170 --> 01:40:24.003
<v Speaker 4>As he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a question of who's going to be </v>

2035
01:40:26.861 --> 01:40:31.010
<v Speaker 4>the opponent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the next thing I say it is,</v>

2036
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:32.240
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2037
01:40:32.241 --> 01:40:36.990
<v Speaker 4>went up a weight division,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go up to 85 now.</v>

2038
01:40:36.991 --> 01:40:37.430
<v Speaker 4>Now</v>

2039
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:41.810
<v Speaker 2>was any consideration about going up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>85 because the fact that bisping was the</v>

2040
01:40:41.811 --> 01:40:42.790
<v Speaker 2>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2041
01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:43.633
<v Speaker 2>George has trained with business and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision was made before piston was the </v>

2042
01:40:46.311 --> 01:40:47.300
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real?</v>

2043
01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How far in advance was the decision </v>

2044
01:40:50.091 --> 01:40:50.924
<v Speaker 2>made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because bisbing had defended against </v>

2045
01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Henderson won against four</v>

2046
01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:56.300
<v Speaker 4>year project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2047
01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.153
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know initially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Initially I couldn't make that decision </v>

2048
01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:00.874
<v Speaker 4>because then another student of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Weidman was the one 85 pound </v>

2049
01:41:02.921 --> 01:41:05.320
<v Speaker 4>champion and Chris and Georgia never </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight each other.</v>

2050
01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:08.560
<v Speaker 4>But once that was no longer an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it was like,</v>

2051
01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:09.160
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2052
01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.590
<v Speaker 4>this could work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This could be interesting.</v>

2053
01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:15.800
<v Speaker 4>So d during the entire four years he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about eventually becoming,</v>

2054
01:41:15.801 --> 01:41:17.450
<v Speaker 4>not the entire four years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2055
01:41:17.490 --> 01:41:20.230
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was training the whole time and I</v>

2056
01:41:20.231 --> 01:41:22.260
<v Speaker 4>was pushing him a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't fight anymore.</v>

2057
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Let's do some submission grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2058
01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:24.940
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2059
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:28.540
<v Speaker 4>he stuck with Freddie Roach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She loves working with Freddie Roach.</v>

2060
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:29.433
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2061
01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:32.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the training was,</v>

2062
01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:35.050
<v Speaker 4>was going in different directions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was this Moitai coach.</v>

2063
01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:38.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mostly he works at Ferrazzi Hobby and,</v>

2064
01:41:38.570 --> 01:41:42.340
<v Speaker 4>and tries to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's more a integrated for us as a</v>

2065
01:41:42.341 --> 01:41:43.000
<v Speaker 4>black belt of mine.</v>

2066
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.320
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2067
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:45.580
<v Speaker 4>often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2068
01:41:45.630 --> 01:41:48.840
<v Speaker 4>does Jujitsu with fluoroscopy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had I teach for us in frost,</v>

2069
01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:51.220
<v Speaker 4>that does a good job there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2070
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:52.550
<v Speaker 4>but for us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2071
01:41:52.630 --> 01:41:53.463
<v Speaker 4>ties things together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's his principal function and I know </v>

2072
01:41:55.361 --> 01:41:56.194
<v Speaker 4>he trained with Phil nurse for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he trained with a lot of guys who </v>

2073
01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:01.310
<v Speaker 4>came out of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2074
01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:04.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thailand itself from Tiger Moy,</v>

2075
01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:05.800
<v Speaker 4>Tai,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2076
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:07.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yard.</v>

2077
01:42:08.170 --> 01:42:11.170
<v Speaker 4>That's a shortening of his actual name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will have very long names,</v>

2078
01:42:11.171 --> 01:42:12.004
<v Speaker 4>but a yard was one of his trainers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They trained him prior to condit and </v>

2079
01:42:15.401 --> 01:42:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2080
01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:18.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did a fine job.</v>

2081
01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:22.570
<v Speaker 4>So there's never been a shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 4>coaches in his life,</v>

2082
01:42:22.571 --> 01:42:23.830
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2083
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:26.530
<v Speaker 4>there were certain things that seem to </v>
<v Speaker 4>gel with them more than others.</v>

2084
01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:29.050
<v Speaker 4>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during that four year period,</v>

2085
01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:30.333
<v Speaker 4>George had a strong rebirth into karate </v>
<v Speaker 4>and worked with a lot of specialized </v>

2086
01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:36.880
<v Speaker 4>created people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including Raymond Daniels and others.</v>

2087
01:42:37.230 --> 01:42:38.380
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they came from the,</v>

2088
01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:42.340
<v Speaker 4>mostly from the European point fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>karate a circuit and he was working with</v>

2089
01:42:42.341 --> 01:42:46.650
<v Speaker 4>them a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so somewhere or eh,</v>

2090
01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:47.753
<v Speaker 4>the cross has certain poor a period of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time where you're dealing with a </v>

2091
01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:53.620
<v Speaker 4>different athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now this is the guy who's had four years</v>

2092
01:42:53.621 --> 01:42:55.840
<v Speaker 4>off and the train had gone in different </v>
<v Speaker 4>directions.</v>

2093
01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:57.333
<v Speaker 4>It's finishing skills in both fisticuffs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and grappling had gotten considerably </v>

2094
01:43:01.781 --> 01:43:03.590
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2095
01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:04.653
<v Speaker 4>he was toying with the idea of going up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to 85 and experimented with diet and et </v>

2096
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:12.310
<v Speaker 4>Cetera to get his body weight up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's never an easy thing to do.</v>

2097
01:43:13.450 --> 01:43:14.283
<v Speaker 4>And tactically he was working more on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea of being an exciting fighter </v>

2098
01:43:18.581 --> 01:43:22.090
<v Speaker 4>through movement and pushing harder for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the finish.</v>

2099
01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:23.620
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2100
01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.490
<v Speaker 4>and I thought those were three very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very healthy directions to go and,</v>

2101
01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.010
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2102
01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:31.600
<v Speaker 4>this would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as it were,</v>

2103
01:43:31.601 --> 01:43:32.434
<v Speaker 4>if he did come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this would be offer a genuine </v>

2104
01:43:33.611 --> 01:43:37.930
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to address the three most </v>
<v Speaker 4>persistent criticism of his career.</v>

2105
01:43:38.710 --> 01:43:39.543
<v Speaker 4>Initially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of resistance from the </v>

2106
01:43:40.451 --> 01:43:42.100
<v Speaker 4>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they were fond of the idea</v>

2107
01:43:42.101 --> 01:43:43.810
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted him to go to one 70 and,</v>

2108
01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:46.210
<v Speaker 4>and do what he had done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2109
01:43:46.211 --> 01:43:49.270
<v Speaker 4>but George pushed hard for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2110
01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:53.420
<v Speaker 4>for the fight at 85 and ultimately it </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in a rather strange way.</v>

2111
01:43:53.421 --> 01:43:57.470
<v Speaker 4>Tyrone Woodley had a fight at one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2112
01:43:57.471 --> 01:44:02.471
<v Speaker 4>Shum uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't the most crowd pleasing fight and</v>

2113
01:44:03.081 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2114
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:08.110
<v Speaker 4>George St Pierre was supposed to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>tyrone woodley and in UFC,</v>

2115
01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:10.460
<v Speaker 4>you know what fibers mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's on.</v>

2116
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:13.250
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we chose the Madison Square Garden.</v>

2117
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:15.740
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the great fight capitols </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the world.</v>

2118
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:16.663
<v Speaker 4>And it's how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was consideration in fighting </v>

2119
01:44:19.161 --> 01:44:20.270
<v Speaker 4>one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2120
01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:25.170
<v Speaker 4>And so this was the ufc his idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what about your python for I,</v>

2121
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:27.690
<v Speaker 4>I thought first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2122
01:44:27.691 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not the matchmaker.</v>

2123
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:32.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm not the main policy making under,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say that I was the guy,</v>

2124
01:44:33.170 --> 01:44:34.910
<v Speaker 4>I was the guy that suggested those </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

2125
01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:37.430
<v Speaker 4>And George seems to like the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

2126
01:44:37.431 --> 01:44:38.264
<v Speaker 4>if I'm going to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we're going to take the risk of a </v>

2127
01:44:39.411 --> 01:44:41.300
<v Speaker 4>four year layoff and come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big risk,</v>

2128
01:44:41.301 --> 01:44:41.900
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2129
01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:43.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Muhammad Ali came back after three years</v>

2130
01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:46.850
<v Speaker 4>and had to warm up fights and still lost</v>
<v Speaker 4>his title phone.</v>

2131
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:49.820
<v Speaker 4>But Muhammad Ali wehrly wasn't working </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

2132
01:44:50.230 --> 01:44:52.790
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was when the Vietnam war thing,</v>

2133
01:44:52.791 --> 01:44:55.180
<v Speaker 4>it happens mostly doing tours of college</v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

2134
01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:58.070
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't really working out the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and improving.</v>

2135
01:44:58.170 --> 01:44:59.780
<v Speaker 4>You can see the difference in Muhammad </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ali,</v>

2136
01:44:59.781 --> 01:45:01.370
<v Speaker 4>his body when he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still,</v>

2137
01:45:01.371 --> 01:45:02.204
<v Speaker 4>there's many other examples that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar ray Leonard came back after </v>

2138
01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:04.844
<v Speaker 4>layoffs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had one successful and one very </v>

2139
01:45:05.901 --> 01:45:08.510
<v Speaker 4>unsuccessful come back and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>working hard the whole time.</v>

2140
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:10.820
<v Speaker 4>So coming back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it's a hard,</v>

2141
01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:12.253
<v Speaker 4>tricky thing on many levels too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not just physical but also </v>

2142
01:45:14.370 --> 01:45:15.203
<v Speaker 4>psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now this collitus thing is thrown a </v>

2143
01:45:17.181 --> 01:45:18.014
<v Speaker 4>monkey wrench into the gears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If actually it threw a monkey wrench </v>

2144
01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:21.740
<v Speaker 4>during the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2145
01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.900
<v Speaker 4>I could tell you some stories about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2146
01:45:23.901 --> 01:45:26.270
<v Speaker 4>That camp was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

2147
01:45:26.271 --> 01:45:29.600
<v Speaker 4>as good as the four years was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The camp itself,</v>

2148
01:45:29.601 --> 01:45:31.160
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can say it now because it's over,</v>

2149
01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:34.070
<v Speaker 4>was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was probably the worst camp I've ever</v>

2150
01:45:34.071 --> 01:45:35.240
<v Speaker 4>been involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A really,</v>

2151
01:45:35.630 --> 01:45:38.390
<v Speaker 4>I was coaching of course the scored for </v>
<v Speaker 4>ADCC.</v>

2152
01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:39.950
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2153
01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:43.940
<v Speaker 4>adcc I believe was around six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2154
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:44.803
<v Speaker 4>before George is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was in Finland and communicating </v>

2155
01:45:49.041 --> 01:45:50.960
<v Speaker 4>with George and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling good.</v>

2156
01:45:50.961 --> 01:45:51.794
<v Speaker 4>Let's get the moment I get back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to get on a plane from </v>

2157
01:45:53.631 --> 01:45:56.030
<v Speaker 4>Finland to Montreal and start the camp.</v>

2158
01:45:58.040 --> 01:45:59.080
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>George sent me out.</v>

2159
01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:03.920
<v Speaker 4>I've got stomach issues and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean stomach issues?</v>

2160
01:46:03.921 --> 01:46:06.620
<v Speaker 4>What does that even mean now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2161
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:09.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about two weeks into the camp,</v>

2162
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:14.390
<v Speaker 4>the issues got so bad that George </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally could not,</v>

2163
01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:16.970
<v Speaker 4>now this is a six week fight camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very short camp.</v>

2164
01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Back in the day we used to do eight to </v>
<v Speaker 4>12 weeks,</v>

2165
01:46:19.190 --> 01:46:20.960
<v Speaker 4>but George thought a shorter camp would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be better.</v>

2166
01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:22.100
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as he's getting older,</v>

2167
01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:25.510
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to short at camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First two weeks were okayed,</v>

2168
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:28.110
<v Speaker 4>but I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2169
01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.170
<v Speaker 4>the aftermath of the Finland expedition </v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

2170
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:33.770
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I first went up,</v>

2171
01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.540
<v Speaker 4>George said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to cancel.</v>

2172
01:46:36.170 --> 01:46:37.003
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2173
01:46:37.670 --> 01:46:41.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't train my fights four weeks away.</v>

2174
01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:44.203
<v Speaker 4>And George took two weeks off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a critical moment on a Friday </v>

2175
01:46:48.141 --> 01:46:50.790
<v Speaker 4>evening where I say it to for Rasa </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hobby,</v>

2176
01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:53.190
<v Speaker 4>this is the second time I've had to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>this to for our salary.</v>

2177
01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:57.690
<v Speaker 4>The other was the Carlos condit camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say George isn't training by Monday we</v>

2178
01:46:57.691 --> 01:46:59.850
<v Speaker 4>can to pull the plug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no other way.</v>

2179
01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 4>And we were talking about a four year </v>
<v Speaker 4>layoff and this camp is lost.</v>

2180
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:06.383
<v Speaker 4>It's dead in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So four weeks out he takes two weeks </v>

2181
01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:09.640
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2182
01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:12.540
<v Speaker 4>I believe it might've been five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll check the dates later,</v>

2183
01:47:12.541 --> 01:47:13.374
<v Speaker 4>but I'm very close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a critical two week period </v>

2184
01:47:16.471 --> 01:47:18.420
<v Speaker 4>where during that two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is he able to do?</v>

2185
01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:20.370
<v Speaker 4>Essentially?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

2186
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:21.263
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2187
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:24.060
<v Speaker 4>Just no train light drilling some </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>

2188
01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:25.060
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2189
01:47:25.061 --> 01:47:26.300
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2190
01:47:26.620 --> 01:47:28.710
<v Speaker 4>it occurred the worst possible time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

2191
01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:29.573
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't at the start of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was in the middle of the camp so that </v>

2192
01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:35.070
<v Speaker 4>the first two weeks were lost because </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

2193
01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:36.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had two weeks of inactivity.</v>

2194
01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:41.850
<v Speaker 4>Then there's two weeks left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember the first time I went up,</v>

2195
01:47:41.851 --> 01:47:44.400
<v Speaker 4>I bought Jake Shields,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gary Turner and Gordon Ryan with me.</v>

2196
01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:48.360
<v Speaker 4>And we came up and we went through some </v>
<v Speaker 4>drills on the ground and I was happy,</v>

2197
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:49.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joseph Del k on the ground.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2199
01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:53.273
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2200
01:47:54.481 --> 01:47:56.910
<v Speaker 4>stuff and then the next day he went to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do a shoot box workout.</v>

2201

2216
01:48:39.841 --> 01:48:43.320

<v Speaker 4>year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Madison Square Garden.</v>

2226
01:49:05.461 --> 01:49:06.294
<v Speaker 4>He's the headline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The USC had to pull some big things to </v>

01:49:10.531 --> 01:49:12.900
<v Speaker 4>get this fight to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't originally didn't want it.</v>

2228
01:49:12.901 --> 01:49:15.090
<v Speaker 4>If we pull out now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to look like a disaster.</v>

2229
01:49:15.091 --> 01:49:17.220
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be George let the UFC </v>

<v Speaker 4>and to his everlasting credit,</v>

2231
01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:22.973
<v Speaker 4>George said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be back on Monday and I'll be </v>

2232
01:49:25.441 --> 01:49:27.120
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went up and,</v>

2233
01:49:28.050 --> 01:49:29.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2234
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:31.050
<v Speaker 4>he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he dug in deep.</v>

2235
01:49:31.051 --> 01:49:33.240
<v Speaker 4>What can I tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a trooper.</v>

2236
01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:34.193
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2237
01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:35.123
<v Speaker 4>he trained every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those last two weeks and as each day </v>

2238
01:49:39.151 --> 01:49:40.890
<v Speaker 4>went by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was significant improvement.</v>

2239
01:49:40.891 --> 01:49:42.630
<v Speaker 4>And I remember there was a distinct </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>

2240
01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:44.340
<v Speaker 4>about five days before the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>camp,</v>

2241
01:49:44.341 --> 01:49:45.870
<v Speaker 4>I swung to a shoot box,</v>
<v Speaker 4>work out,</v>

2242
01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:48.250
<v Speaker 4>and he looked like the old George and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

2243
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:50.230
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in this care again.</v>

2244
01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:51.300
<v Speaker 4>You can do it.</v>

2245
01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you please google?</v>

2246
01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Collitus I don't know enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe he should.</v>

2247
01:49:56.791 --> 01:49:59.430
<v Speaker 2>What the goals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ulcerative colitis.</v>

2248
01:50:01.290 --> 01:50:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2249
01:50:02.641 --> 01:50:03.474
<v Speaker 2>It's so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something to do with stomach </v>

2250
01:50:04.531 --> 01:50:05.970
<v Speaker 2>ulcers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2251
01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:08.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to claim to be an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2252
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:10.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you what the symptoms were.</v>

2253
01:50:10.261 --> 01:50:13.110
<v Speaker 2>I was extreme stomach pain and inability</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat at,</v>

2254
01:50:13.111 --> 01:50:15.330
<v Speaker 2>screwed up his entire diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when did it start?</v>

2255
01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.433
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an early in the camp and got </v>

2256
01:50:17.461 --> 01:50:19.770
<v Speaker 2>progressively worse and then hit for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

2257
01:50:19.771 --> 01:50:21.180
<v Speaker 2>There was no issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2258
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:24.750
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sort of colitis is usually only,</v>

2259
01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:25.673
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in innermost lining of the large </v>

2260
01:50:27.241 --> 01:50:28.074
<v Speaker 2>intestine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>colon and rectum forms range from mild </v>

2261
01:50:30.151 --> 01:50:30.984
<v Speaker 2>to severe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having all sort of colitis puts a </v>

2262
01:50:32.581 --> 01:50:33.414
<v Speaker 2>patient at increased risk of developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>colon cancer symptoms including rectal </v>

2263
01:50:36.811 --> 01:50:38.190
<v Speaker 2>bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloody diarrhea,</v>

2264
01:50:38.191 --> 01:50:41.010
<v Speaker 2>abdominal cramps and pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it sounds like a party.</v>

2265
01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you read the,</v>

2266
01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.350
<v Speaker 2>can you bring it back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read the first four treatment,</v>

2267
01:50:46.351 --> 01:50:48.810
<v Speaker 2>can help with this condition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot be cured,</v>

2268
01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.960
<v Speaker 2>requires a medical diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lab tests or imaging.</v>

2269
01:50:51.961 --> 01:50:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Always required chronic can last for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years or be lifelong.</v>

2270
01:50:57.120 --> 01:50:59.220
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly frustrating for him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with.</v>

2271
01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:02.220
<v Speaker 2>And it says treatments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including medications and surgery.</v>

2272
01:51:02.650 --> 01:51:06.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's a forgery,</v>

2273
01:51:06.970 --> 01:51:07.900
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2274
01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:10.960
<v Speaker 4>it appeared to back off a little bit in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the last two weeks.</v>

2275
01:51:10.961 --> 01:51:12.600
<v Speaker 4>He came back and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2276
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:15.700
<v Speaker 4>this is the kind of person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>George Saint Pierre.</v>

2277
01:51:15.701 --> 01:51:16.534
<v Speaker 4>It's the morning of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturday morning we're in New York City </v>

2278
01:51:19.961 --> 01:51:22.210
<v Speaker 4>in the hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2279
01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:23.141
<v Speaker 4>for us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2280
01:51:23.141 --> 01:51:24.580
<v Speaker 4>hobbies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Freddie Roach and myself,</v>

2281
01:51:24.610 --> 01:51:27.760
<v Speaker 4>or at the breakfast table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>George comes down for breakfast and he's</v>

2282
01:51:27.761 --> 01:51:28.594
<v Speaker 4>weighed in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he looks at his breakfast is originally </v>

2283
01:51:35.561 --> 01:51:39.760
<v Speaker 4>the plan because it was a fight at one </v>
<v Speaker 4>85 was to have george come in at a,</v>

2284
01:51:39.761 --> 01:51:44.761
<v Speaker 4>at a higher body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he ended up weighing 191 pounds,</v>

2285
01:51:45.191 --> 01:51:48.010
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly the same as he used to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight at welterweight,</v>

2286
01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:51.340
<v Speaker 4>the same body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was kind of a disappointment,</v>

2287
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:52.900
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2288
01:51:53.710 --> 01:51:54.543
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he quietly excuse himself and went to </v>

2289
01:51:57.551 --> 01:51:58.384
<v Speaker 4>the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone else went away to do their </v>

2290
01:51:59.921 --> 01:52:00.250
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2291
01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:04.150
<v Speaker 4>And I sat there and I realized he's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bathroom for an hour.</v>

2292
01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.900
<v Speaker 4>He came out and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>George,</v>

2293
01:52:06.901 --> 01:52:08.470
<v Speaker 4>you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he looked at me,</v>

2294
01:52:08.471 --> 01:52:09.304
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine,</v>

2295
01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:12.910
<v Speaker 4>but I knew he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he went out,</v>

2296
01:52:12.930 --> 01:52:14.560
<v Speaker 4>fought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2297
01:52:15.070 --> 01:52:15.903
<v Speaker 4>and then afterwards he told me I was in </v>
<v Speaker 4>so much pain and he was afraid to tell </v>

2298
01:52:19.811 --> 01:52:20.644
<v Speaker 4>me because he would worry that if I </v>
<v Speaker 4>cornered him and I thought he was </v>

2299
01:52:23.321 --> 01:52:24.154
<v Speaker 4>compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't call him the way I normally </v>

2300
01:52:25.421 --> 01:52:27.400
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I would doubt him.</v>

2301
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:29.890
<v Speaker 4>So he kept it all inside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't say a word.</v>

2302
01:52:30.730 --> 01:52:32.290
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a good kid.</v>

2303
01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:34.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't help but to it like that.</v>

2304
01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what makes them a champion.</v>

2305
01:52:37.731 --> 01:52:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things,</v>

2306
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:41.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's less than perfect conditions.</v>

2307
01:52:41.571 --> 01:52:43.910
<v Speaker 2>He could still rise to the occasion less</v>
<v Speaker 2>than perfect.</v>

2308
01:52:43.911 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 2>It was a very far from perfect.</v>

2309
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Now you said that during the Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hendricks fight during the camp for that</v>

2310
01:52:50.271 --> 01:52:51.104
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he decided to impromptu retire </v>

2311
01:52:54.261 --> 01:52:58.580
<v Speaker 3>inside the octagon yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there was talk during the camp that</v>

2312
01:52:58.581 --> 01:52:59.710
<v Speaker 3>he didn't want to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.793
<v Speaker 3>What was that about?</v>

2314
01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:02.980
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really centered around two things.</v>

2315
01:53:02.981 --> 01:53:03.840
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can just,</v>

2316
01:53:03.970 --> 01:53:08.260
<v Speaker 4>I can not discuss because it involves a </v>
<v Speaker 4>personal life.</v>

2317
01:53:08.261 --> 01:53:09.094
<v Speaker 4>Joe Saint Pa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some things going on in his </v>

2318
01:53:10.031 --> 01:53:12.440
<v Speaker 4>personal life that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2319
01:53:12.970 --> 01:53:13.803
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply affected him and he was deeply </v>

2320
01:53:16.871 --> 01:53:19.890
<v Speaker 4>unhappy with some circumstances in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>personal life and I'm,</v>

2321
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:21.670
<v Speaker 4>it's not appropriate for me to talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about those.</v>

2322
01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:23.113
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the second was the whole idea that </v>

2323
01:53:25.541 --> 01:53:27.910
<v Speaker 4>it become an obsession with George at </v>
<v Speaker 4>that time,</v>

2324
01:53:27.911 --> 01:53:31.570
<v Speaker 4>which is the use of anabolic steroids in</v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed martial arts.</v>

2325
01:53:32.230 --> 01:53:33.063
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was deeply unhappy with what he </v>

2326
01:53:36.791 --> 01:53:37.624
<v Speaker 4>perceived as the prevalence of the use </v>
<v Speaker 4>of anabolic steroids in mixed martial </v>

2327
01:53:40.721 --> 01:53:44.470
<v Speaker 4>arts as a whole and among his opponents </v>
<v Speaker 4>in particular.</v>

2328
01:53:45.370 --> 01:53:47.380
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2329
01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:51.250
<v Speaker 4>he wanted a testing program to be bought</v>
<v Speaker 4>in for that fight.</v>

2330
01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.560
<v Speaker 4>There was talk about it but nothing came</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

2331
01:53:53.770 --> 01:53:54.603
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2332
01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:59.940
<v Speaker 4>it became like this psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>obsession during the camp and uh,</v>

2333
01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:03.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>between those two issues,</v>

2334
01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:05.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of unhappiness.</v>

2335
01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:07.450
<v Speaker 4>He came in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did a strain,</v>

2336
01:54:07.451 --> 01:54:07.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2337
01:54:07.831 --> 01:54:08.664
<v Speaker 4>he's a professional athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like he missed workouts or </v>

2338
01:54:09.821 --> 01:54:12.340
<v Speaker 4>anything crazy like there wasn't a going</v>
<v Speaker 4>out at night or anything foolish,</v>

2339
01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:13.713
<v Speaker 4>but there was a degree of unhappiness </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I'm looking and thinking how much </v>

2340
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:19.930
<v Speaker 4>longer in this go on</v>

2341
01:54:21.610 --> 01:54:22.443
<v Speaker 3>now there was some talk about the tyron </v>
<v Speaker 3>Woodley fight and then tyron had this </v>

2342
01:54:29.201 --> 01:54:30.034
<v Speaker 3>bad performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if George did get healthy and was </v>

2343
01:54:35.471 --> 01:54:39.130
<v Speaker 3>confident enough in his health that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>could get through,</v>

2344
01:54:39.131 --> 01:54:39.964
<v Speaker 3>get through an actual training camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would he be interested in considering a </v>

2345
01:54:42.701 --> 01:54:43.720
<v Speaker 3>fight with Tyron Woodley?</v>

2346
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:44.880
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Tyron,</v>

2347
01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:47.390
<v Speaker 4>what is a great champion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he gets a lot of steak,</v>

2348
01:54:47.391 --> 01:54:49.340
<v Speaker 4>a lot of flag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That kid is talented,</v>

2349
01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:50.650
<v Speaker 3>very talented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good,</v>

2350
01:54:50.890 --> 01:54:52.750
<v Speaker 3>and he doesn't think George wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight him.</v>

2351
01:54:52.751 --> 01:54:54.340
<v Speaker 3>He was on the podcast the other day.</v>

2352
01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:59.630
<v Speaker 4>People say that for reasons so that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>can motivate someone defined,</v>

2353
01:54:59.790 --> 01:55:00.623
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

2354
01:55:01.230 --> 01:55:02.063
<v Speaker 4>There's a political aspect to it and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that both athletes have a deep </v>

2355
01:55:03.791 --> 01:55:05.890
<v Speaker 4>respect for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2356
01:55:07.110 --> 01:55:09.010
<v Speaker 4>targeted wound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a very,</v>

2357
01:55:09.011 --> 01:55:13.330
<v Speaker 4>very difficult opponent to beat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people criticize his style,</v>

2358
01:55:13.331 --> 01:55:14.164
<v Speaker 4>but people don't understand difference </v>
<v Speaker 4>between regular fighting and </v>

2359
01:55:16.721 --> 01:55:17.554
<v Speaker 4>championship fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Championship fighting is about winning </v>

2360
01:55:19.031 --> 01:55:21.340
<v Speaker 4>and losing and you got to do what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>gotta do to win.</v>

2361
01:55:21.490 --> 01:55:24.700
<v Speaker 4>That's the first consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nice to impress the crowd.</v>

2362
01:55:24.701 --> 01:55:25.534
<v Speaker 4>It's nice to do this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately it's about what are you </v>

2363
01:55:27.881 --> 01:55:28.990
<v Speaker 4>going to do to win?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

2364
01:55:28.991 --> 01:55:31.030
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do to beat the </v>
<v Speaker 4>second best guy in the world?</v>

2365
01:55:31.031 --> 01:55:33.160
<v Speaker 4>That's a difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult thing.</v>

2366
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:34.303
<v Speaker 3>It has to be done correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea of fighting to entertain this </v>

2367
01:55:38.151 --> 01:55:41.040
<v Speaker 3>is a very complex thing and you talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it with,</v>

2368
01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:41.923
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George addressing that are attempted to </v>

2369
01:55:43.531 --> 01:55:44.364
<v Speaker 3>address that in his comeback and trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to finish and be more energetic and </v>

2370
01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:51.030
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is that's not always the</v>

2371
01:55:51.031 --> 01:55:54.510
<v Speaker 3>best way to engage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's is a right way to fight a person</v>

2372
01:55:54.511 --> 01:55:58.620
<v Speaker 3>with a particular skillset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And especially in the Woodley,</v>

2373
01:55:58.900 --> 01:55:59.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus,</v>

2374
01:55:59.911 --> 01:56:01.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Wonderboy Thompson fights.</v>

2375
01:56:01.561 --> 01:56:02.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2376
01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:04.950
<v Speaker 3>this is the only way to find that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot,</v>

2377
01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:07.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you are what he is,</v>

2378
01:56:07.650 --> 01:56:12.650
<v Speaker 3>which is a very skillful traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial artist that has this very unique</v>

2379
01:56:13.381 --> 01:56:14.214
<v Speaker 3>ability to bend at the waist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a snake and slide in with </v>

2380
01:56:16.681 --> 01:56:19.200
<v Speaker 3>techniques and it does a lot off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>front leg.</v>

2381
01:56:19.201 --> 01:56:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Dangerous stuff off the front leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you can do that too.</v>

2382
01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:24.810
<v Speaker 3>You really shouldn't be on the outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>striking with him.</v>

2383
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:25.703
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just too weird that styles too </v>

2384
01:56:26.881 --> 01:56:27.714
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he kind of had the lay back and if </v>

2385
01:56:30.091 --> 01:56:32.910
<v Speaker 3>you and I that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the results of the fight,</v>

2386
01:56:32.970 --> 01:56:36.000
<v Speaker 3>the times in the fight where someone was</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt,</v>

2387
01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:39.900
<v Speaker 3>it was tyron woodley putting the hurt on</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderboy Thompson.</v>

2388
01:56:39.901 --> 01:56:40.734
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the only times in the fight </v>

2389
01:56:41.791 --> 01:56:43.590
<v Speaker 3>where it was really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>

2390
01:56:43.591 --> 01:56:44.424
<v Speaker 3>it was sort of wonderboy kind of trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to pick out them from the outside and </v>

2391
01:56:47.881 --> 01:56:50.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very difficult fight to look good</v>

2392
01:56:50.221 --> 01:56:51.054
<v Speaker 3>at.</v>

2393
01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2394
01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:55.430
<v Speaker 4>the whole idea of mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 4>fans,</v>

2395
01:56:56.030 --> 01:57:00.110
<v Speaker 4>there's always three kinds of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that watch mixed martial arts.</v>

2396
01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:04.970
<v Speaker 4>There's fans of drama is fans of </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence and his fans of strategy.</v>

2397
01:57:04.971 --> 01:57:08.150
<v Speaker 4>And technique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys like us,</v>

2398
01:57:08.151 --> 01:57:11.380
<v Speaker 4>when we watch mma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we fall into the technique and strategy.</v>

2399
01:57:11.890 --> 01:57:14.900
<v Speaker 4>That's the guy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can watch Woodley flight one,</v>

2400
01:57:14.901 --> 01:57:16.080
<v Speaker 4>the boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm fascinated by that.</v>

2401
01:57:16.090 --> 01:57:17.060
<v Speaker 4>To me that's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

2402
01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:18.980
<v Speaker 4>I said magic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can watch it all day?</v>

2403
01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:23.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many of the fans want to see violence.</v>

2404
01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:26.750
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're tracking too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a significant portion.</v>

2405
01:57:27.250 --> 01:57:28.083
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>others like the idea of drama and </v>

2406
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:30.763
<v Speaker 4>athletes in a sense have to brand </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves according to one of those </v>

2407
01:57:33.561 --> 01:57:34.394
<v Speaker 4>three choices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>George always branded himself as the </v>

2408
01:57:36.711 --> 01:57:37.544
<v Speaker 4>technique and strategy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tyron Woodley struggling with that now </v>

2409
01:57:39.861 --> 01:57:41.210
<v Speaker 4>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's doing the same thing.</v>

2410
01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:42.573
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kale Sona and is the quintessential </v>

2411
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.870
<v Speaker 4>drama fighter.</v>

2412
01:57:44.930 --> 01:57:48.680
<v Speaker 4>He didn't really have an exciting </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting style and he was never really a</v>

2413
01:57:48.681 --> 01:57:51.320
<v Speaker 4>technique and strategy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he went with drama.</v>

2414
01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:54.050
<v Speaker 4>Some of he'd done vocally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2415
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:56.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get like a violence based.</v>

2416
01:57:56.301 --> 01:57:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Find someone who's a mop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How jaros that's his appeal.</v>

2417
01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:00.140
<v Speaker 4>You know the Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2418
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:01.820
<v Speaker 4>Rumble Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a violence.</v>

2419
01:58:01.821 --> 01:58:03.400
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not into drama,</v>

2420
01:58:03.401 --> 01:58:05.350
<v Speaker 4>is not going to talk anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not gonna.</v>

2421
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.903
<v Speaker 4>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one is stuck as strategy and t neat </v>

2422
01:58:08.331 --> 01:58:09.164
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to come out and do the same </v>

2423
01:58:09.501 --> 01:58:12.140
<v Speaker 4>thing every fight and it's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>violent finish.</v>

2424
01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so every fighter has to,</v>

2425
01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:16.610
<v Speaker 4>as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>identify what's his ear,</v>

2426
01:58:16.630 --> 01:58:17.463
<v Speaker 4>what's he gonna do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going to be his appeal and work </v>

2427
01:58:18.831 --> 01:58:20.780
<v Speaker 4>within that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2428
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:23.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tyron is learning.</v>

2429
01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:25.940
<v Speaker 4>It's not an easy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get criticism from certain,</v>

2430
01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:27.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as we said,</v>

2431
01:58:27.981 --> 01:58:29.270
<v Speaker 4>the other two elements of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2432
01:58:29.271 --> 01:58:30.860
<v Speaker 4>of the mixed martial arts audience,</v>

2433
01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:35.150
<v Speaker 3>that seems like the big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly the big fight for Tyron,</v>

2434
01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:37.550
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like the big five for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Georgia as well.</v>

2435
01:58:37.570 --> 01:58:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2436
01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:40.260
<v Speaker 4>It might only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2437
01:58:40.290 --> 01:58:41.830
<v Speaker 4>reservation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2438
01:58:41.850 --> 01:58:42.050
<v Speaker 4>when</v>

2439
01:58:42.050 --> 01:58:42.611
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say,</v>

2440
01:58:42.611 --> 01:58:45.250
<v Speaker 2>is this the big fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it essentially,</v>

2441
01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:47.380
<v Speaker 2>it's the same fight that George did for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a decade.</v>

2442
01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:51.550
<v Speaker 2>It's George against another very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very tough welterweight.</v>

2443
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:55.360
<v Speaker 2>What you did for 10 years was life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2444
01:58:55.361 --> 01:59:00.361
<v Speaker 2>But tyron is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's especially dangerous.</v>

2445
01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:04.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a more,</v>

2446
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I think he's more dangerous than </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hendricks.</v>

2447
01:59:06.251 --> 01:59:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I think he's more dangerous than those </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

2448
01:59:07.991 --> 01:59:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I think his ability to put you away with</v>
<v Speaker 2>one shot is,</v>

2449
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:12.783
<v Speaker 2>but you could say top of the food chain </v>
<v Speaker 2>tricks was putting people away with one </v>

2450
01:59:14.531 --> 01:59:16.240
<v Speaker 2>shelf and one years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2451
01:59:16.241 --> 01:59:17.074
<v Speaker 2>he was Hendrix's fascinating case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we should probably talk about that </v>

2452
01:59:20.981 --> 01:59:23.430
<v Speaker 2>once the camera stops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2453
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.831
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

2454
01:59:26.831 --> 01:59:31.831
<v Speaker 2>he was a fascinating case and I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand why he was so successful,</v>

2455
01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:37.030
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot to maintaining that.</v>

2456
01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.073
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot too is one thing to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a position where you are a world class </v>

2457
01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:43.174
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

2458
01:59:43.180 --> 01:59:44.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like how long can you keep that up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to her?</v>

2459
01:59:44.901 --> 01:59:45.734
<v Speaker 2>And one of the most impressive aspects </v>
<v Speaker 2>of George's career was the fact that </v>

2460
01:59:47.951 --> 01:59:49.780
<v Speaker 2>George was able to keep that up for so </v>
<v Speaker 2>long.</v>

2461
01:59:50.110 --> 01:59:51.800
<v Speaker 2>People don't understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

2462
01:59:51.810 --> 01:59:52.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly tough to become a UFC </v>

2463
01:59:54.791 --> 01:59:56.530
<v Speaker 2>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but however tough net is,</v>

2464
01:59:56.590 --> 02:00:00.160
<v Speaker 2>it's 10 times tougher to stay there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2465
02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:03.310
<v Speaker 2>and on so many different levels too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a physical thing.</v>

2466
02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:04.413
<v Speaker 2>The moment you become champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become the most studied fighter in </v>

2467
02:00:06.131 --> 02:00:07.180
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2468
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:08.103
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows every little weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see every little strength and they </v>

2469
02:00:10.361 --> 02:00:12.100
<v Speaker 2>can negate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2470
02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:14.730
<v Speaker 2>psychologically it's tough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2471
02:00:14.770 --> 02:00:19.770
<v Speaker 2>every time the other guy fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the biggest fight of his life where</v>

2472
02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:22.473
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you find it was just another </v>

2473
02:00:23.531 --> 02:00:26.050
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is He a 10th title defense?</v>

2474
02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Fios is another flight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other guy across the ring,</v>

2475
02:00:29.290 --> 02:00:31.330
<v Speaker 2>this is the biggest moment of his life.</v>

2476
02:00:31.330 --> 02:00:33.650
<v Speaker 2>He's coming at you with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gone.</v>

2477
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:34.833
<v Speaker 2>This is his moment of glory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is literally gonna change his life </v>

2478
02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:38.073
<v Speaker 2>and keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Ufc champion feel is his the next </v>

2479
02:00:39.461 --> 02:00:40.294
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the question is like is it </v>

2480
02:00:42.341 --> 02:00:43.174
<v Speaker 2>possible for a champion to maintain a </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges intensity through a 10 title </v>

2481
02:00:47.351 --> 02:00:52.150
<v Speaker 2>fight defect or do you just have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept the fact that you're dealing with</v>

2482
02:00:52.151 --> 02:00:52.984
<v Speaker 2>a completely different mind space?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think ultimately you have to drop the </v>

2483
02:00:55.691 --> 02:00:59.080
<v Speaker 2>whole pretense that it's about intensity</v>
<v Speaker 2>because no,</v>

2484
02:00:59.140 --> 02:00:59.973
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe anyone can hold the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of intensity of a teen years of </v>

2485
02:01:02.501 --> 02:01:07.030
<v Speaker 2>preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to start thinking in terms of,</v>

2486
02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to defend my title with </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique and strategy,</v>

2487
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:14.740
<v Speaker 2>because if you go with intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can only hold intensity so long it's</v>

2488
02:01:14.741 --> 02:01:17.230
<v Speaker 2>going to diminish and time as you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid more,</v>

2489
02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:19.120
<v Speaker 2>as you get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you get injured,</v>

2490
02:01:19.121 --> 02:01:21.760
<v Speaker 2>as years go by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intensity drops.</v>

2491
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Now when you analyze various fighters of</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

2492
02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.370
<v Speaker 2>who stands out to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who they lot.</v>

2493
02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:32.500
<v Speaker 2>There's some very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very impressive people.</v>

2494
02:01:32.890 --> 02:01:36.580
<v Speaker 2>A guy who impresses me enormously is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Demetrius Johnson.</v>

2495
02:01:36.610 --> 02:01:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I extremely impressed by this.</v>

2496
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I think he's the</v>

2497
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.640
<v Speaker 4>greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2498
02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:44.480
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to,</v>

2499
02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:47.060
<v Speaker 4>graceful time is such a tough thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>

2500
02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.130
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2501
02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:52.610
<v Speaker 4>with Demetrius that the open question is</v>
<v Speaker 4>always going to be what was the level of</v>

2502
02:01:52.611 --> 02:01:53.610
<v Speaker 4>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2503
02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:56.990
<v Speaker 4>But that's not his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can only fight the guys that give you</v>

2504
02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:59.450
<v Speaker 4>what's like Roy Jones Jr when Roy was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>his prime.</v>

2505
02:01:59.510 --> 02:02:00.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same sort of situation.</v>

2506
02:02:00.861 --> 02:02:01.694
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was so much better than everybody </v>

2507
02:02:02.771 --> 02:02:04.970
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like how good were these guys?</v>

2508
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:08.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean they were worldclass guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but against him,</v>

2509
02:02:08.181 --> 02:02:10.340
<v Speaker 4>they just looked like they didn't belong</v>
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>

2510
02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:11.473
<v Speaker 4>What you typically find is that when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>come to a cs who's the greatest of all </v>

2511
02:02:15.141 --> 02:02:15.974
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always going to come down to </v>

2512
02:02:16.731 --> 02:02:19.010
<v Speaker 4>criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2513
02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:23.060
<v Speaker 4>each guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his his strong point,</v>

2514
02:02:23.061 --> 02:02:24.830
<v Speaker 4>his claim to fame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as,</v>

2515
02:02:24.831 --> 02:02:26.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was the bass guy of all time.</v>

2516
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:29.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's stick with just UFC champions.</v>

2517
02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:29.953
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise we could have a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we too great if we go into pride </v>

2518
02:02:32.781 --> 02:02:34.290
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure he's getting,</v>

2519
02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.650
<v Speaker 4>it's going to get out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2520
02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:41.360
<v Speaker 4>but Demetrius Johnson's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2521
02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:42.890
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his claim to fame is,</v>

2522
02:02:42.970 --> 02:02:46.820
<v Speaker 4>is the completeness with which he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>winning fights.</v>

2523
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:50.240
<v Speaker 4>He's using everything beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's knocking,</v>

2524
02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:51.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's hitting people.</v>

2525
02:02:51.381 --> 02:02:52.610
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's clenching people.</v>

2526
02:02:52.611 --> 02:02:54.020
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's hitting clinched knockouts.</v>

2527
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:55.590
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't see those often in the USC.</v>

2528
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:58.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's incredibly good on the ground.</v>

2529
02:02:58.161 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 4>A few times he gets in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He seems to navigate his way out without</v>

2530
02:03:01.401 --> 02:03:02.650
<v Speaker 4>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2531
02:03:02.690 --> 02:03:05.660
<v Speaker 4>this a completeness in his skillset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is incredibly impressive.</v>

2532
02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:06.733
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's integrating wrestling and striking </v>

2533
02:03:08.091 --> 02:03:10.250
<v Speaker 4>and ways that just deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeply impressive.</v>

2534
02:03:10.810 --> 02:03:11.643
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll get someone like Jose Aldo who's </v>

2535
02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:16.940
<v Speaker 4>right up there in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2536
02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:18.590
<v Speaker 4>as he wanted the grace of all time.</v>

2537
02:03:18.650 --> 02:03:20.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sad thing about USC is that,</v>

2538
02:03:21.110 --> 02:03:23.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>UFC fans I should say is that,</v>

2539
02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:25.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have very short memories.</v>

2540
02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:28.070
<v Speaker 4>You a guy loses a couple of fights and </v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly he sucks.</v>

2541
02:03:28.071 --> 02:03:28.581
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2542
02:03:28.581 --> 02:03:31.250
<v Speaker 4>Jose Aldo was a killer and you kill it </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 10 years.</v>

2543
02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:33.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2544
02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:34.910
<v Speaker 4>obviously very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very skilled.</v>

2545
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.190
<v Speaker 4>He had that and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he fought,</v>

2546
02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:39.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many tough opponents.</v>

2547
02:03:39.110 --> 02:03:42.350
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you feel like when you see a guy,</v>

2548
02:03:42.351 --> 02:03:44.300
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although you were just seeing the miles,</v>

2549
02:03:44.690 --> 02:03:47.150
<v Speaker 4>the miles pile up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or do you think that Max Holloway,</v>

2550
02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:48.880
<v Speaker 4>he's not that old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nothing,</v>

2551
02:03:48.881 --> 02:03:50.000
<v Speaker 4>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All 32.</v>

2552
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.863
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm reluctant to say it's the miles </v>

2553
02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:56.120
<v Speaker 4>and also wholesale to it didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 4>take a lot of damage and it's crazy.</v>

2554
02:03:56.121 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not like a guy that got knocked out</v>

2555
02:03:58.521 --> 02:04:00.260
<v Speaker 4>five times and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it came back.</v>

2556
02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.110
<v Speaker 4>So in terms of like the damage he took </v>
<v Speaker 4>in his age,</v>

2557
02:04:03.111 --> 02:04:05.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a question of miles </v>
<v Speaker 4>and his,</v>

2558
02:04:05.690 --> 02:04:08.800
<v Speaker 4>do you think as a team it's a question </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the game just passing them by,</v>

2559
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:10.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new levels of the game?</v>

2560
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:13.700
<v Speaker 4>I that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a great question.</v>

2561
02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like Max Holloway's style,</v>

2562
02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:17.890
<v Speaker 4>it was almost like the perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2563
02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:21.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it comes out to styles and um,</v>

2564
02:04:21.230 --> 02:04:22.790
<v Speaker 4>and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2565
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:23.713
<v Speaker 4>Holloway's awkward distancing and things</v>
<v Speaker 4>like very good distance but also </v>

2566
02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:30.950
<v Speaker 4>phenomenal endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable mental toughness,</v>

2567
02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:31.873
<v Speaker 4>extreme confidence in himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he has the ability to break guys </v>

2568
02:04:35.211 --> 02:04:38.340
<v Speaker 4>just puts a piece on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very Nick Diaz like in that regard.</v>

2569
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:40.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just puts that pace on him.</v>

2570
02:04:40.261 --> 02:04:43.680
<v Speaker 3>And you saw it with Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see all those start to wilt cause it</v>

2571
02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:45.520
<v Speaker 3>almost thought as strongly in both </v>
<v Speaker 3>cases,</v>

2572
02:04:45.610 --> 02:04:47.310
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It starts very strong.</v>

2573
02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:48.173
<v Speaker 3>Well that's his thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's so explosive and he sprints </v>

2574
02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:53.130
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you really can't do that.</v>

2575
02:04:53.131 --> 02:04:53.964
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his style is highlighted by incredibly </v>

2576
02:04:58.381 --> 02:05:02.580
<v Speaker 3>explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast movement and Max is not.</v>

2577
02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Maxxis is about avoiding and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulation of bombs,</v>

2578
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:11.000
<v Speaker 3>a of techniques keep it on you keep and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also his well-roundedness,</v>

2579
02:05:11.010 --> 02:05:15.060
<v Speaker 3>his ability to submit you ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>absorb shots,</v>

2580
02:05:15.450 --> 02:05:18.600
<v Speaker 3>maintain composure when being fired upon</v>
<v Speaker 3>all those things.</v>

2581
02:05:18.601 --> 02:05:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Incredible strengths of his but </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly,</v>

2582
02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:23.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>matched up against Aldo.</v>

2583
02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:25.580
<v Speaker 3>His strengths really shine.</v>

2584
02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2585
02:05:27.110 --> 02:05:28.170
<v Speaker 4>But that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

2586
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:31.470
<v Speaker 4>a whole mark of that if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>call someone of the greatest of all time</v>

2587
02:05:31.471 --> 02:05:32.304
<v Speaker 4>is they have to be able to take on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wide array of opponents and still be </v>

2588
02:05:35.571 --> 02:05:36.650
<v Speaker 4>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2589
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:37.583
<v Speaker 3>Which is why Demetrius gets my vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like when you look at </v>

2590
02:05:41.641 --> 02:05:43.440
<v Speaker 3>Benevidez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at,</v>

2591
02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:47.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many different people that he fought,</v>

2592
02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:51.450
<v Speaker 3>showed him a bunch of different looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of different styles,</v>

2593
02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:54.000
<v Speaker 3>and he was able to overwhelm the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wilson,</v>

2594
02:05:54.001 --> 02:05:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2595
02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:57.640
<v Speaker 4>what's your assessment of his fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>against Dominick Cruz?</v>

2596
02:05:57.641 --> 02:05:58.474
<v Speaker 4>Apple Weight Division?</v>

2597
02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:02.060
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at that as a learning experience.</v>

2598
02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:04.490
<v Speaker 3>A different era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different guy.</v>

2599
02:06:04.491 --> 02:06:07.880
<v Speaker 3>He had a full time job back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't the same fighter happens if he</v>

2600
02:06:07.881 --> 02:06:11.180
<v Speaker 3>finds dominick Cruz is second time of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by that.</v>

2601
02:06:11.210 --> 02:06:13.100
<v Speaker 3>I want to see him fight Tj dillashaw </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2602
02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:16.730
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the big fight because Tj </v>
<v Speaker 3>is willing to go down to 125.</v>

2603
02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:19.340
<v Speaker 3>So instead of fighting dominick at one </v>
<v Speaker 3>35,</v>

2604
02:06:19.341 --> 02:06:20.174
<v Speaker 3>Tj is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can make one 25 and Tj feels like </v>

2605
02:06:22.551 --> 02:06:25.100
<v Speaker 3>he'll be the guy to break the legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll be far bigger,</v>

2606
02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:25.993
<v Speaker 3>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like he could match him speed </v>

2607
02:06:27.381 --> 02:06:29.690
<v Speaker 3>for speed and he thinks he can make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight comfortably.</v>

2608
02:06:30.020 --> 02:06:31.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm really fascinated by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fine.</v>

2609
02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:37.300
<v Speaker 3>Because also I think Tj is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>few guys that's trained,</v>

2610
02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:38.733
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

2611
02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:42.640
<v Speaker 3>I think Matt Hume is one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>unsung heroes of MMA.</v>

2612
02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:44.600
<v Speaker 3>I agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a master,</v>

2613
02:06:44.601 --> 02:06:46.220
<v Speaker 3>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating guy.</v>

2614
02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Incredibly intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep,</v>

2615
02:06:48.321 --> 02:06:51.540
<v Speaker 3>deep knowledge of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both stand up and on the ground and,</v>

2616
02:06:51.541 --> 02:06:53.270
<v Speaker 3>and integrating those two things </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

2617
02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:57.160
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the few guys you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>genuinely say his,</v>

2618
02:06:57.670 --> 02:06:59.200
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2619
02:06:59.470 --> 02:07:00.303
<v Speaker 4>expertise across all areas of mixed </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts and played a pivotal role </v>

2620
02:07:05.170 --> 02:07:09.430
<v Speaker 4>in taking someone from being an unknown </v>
<v Speaker 4>to a legitimate greg,</v>

2621
02:07:09.670 --> 02:07:11.240
<v Speaker 4>we'll champion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2622
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:13.390
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see people who,</v>

2623
02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:17.440
<v Speaker 4>people often don't make a distinction </v>
<v Speaker 4>between recruiters and coaches.</v>

2624
02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:18.521
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

2625
02:07:18.521 --> 02:07:19.354
<v Speaker 4>there's many fight camps out there that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are very good at recruiting people that </v>

2626
02:07:22.061 --> 02:07:26.140
<v Speaker 4>were already good and helping them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>manage them,</v>

2627
02:07:26.141 --> 02:07:27.340
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and make them slightly better.</v>

2628
02:07:27.730 --> 02:07:30.820
<v Speaker 4>The world's full of recruiters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's not many coaches out there.</v>

2629
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:36.270
<v Speaker 4>Matt Hume took a kid who'd known,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had heard of and took him from obscurity</v>

2630
02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:39.550
<v Speaker 4>to arguably one of the best of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2631
02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>

2632
02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:43.353
<v Speaker 4>he did it in a way with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kid went from being essentially a </v>

2633
02:07:45.611 --> 02:07:50.611
<v Speaker 4>wrestler to a genuinely well-rounded </v>
<v Speaker 4>mixed martial artist with a complete set</v>

2634
02:07:51.131 --> 02:07:52.630
<v Speaker 4>of skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2635
02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:54.220
<v Speaker 4>that's an impressive accomplishment.</v>

2636
02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2637
02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:59.700
<v Speaker 3>and it's also his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he does it,</v>

2638
02:08:00.030 --> 02:08:02.340
<v Speaker 3>the way he fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how little damage she takes.</v>

2639
02:08:02.370 --> 02:08:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's his movement,</v>

2640
02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:05.470
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

2641
02:08:05.471 --> 02:08:06.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to control,</v>

2642
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:11.160
<v Speaker 3>like a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dodson who fought John Dodson,</v>

2643
02:08:11.161 --> 02:08:16.161
<v Speaker 3>who's unbelievably explosive and fast </v>
<v Speaker 3>and dangerous and just overwhelmed him.</v>

2644
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:18.583
<v Speaker 4>If Demetrius Johnson didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dolson would've been a very good </v>

2645
02:08:21.081 --> 02:08:21.980
<v Speaker 4>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2646
02:08:21.981 --> 02:08:23.420
<v Speaker 4>Highly regarded champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2647
02:08:23.730 --> 02:08:26.450
<v Speaker 4>That people don't realize how good some </v>
<v Speaker 4>of these opponents adion and they say,</v>

2648
02:08:26.451 --> 02:08:27.200
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2649
02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.610
<v Speaker 4>I see the level of a ponant that </v>
<v Speaker 4>goodwill Dalton's it</v>

2650
02:08:30.150 --> 02:08:34.050
<v Speaker 3>very good at Dodson was especially a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

2651
02:08:34.130 --> 02:08:37.920
<v Speaker 3>It's extremely dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seems to be in a bit of a Rut down,</v>

2652
02:08:37.921 --> 02:08:40.350
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a psychological rod or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>physical Rut.</v>

2653
02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.620
<v Speaker 3>It not quite the same guy that he used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>

2654
02:08:44.130 --> 02:08:47.010
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard when a guy best you,</v>

2655
02:08:47.250 --> 02:08:48.083
<v Speaker 3>the way that mighty mouse best too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it seems like the level of </v>

2656
02:08:51.571 --> 02:08:54.810
<v Speaker 3>talent is so far above where you're at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>

2657
02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:56.640
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're left with a dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2658
02:08:56.641 --> 02:08:58.440
<v Speaker 3>how do I catch this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ken?</v>

2659
02:08:58.490 --> 02:08:59.323
<v Speaker 3>Is it even possible for me to catch him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they had two fights and the </v>

2660
02:09:02.281 --> 02:09:04.860
<v Speaker 3>second fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mighty mouse won handily.</v>

2661
02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:06.960
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first fight was closer.</v>

2662
02:09:07.110 --> 02:09:09.540
<v Speaker 3>The first fight was more dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got hit a few times,</v>

2663
02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:10.793
<v Speaker 3>but in the second fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mighty mouse just showed leaps and </v>

2664
02:09:12.931 --> 02:09:16.170
<v Speaker 3>bounds and it was just a route he just </v>
<v Speaker 3>ran him over.</v>

2665
02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:17.813
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other arguments are Anderson </v>

2666
02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Anderson in his prime is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2667
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:23.850
<v Speaker 3>it's a great argument for the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all time,</v>

2668
02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:25.633
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2669
02:09:25.710 --> 02:09:26.950
<v Speaker 3>outside of the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fader.</v>

2670
02:09:27.630 --> 02:09:30.900
<v Speaker 3>I think those are really the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments for the greatest of all times.</v>

2671
02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:32.273
<v Speaker 3>And George George's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially coming back and beating </v>

2672
02:09:34.561 --> 02:09:36.150
<v Speaker 3>bisping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that puts him,</v>

2673
02:09:36.630 --> 02:09:38.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right back into the mix.</v>

2674
02:09:38.161 --> 02:09:41.010
<v Speaker 3>And in terms of a argument of one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest of all time.</v>

2675
02:09:41.110 --> 02:09:43.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was an important step for him</v>

2676
02:09:43.121 --> 02:09:43.954
<v Speaker 4>because as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were three persistent criticisms </v>

2677
02:09:46.001 --> 02:09:48.350
<v Speaker 4>and he answered all three in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2678
02:09:48.351 --> 02:09:49.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that definitely helps his case.</v>

2679
02:09:50.010 --> 02:09:52.050
<v Speaker 3>What's your thought on could be abnormal</v>
<v Speaker 3>to madoff?</v>

2680
02:09:52.051 --> 02:09:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Extremely</v>

2681
02:09:53.090 --> 02:09:57.740
<v Speaker 4>embraced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His kid is a deeply,</v>

2682
02:09:57.741 --> 02:09:59.870
<v Speaker 4>deeply impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've um,</v>

2683
02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:00.883
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's coming to the academy a couple of </v>

2684
02:10:02.421 --> 02:10:05.210
<v Speaker 4>times before fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never actually seen him train.</v>

2685
02:10:05.540 --> 02:10:06.373
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2686
02:10:06.590 --> 02:10:07.423
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after his fight in Madison Square </v>

2687
02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:10.813
<v Speaker 4>Garden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he bought himself and a group of his </v>

2688
02:10:12.771 --> 02:10:13.604
<v Speaker 4>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his training partners came into the </v>

2689
02:10:14.361 --> 02:10:16.340
<v Speaker 4>academy and trained in my Monday </v>
<v Speaker 4>afternoon class.</v>

2690
02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:17.480
<v Speaker 4>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't train.</v>

2691
02:10:17.481 --> 02:10:19.790
<v Speaker 4>He just sat on the bench cause he'd just</v>
<v Speaker 4>support on Saturday nights.</v>

2692
02:10:19.791 --> 02:10:21.560
<v Speaker 4>Of course he's not going to train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but his,</v>

2693
02:10:21.561 --> 02:10:22.580
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

2694
02:10:22.610 --> 02:10:23.443
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his training partners came in and </v>

2695
02:10:24.951 --> 02:10:26.840
<v Speaker 4>trained with a squad and that was a fun </v>
<v Speaker 4>afternoon.</v>

2696
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:27.990
<v Speaker 4>They rolled with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2697
02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:31.160
<v Speaker 4>I think mostly Nikki Ryan and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2698
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:33.800
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for them of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's submission grappling.</v>

2699
02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:36.160
<v Speaker 4>That's not really what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do more the interface of,</v>

2700
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:38.780
<v Speaker 4>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grappling to bind with striking.</v>

2701
02:10:38.781 --> 02:10:40.070
<v Speaker 4>So they had a hard time of it.</v>

2702
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:40.903
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2703
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:42.590
<v Speaker 4>he struck me as a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very nice person.</v>

2704
02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:44.510
<v Speaker 4>He shockingly big for his weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>division,</v>

2705
02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:45.490
<v Speaker 4>shockingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shockingly.</v>

2706
02:10:45.690 --> 02:10:46.750
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2707
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:51.650
<v Speaker 4>like all the people coming out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Caucasus regions of Russia has wrestling</v>

2708
02:10:51.651 --> 02:10:56.651
<v Speaker 4>is extremely good and they have probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>the base wrestling program in the world.</v>

2709
02:10:57.411 --> 02:10:59.690
<v Speaker 4>That whole area stretching from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2710
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:01.123
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>asitia through Dagestan's or Chechnya </v>

2711
02:11:03.411 --> 02:11:07.040
<v Speaker 4>all the way down to Iran at that areas </v>
<v Speaker 4>is the hotbed of wrestling in the world.</v>

2712
02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:08.383
<v Speaker 4>And it shows all find fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all strong and wrestling and he </v>

2713
02:11:11.331 --> 02:11:13.100
<v Speaker 4>named is add to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the various skills.</v>

2714
02:11:13.101 --> 02:11:14.660
<v Speaker 4>And you've got a tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tough group</v>

2715
02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:15.890
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2716
02:11:15.891 --> 02:11:16.724
<v Speaker 2>I was extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet I've been impressed with every </v>

2717
02:11:17.811 --> 02:11:19.460
<v Speaker 2>single performance he's had in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>octagon.</v>

2718
02:11:19.461 --> 02:11:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a undefeated,</v>

2719
02:11:20.991 --> 02:11:23.450
<v Speaker 2>which is incredibly rare in and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

2720
02:11:23.451 --> 02:11:25.310
<v Speaker 2>but in the hundred and 55 pound </v>
<v Speaker 2>division,</v>

2721
02:11:25.311 --> 02:11:26.144
<v Speaker 2>even more impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the way he mauled Barboza Jesus </v>

2722
02:11:30.710 --> 02:11:31.543
<v Speaker 2>Christ and you can see the fight was </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially over halfway through round </v>

2723
02:11:33.621 --> 02:11:34.540
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2724
02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could see it in Barboza his face.</v>

2725
02:11:37.041 --> 02:11:38.630
<v Speaker 2>He was drained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2726
02:11:38.631 --> 02:11:40.400
<v Speaker 2>That was an incredibly impressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

2727
02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2728
02:11:42.831 --> 02:11:43.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2729
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:44.743
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't put them yet and the grace of </v>

2730
02:11:47.301 --> 02:11:49.310
<v Speaker 2>all time category,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he hasn't won a title,</v>

2731
02:11:49.311 --> 02:11:50.144
<v Speaker 2>hasn't even challenge for it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you definitely get the sense that </v>

2732
02:11:52.401 --> 02:11:54.290
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he had had a title fight by now,</v>

2733
02:11:54.291 --> 02:11:57.770
<v Speaker 2>he probably would have been a champion </v>
<v Speaker 2>by now hem versus Connor,</v>

2734
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to say.</v>

2735
02:11:59.901 --> 02:12:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Him versus connor and Russia or him </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus Tony,</v>

2736
02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:04.993
<v Speaker 2>Tony Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then would be a very interesting </v>

2737
02:12:06.231 --> 02:12:06.900
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2738
02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:07.733
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting about those two </v>

2739
02:12:08.011 --> 02:12:08.844
<v Speaker 4>fights as you have basically polar </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposites can be to him and we get all </v>

2740
02:12:11.781 --> 02:12:14.540
<v Speaker 4>of us a control based fighter whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2741
02:12:14.570 --> 02:12:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Tony Focus in is a scramble based fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2742
02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:18.293
<v Speaker 4>And just that clash in styles is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be fascinating with regards conor </v>

2743
02:12:22.831 --> 02:12:26.820
<v Speaker 4>mcgregor and could be minimum get off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The feeling one gets is that if they did</v>

2744
02:12:26.821 --> 02:12:30.690
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be a complete shutout in one of</v>

2745
02:12:30.691 --> 02:12:31.524
<v Speaker 4>two directions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's either like a man beating up a </v>

2746
02:12:34.891 --> 02:12:39.891
<v Speaker 4>child on the ground or it's just a flush</v>
<v Speaker 4>knock out a guy unable to cover distance</v>

2747
02:12:42.931 --> 02:12:46.800
<v Speaker 4>properly and walking into a left hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just being catastrophic k Ote.</v>

2748
02:12:47.310 --> 02:12:51.030
<v Speaker 4>And you feel like there's potential for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it to go in both directions.</v>

2749
02:12:52.070 --> 02:12:52.903
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

2750
02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:55.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a fight I don't think goes to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>

2751
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.900
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2752
02:12:55.900 --> 02:12:57.460
<v Speaker 2>it's one way or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2753
02:12:57.461 --> 02:12:58.930
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2754
02:12:58.931 --> 02:12:59.764
<v Speaker 2>I feel like what connor presents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting in terms of danger is </v>

2755
02:13:03.191 --> 02:13:07.040
<v Speaker 2>speed and one shot knockout power with </v>
<v Speaker 2>his hands and could be,</v>

2756
02:13:07.050 --> 02:13:09.320
<v Speaker 2>has been heard coming in by Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnson.</v>

2757
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:10.183
<v Speaker 2>It's really the only adversity ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffered inside the occupant and he </v>

2758
02:13:12.251 --> 02:13:12.930
<v Speaker 2>dealt with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2759
02:13:12.930 --> 02:13:14.510
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good sign for debate.</v>

2760
02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:17.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a sliver of hope that every </v>
<v Speaker 2>opponent clings to.</v>

2761
02:13:17.530 --> 02:13:20.950
<v Speaker 2>They watched that one moment where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Johnson clipped him and be like,</v>

2762
02:13:20.951 --> 02:13:21.461
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2763
02:13:21.461 --> 02:13:22.480
<v Speaker 2>he's human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2764
02:13:22.630 --> 02:13:26.020
<v Speaker 2>It can be hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the terminator if it bleeds.</v>

2765
02:13:26.021 --> 02:13:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that this predator.</v>

2766
02:13:29.530 --> 02:13:30.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd I say?</v>

2767
02:13:30.341 --> 02:13:31.174
<v Speaker 2>Terminator?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2768
02:13:31.290 --> 02:13:33.680
<v Speaker 2>you just fucked up your reference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

2769
02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:36.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm sweaty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

2770
02:13:36.031 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did fuck it up.</v>

2771
02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:38.253
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that connor has been </v>

2772
02:13:40.621 --> 02:13:44.100
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmed on the ground though and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been overwhelmed by Nadya's.</v>

2773
02:13:44.270 --> 02:13:45.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's been controlled in the ground </v>

2774
02:13:46.441 --> 02:13:47.274
<v Speaker 2>by Chad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One gets the feeling that whatever </v>

2775
02:13:48.721 --> 02:13:52.080
<v Speaker 2>amount of controlled they were able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>impose on them would be nothing compared</v>

2776
02:13:52.081 --> 02:13:54.520
<v Speaker 2>with what could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could impose more of a,</v>

2777
02:13:54.620 --> 02:13:55.510
<v Speaker 2>could be busy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2778
02:13:56.010 --> 02:13:58.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a much more dangerous form of </v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

2779
02:13:58.141 --> 02:13:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2780
02:13:58.830 --> 02:13:59.663
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a program of hitting people on the </v>

2781
02:14:01.531 --> 02:14:02.364
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is substantially better than </v>

2782
02:14:04.681 --> 02:14:06.330
<v Speaker 2>either of the two athletes you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned.</v>

2783
02:14:06.331 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2784
02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:11.490
<v Speaker 2>and big differences when it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets you on the ground.</v>

2785
02:14:11.970 --> 02:14:13.650
<v Speaker 2>You're not getting up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2786
02:14:14.010 --> 02:14:16.800
<v Speaker 2>you're getting mauled and it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a spider.</v>

2787
02:14:17.070 --> 02:14:17.903
<v Speaker 2>Like he's injecting venom into you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly but surely like we can in your </v>

2788
02:14:21.331 --> 02:14:22.890
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

2789
02:14:22.891 --> 02:14:27.000
<v Speaker 2>you see after the first round when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barboza gets up,</v>

2790
02:14:27.330 --> 02:14:29.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean he's,</v>

2791
02:14:29.251 --> 02:14:30.084
<v Speaker 2>he's alive still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is a different person now and </v>

2792
02:14:32.821 --> 02:14:33.654
<v Speaker 2>going into the second round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Barboza gave an admirable </v>

2793
02:14:36.331 --> 02:14:37.010
<v Speaker 2>count of himself.</v>

2794
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean showed himself to be a true </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior.</v>

2795
02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:40.410
<v Speaker 2>He did try a couple of spinning back </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks in.</v>

2796
02:14:40.411 --> 02:14:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were relatively close.</v>

2797
02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:43.053
<v Speaker 2>Barboza is kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heavy strategy though is very different </v>

2798
02:14:46.111 --> 02:14:48.900
<v Speaker 2>than connors connors kicks or just the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

2799
02:14:48.901 --> 02:14:52.620
<v Speaker 2>His kicks are just probes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sort of poking at you,</v>

2800
02:14:52.621 --> 02:14:53.454
<v Speaker 2>poking at you and it putting things out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in front of you and he's just tried to </v>

2801
02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:00.420
<v Speaker 2>just trying to drop that hard left hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>on you.</v>

2802
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:02.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fascinating.</v>

2803
02:15:02.970 --> 02:15:05.850
<v Speaker 2>I always undervalued him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he first came in the UFC,</v>

2804
02:15:05.851 --> 02:15:06.280
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2805
02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:07.113
<v Speaker 2>it's high but typing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the more I started with we'll </v>

2806
02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:10.770
<v Speaker 2>wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's saying he's very,</v>

2807
02:15:10.771 --> 02:15:12.420
<v Speaker 2>very skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While he's also,</v>

2808
02:15:12.421 --> 02:15:16.380
<v Speaker 2>he mind fucks people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He mind fucks people in a way that,</v>

2809
02:15:16.530 --> 02:15:17.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think he's mind fucking </v>

2810
02:15:18.481 --> 02:15:19.980
<v Speaker 2>could be anything that works on could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

2811
02:15:20.100 --> 02:15:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's,</v>

2812
02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:24.990
<v Speaker 2>we do dealing with a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of human being.</v>

2813
02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Those people from Dagestan are just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

2814
02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:31.200
<v Speaker 2>It's just a hard part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

2815
02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:34.770
<v Speaker 2>they're made of hardier stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2816
02:15:34.771 --> 02:15:36.900
<v Speaker 2>It's just like they have to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>way more.</v>

2817
02:15:36.930 --> 02:15:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Not that people in Ireland are soft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking hard people too.</v>

2818
02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I just think that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always said the most important,</v>

2819
02:15:44.851 --> 02:15:49.650
<v Speaker 2>if you have a pyramid of technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to mixed martial arts,</v>

2820
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:50.663
<v Speaker 2>the base of the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing is the ability </v>

2821
02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:57.120
<v Speaker 2>to control the grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to take a guy down.</v>

2822
02:15:57.121 --> 02:15:59.520
<v Speaker 2>If you can take a guy down and control </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

2823
02:15:59.940 --> 02:16:00.773
<v Speaker 2>you have a significant advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can choose where the fight takes </v>

2824
02:16:03.361 --> 02:16:06.060
<v Speaker 2>place and if you are competent in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standup,</v>

2825
02:16:06.061 --> 02:16:08.400
<v Speaker 2>which could be was definitely competent </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the standup.</v>

2826
02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:13.200
<v Speaker 2>So you are adequate in the standup but </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming when it gets to the ground.</v>

2827
02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:17.040
<v Speaker 2>You can present problems with a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up and which,</v>

2828
02:16:17.041 --> 02:16:17.874
<v Speaker 2>which case his problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy has to deal with the striking </v>

2829
02:16:20.581 --> 02:16:23.370
<v Speaker 2>aspects which opened up the takedowns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2830
02:16:23.580 --> 02:16:26.160
<v Speaker 2>I wholeheartedly agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll go a little further.</v>

2831
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Whenever someone asks me what are the,</v>

2832
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:31.750
<v Speaker 4>what are the programs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2833
02:16:31.751 --> 02:16:34.960
<v Speaker 4>what do you look for when you see a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>dominating fights?</v>

2834
02:16:34.961 --> 02:16:35.321
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2835
02:16:35.321 --> 02:16:39.280
<v Speaker 4>what makes someone go in the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>directions with a training and,</v>

2836
02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:42.640
<v Speaker 4>and the fighting itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always say this three things.</v>

2837
02:16:42.641 --> 02:16:45.160
<v Speaker 4>If you show me a fighter who can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

2838
02:16:46.390 --> 02:16:51.310
<v Speaker 4>dominate the setups to dominate the pace</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the fight.</v>

2839
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:56.110
<v Speaker 4>And three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how can I phrase this?</v>

2840
02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Dominate the simple direction of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2841
02:17:03.390 --> 02:17:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Three things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dominate the setups,</v>

2842
02:17:05.220 --> 02:17:07.440
<v Speaker 4>dominate the pace,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dominate the direction.</v>

2843
02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:11.700
<v Speaker 4>You show me a fighter who can do those </v>
<v Speaker 4>three things and I'll show you a fighter</v>

2844
02:17:11.701 --> 02:17:14.460
<v Speaker 4>who can win 95% of the fights he gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>into</v>

2845
02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:18.510
<v Speaker 4>dominate the setups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dominate the pace,</v>

2846
02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:21.700
<v Speaker 4>dominantly direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about someone that could be,</v>

2847
02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:23.650
<v Speaker 4>or anyone who comes from a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

2848
02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:24.593
<v Speaker 4>a strong wrestling or judo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu with takedowns baseline is they </v>

2849
02:17:28.221 --> 02:17:29.054
<v Speaker 4>always kind of at a dominated direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They determine whether it goes down to </v>

2850
02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:37.711
<v Speaker 4>the ground over there where it say </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing to be always dominates the pace</v>

2851
02:17:37.811 --> 02:17:39.880
<v Speaker 4>of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you're on the ground,</v>

2852
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:40.833
<v Speaker 4>you're on top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other guys is reacting to what </v>

2853
02:17:42.971 --> 02:17:44.470
<v Speaker 4>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get back up to his feet,</v>

2854
02:17:44.471 --> 02:17:45.304
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

2855
02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:46.623
<v Speaker 4>You're dominating pace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's one weakness that could be </v>

2856
02:17:50.651 --> 02:17:53.410
<v Speaker 4>pairs is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not as strong.</v>

2857
02:17:53.411 --> 02:17:58.411
<v Speaker 4>It dominating the setups to get to those</v>
<v Speaker 4>areas where he can dominate pace and uh,</v>

2858
02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:01.780
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

2859
02:18:02.530 --> 02:18:03.363
<v Speaker 4>If he's going to lose a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be in their area and </v>

2860
02:18:05.861 --> 02:18:06.694
<v Speaker 4>corner more than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a guy who dominates the setups you </v>

2861
02:18:11.081 --> 02:18:12.820
<v Speaker 4>set up before the kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a probe,</v>

2862
02:18:12.850 --> 02:18:13.683
<v Speaker 4>they're not kicks.</v>

2863
02:18:13.890 --> 02:18:15.120
<v Speaker 4>It's not trying to hurt you with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks.</v>

2864
02:18:15.130 --> 02:18:17.560
<v Speaker 4>He's probing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hurts you with this.</v>

2865
02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:22.150
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So connor skill is,</v>

2866
02:18:22.151 --> 02:18:25.300
<v Speaker 4>he's a master of dominating setups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in a standing position,</v>

2867
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:27.063
<v Speaker 4>but to beavs mastery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Out of those three critical areas for </v>

2868
02:18:30.371 --> 02:18:33.760
<v Speaker 4>domination and all forms of fighting is </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a dominant,</v>

2869
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:34.833
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's incredibly dominant in determining </v>

2870
02:18:36.940 --> 02:18:39.310
<v Speaker 4>the direction of the fight and the pace </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the fight.</v>

2871
02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:41.370
<v Speaker 4>That's why he never gets tired and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>white.</v>

2872
02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:43.870
<v Speaker 4>It's got a very high work rate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he never gets tired.</v>

2873
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.903
<v Speaker 4>He never see him just completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>shattered despite the [inaudible] </v>

2874
02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:46.820
<v Speaker 4>working</v>

2875
02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:49.640
<v Speaker 2>hard the whole time and the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that he's significantly</v>

2876
02:18:49.641 --> 02:18:51.740
<v Speaker 2>weakens themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make 155 pounds,</v>

2877
02:18:52.100 --> 02:18:54.650
<v Speaker 2>which apparently he's done far better </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2878
02:18:54.890 --> 02:18:58.760
<v Speaker 2>He had a real nutritionist heading into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this camp and it was much easier for him</v>

2879
02:18:58.761 --> 02:18:59.594
<v Speaker 2>to cut the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be fascinated to see him fight at </v>

2880
02:19:00.831 --> 02:19:02.780
<v Speaker 2>one 70 and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a plan.</v>

2881
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:04.063
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that was a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm woodley was joking around about it </v>

2882
02:19:05.631 --> 02:19:07.690
<v Speaker 2>saying he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll send them nutritionists.</v>

2883
02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:08.533
<v Speaker 2>So Sal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep his psycho ass down at one 55 was </v>

2884
02:19:10.311 --> 02:19:11.710
<v Speaker 2>his exact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2885
02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:18.450
<v Speaker 2>With regards to your point before saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2887
02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:19.633
<v Speaker 2>this core combat skill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important one that you as a </v>

2888
02:19:21.861 --> 02:19:23.570
<v Speaker 2>commentator look for when you look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>finance,</v>

2889
02:19:23.571 --> 02:19:24.404
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2890
02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:26.830
<v Speaker 2>can you determine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2891
02:19:26.860 --> 02:19:28.430
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put grappling</v>

2892
02:19:28.430 --> 02:19:30.260
<v Speaker 5>skill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that number one same way.</v>

2893
02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:32.210
<v Speaker 5>There'll be wrestling with every samba </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the beach you get.</v>

2894
02:19:32.211 --> 02:19:33.680
<v Speaker 5>So what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2895
02:19:33.700 --> 02:19:34.880
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would go through them and say,</v>

2896
02:19:34.881 --> 02:19:36.500
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's three things that I look for.</v>

2897
02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:38.900
<v Speaker 5>Who dominates the setups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who dominates the pace,</v>

2898
02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:39.853
<v Speaker 5>who dominates the direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what are your thoughts about </v>

2899
02:19:42.471 --> 02:19:45.170
<v Speaker 5>strength and conditioning for mixed </v>
<v Speaker 5>martial arts fighters?</v>

2900
02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:47.660
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a huge question.</v>

2901
02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:50.900
<v Speaker 5>But the question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what takes precedent?</v>

2902
02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:51.793
<v Speaker 5>The skill training take precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's several schools of thought </v>

2903
02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:55.333
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of them would be one of the more </v>

2904
02:19:57.531 --> 02:20:01.160
<v Speaker 5>interesting ones is nick curse on and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Marvin Marinovich that camp.</v>

2905
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:02.023
<v Speaker 5>They believe that you already know how </v>
<v Speaker 5>to fight and that what the camp really </v>

2906
02:20:04.791 --> 02:20:08.150
<v Speaker 5>should be about is just radical strength</v>
<v Speaker 5>and conditioning to the point where,</v>

2907
02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:09.200
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2908
02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:11.900
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a mixed question then.</v>

2909
02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:13.153
<v Speaker 5>Are you talking about a fight camp or </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's talking about fight training over </v>

2910
02:20:15.981 --> 02:20:17.130
<v Speaker 5>the year?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very difficult.</v>

2911
02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:17.993
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's talk about a fight camp and </v>

2912
02:20:18.771 --> 02:20:19.640
<v Speaker 5>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2913
02:20:21.020 --> 02:20:23.390
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Average fight camp is around,</v>

2914
02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:24.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2915
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:27.730
<v Speaker 5>six to eight weeks and has the lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a,</v>

2916
02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:29.150
<v Speaker 5>it's like a 10 to 12 weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>

2917
02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:30.770
<v Speaker 5>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very long fight camp.</v>

2918
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:32.023
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much physiological change can you </v>

2919
02:20:35.211 --> 02:20:37.040
<v Speaker 5>affect in the body and six to eight </v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks</v>

2920
02:20:39.630 --> 02:20:42.840
<v Speaker 5>she can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could tighten everything up.</v>

2921
02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:43.733
<v Speaker 5>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can certainly increase your </v>

2922
02:20:44.881 --> 02:20:46.680
<v Speaker 5>endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your threshold,</v>

2923
02:20:46.681 --> 02:20:47.514
<v Speaker 5>your ability to work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much could you increase your vo two </v>

2924
02:20:49.381 --> 02:20:52.260
<v Speaker 5>Max and six weeks is a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few percentage points,</v>

2925
02:20:52.261 --> 02:20:53.094
<v Speaker 5>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2926
02:20:53.130 --> 02:20:54.960
<v Speaker 5>I think considerably less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2927
02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:55.853
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2928
02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:58.593
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2929
02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:03.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how much could you increase</v>
<v Speaker 5>your vertical jump in six weeks?</v>

2930
02:21:03.640 --> 02:21:04.473
<v Speaker 5>Not much.</v>

2931
02:21:06.200 --> 02:21:07.033
<v Speaker 5>Not much at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a big believer in the idea that </v>

2932
02:21:09.921 --> 02:21:14.870
<v Speaker 5>you're going to create big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>significant fight changing physiological</v>

2933
02:21:14.871 --> 02:21:18.020
<v Speaker 5>changes in six to eight weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not really my experience.</v>

2934
02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:19.483
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I can show someone a single </v>

2935
02:21:21.711 --> 02:21:25.820
<v Speaker 5>technique which can have a direct impact</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a fight.</v>

2936
02:21:26.090 --> 02:21:29.320
<v Speaker 5>I can show them that in five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2937
02:21:29.640 --> 02:21:30.473
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna claim to be a medical </v>

2938
02:21:31.311 --> 02:21:32.144
<v Speaker 5>expert who has a deep understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things about my experience in </v>

2939
02:21:35.421 --> 02:21:40.010
<v Speaker 5>coaching is that physiological changes </v>
<v Speaker 5>take time and you're not going to get it</v>

2940
02:21:40.011 --> 02:21:41.990
<v Speaker 5>done in a fight camp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2941
02:21:41.991 --> 02:21:45.020
<v Speaker 5>You can make physiological changes over </v>
<v Speaker 5>a year,</v>

2942
02:21:45.021 --> 02:21:46.010
<v Speaker 5>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2943
02:21:46.130 --> 02:21:48.110
<v Speaker 5>George went up a weight division.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2944
02:21:48.111 --> 02:21:49.850
<v Speaker 5>But it took quite a bit of preparation </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>

2945
02:21:49.851 --> 02:21:50.684
<v Speaker 5>So it didn't happen in six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What kind of strength training was he </v>

2946
02:21:53.211 --> 02:21:56.150
<v Speaker 5>doing to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know he's very involved in gymnastics.</v>

2947
02:21:56.950 --> 02:22:00.260
<v Speaker 5>George George has primary physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>training outside.</v>

2948
02:22:00.261 --> 02:22:01.580
<v Speaker 5>It has gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He loves it.</v>

2949
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:03.410
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2950
02:22:03.440 --> 02:22:05.990
<v Speaker 5>he also for a time did Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 5>weightlifting.</v>

2951
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:07.610
<v Speaker 5>Less so now than before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2952
02:22:07.810 --> 02:22:08.643
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a time that was a big part of </v>

2953
02:22:09.891 --> 02:22:11.030
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2954
02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:16.060
<v Speaker 5>recently he started taking on a training</v>
<v Speaker 5>in water with various fins,</v>

2955
02:22:17.481 --> 02:22:18.081
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>

2956
02:22:18.081 --> 02:22:20.510
<v Speaker 5>to increase resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's quite a fan of that.</v>

2957
02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:22.120
<v Speaker 5>But the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>George go through,</v>

2958
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:24.010
<v Speaker 5>goes through cycles and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2959
02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:25.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boredom is a factor.</v>

2960
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 5>He get bored at a certain</v>

2961
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:29.250
<v Speaker 4>kind of physical activity and you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to try something new.</v>

2962
02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he's gone through various cycles.</v>

2963
02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:37.220
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Georgia's strength has not significantly</v>

2964
02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:42.960
<v Speaker 4>changed despite the various changes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>physiological training.</v>

2965
02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:44.153
<v Speaker 4>Like when he did Olympic lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't massively stronger than when </v>

2966
02:22:46.831 --> 02:22:51.150
<v Speaker 4>he did regular weight lifting or when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>did swim training,</v>

2967
02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:53.250
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't feel like,</v>

2968
02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:54.900
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One made him stronger than the other.</v>

2969
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:56.510
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2970
02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:02.920
<v Speaker 4>there's so many interesting questions </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the one you just asked it.</v>

2971
02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I believe that strength is important?</v>

2972
02:23:05.380 --> 02:23:07.290
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2973
02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:08.193
<v Speaker 4>And anyone who says that strengths </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't make a difference in a fight is </v>

2974
02:23:10.781 --> 02:23:11.614
<v Speaker 4>just straight up ignoring the obvious </v>
<v Speaker 4>facts is a reason why men don't find </v>

2975
02:23:15.401 --> 02:23:18.040
<v Speaker 4>women because there's massive strength </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences.</v>

2976
02:23:18.310 --> 02:23:20.930
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason why this weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>categories because there's big strength.</v>

2977
02:23:20.931 --> 02:23:22.180
<v Speaker 4>There was been heavyweight and </v>
<v Speaker 4>lightweight.</v>

2978
02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:23.770
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2979
02:23:24.310 --> 02:23:26.950
<v Speaker 4>strength makes a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The proof of that is simple,</v>

2980
02:23:27.070 --> 02:23:29.350
<v Speaker 4>easy to observe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do people take anabolic steroids?</v>

2981
02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:31.960
<v Speaker 4>Because they know that strength makes a </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference.</v>

2982
02:23:32.020 --> 02:23:32.853
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is there a reason why they are </v>

2983
02:23:33.191 --> 02:23:34.024
<v Speaker 4>illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they do change the outcome of </v>

2984
02:23:35.711 --> 02:23:37.570
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2985
02:23:37.571 --> 02:23:38.404
<v Speaker 4>strength is extremely important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is how are you going to </v>

2986
02:23:40.421 --> 02:23:43.090
<v Speaker 4>build it and then are you going to do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in camp?</v>

2987
02:23:43.870 --> 02:23:46.300
<v Speaker 4>Is your fight camp can be based around </v>
<v Speaker 4>strings?</v>

2988
02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:47.433
<v Speaker 4>That's a risky strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you ready to get that much stronger </v>

2989
02:23:49.361 --> 02:23:51.220
<v Speaker 4>in six weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2990
02:23:51.370 --> 02:23:52.203
<v Speaker 4>I've always believed that the whole idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>of fight camp is to prepare an already </v>

2991
02:23:55.991 --> 02:23:59.740
<v Speaker 4>well trained athlete to get around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem of one individual.</v>

2992
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:01.383
<v Speaker 4>It's programming one individual to solve</v>
<v Speaker 4>the complex problem that another </v>

2993
02:24:04.991 --> 02:24:05.824
<v Speaker 4>individual presents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like preparation for an </v>

2994
02:24:07.871 --> 02:24:08.830
<v Speaker 4>exam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>

2995
02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:12.820
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

2996
02:24:12.821 --> 02:24:13.780
<v Speaker 4>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing,</v>

2997
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:16.600
<v Speaker 4>every flight campus motivated by two </v>
<v Speaker 4>very simple questions.</v>

2998
02:24:16.810 --> 02:24:20.230
<v Speaker 4>How are you going to win this fight and </v>
<v Speaker 4>how you not going to lose this fight.</v>

2999
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:21.833
<v Speaker 4>The entire structure of the campus based</v>
<v Speaker 4>around that and almost all of it has to </v>

3000
02:24:25.301 --> 02:24:29.150
<v Speaker 4>do with tactics and techniques rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>than changes in the physical body.</v>

3001
02:24:30.850 --> 02:24:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Now when George is in off camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3002
02:24:34.171 --> 02:24:37.420
<v Speaker 2>when we say out of camp is that when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

3003
02:24:37.690 --> 02:24:41.680
<v Speaker 2>that's a period of skill acquisition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to acquire new skills.</v>

3004
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.863
<v Speaker 2>So that's when he would t I know he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>notorious for taking trips to like to </v>

3005
02:24:46.361 --> 02:24:47.194
<v Speaker 2>Brazil,</v>

3006
02:24:48.050 --> 02:24:49.330
<v Speaker 4>experimentation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3007
02:24:49.331 --> 02:24:51.590
<v Speaker 4>you bring in different perspectives at </v>
<v Speaker 4>different person,</v>

3008
02:24:51.740 --> 02:24:53.770
<v Speaker 4>hey this is interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this has potential,</v>

3009
02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:56.630
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't really have much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you start changing things up.</v>

3010
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:58.423
<v Speaker 2>Now do you have that same approach with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the fighters that you've worked </v>

3011
02:25:01.731 --> 02:25:03.470
<v Speaker 2>with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the context.</v>

3012
02:25:03.471 --> 02:25:04.304
<v Speaker 2>How they mixed martial artists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they train with me full time part </v>

3013
02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:08.090
<v Speaker 2>timers?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would depend on the context.</v>

3014
02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I can answer with regards to the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3015
02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:10.851
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm,</v>

3016
02:25:10.851 --> 02:25:14.540
<v Speaker 2>what I was going to bring up is Weidman </v>
<v Speaker 2>Weidman's approach.</v>

3017
02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3018
02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:16.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from that elite wrestling </v>

3019
02:25:17.451 --> 02:25:19.640
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then developing a lot of,</v>

3020
02:25:19.641 --> 02:25:20.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant,</v>

3021
02:25:20.970 --> 02:25:22.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts skills.</v>

3022
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3023
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:25.030
<v Speaker 4>is in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3024
02:25:25.031 --> 02:25:26.840
<v Speaker 4>an unusual situation right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3025
02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:28.023
<v Speaker 4>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where does he stand in terms of like </v>

3026
02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:31.420
<v Speaker 4>future opponents?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where's he at right now?</v>

3027
02:25:32.170 --> 02:25:33.640
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3028
02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:36.820
<v Speaker 4>that's a tough question to us to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3029
02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:38.073
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris I think had probably one of the </v>

3030
02:25:40.571 --> 02:25:44.950
<v Speaker 4>most meteoric rises into will change </v>
<v Speaker 4>chip level.</v>

3031
02:25:44.951 --> 02:25:49.951
<v Speaker 4>He literally beat twice in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy that at that time was considered</v>

3032
02:25:49.961 --> 02:25:51.790
<v Speaker 4>by most people to be the greatest of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3033
02:25:52.420 --> 02:25:53.253
<v Speaker 4>His run up to that was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've commentated many of </v>

3034
02:25:56.801 --> 02:25:59.410
<v Speaker 4>those funds until this kid who an </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal,</v>

3035
02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:00.273
<v Speaker 4>that the timeframe with which she went </v>
<v Speaker 4>from obscurity to world championship </v>

3036
02:26:03.850 --> 02:26:06.220
<v Speaker 4>level is incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should undefeated,</v>

3037
02:26:07.150 --> 02:26:09.910
<v Speaker 4>is insane what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3038
02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:12.610
<v Speaker 4>so there was this incredible meteoric </v>
<v Speaker 4>rise.</v>

3039
02:26:12.611 --> 02:26:13.444
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a short period after that where he </v>

3040
02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:16.473
<v Speaker 4>appeared to be crushing great former </v>
<v Speaker 4>champions and the outer machito Vito </v>

3041
02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:20.080
<v Speaker 4>Belfort.</v>

3042
02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:21.960
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just beating them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says smashing it.</v>

3043
02:26:21.961 --> 02:26:23.530
<v Speaker 4>And that makes it an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>impressive.</v>

3044
02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:25.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3045
02:26:25.631 --> 02:26:26.464
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I think people were shocked by </v>

3046
02:26:28.690 --> 02:26:29.523
<v Speaker 4>what appeared to be an unbeaten record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then suddenly three losses in a row </v>

3047
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:36.880
<v Speaker 4>and catastrophic iasis that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting smashed by Luke rockhold getting</v>

3048
02:26:36.881 --> 02:26:37.714
<v Speaker 4>kod by a flying knee from Yoel Merrill </v>
<v Speaker 4>and getting dominated by gay guard </v>

3049
02:26:41.401 --> 02:26:43.240
<v Speaker 4>saucy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all the controversy that it led</v>

3050
02:26:43.241 --> 02:26:44.830
<v Speaker 4>to that stoppage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was,</v>

3051
02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:49.920
<v Speaker 4>it was three in a row that on a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>never even experienced defeat.</v>

3052
02:26:50.490 --> 02:26:51.323
<v Speaker 4>And so you go from no defeats to three </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic defeats in a row that </v>

3053
02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:56.590
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that throws everything off.</v>

3054
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:58.023
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then he rebounded with even gas </v>

3055
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:03.530
<v Speaker 4>finished one of the toughest guys in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>division and he's not an easy know.</v>

3056
02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:06.220
<v Speaker 4>You saw what guested on went on to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with yes.</v>

3057
02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:08.290
<v Speaker 4>Bisbing bisbing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

3058
02:27:08.370 --> 02:27:09.160
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

3059
02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:10.740
<v Speaker 4>that was a great one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a nice come back.</v>

3060
02:27:10.750 --> 02:27:12.160
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the question is,</v>

3061
02:27:12.161 --> 02:27:13.930
<v Speaker 4>where does it go from here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3062
02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:16.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't have an answer for you.</v>

3063
02:27:16.031 --> 02:27:18.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How often do you work with them on,</v>

3064
02:27:18.500 --> 02:27:19.450
<v Speaker 4>not often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris.</v>

3065
02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:22.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris came to me as a student.</v>

3066
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:23.950
<v Speaker 4>He was a student of met Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>

3067
02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:27.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my great friends and a,</v>

3068
02:27:27.310 --> 02:27:29.920
<v Speaker 4>a training partners from the Henzel </v>
<v Speaker 4>Gracie Academy.</v>

3069
02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:34.540
<v Speaker 4>And Matt was having some medical issues </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>

3070
02:27:34.541 --> 02:27:35.374
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3071
02:27:35.470 --> 02:27:38.440
<v Speaker 4>can you take over this student of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Weidman,</v>

3072
02:27:38.441 --> 02:27:41.110
<v Speaker 4>this guy is incredibly talented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd heard of Chris because you know,</v>

3073
02:27:41.111 --> 02:27:42.440
<v Speaker 4>we're linked schools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3074
02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:45.130
<v Speaker 4>fairly close by and people were telling </v>
<v Speaker 4>me about this amazing wrestlers,</v>

3075
02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:47.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3076
02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:50.530
<v Speaker 4>incredibly talented picks techniques up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

3077
02:27:50.531 --> 02:27:51.364
<v Speaker 4>I always take these things with a grain </v>
<v Speaker 4>of salt because people exaggerate and </v>

3078
02:27:53.171 --> 02:27:54.004
<v Speaker 4>stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Chris started coming in and it was </v>

3079
02:27:56.111 --> 02:27:56.920
<v Speaker 4>all true.</v>

3080
02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:57.753
<v Speaker 4>This kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can show him a teeny on Monday and </v>

3081
02:27:58.991 --> 02:28:00.490
<v Speaker 4>by Tuesday is doing a better than you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

3082
02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:04.600
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has a gift for physical movement that</v>

3083
02:28:04.930 --> 02:28:07.480
<v Speaker 4>you don't see very often and guys that </v>
<v Speaker 4>big,</v>

3084
02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:11.230
<v Speaker 4>he's big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agile,</v>

3085
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:12.423
<v Speaker 4>highly intelligent and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and had at that time a level of self </v>

3086
02:28:20.201 --> 02:28:21.034
<v Speaker 4>confidence that was deeply impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would show Chris a guillotine </v>

3087
02:28:25.461 --> 02:28:26.294
<v Speaker 4>variation and then five minutes later he</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be using it in the gym and then a </v>

3088
02:28:30.690 --> 02:28:33.560
<v Speaker 4>month later to be using it in an MMA </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

3089
02:28:34.030 --> 02:28:39.030
<v Speaker 4>I guess he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he literally would see opportunities and</v>

3090
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:44.110
<v Speaker 4>immediately act upon them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I worry about with Chris is that in</v>

3091
02:28:44.391 --> 02:28:49.391
<v Speaker 4>those three losses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>W I'm not saying this has happened,</v>

3092
02:28:49.581 --> 02:28:54.581
<v Speaker 4>but what I worry will happen is it </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters who are typically very dominant</v>

3093
02:28:54.770 --> 02:28:59.770
<v Speaker 4>and what confidence fighters when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced a feet lose confidence and a</v>

3094
02:29:00.261 --> 02:29:01.094
<v Speaker 4>big pot of croesus success was that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to see opportunity and have the </v>

3095
02:29:04.191 --> 02:29:05.930
<v Speaker 4>confidence to immediately act upon it.</v>

3096
02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so my concern if I,</v>

3097
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:11.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I,</v>

3098
02:29:11.571 --> 02:29:12.404
<v Speaker 4>if I look at Chris's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will that still be there when he still </v>

3099
02:29:14.121 --> 02:29:17.210
<v Speaker 4>had the same conference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was such a big part of his rise to</v>

3100
02:29:17.211 --> 02:29:18.044
<v Speaker 4>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will it be drastically altered by three </v>

3101
02:29:20.061 --> 02:29:21.260
<v Speaker 4>losses?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm,</v>

3102
02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:22.213
<v Speaker 4>I'm very pleased to say that it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>appear to be so in the fight with </v>

3103
02:29:25.281 --> 02:29:25.820
<v Speaker 4>guests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Willem,</v>

3104
02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:26.690
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3105
02:29:26.691 --> 02:29:27.524
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he actually took a heavy hit at the end </v>

3106
02:29:28.521 --> 02:29:30.860
<v Speaker 4>of the first round in that fight and </v>
<v Speaker 4>came back at eat.</v>

3107
02:29:30.890 --> 02:29:32.900
<v Speaker 4>It looked like he had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd gone through those,</v>

3108
02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:33.793
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3109
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:34.783
<v Speaker 4>those three losses and come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come back strong and everything was </v>

3110
02:29:36.861 --> 02:29:38.720
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm pretty confident.</v>

3111
02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris,</v>

3112

<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

3113
02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:43.593
<v Speaker 3>knowing how good Chris is on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How shocked were you about the Luke </v>

3114
02:29:47.921 --> 02:29:48.754
<v Speaker 3>rockhold fight?</v>

3115
02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:50.940
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a hard one for me to watch.</v>

3116
02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.260
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3117
02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:56.850
<v Speaker 4>Chris stopped working with me after this</v>
<v Speaker 4>second Anderson Silva fight.</v>

3118
02:29:56.910 --> 02:29:59.190
<v Speaker 4>We did most of that came together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

3119
02:29:59.230 --> 02:30:00.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he stopped working,</v>

<v Speaker 4>island.</v>

3122
02:30:03.601 --> 02:30:06.600

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3123
02:30:06.601 --> 02:30:09.320
<v Speaker 4>went back to train with Matt Serra and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3125
02:30:11.131 --> 02:30:12.840
<v Speaker 4>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did a fine job getting them through</v>

3126
02:30:12.841 --> 02:30:13.950
<v Speaker 4>the machine to fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>

3127
02:30:13.951 --> 02:30:15.040
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3128
02:30:15.090 --> 02:30:17.030
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3129
02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:17.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3130
02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:19.930
<v Speaker 4>I was at that UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3131
02:30:20.250 --> 02:30:21.083
<v Speaker 4>it was in Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conor mcgregor was the main event and </v>

3132
02:30:24.210 --> 02:30:25.370
<v Speaker 4>Chris was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3133
02:30:25.410 --> 02:30:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Co main event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3134
02:30:27.510 --> 02:30:29.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3135
02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:32.070
<v Speaker 4>the fight had interesting beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3136
02:30:32.100 --> 02:30:33.660
<v Speaker 4>Chris was doing well with the take </v>
<v Speaker 4>downs,</v>

3137
02:30:33.661 --> 02:30:34.494
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3138
02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:35.773
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>luke rockhold was doing a great job of </v>

3139
02:30:37.501 --> 02:30:38.334
<v Speaker 4>controlling Chris's head with like fake </v>
<v Speaker 4>guillotines to prevent any kind of </v>

3140
02:30:41.551 --> 02:30:44.010
<v Speaker 4>damage on the ground and doing a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>job of standing back up to the feet.</v>

3141
02:30:44.011 --> 02:30:45.750
<v Speaker 4>So there was no really significant </v>
<v Speaker 4>damage.</v>

3142
02:30:46.310 --> 02:30:47.143
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they got into an interesting </v>

3143
02:30:47.821 --> 02:30:50.340
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing battle where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3144
02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:51.293
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3145
02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:52.313
<v Speaker 4>it seems to go in one direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then switched directions and increased </v>

3146
02:30:54.421 --> 02:30:56.430
<v Speaker 4>seem to be getting the better of it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>things look good.</v>

3147
02:30:56.730 --> 02:30:57.563
<v Speaker 4>And then there was just one episode </v>
<v Speaker 4>where everything just came unstuck in a </v>

3148
02:31:01.921 --> 02:31:04.980
<v Speaker 4>second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember watching and it's like,</v>

3149
02:31:04.981 --> 02:31:07.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like watching a bad dream,</v>

3150
02:31:07.231 --> 02:31:08.064
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

3151
02:31:08.700 --> 02:31:09.421
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3152
02:31:09.421 --> 02:31:10.254
<v Speaker 4>it was shocking.</v>

3153
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:11.171
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>

3154
02:31:11.171 --> 02:31:13.690
<v Speaker 3>through an ill advised wheel keck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3155
02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Which is slow and telegraph and rockhold</v>
<v Speaker 3>took him to the ground.</v>

3156
02:31:18.221 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 3>And what I was most shocked with</v>

3157
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.170
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen it time and time again,</v>

3158
02:31:22.171 --> 02:31:23.004
<v Speaker 2>I saw it in the David Branch fight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sought in Leo Machida fight is rockhold </v>

3159
02:31:26.850 --> 02:31:29.020
<v Speaker 2>top game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's be fucking terrifying.</v>

3160
02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Pretty impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very impressive.</v>

3161
02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I attribute that,</v>

3162
02:31:33.570 --> 02:31:35.850
<v Speaker 2>not just his skill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is considerable,</v>

3163
02:31:35.851 --> 02:31:40.380
<v Speaker 2>but also to training on a regular basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Daniel Carmia and Cain Velasquez is</v>

3164
02:31:40.381 --> 02:31:42.480
<v Speaker 2>just his wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his grappling,</v>

3165
02:31:42.810 --> 02:31:46.260
<v Speaker 2>it severely underrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not so now,</v>

3166
02:31:46.410 --> 02:31:48.750
<v Speaker 2>but his ability to control guys on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

3167
02:31:48.751 --> 02:31:52.350
<v Speaker 2>It's just terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generate an amazing job,</v>

3168
02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got very strong submission skills.</v>

3169
02:31:54.570 --> 02:31:55.403
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People I didn't think talk about those </v>

3170
02:31:58.141 --> 02:31:59.280
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3171
02:31:59.550 --> 02:32:02.550
<v Speaker 2>he submitted a good people and he's hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>summit at Biscayne without one arm.</v>

3172
02:32:02.551 --> 02:32:03.384
<v Speaker 2>Good team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly some of his finishes like </v>

3173
02:32:04.861 --> 02:32:06.860
<v Speaker 2>highlight reel finishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

3174
02:32:07.370 --> 02:32:07.981
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3175
02:32:07.981 --> 02:32:11.100
<v Speaker 2>he's got tremendous skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3176
02:32:11.101 --> 02:32:13.200
<v Speaker 2>he's big for the division.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3177
02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:15.330
<v Speaker 2>he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk about a guy who,</v>

3178
02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:16.373
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dominique's that pace and dominates the </v>

3179
02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:21.750
<v Speaker 2>direction he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one can hold them down for any period</v>

3180
02:32:21.751 --> 02:32:23.370
<v Speaker 2>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is great at getting makeup to his feet.</v>

3181
02:32:23.370 --> 02:32:24.900
<v Speaker 2>He wrestles the fence very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well.</v>

3182
02:32:24.901 --> 02:32:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Like all the Aka guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good on the fence.</v>

3183
02:32:27.690 --> 02:32:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

3184
02:32:29.101 --> 02:32:30.510
<v Speaker 2>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very impressive fighter.</v>

3185
02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm impressed with him and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

3186
02:32:32.671 --> 02:32:35.550
<v Speaker 2>but his ability to control top level </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

3187
02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:37.013
<v Speaker 2>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my thought was when he got Chris down </v>

3188
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:40.261
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3189
02:32:40.261 --> 02:32:43.800
<v Speaker 2>Chris is a worldclass grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be able to get out of this</v>

3190
02:32:43.801 --> 02:32:45.230
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be scrambles to,</v>

3191
02:32:45.231 --> 02:32:46.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was none of that.</v>

3192
02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:51.400
<v Speaker 2>It was just total control and ground and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pound for a considerable period of time.</v>

3193
02:32:51.410 --> 02:32:52.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was rough.</v>

3194
02:32:52.290 --> 02:32:55.770
<v Speaker 2>It was rough to watch because it was one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those where you could easily make the</v>

3195
02:32:55.771 --> 02:32:57.570
<v Speaker 2>argument for it had been stopped sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3196
02:32:57.571 --> 02:32:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3197
02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:00.360
<v Speaker 2>it was a rough one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3198
02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:03.060
<v Speaker 2>and now rockwell is going to face Yoel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Romero,</v>

3199
02:33:03.180 --> 02:33:05.580
<v Speaker 2>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the freaking ball freaks.</v>

3200
02:33:06.060 --> 02:33:08.330
<v Speaker 2>That's like that guy was made in a lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3201
02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Isn't Yoel Romero with fighting dated </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brunch?</v>

3202
02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:12.930
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did this happen recently?</v>

3203
02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3204
02:33:14.330 --> 02:33:16.260
<v Speaker 2>I've been at Robert Whitaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got injured.</v>

3205
02:33:17.010 --> 02:33:18.120
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The knee again,</v>

3206
02:33:18.240 --> 02:33:21.240
<v Speaker 2>most likely if I had a gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they released it,</v>

3207
02:33:21.570 --> 02:33:23.760
<v Speaker 2>but there's been an injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a different entry,</v>

3208
02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:25.710
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did this happen?</v>

3209

3215
02:33:39.781 --> 02:33:42.540

3220
02:33:49.970 --> 02:33:51.750

<v Speaker 2>that's a different vibe.</v>

3221
02:33:53.370 --> 02:33:54.203
<v Speaker 2>Yoel Romero is probably the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncontrollable man in the universe is a </v>

3222
02:33:58.981 --> 02:33:59.814
<v Speaker 2>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult posting to control in any </v>

3223
02:34:01.321 --> 02:34:02.154
<v Speaker 2>aspect of the fight.</v>

3224
02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:06.120
<v Speaker 2>He's a fight is some parts of what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does make no sense.</v>

3225
02:34:06.170 --> 02:34:07.003
<v Speaker 2>Like he's one of the greatest grace </v>
<v Speaker 2>lists of his generation and many people </v>

3226
02:34:09.451 --> 02:34:10.590
<v Speaker 2>take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3227
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:11.543
<v Speaker 2>It gets taken down all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they kind of control and he just </v>

3228
02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:15.870
<v Speaker 2>springs back up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not worried about being taken down.</v>

3229
02:34:15.871 --> 02:34:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3230
02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Cause he comes so hard with the upper </v>
<v Speaker 2>body leaves the lower body open and um,</v>

3231
02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:22.600
<v Speaker 2>and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no consequence to it.</v>

3232
02:34:22.601 --> 02:34:24.080
<v Speaker 2>He can just get up whenever he feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

3233
02:34:24.490 --> 02:34:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3234
02:34:26.510 --> 02:34:27.343
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a greater propensity to change </v>

3235
02:34:31.121 --> 02:34:34.780
<v Speaker 2>direction at speed than anyone else who </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have seen in my life.</v>

3236
02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People always talk about speed.</v>

3237
02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:37.540
<v Speaker 2>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3238
02:34:37.540 --> 02:34:39.370
<v Speaker 2>this guy's font.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that guy's spas to me,</v>

3239
02:34:39.371 --> 02:34:41.560
<v Speaker 2>the only kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two kinds of speed,</v>

3240
02:34:41.810 --> 02:34:43.720
<v Speaker 2>they don't impress me in fighting.</v>

3241
02:34:44.050 --> 02:34:47.020
<v Speaker 2>One is the speed of decision making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3242
02:34:47.021 --> 02:34:47.854
<v Speaker 2>If you can make decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good decisions faster than your </v>

3243
02:34:49.751 --> 02:34:51.010
<v Speaker 2>opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta win a lot of fights.</v>

3244
02:34:51.700 --> 02:34:56.700
<v Speaker 2>And the other is your ability not to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>and straight lines at speed.</v>

3245
02:34:57.100 --> 02:34:57.933
<v Speaker 2>But to change direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speed of directional change is the most </v>

3246
02:35:02.261 --> 02:35:03.094
<v Speaker 2>important kind of physical speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fighting I'll get is plenty of </v>

3247
02:35:06.131 --> 02:35:10.060
<v Speaker 2>people that weren't really that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can change direction quickly.</v>

3248
02:35:10.300 --> 02:35:12.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's the kind of speed that counts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fighting.</v>

3249
02:35:13.330 --> 02:35:14.163
<v Speaker 2>So the two kinds of speed that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to be to be a fighter was speed </v>

3250
02:35:16.241 --> 02:35:20.530
<v Speaker 2>of decision making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a speed of directional change.</v>

3251
02:35:20.770 --> 02:35:24.130
<v Speaker 2>And you see lots of fast people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a Hussein bolt is fast,</v>

3252
02:35:24.310 --> 02:35:26.140
<v Speaker 2>but he's not fast and directional </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

3253
02:35:26.141 --> 02:35:28.780
<v Speaker 2>It's not his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that Yoel Romero is,</v>

3254
02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:30.003
<v Speaker 2>there's this certain twitchiness to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement where it's so hard to read </v>

3255
02:35:33.101 --> 02:35:33.934
<v Speaker 2>where he's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's going to be in the next half </v>

3256
02:35:35.411 --> 02:35:35.800
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

3257
02:35:35.800 --> 02:35:38.990
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a handful to deal with that.</v>

3258
02:35:38.991 --> 02:35:42.190
<v Speaker 2>That is a very good assessment of what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's shocking about him,</v>

3259
02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:45.910
<v Speaker 2>his ability to go from zero to 60 insist</v>
<v Speaker 2>freakish shin.</v>

3260
02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:48.260
<v Speaker 2>This is him at 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3261
02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:50.433
<v Speaker 2>What was he like when he was 25?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't look like a 40 year old </v>

3262
02:35:53.231 --> 02:35:55.680
<v Speaker 2>man and just everything is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3263
02:35:55.720 --> 02:35:58.720
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look like a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at his body,</v>

3264
02:35:58.721 --> 02:35:59.554
<v Speaker 2>his proportions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything looks like something from a </v>

3265
02:36:02.291 --> 02:36:03.320
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3266
02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:04.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3267
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:07.270
<v Speaker 2>And that flying knee that he hit Chris </v>
<v Speaker 2>with was like,</v>

3268
02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:10.450
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's Christ and now he could feel it.</v>

3269
02:36:10.451 --> 02:36:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3270
02:36:11.470 --> 02:36:12.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3271
02:36:12.341 --> 02:36:13.174
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible.</v>

3272
02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:16.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of force that he can generate</v>

3273
02:36:16.451 --> 02:36:17.284
<v Speaker 2>is just stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's also a guy that's carrying </v>

3274
02:36:19.781 --> 02:36:20.614
<v Speaker 2>around a tremendous amount of muscle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what kind of pace he can keep </v>

3275
02:36:23.981 --> 02:36:24.700
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

3276
02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:26.500
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we saw that in the whitaker fight,</v>

3277
02:36:26.530 --> 02:36:29.470
<v Speaker 2>you faded a bit and that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of losing that fight,</v>

3278
02:36:29.471 --> 02:36:31.450
<v Speaker 2>and we've seen it in several,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was fights.</v>

3279
02:36:31.451 --> 02:36:32.284
<v Speaker 2>The Tim Kennedy fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you faded in that fight and eventually </v>

3280
02:36:34.570 --> 02:36:38.920
<v Speaker 2>came back to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's got so much to feed.</v>

3281
02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:41.260
<v Speaker 2>There's so much tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3282
02:36:41.350 --> 02:36:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3283
02:36:42.250 --> 02:36:43.083
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fascinating character and </v>

3284
02:36:43.561 --> 02:36:45.340
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

3285
02:36:45.370 --> 02:36:49.250
<v Speaker 2>boy wouldn't you have loved to seen him </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the UFC at 26 yeah,</v>

3286
02:36:49.570 --> 02:36:51.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean when he was just dominating </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>

3287
02:36:51.740 --> 02:36:52.573
<v Speaker 2>the wrestling scene and he says he's as </v>
<v Speaker 2>good as I get in Raceland metaled into </v>

3288
02:36:55.811 --> 02:36:58.810
<v Speaker 2>every single world class competition he </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever answered.</v>

3289
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.943
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the best wrestlers in his weight </v>

3290
02:37:03.101 --> 02:37:07.870
<v Speaker 2>division of that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He beat all of them like crazy.</v>

3291
02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:11.170
<v Speaker 2>It's as good as he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hard to imagine.</v>

3292
02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think we've covered</v>

3294
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.040

<v Speaker 3>we're three hours in here,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of friends share them.</v>

3301
02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:34.400
<v Speaker 3>They didn't send them to me in text </v>
<v Speaker 3>messages.</v>

3302
02:37:34.401 --> 02:37:35.234
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally you are breakdowns of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique and strategy and what is </v>

3303
02:37:39.951 --> 02:37:41.630
<v Speaker 3>actually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're critical.</v>
