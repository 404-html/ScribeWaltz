<v Speaker 2>you are defying science and doctors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>David telling you it was over.</v>

18
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Tell everybody the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put this,</v>

19
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>bring this sucker up here at a story </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

20
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.903
<v Speaker 1>I was out one night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy of mine was having trouble and </v>

21
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.670
<v Speaker 1>needed somebody to go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>

22
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.933
<v Speaker 1>was around the city that night and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after taking him home we were leaving </v>

24
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has it split off?</v>

25
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I was coming around was like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a bike.</v>

26
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a passenger.</v>

27
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.123
<v Speaker 1>So what was called eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>26 is the highway as the splits off to </v>

28
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>95.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going around eight,</v>

29
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>26.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the tricky part.</v>

30
00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't really remember what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>from there.</v>

31
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.603
<v Speaker 1>So the men and the passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember we were hit from either the </v>

32
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>side or from the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>but coming around the bend boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming around,</v>

34
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>got pushed into the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll wake up under the,</v>

35
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>a guard rail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't move,</v>

36
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody else is there and the car is </v>

37
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:35.154
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

38
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 1>There was not really a witness there </v>
<v Speaker 1>until like later pulling up behind us.</v>

39
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>So it fucked me up for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fuck me up right now.</v>

40
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:43.764
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting back to just what it is,</v>

42
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:48.070
<v Speaker 1>the body's healing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

43
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 1>So what was the extent of your injuries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

44
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:51.924
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>in my c four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five and six,</v>

47
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.373
<v Speaker 1>I had contusions on my spinal cord and </v>
<v Speaker 1>half a mile on the left side of my </v>

48
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.323
<v Speaker 1>spinal quarter was a pressure so bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it shut down my whole nervous </v>

49
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all my body.</v>

50
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.773
<v Speaker 1>So a mix up in my neck and then my </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of my back was just compressed a </v>

51
00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>lot of the swelling and that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>caused a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.403
<v Speaker 1>not being able to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not being able to feel the nervous </v>

54
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never system that I have or the nervous,</v>

55
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues that I had.</v>

56
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>So what did they do to fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been rehabbing a,</v>

57
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to do surgery right away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how many months ago was this?</v>

58
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>This was in December.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was September 17th.</v>

59
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to do or they wanted to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery immediately.</v>

61
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm trying to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

62
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:44.784
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

63
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to fight again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

64
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

65
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.040
<v Speaker 1>What kind of surgery?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fusion.</v>

66
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what they wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to go in and take the,</v>

67
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.923
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say the three to the five or </v>

68
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>four to six or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuse that altogether,</v>

69
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>which obviously there's no rain that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a big spot.</v>

70
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>So a wasn't trying to have that looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up for.</v>

71
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.130
<v Speaker 1>We looked for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.093
<v Speaker 1>a couple of rehab places and eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>got hooked up with a place called a </v>

73
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.280
<v Speaker 1>neural fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three 60.</v>

74
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.493
<v Speaker 1>So I've been rehabbing there since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident and I mean it's weird in </v>

75
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.360

78
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been giving me back in the game.</v>

79
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.803
<v Speaker 1>I've been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing that extensively every day </v>

80
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.390

<v Speaker 1>two hour or couple of hours a day,</v>

81
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two to three times a day.</v>

82
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>What kind of shit that they do for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck?</v>

83
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for more.</v>

84
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first we had to start with um,</v>

85
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I had problems with my sensitivities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you wake up onto the guard rail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.833
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't remember what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you wake up in the hospital where </v>

91
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>they're telling you for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got all of this stuff.</v>

92
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:57.200
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

93
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you feel,</v>

94
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>could you like how were you when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up for me?</v>

95
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I woke up,</v>

96
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>So back to the store when I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I woke up,</v>

98
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.810
<v Speaker 1>so I woke up and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I had my helmet on but I couldn't move </v>
<v Speaker 1>my legs.</v>

100
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.153
<v Speaker 1>My passenger had one over top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had her hands so she wasn't like </v>

101
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>extremely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had went out to.</v>

102
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:26.010
<v Speaker 1>So I couldn't really feel nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nothing.</v>

103
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I was just telling him to get my helmet </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and get my helmet off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Finally had a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had pulled up and seen that we were in </v>

112
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>being able to feel nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to wipe my face or trying to grab</v>

113
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>something and you just couldn't move my </v>

<v Speaker 1>anytime soon.</v>

125
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.290

<v Speaker 1>I really want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to do it in the hospital </v>

139
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:56.780
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You never gonna walk again.</v>

142
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to go back to them right now</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

145
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.014
<v Speaker 1>And it's been like that majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in my career where I've done </v>

146
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's happening.</v>

147

<v Speaker 1>It's just insane.</v>

152
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.463
<v Speaker 1>It just makes me sick that they always </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to cut you immediately when it </v>

153
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:22.364
<v Speaker 1>comes to any kind of bulging disc issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to get in there and it's </v>

154
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:28.990
<v Speaker 1>hurtful to us because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I understand they got a job to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do your job.</v>

156
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>one method of surgery.</v>

158
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

159
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

160

<v Speaker 1>six d,</v>

161
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:46.220

<v Speaker 1>down there in pembroke pines.</v>

162
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:52.100

164
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 1>which is small exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

165
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I started with fine motor stuff where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to work on a lot of balance stuff,</v>

166
00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

167
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.120
<v Speaker 1>you ever fuck with that iron neck thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever used that thing yet?</v>

168
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have not used out here.</v>

169
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying if you want to mess around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and he's fantastic.</v>

170
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you are six months out now.</v>

171
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Six months out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you start walking again?</v>

172
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.993
<v Speaker 1>It took me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even now I'm still like trying to get </v>

173
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 1>the form right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

174
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:26.400
<v Speaker 1>it took me about three months because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like read,</v>

175
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 1>learned how we learned how to tie her </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoe in my hand.</v>

176
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>My Motor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my hand wasn't moving his right.</v>

177
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.163
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't working as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just everything slowed down for me </v>

178
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>because of my spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So wow,</v>

179
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the most for me was the scariest</v>

180
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>part because I was everything so unsure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

181
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.810
<v Speaker 1>The most recent MRI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you get,</v>

182
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 1>have you gotten a gv one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About a month and a half ago.</v>

183
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And whenever you look good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks good.</v>

184
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 1>All the swelling went down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

185
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 1>the left side is clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way I can explain it,</v>

186
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:01.690
<v Speaker 1>there's two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two,</v>

187
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.370
<v Speaker 1>two months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white lines and it gets blocked.</v>

188
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the fluids coming down.</v>

189
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>My left side of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the fluid was being blocked.</v>

190
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm having a clear line of fluid </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down my spinal cord.</v>

191
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Now it's just about healing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

192
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working.</v>

193
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the part to get overcome the </v>
<v Speaker 1>healing part,</v>

194
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>the neurological part and the nerves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that part that goes with it.</v>

195
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:26.174
<v Speaker 1>It's the body that can only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not too much that I can do to </v>

196

<v Speaker 1>all the simple shit,</v>

198
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:37.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's the body that's telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's crazy that you're sparring.</v>

199
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of things.</v>

208
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:04.000
<v Speaker 1>to get me hurt or injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's had a lot of respect and love</v>

209
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.853
<v Speaker 1>seeing me back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've never been in a situation where </v>

210
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to go super hard.</v>

213
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.640

<v Speaker 2>pads,</v>

214
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 2>you feel like you have full strength?</v>

215
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

216
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.330
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that I'm,</v>

217
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.953
<v Speaker 1>that I'm excited about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a broken toward that is dying to be </v>

218
00:09:25.511 --> 00:09:26.470
<v Speaker 1>fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

219
00:09:26.471 --> 00:09:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm a brand new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I can be fixed in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm relearning everything.</v>

221
00:09:32.711 --> 00:09:33.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

222
00:09:33.401 --> 00:09:36.010
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I can't box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I can't wrestle,</v>

223
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's now just relearning the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 2>the mechanics of making your brain knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do it,</v>

225
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 2>but your body's got to relearn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly why?</v>

226
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:49.090
<v Speaker 4>And it's like the nerve,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nerve stuffs is on the right side of</v>

227
00:09:49.091 --> 00:09:49.880
<v Speaker 4>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

228
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.713
<v Speaker 4>It's like muscle memory coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even yesterday I was holding pads from </v>

229
00:09:52.811 --> 00:09:53.644
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his job was a little weak and like his </v>

230
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.940
<v Speaker 4>is a lifting of his foot or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing we're trying to do,</v>

231
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.840
<v Speaker 4>but once as we are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once he felt the right way to do it,</v>

232
00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:03.220
<v Speaker 4>then he could repeat it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

233
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.890
<v Speaker 4>So it was a lot to do with it</v>

234
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:07.770
<v Speaker 1>and is big for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've had a lot of,</v>

264
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it's stenosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinal stenosis for,</v>

265
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.560
<v Speaker 1>for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

266

<v Speaker 1>Source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do any decompression?</v>

267
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.763
<v Speaker 1>I do a little bit here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I can get to the chiropractors </v>

268
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:47.394
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing some or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I said it's been bad for </v>

269
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:50.620
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

270
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.453
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that thing that you hook </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to your neck and yet came from a </v>

271
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:54.334
<v Speaker 2>doorway</v>

272
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 5>stretch it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

273
00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:57.403
<v Speaker 6>I did that same thing with a rolled up </v>
<v Speaker 6>towel or bang from the doorway and it </v>

274
00:12:00.711 --> 00:12:03.650
<v Speaker 6>helps mind tremendously,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I got mine I'm sure from fighting,</v>

275
00:12:03.651 --> 00:12:08.651
<v Speaker 6>but then also like I'll lay on my back </v>
<v Speaker 6>at night for like two weeks.</v>

276
00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.380
<v Speaker 6>My neck will be all know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't it crazy?</v>

277
00:12:12.381 --> 00:12:13.214
<v Speaker 6>You're a professional fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You fuck up your back watching youtube </v>

278
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.270
<v Speaker 6>videos for sure.</v>

279
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.890
<v Speaker 5>But everyone's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

280
00:12:18.891 --> 00:12:21.700
<v Speaker 5>That's all we do is take the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>working.</v>

281
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 5>People's necks are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible</v>

282
00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.900
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

283
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>being in awareness that I have now for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like my neck and neck injuries,</v>

284
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.123
<v Speaker 1>just seeing a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like trying to posture up and just </v>

285
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 1>seeing shit because I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like this.</v>

286
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always hurting.</v>

287
00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:41.064
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been one thing after another four </v>

288
00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:45.750
<v Speaker 1>years and that's actually leading into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

289
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this accident with this injury,</v>

294
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.000
<v Speaker 5>34.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm at that age where you forget how old</v>

295
00:13:03.001 --> 00:13:03.950
<v Speaker 5>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

297
00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:12.120
<v Speaker 5>you're healthy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ability to recuperate from something</v>

298
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.240
<v Speaker 5>that's that devastating that quickly </v>
<v Speaker 5>shows what good of shape you're in.</v>

299
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.080
<v Speaker 5>That must have a big impact on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on your rehab process.</v>

300
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does,</v>

301
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.463
<v Speaker 5>it does mean a regular person that has </v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of injury probably is not </v>

302
00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:24.120
<v Speaker 5>going to bounce back like that.</v>

303
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:25.223
<v Speaker 1>Not as quickly and being like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being an athlete has helped me </v>

304
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:29.580
<v Speaker 1>tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

305
00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:33.090
<v Speaker 1>well my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean obviously as strong as it was,</v>

306
00:13:33.091 --> 00:13:33.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

307
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.140
<v Speaker 1>the damage would have been worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

308
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.490
<v Speaker 1>being able to bounce back was been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.950
<v Speaker 1>being young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to.</v>

310
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I put my body through so much that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

311
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compared to what has been through.</v>

312
00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:47.124
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being young definitely helped me and </v>

313
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.390
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

314
00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.750
<v Speaker 1>that time away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

315
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 5>so how will you know when you get back </v>
<v Speaker 5>in there?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Are you wrestling yet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>yanked on.</v>

321
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.450
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was nervous before.</v>

322
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.110
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

323
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.710

<v Speaker 1>getting my neck strong,</v>

324
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.290
<v Speaker 1>making sure I don't do the stupid moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing the caused the injury.</v>

00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

354
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.290
<v Speaker 5>the ideal for everybody would be bell </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

355
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.480
<v Speaker 5>It gets to the same state as the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The same level.</v>

356
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:28.520
<v Speaker 5>That would be ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would help.</v>

357
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.120
<v Speaker 5>Like if you see Gennady Golovkin </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting Canelo Alvarez,</v>

358
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:34.570
<v Speaker 5>you don't give a fuck if it's golden boy</v>
<v Speaker 5>versus Bob Arum.</v>

359
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.720
<v Speaker 5>Nobody that they want to see champions </v>
<v Speaker 5>go after it.</v>

360
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.670
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what everybody wants to see.</v>

361
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately that's what I would like to </v>
<v Speaker 5>see across the board.</v>

362
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I don't think it harms anybody.</v>

363
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 5>I think it helps everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Competition is definitely getting better</v>

364
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 5>for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's better for the athletes for sure.</v>

365
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.813
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the more money that gets thrown </v>

366
00:15:54.231 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 5>around and the more promoted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

367
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.100
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if a superstar emerges from beltour tour</v>

368
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 5>that's at the same level that Rhonda </v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

369
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:01.870
<v Speaker 5>or connor is or something like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be amazing.</v>

370
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.690
<v Speaker 5>That's great for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For everybody.</v>

371
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a possibility there too.</v>

372
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael Venom pages,</v>

373
00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.113
<v Speaker 5>he's getting a lot of mainstream press.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were paying attention to him now </v>

374
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:12.700
<v Speaker 5>because the other crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't matter.</v>

375
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.893
<v Speaker 5>We need more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought he actually retired from him </v>

376
00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.533
<v Speaker 5>in a box for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like retired from the a box to </v>

377
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:20.794
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>

378
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.863
<v Speaker 5>You know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude like that probably will retire and </v>

379
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:26.180
<v Speaker 5>unretired just for the press,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

380
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Speaker 5>just seems to be the thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot.</v>

381
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:31.790
<v Speaker 5>Speaking of retiring and retiring</v>

382
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.693
<v Speaker 6>Joe Shell and back to mma,</v>

<v Speaker 6>He thought he was going to jail.</v>

385
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.740
<v Speaker 6>He told me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>

386
00:16:40.741 --> 00:16:44.520
<v Speaker 6>I was convinced I was going to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was so paranoid.</v>

387

<v Speaker 6>That was such a cool event.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The event for people don't know what the</v>

<v Speaker 6>background fall.</v>

398
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.110
<v Speaker 6>It was like kind of press star studded </v>
<v Speaker 6>event.</v>

399
00:17:22.111 --> 00:17:22.944
<v Speaker 6>It was really fucking cool as it is by </v>
<v Speaker 6>far the coolest martial arts event I've </v>

400
00:17:25.921 --> 00:17:27.920
<v Speaker 6>ever been to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was the</v>

401
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.180
<v Speaker 5>shout out to that Dj man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He did like eight hours straight playing</v>

402
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:36.140
<v Speaker 5>the same song,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like only twice paid twice a month.</v>

403
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:37.210
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't really,</v>

404
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he had bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was it?</v>

405
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.183
<v Speaker 5>It's a weird connection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Marijuana with Jujitsu and it's always </v>

406
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 5>been there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And people that don't know,</v>

407
00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:49.060
<v Speaker 5>like people that don't smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I have to tell them that please.</v>

408
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.153
<v Speaker 5>Jeff Glover</v>

409
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:55.310
<v Speaker 7>and his opponent smoking weed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's hilarious.</v>

410
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:57.234
<v Speaker 7>Man is really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really fun and that they're doing that </v>

411
00:17:59.641 --> 00:18:00.474
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I like it was a real cool event and </v>

412
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.773
<v Speaker 7>it was real cool Jujitsu and we'd have </v>
<v Speaker 7>always been connected for as long as </v>

413
00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 7>I've been doing Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People smoked pot in the parking lot and</v>

414
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:15.171
<v Speaker 7>then went and enrolled.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's still do kickboxing apparently is</v>

415
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:16.404
<v Speaker 7>the same way you practice focus.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I always found that I'm not good at </v>

416
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:27.070
<v Speaker 7>learning when I'm high or maybe I get </v>
<v Speaker 7>too high and I can't learn like,</v>

417
00:18:27.071 --> 00:18:29.010
<v Speaker 7>like some Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>show me something and I'm not sure where</v>

418
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:29.791
<v Speaker 7>to put my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

419
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:30.624
<v Speaker 7>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Step over here would have put my right </v>

420
00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:33.000
<v Speaker 7>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>

421
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.280
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I find that a bit,</v>

422
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.010
<v Speaker 7>but when I'm rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I'm rolling high then it just,</v>

423
00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:39.260
<v Speaker 7>you just get into that zone and</v>

424
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.610
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they say like,</v>

425
00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:44.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take it,</v>

426
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.943
<v Speaker 1>when you study for a test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sucking on peppermint and then </v>

427
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.000
<v Speaker 1>the day of the test you take pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You suck on pepper.</v>

428
00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.140
<v Speaker 1>You supposed to help you remember?</v>

429
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

430
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 7>Like that's Kinda how it is</v>

431
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.023
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

432
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 1>with martial arts for me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm high as fuck and I'm kinda like</v>

433
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 1>just a programming into my deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>subconscious or whatever.</v>

434
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.363
<v Speaker 1>That's my thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you think smoking all the time </v>

435
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:09.570
<v Speaker 1>when you try and then smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not smoking when you perform,</v>

436
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 1>do you think that has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a positive or negative effect?</v>

437
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

438
00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.820
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't really.</v>

439
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.290
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well let me ask you this,</v>

440
00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:21.410

<v Speaker 7>not testing for weed,</v>

441
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:24.710
<v Speaker 7>you could fight high as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What would you do that smoke that day?</v>

442
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.413
<v Speaker 7>I wouldn't smoke probably 10 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 7>before a lot of shit going on in my </v>

443
00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:30.800
<v Speaker 7>head.</v>

444
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.430
<v Speaker 7>This is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But like,</v>

445

<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

448
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:45.080
<v Speaker 7>zig zagging a lot different when kicks </v>
<v Speaker 7>and punches are being thrown.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

492
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.320
<v Speaker 1>fighting a Karen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deborah Gideon.</v>

493
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.440
<v Speaker 1>So it was the biggest name I had fought </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it was like that.</v>

494
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.980

<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

495
00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I just was kind of overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't a Jujitsu.</v>

496
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know much about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to actually,</v>

497
00:21:39.411 --> 00:21:42.830
<v Speaker 1>the whole fight was weird because on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monday I separated.</v>

503
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.240
<v Speaker 5>Torn muscle.</v>

504

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

509
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 1>well we got it like bandaged up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to work in,</v>

510
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:10.360
<v Speaker 1>fought with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't fight,</v>

511
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:11.194
<v Speaker 1>would've been bandaged up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the next few days kind of build on </v>

512
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:16.570
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said worked on as much as I can.</v>

513
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Went out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

514
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.860
<v Speaker 1>it was in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought and uh,</v>

515
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just for me.</v>

516
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:23.560
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

517
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 1>one decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

518
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.580
<v Speaker 1>like I said at first round he had threw </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of like lego blocks.</v>

519
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a serious spookseekers leg lock.</v>

520
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.660
<v Speaker 5>That's what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

521
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.810
<v Speaker 5>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

522
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.530
<v Speaker 5>I just want to get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was,</v>

523
00:22:41.531 --> 00:22:44.640
<v Speaker 5>it was a bad thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one I'm done fighting,</v>

524
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:45.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

525
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever fought?</v>

526
00:22:47.481 --> 00:22:48.314
<v Speaker 5>Hi?</v>

527
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.490
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

528
00:22:50.491 --> 00:22:52.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure I've fought at spar high all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

529
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.503
<v Speaker 4>What's your feeling about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it like a for this Jujitsu </v>

530
00:23:00.871 --> 00:23:01.704
<v Speaker 4>tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

531
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu is not my strong suit obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so for me,</v>

532
00:23:04.621 --> 00:23:05.454
<v Speaker 4>that was my first Jiu Jitsu tournament </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we just put on the gay like about a </v>

533
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.900
<v Speaker 4>month ago when Matt told me about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things you should do it and Micky Gall I</v>

534
00:23:12.901 --> 00:23:16.470
<v Speaker 4>trained with everyday and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and Bomba and we like,</v>

535
00:23:16.471 --> 00:23:16.951
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

536
00:23:16.951 --> 00:23:18.830
<v Speaker 4>we'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we start putting on the g and the,</v>

537
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.750
<v Speaker 4>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to make a fool of myself.</v>

538
00:23:21.751 --> 00:23:23.730
<v Speaker 4>So being high and having that like </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure,</v>

539
00:23:23.731 --> 00:23:25.800
<v Speaker 4>like not being completely comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was different.</v>

540
00:23:25.801 --> 00:23:26.634
<v Speaker 4>But like in a kickboxing fight I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably be drunk and still be pretty </v>

541
00:23:29.971 --> 00:23:30.804
<v Speaker 4>comfortable with.</v>

542
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.273
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that think that </v>

543
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of them to think that marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 5>is a performance enhancing drug.</v>

544
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

545
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:42.940
<v Speaker 5>On a certain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On certain levels,</v>

546
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.380
<v Speaker 5>certain levels I think you can fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 5>up but.</v>

547
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.273
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>

548
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.233
<v Speaker 2>if you get the dose right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you puts you in a zone in a </v>

549
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 2>comfortable zone.</v>

550
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.903
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think a lot of them for </v>

551
00:23:52.691 --> 00:23:53.524
<v Speaker 4>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how well it's gonna increase your </v>

552
00:23:55.031 --> 00:23:58.130
<v Speaker 4>performance is not being super stressed </v>
<v Speaker 4>out over bullshit the week.</v>

553
00:23:58.131 --> 00:24:00.160
<v Speaker 4>And that's where I find the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefit.</v>

554
00:24:00.161 --> 00:24:03.910
<v Speaker 4>Like when I would quit smoking weed for </v>
<v Speaker 4>a couple of days before the fight,</v>

555
00:24:03.911 --> 00:24:05.920
<v Speaker 4>that was when it's like now is when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>need it the most.</v>

556
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:06.763
<v Speaker 4>That was when the most stressed out when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had the most anxiety that I have the </v>

557
00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.390
<v Speaker 4>hungriest they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

558
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.470
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sucks,</v>

559
00:24:11.471 --> 00:24:13.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in displays and just relax.</v>

560
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.633
<v Speaker 4>I think that helps.</v>

561
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.481
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you doing?</v>

562
00:24:15.481 --> 00:24:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Any cryo therapy or anything to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>swelling?</v>

563
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.790

<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

564
00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:21.410
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a little bit with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

565
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.780
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm drawing a blank,</v>

566
00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:28.030
<v Speaker 1>the chiropractor that I was going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't done much of it.</v>

567
00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:32.470
<v Speaker 1>But that's one thing I really wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get into because of the swelling a lot.</v>

568
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it,</v>

569

<v Speaker 2>That's where like it travels down and I </v>

594
00:25:46.251 --> 00:25:47.340
<v Speaker 2>rubbed that shit on before I go to</v>

<v Speaker 4>a medicated patches you can use to have </v>

596
00:25:51.851 --> 00:25:54.130
<v Speaker 4>roll ons that you could use evidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>solve stuff.</v>

597
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:55.323
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like I smoked so much weed </v>

598
00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.830
<v Speaker 4>with cbd in it all the time that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>

599
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.510
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem to work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't notice it,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

602
00:26:04.781 --> 00:26:07.630

<v Speaker 4>tolerance.</v>

603
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.530
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think of you.</v>

604
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:11.350
<v Speaker 4>If you smoke weed constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's cbd and everything.</v>

605
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.090
<v Speaker 4>You're hitting both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like when,</v>

606
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.720
<v Speaker 4>when my coach who's like 65 and never </v>
<v Speaker 4>smokes weed and I give him,</v>

607
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:17.830
<v Speaker 4>put that shit on him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

608
00:26:17.831 --> 00:26:19.580
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my elbow feels crazy.</v>

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll get you some of that Jambo Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better than anything I've ever used</v>

610

<v Speaker 2>milligram and I put that 2000 milligram </v>

612
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.830
<v Speaker 2>and it's got like a menthol in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you feel it in your skin,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like woo heats up.</v>

616
00:26:42.831 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>does the achiness goes</v>

617
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.390
<v Speaker 6>away,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but on my neck as well,</v>

00:30:55.511 --> 00:30:58.090
<v Speaker 7>And so they came in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you're on like a six fight,</v>

704
00:30:58.091 --> 00:31:00.430
<v Speaker 7>losing streak.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Crazy dropped two weight classes.</v>

705
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.740
<v Speaker 7>Anybody who says it's steroids doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>work as they're crazy fucking mind.</v>

706
00:31:05.741 --> 00:31:06.574
<v Speaker 7>They're not taking it for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're not going all the way down to </v>

707
00:31:10.151 --> 00:31:10.984
<v Speaker 7>Tijuana and buying this shit because </v>
<v Speaker 7>it's fun to get to do something on the </v>

708
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.023
<v Speaker 7>weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So do you feel like you got a new lease </v>

709
00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:17.764
<v Speaker 7>on life?</v>

710
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd do,</v>

711
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.980
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now I'm just grinding,</v>

712
00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.850
<v Speaker 1>like fully focused on getting back into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cage,</v>

713
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

714
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:29.603
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having what happened to me and being in </v>

715
00:31:31.711 --> 00:31:32.544
<v Speaker 1>a position that I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have too many things to </v>

716
00:31:34.411 --> 00:31:36.480
<v Speaker 1>go back to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

717
00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 1>having a new lease on life really isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>how I would say it is,</v>

718
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:44.640
<v Speaker 1>it's just what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just focused on the next step,</v>

719
00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.560
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next step in my career,</v>

720
00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.740
<v Speaker 1>the next step in the path and what I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been going through,</v>

721
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always just something for me.</v>

722
00:31:51.961 --> 00:31:54.690
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's a new lease of life,</v>

723
00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:56.280
<v Speaker 1>but just a new chapter.</v>

724
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.420
<v Speaker 7>But you must feel very fortunate that </v>
<v Speaker 7>you can recover from that.</v>

725
00:31:59.421 --> 00:32:00.254
<v Speaker 7>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do.</v>

726
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.110
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I love hearing that</v>

727
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:06.390
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just sucks.</v>

728
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.250
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sucks to be in this position,</v>

729
00:32:08.251 --> 00:32:08.840
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

730
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you,</v>

731
00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.990
<v Speaker 1>talking to this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around.</v>

732
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.660
<v Speaker 1>So I'm blessed more than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anything,</v>

733
00:32:15.661 --> 00:32:20.660
<v Speaker 1>but this is just fired me up to just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick on,</v>

735
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.183
<v Speaker 7>So you got to feel pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>unstoppable after I go fly into the air </v>

736
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.730
<v Speaker 7>slamming champion before this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you come back like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

738
00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:30.883

<v Speaker 5>Figure out a way to.</v>

750
00:32:54.781 --> 00:32:56.380
<v Speaker 5>If we put the steering wheel in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle,</v>

<v Speaker 5>strapped me in with a race harness and </v>

<v Speaker 5>put fucking airbags everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want this thing to be like an </v>

<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

820
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.840
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

821
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:10.610
<v Speaker 2>I guess just some people once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess fighting is a big part of it.</v>

822
00:36:10.611 --> 00:36:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Like once you've experienced the highs </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fighting,</v>

823
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.323
<v Speaker 2>I guess the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lows of regular life or just too </v>

824
00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:17.390
<v Speaker 2>fucking boring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is,</v>

825
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.313
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine.</v>

826
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:19.603
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you would get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely mammon thought about </v>

827
00:36:21.351 --> 00:36:22.184
<v Speaker 4>retiring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I stopped fighting I think </v>

828
00:36:24.171 --> 00:36:25.004
<v Speaker 4>that's what really bothered me because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm addicted to like not the adrenaline </v>

829
00:36:30.051 --> 00:36:33.230
<v Speaker 4>side of the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The challenge like the you can't do this</v>

830
00:36:33.231 --> 00:36:36.590
<v Speaker 4>like me versus the world like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That really gets me going.</v>

831
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.200
<v Speaker 4>I think if I didn't have that when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>older,</v>

832
00:36:39.201 --> 00:36:41.570
<v Speaker 4>I'd be pretty pissed off you versus the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

833
00:36:41.571 --> 00:36:43.250
<v Speaker 4>Like how so?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

834
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.610
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like even me versus a man versus man,</v>

835
00:36:46.611 --> 00:36:48.540
<v Speaker 4>like one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like no other.</v>

836
00:36:48.541 --> 00:36:50.360
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're the only one that you can,</v>

837
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:52.940
<v Speaker 4>you can count on in that scenario I </v>
<v Speaker 4>guess.</v>

838
00:36:52.941 --> 00:36:53.774
<v Speaker 4>But like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that personal challenge is what drives </v>

839
00:36:55.761 --> 00:36:59.780
<v Speaker 4>me and fuels me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I think in my career,</v>

840
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.480
<v Speaker 4>the fights that I wasn't supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>win,</v>

841
00:37:02.481 --> 00:37:05.110
<v Speaker 4>we're always the ones that I really </v>
<v Speaker 4>showed up for it because that Jen,</v>

842
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.460
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hit me where it was,</v>

843
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.440
<v Speaker 4>if I was supposed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to,</v>

844
00:37:09.441 --> 00:37:12.260
<v Speaker 4>when everyone thought I was going to win</v>
<v Speaker 4>for some on some level,</v>

845
00:37:12.261 --> 00:37:15.170
<v Speaker 4>I would not show up the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very common.</v>

846
00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:17.000
<v Speaker 2>That's very common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

847
00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:17.890
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

848
00:37:17.891 --> 00:37:19.130
<v Speaker 2>when they think it's going to be an easy</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

849
00:37:19.131 --> 00:37:20.120
<v Speaker 2>they can't get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

850
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:21.920
<v Speaker 2>They just have this weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's weird</v>

851
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.753
<v Speaker 4>because like you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your coaches won't let you not trained </v>

852
00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:27.250
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you train hard for the fight,</v>

853
00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.093
<v Speaker 4>you know that something about the thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your head doesn't click or it </v>

854
00:37:31.831 --> 00:37:32.430
<v Speaker 4>doesn't,</v>

855
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:35.850
<v Speaker 2>don't go after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

856
00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:36.693
<v Speaker 2>It's like the thing that everybody hates</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most about before a fight that </v>

857
00:37:39.731 --> 00:37:42.520
<v Speaker 2>discomfort and anxiety and just fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I doing this?</v>

858
00:37:42.521 --> 00:37:43.354
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what is your friend when you're </v>

859
00:37:45.011 --> 00:37:45.900
<v Speaker 2>in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

860
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the fights were guiding extent.</v>

861
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:49.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what fucking drowns you at the </v>

862
00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:51.234
<v Speaker 4>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it'd be people like fucking </v>

863
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.630
<v Speaker 4>their whole campus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>

864
00:37:54.631 --> 00:37:56.450
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as they walk out in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that crowd,</v>

865
00:37:56.451 --> 00:37:57.390
<v Speaker 4>it's like who the coach is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

866
00:37:57.391 --> 00:37:59.310
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck's going on?</v>

867
00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:03.370
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that that's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of person,</v>

868
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.280
<v Speaker 2>like a guy like you doesn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not,</v>

869
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.200
<v Speaker 2>that's not a thing that you experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

870
00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's the type of people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>crumble or usually like the guys who are</v>

871
00:38:13.571 --> 00:38:16.510
<v Speaker 2>just murderers in the gym and then for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason,</v>

872
00:38:16.511 --> 00:38:20.290
<v Speaker 2>under the bright lights they falter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they rarely rise.</v>

873
00:38:20.291 --> 00:38:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Like those guys rarely win the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights that they're not supposed to win.</v>

874
00:38:24.041 --> 00:38:24.874
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not the same psychological </v>

875
00:38:25.811 --> 00:38:29.140
<v Speaker 2>makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like something about the challenge or</v>

876
00:38:29.141 --> 00:38:32.860
<v Speaker 2>the unknown to some people it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelms them.</v>

877
00:38:32.861 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Whereas other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever their psychological is,</v>

878
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.710
<v Speaker 4>that challenge is what fires them up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets them excited.</v>

879
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:39.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

880
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

881
00:38:41.501 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 4>Consistency is the hard part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And longevity for fighters in general.</v>

882
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.003
<v Speaker 4>The curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what makes floyd mayweather so </v>

883
00:38:49.091 --> 00:38:53.140
<v Speaker 4>impressive to me is for him to be at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>top of the game for so long and can make</v>

884
00:38:53.141 --> 00:38:56.860
<v Speaker 4>all the money and continue to be at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>top of the game and still do that.</v>

885
00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean versus like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

886
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.280
<v Speaker 4>the guys that blow up and then Jon Jones</v>
<v Speaker 4>has trouble,</v>

887
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 4>they don't know how to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fame for him.</v>

888
00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Connor throwing shit through bus </v>
<v Speaker 4>windows.</v>

889
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:07.894
<v Speaker 4>Like it's hard to stay balanced and </v>
<v Speaker 4>consistent through that whole mental </v>

890
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.220
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

891
00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.830
<v Speaker 1>The biggest one of my biggest thing has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

892
00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mental part of fighting,</v>

893
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to the top,</v>

894
00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.260
<v Speaker 1>being pushed back down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to the top,</v>

895
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:20.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just dealing with that as a fighter has </v>

896
00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.960
<v Speaker 1>put a lot of stress on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

897
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:27.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time that I got into the cage,</v>

898
00:39:27.391 --> 00:39:30.570
<v Speaker 1>like had thought or how I acted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A performance.</v>

899
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>

900
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:33.660
<v Speaker 4>you did some work with vinny shoreman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

901
00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:34.890
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did that help?</v>

902
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:39.900
<v Speaker 4>A vinny helped me a lot for a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worked with him for I think three years,</v>

903
00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.393
<v Speaker 4>two or three years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I find that I'm tell everybody </v>

904
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:46.560
<v Speaker 4>beneath Germans a hypnotist whose been </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the show a couple times.</v>

905
00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.670
<v Speaker 4>Actually I was the one that had told you</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the bottom up on this phone.</v>

906
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:50.880
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone wants credit.</v>

907
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 4>I made you have any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

908
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.820
<v Speaker 4>he has me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a trip.</v>

909
00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:57.601
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

910
00:39:57.601 --> 00:39:59.610
<v Speaker 4>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really worked for me.</v>

911
00:39:59.611 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

912
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.083
<v Speaker 4>I find that as I've grown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think just like any technique you get </v>

913
00:40:05.371 --> 00:40:07.210
<v Speaker 4>better at it and has it needs time to </v>
<v Speaker 4>lay,</v>

914
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.420
<v Speaker 4>kinda resonate inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I feel,</v>

915
00:40:09.421 --> 00:40:11.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean I haven't worked with them in </v>
<v Speaker 4>over a year and a,</v>

916
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:13.103
<v Speaker 4>I still am figuring out like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh that was the fuck he was talking </v>

917
00:40:15.691 --> 00:40:16.524
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or like this is leanne starts to sink </v>

918
00:40:17.401 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's been,</v>

919
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:23.370
<v Speaker 4>the mental game is a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a huge asset.</v>

920
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.533
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever work with a sports </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychologist or a hypnotist or anything </v>

921
00:40:26.641 --> 00:40:27.270
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

922
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've worked a little bit with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy named will back in Florida.</v>

923
00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:31.094
<v Speaker 1>This was some years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something I've always wanted to </v>

924
00:40:33.411 --> 00:40:35.120
<v Speaker 1>dabble in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something I've wanted to explore.</v>

925
00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I haven't really got a chance to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of things,</v>

926
00:40:37.491 --> 00:40:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's one thing I've always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

927
00:40:39.981 --> 00:40:44.300
<v Speaker 1>the mental part is been key to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've always wanted to do</v>

928
00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:47.650
<v Speaker 4>it might be a good thing to help you </v>
<v Speaker 4>during your recovery too,</v>

929
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:48.873
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to just really concentrate on recovery </v>

930
00:40:50.931 --> 00:40:53.050
<v Speaker 4>and really concentrate on the parts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your body that need</v>

931
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:58.130
<v Speaker 1>be fixed and you need to reach out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right people to get the right,</v>

932
00:41:00.811 --> 00:41:01.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

933
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.970
<v Speaker 1>help as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.160
<v Speaker 2>My whole body felt weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like pretending to be sober.</v>

1050
00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.960
<v Speaker 2>I was walking around and pretend to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sober,</v>

1051
00:46:25.961 --> 00:46:28.750
<v Speaker 2>but not like a drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1052
00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:29.613
<v Speaker 2>not like reaction time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like almost knocked something off the </v>

1053
00:46:31.901 --> 00:46:33.040
<v Speaker 2>counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I caught it real quick.</v>

1054
00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:35.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your body moves good,</v>

1055
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:37.960
<v Speaker 2>but you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

1056
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:38.843
<v Speaker 2>You feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you're under the </v>

1057
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.000
<v Speaker 2>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mentally.</v>

1058
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.770
<v Speaker 2>It's very nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1059
00:46:44.771 --> 00:46:45.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives you a body buzz,</v>

1060
00:46:45.791 --> 00:46:49.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great at alleviating anxiety.</v>

1061
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Like it makes you really chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

1062
00:46:51.971 --> 00:46:54.820
<v Speaker 2>It's just like puts you in this nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>headspace where you just like,</v>

1063
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.470
<v Speaker 2>ugh.</v>

1064
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.303
<v Speaker 2>Like everything's calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea is that it fills up </v>

1065
00:46:59.591 --> 00:47:02.050
<v Speaker 2>these opium receptors and that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1066
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.140
<v Speaker 2>what people that have had real problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>with opiates.</v>

1067
00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:08.800
<v Speaker 2>That's why they like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because even if you're fucked up on it,</v>

1068
00:47:08.801 --> 00:47:12.100
<v Speaker 2>you're not fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucked up like,</v>

1069
00:47:12.101 --> 00:47:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel something.</v>

1070
00:47:13.121 --> 00:47:13.954
<v Speaker 2>Something crazy is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was taking eight and my buddy </v>

1071
00:47:17.561 --> 00:47:19.930
<v Speaker 2>Chris Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the guy who directed that a bigger,</v>

1072
00:47:19.931 --> 00:47:21.220
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster documentary.</v>

1073
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:25.750
<v Speaker 2>He had a real problem with opiates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got a pretty serious,</v>

1074
00:47:25.751 --> 00:47:28.060
<v Speaker 2>a hip injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to get a hip replacement surgery and</v>

1075
00:47:28.061 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 2>was in massive and when he has a serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis,</v>

1076
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 2>like a genetic arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when he got his hip replaced and got</v>

1077
00:47:36.251 --> 00:47:37.084
<v Speaker 2>on pain pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got hooked bad in the middle of </v>

1078
00:47:38.741 --> 00:47:41.770
<v Speaker 2>making a documentary about prescription </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

1079
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the middle of it,</v>

1080
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:46.930
<v Speaker 2>he got hooked himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just total random,</v>

1081
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>synchronicity.</v>

1082
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 2>And he takes 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes 10 of those,</v>

1083
00:47:51.191 --> 00:47:54.370
<v Speaker 2>so he takes two more than I took it </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday for like four hours.</v>

1084
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I was walking around like this,</v>

1085
00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.780
<v Speaker 4>but there's no real side effects in </v>
<v Speaker 4>comparison to the other stuff.</v>

1086
00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.010
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no real side effects.</v>

1087
00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:03.830
<v Speaker 4>After that last man standing tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm with Laura,</v>

1088
00:48:03.831 --> 00:48:05.570
<v Speaker 4>had three fights in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

1089
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:11.150
<v Speaker 4>I had like super bad chest contusion of </v>
<v Speaker 4>my chest is still there years later,</v>

1090
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:15.250
<v Speaker 4>the swelling and swelling of my sternum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1091
00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.540
<v Speaker 4>it would pinch off nerves running down </v>
<v Speaker 4>my shoulder.</v>

1092
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:20.420
<v Speaker 4>And then I think it actually pinched off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nerve root,</v>

1093
00:48:20.421 --> 00:48:21.950
<v Speaker 4>which is when I started doing the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1094
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.950
<v Speaker 4>the decompression with the chiropractor </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so my left side started like,</v>

1095
00:48:27.951 --> 00:48:28.371
<v Speaker 4>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1096
00:48:28.371 --> 00:48:31.850
<v Speaker 4>it was noticeably getting smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was the muscle atrophies because</v>

1097
00:48:31.851 --> 00:48:34.520
<v Speaker 4>you don't know that I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might know what Joe,</v>

1098
00:48:34.521 --> 00:48:35.354
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything is that the nerve root </v>

1099
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:40.640
<v Speaker 4>actually feeds them the muscle and </v>
<v Speaker 4>allows it to grow without,</v>

1100
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.190
<v Speaker 4>once that's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then your muscle won't grow anymore.</v>

1101
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:44.023
<v Speaker 4>It's when you atrophy and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to get it to grow </v>

1102
00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:47.720
<v Speaker 4>back to if you don't catch it quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1103
00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:48.853
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1104
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:51.230
<v Speaker 4>did you have a problem and get into grow</v>
<v Speaker 4>back or do you catch it quick?</v>

1105
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:52.383
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when we started doing the </v>

1106
00:48:52.641 --> 00:48:54.560
<v Speaker 4>decompression and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it worked.</v>

1107
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it grew back I think,</v>

1108
00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:58.360
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

1109
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.300
<v Speaker 4>the pain that I was feeling from all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit I kept,</v>

1110
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:06.340
<v Speaker 4>I kept getting Vicodin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prescription Vikatin in Norco and uh,</v>

1111
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.380
<v Speaker 4>you're literally in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would take the medicine.</v>

1112
00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.813
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1113
00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:11.953
<v Speaker 4>after like two months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I looked at my kitchen counter and </v>

1114
00:49:14.361 --> 00:49:16.730
<v Speaker 4>there was just empty pill bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everywhere.</v>

1115
00:49:16.731 --> 00:49:17.564
<v Speaker 4>And I noticed that I was like really </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking aggressive and like short and </v>

1116
00:49:19.941 --> 00:49:23.000
<v Speaker 4>like I just stopped right away when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I realized that,</v>

1117
00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:25.070
<v Speaker 4>but I could totally see how that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

1118
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:27.530
<v Speaker 4>That could become a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an addictive thing for sure.</v>

1119
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:29.900
<v Speaker 4>I was there manning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really need it,</v>

1120
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:30.763
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like I was like trying to get </v>

1121
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:32.384
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1122
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.830
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in pain and take a pill.</v>

1123
00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.113
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1124
00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.680
<v Speaker 4>did you go to a doctor and get it looked</v>
<v Speaker 4>at?</v>

1125
00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.053
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to.</v>

1126
00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:39.840
<v Speaker 4>What did they say about your sternum?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1127
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.710
<v Speaker 4>they said that there was nothing wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>with it and went to the hospital twice.</v>

1128
00:49:42.711 --> 00:49:43.544
<v Speaker 4>I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1129
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:47.960
<v Speaker 4>America woke up screaming and shaking </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the pain and went to the doctor,</v>

1130
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:49.470
<v Speaker 4>the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they did an x ray.</v>

1131
00:49:49.471 --> 00:49:51.200
<v Speaker 4>And so there's nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

1132
00:49:51.201 --> 00:49:53.450
<v Speaker 4>look at the swelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looked like a tennis ball.</v>

1133
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.823
<v Speaker 4>And they said that it was in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>cartilage or between the ribs or had </v>

1134
00:49:58.401 --> 00:49:59.690
<v Speaker 4>gotten some sort of confusion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1135
00:49:59.691 --> 00:50:00.524
<v Speaker 4>somebody gets a hit and elbow and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>had swells up that mine was doing that </v>

1136
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.910
<v Speaker 4>under the rib or under the sternum </v>
<v Speaker 4>plates or some shit.</v>

1137
00:50:07.911 --> 00:50:10.940
<v Speaker 4>So there's this constant pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just started taking advil,</v>

1138
00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:15.260
<v Speaker 4>like it was going out of style and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would make the swelling go down and</v>

1139
00:50:15.261 --> 00:50:16.094
<v Speaker 4>then I wasn't in pain anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the problem that I was having with </v>

1140
00:50:17.841 --> 00:50:21.020
<v Speaker 4>the Vicodin was it's not an anti </v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory,</v>

1141
00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:23.570
<v Speaker 4>so it did nothing for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the actual cause of the pain.</v>

1142
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.180
<v Speaker 4>And I was just eating fucking vicodin </v>
<v Speaker 4>like crazy.</v>

1143
00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.230
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1144
00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 7>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1145
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.960
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not,</v>

1146
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.980
<v Speaker 7>I pretty much eat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I take advil every day regardless for my</v>

1147
00:50:36.291 --> 00:50:37.124
<v Speaker 7>knees hurting or my toes are hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or like just years of not supposed to </v>

1148
00:50:39.591 --> 00:50:40.424
<v Speaker 7>fuck with that stuff every day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not good to do the honest gut </v>

1149
00:50:44.571 --> 00:50:45.404
<v Speaker 7>health.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1150
00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 7>That'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1151
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 7>in Kimchi helps to probiotics Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It just,</v>

1152
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:54.500
<v Speaker 7>it ruins your gut health and it causes </v>
<v Speaker 7>inflammation.</v>

1153
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:57.740
<v Speaker 7>This is what my friend Cameron Hanes who</v>
<v Speaker 7>runs ultra marathons,</v>

1154
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.843
<v Speaker 7>he was taking 800 milligrams a day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sometimes twice a day and a because he </v>

1155
00:51:02.151 --> 00:51:02.984
<v Speaker 7>was in pain all the time because he runs</v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking dude runs a marathon every day </v>

1156
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.880
<v Speaker 7>on Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This Saturday coming up,</v>

1157
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:12.320
<v Speaker 7>he's running for 24 hours and his goal </v>
<v Speaker 7>is 120 miles in 24 hours.</v>

1158
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:13.640
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's a fucking maniac.</v>

1159
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:15.540
<v Speaker 7>So this dude's always in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

1160
00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.393
<v Speaker 7>I had Dr Rhonda Patrick on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She was explaining about how </v>

1161
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:20.023
<v Speaker 7>nonsteroidal antiinflammatories like </v>
<v Speaker 7>Ibuprofen actually cause inflammation </v>

1162
00:51:24.471 --> 00:51:25.304
<v Speaker 7>because they fuck up your gut bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 7>and they fuck up your body's ability to </v>

1163
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:29.930
<v Speaker 7>process information and it causes pain.</v>

1164
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:30.973
<v Speaker 7>So he listened and there's connections </v>
<v Speaker 7>to stroke and all sorts of other </v>

1165
00:51:33.771 --> 00:51:34.604
<v Speaker 7>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So he gets off of it and all his pain </v>

1166
00:51:35.901 --> 00:51:36.734
<v Speaker 7>went away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His pain was caused in part by the fact </v>

1167
00:51:39.651 --> 00:51:42.140
<v Speaker 7>that he was taking this stuff for his </v>
<v Speaker 7>pain,</v>

1168
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:44.870
<v Speaker 7>which is a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ridiculous vicious cycle.</v>

1169
00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:48.500
<v Speaker 7>What's APP for how long?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Straight was he taking?</v>

1170
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.110
<v Speaker 7>He was taking it for years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For years.</v>

1171
00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:52.093
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he will because he's been running </v>

1172
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:53.443
<v Speaker 7>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's been doing marathons and ultra </v>

1173
00:51:55.431 --> 00:51:58.160
<v Speaker 7>brand 238 miles last year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>

1174
00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.990
<v Speaker 7>you know the mole APP to 30,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is just the same.</v>

1175
00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.113
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we'll have to even possible it takes </v>

1176
00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:05.660
<v Speaker 7>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three fucking days.</v>

1177
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.350
<v Speaker 7>What's really crazy is you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The first day you woke up the next day,</v>

1178
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:11.063
<v Speaker 7>another 24 hours of reading.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's a type of mindset that you </v>

1179
00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.220
<v Speaker 7>have to have to be able to do something </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that.</v>

1180
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:19.940
<v Speaker 7>That's just super human.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to be able to just every step,</v>

1181
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:20.900
<v Speaker 7>left foot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right foot,</v>

1182
00:52:20.901 --> 00:52:23.120
<v Speaker 7>left foot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right foot and agony and pain.</v>

1183
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.133
<v Speaker 7>All your toenails are falling off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everything's in seeing them post </v>

1184
00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:30.170
<v Speaker 7>pictures of nasty fucking feet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All fucked up.</v>

1185
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.063
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's crazy is a woman beat everybody </v>

1186
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.843
<v Speaker 7>by more than 10 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A woman who I had on her name is </v>

1187
00:52:37.461 --> 00:52:38.540
<v Speaker 7>courtney doe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Walter,</v>

1188
00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:39.383
<v Speaker 7>she beat everybody by 22 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She was 22 miles ahead of the second </v>

1189
00:52:43.671 --> 00:52:44.504
<v Speaker 7>place.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>

1190
00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.120
<v Speaker 7>it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's a fucking animal.</v>

1191
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:51.870
<v Speaker 7>She slept for one minute and three days.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One Minute for a minute.</v>

1192
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:57.340
<v Speaker 7>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Twenty two miles come up.</v>

1193
00:52:57.501 --> 00:52:59.360
<v Speaker 7>I don't think steroids help in that </v>
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>

1194
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.160
<v Speaker 7>I think in that world those people are </v>
<v Speaker 7>just,</v>

1195
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:02.840
<v Speaker 7>it's just mental.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really,</v>

1196
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:03.733
<v Speaker 7>I really don't think it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then they'll get paid for it a </v>

1197
00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.590
<v Speaker 7>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They get sponsors and shit.</v>

1198
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:10.783
<v Speaker 7>Cam doesn't get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He had a sponsors under armour sponsors </v>

1199
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:15.050
<v Speaker 7>them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but not really.</v>

1200
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:16.043
<v Speaker 7>It's just because they're animals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know every step I'd be like thinking </v>

1201
00:53:20.511 --> 00:53:21.344
<v Speaker 7>about what am I doing this for?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well it's also your use to psychotic </v>

1202
00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.460
<v Speaker 7>interactions with other people</v>

1203
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.293
<v Speaker 2>in short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you used to like 20 minutes </v>

1204
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 2>description.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chaos.</v>

1205
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that last man standing,</v>

1206
00:53:33.901 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 2>it was one of my favorite events I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever been to.</v>

1207
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:37.013
<v Speaker 2>I fucking loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to ever do it again </v>

1208
00:53:38.311 --> 00:53:42.660
<v Speaker 2>because I love you fighting fucking four</v>
<v Speaker 2>times in a night.</v>

1209
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.190
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kinda want to do it again.</v>

1210
00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about doing that,</v>

1211
00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing something special and,</v>

1212
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.160
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1213
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:53.063
<v Speaker 4>epic like that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was my man the last man standing </v>

1214
00:53:55.891 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 4>the tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like my main focus after the,</v>

1215
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.030
<v Speaker 4>after I knocked out Simon Marcus and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then I guess after a beat,</v>

1216
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:05.340
<v Speaker 4>after the first two fights going into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the third one,</v>

1217
00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:08.760
<v Speaker 4>like I'm pretty sure I wasn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>beat our two most to beat up,</v>

1218
00:54:08.761 --> 00:54:09.594
<v Speaker 4>but I was just had this crazy buzz about</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing that I was doing something </v>

1219
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:15.180
<v Speaker 4>special like this was really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>cool,</v>

1220
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 4>but I would love to do it again.</v>

1221
00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.173
<v Speaker 2>I think that's how those people will </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel when they're running those crazy </v>

1222
00:54:20.651 --> 00:54:21.484
<v Speaker 2>ultra marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know they're about to do something </v>

1223
00:54:22.841 --> 00:54:25.720
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd been a regular fight.</v>

1224
00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Is Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To regular fights in a night is insane.</v>

1225
00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:29.883
<v Speaker 2>Three irregular fights in the night </v>
<v Speaker 2>against worldclass kickboxers and then </v>

1226
00:54:33.581 --> 00:54:34.414
<v Speaker 2>the first fight you got to go for rounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>because after three rounds it was a </v>

1227
00:54:36.701 --> 00:54:39.700
<v Speaker 2>draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What in the fuck man,</v>

1228
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:44.430
<v Speaker 4>good notify.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had to do that shit right now if you get</v>

1229
00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:48.700
<v Speaker 4>excited to hear you talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked.</v>

1230
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.233
<v Speaker 4>I've always loved tournaments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always wanted to be in like a day </v>

1231
00:54:54.331 --> 00:54:57.740
<v Speaker 4>tournament like that should be dope.</v>

1232
00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:00.223
<v Speaker 2>Now you're making your move back to mma </v>
<v Speaker 2>because kickboxing is just not what it </v>

1233
00:55:05.991 --> 00:55:06.824
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we both feel that kickboxing is </v>

1234
00:55:09.561 --> 00:55:10.394
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite things to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a giant fan of it and for whatever </v>

1235
00:55:13.701 --> 00:55:14.534
<v Speaker 2>reason it is just not caught on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America the same way boxing has or the </v>

1236
00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:19.010
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my man</v>

1237
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:19.913
<v Speaker 4>Smith and I've spent my whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I've been doing this since I was </v>

1238
00:55:24.051 --> 00:55:25.730
<v Speaker 4>15.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 34.</v>

1239
00:55:25.731 --> 00:55:26.564
<v Speaker 4>So all of that time I've been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this same question and then like </v>

1240
00:55:28.991 --> 00:55:29.824
<v Speaker 4>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1241
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.770
<v Speaker 4>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1242
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.430
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can't hold onto it </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>

1243
00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.050
<v Speaker 4>at least not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sport is going to grow,</v>

1244
00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.490
<v Speaker 4>it's going to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep doing good.</v>

1245
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.330
<v Speaker 4>And I hope that that continues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for me,</v>

1246
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:41.673
<v Speaker 4>I need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1247
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:43.370
<v Speaker 4>keep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep progressing,</v>

1248
00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.710
<v Speaker 4>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a</v>

1249
00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.020
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what it is.</v>

1250
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:48.883
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best way to put it because </v>

1251
00:55:49.941 --> 00:55:54.380
<v Speaker 2>there's no way we're gonna fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't understand,</v>

1252
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:55.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1253
00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really don't understand.</v>

1254
00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.673
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love watching kickboxing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when people tell me about how they love </v>

1255
00:56:00.801 --> 00:56:01.520
<v Speaker 2>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1256
00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.780
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boxing is great.</v>

1257
00:56:02.781 --> 00:56:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I love boxing to kickboxing is way </v>
<v Speaker 2>better than boxing.</v>

1258
00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.990
<v Speaker 2>That extra level of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1259
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:14.020
<v Speaker 2>thrown in kicks and knees and especially</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to Moitai elbows and clench.</v>

1260
00:56:14.181 --> 00:56:15.770
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a wilder,</v>

1261
00:56:15.771 --> 00:56:20.150
<v Speaker 2>crazier striking sport and I just don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>

1262
00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I watch you fight or Kevin fied</v>

1263
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:25.203
<v Speaker 7>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kevin Ross or Georgia Petrosian John </v>

1264
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:28.991
<v Speaker 7>Wayne part,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1265
00:56:28.991 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 7>how the fuck would you not want to watch</v>
<v Speaker 7>that?</v>

1266
00:56:30.671 --> 00:56:32.800
<v Speaker 7>But it's so exciting.</v>

1267
00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:37.410
<v Speaker 4>And then continuously just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just don't tune in,</v>

1268
00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:39.140
<v Speaker 4>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like fuck,</v>

1269
00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:41.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't understand this.</v>

1270
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Just beltour have real problems with </v>
<v Speaker 4>their ratings when they air it.</v>

1271
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.513
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly what the ratings </v>

1272
00:56:47.281 --> 00:56:48.180
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that they're,</v>

1273
00:56:48.181 --> 00:56:49.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're average.</v>

1274
00:56:49.441 --> 00:56:52.530
<v Speaker 4>They're not super fantastic on any.</v>

1275
00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:56.600
<v Speaker 7>So it's below what the averages for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>MMA fights.</v>

1276
00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:57.590
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1277
00:56:57.591 --> 00:56:58.424
<v Speaker 7>for sure man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a bummer to real fucking bummer </v>

1278
00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.770
<v Speaker 7>because for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for anybody who's a fan,</v>

1279
00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:08.060
<v Speaker 7>anybody who likes watching it like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that event in La,</v>

1280
00:57:08.061 --> 00:57:09.680
<v Speaker 7>that last man standing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Holy Fuck.</v>

1281
00:57:09.681 --> 00:57:11.990
<v Speaker 7>Was that fun?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was crazy.</v>

1282
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was.</v>

1283
00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:13.493
<v Speaker 4>That was probably one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickbox Siemens was the buscot boxing </v>

1284
00:57:15.801 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 4>event I've ever been to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1285
00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:18.243
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole energy and the forum just in </v>

1286
00:57:19.381 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 4>general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that layout of that was,</v>

1287
00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:21.630
<v Speaker 4>was bad ass</v>

1288
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:22.151
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1289
00:57:22.151 --> 00:57:23.730
<v Speaker 7>that form is perfect for that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it,</v>

1290
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.860
<v Speaker 7>everybody knew it was a special night </v>
<v Speaker 7>that it was crazy,</v>

1291
00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:28.450
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that they were doing this,</v>

1292
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.033
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is it like knowing that like how </v>

1293
00:57:32.201 --> 00:57:35.680
<v Speaker 7>much time do you have in between your </v>
<v Speaker 7>second and third fight and everything is</v>

1294
00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:39.700
<v Speaker 7>fucked up and sore and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're about to go into another fight.</v>

1295
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:45.070
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably like 30 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>

1296
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:46.690
<v Speaker 4>40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe one more.</v>

1297
00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:47.643
<v Speaker 4>One other fight between you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just enough time for everything to </v>

1298
00:57:49.781 --> 00:57:50.950
<v Speaker 4>start hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.473
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1300
00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I was just because of the money,</v>

1301
00:57:57.550 --> 00:57:58.383
<v Speaker 4>like I knew that each time my father was</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get more money and that was </v>

1302
00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:01.714
<v Speaker 4>like my focus in the 30 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like not wanting to go back out and </v>

1303
00:58:04.121 --> 00:58:06.050
<v Speaker 4>never crossed my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1304
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:08.920
<v Speaker 4>Versus if I think if I wasn't getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>paid for it,</v>

1305
00:58:08.921 --> 00:58:09.754
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1306
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:10.870
<v Speaker 4>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1307
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:12.250
<v Speaker 4>that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1308
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.130
<v Speaker 4>So that's why I was asking about those </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultra marathons,</v>

1309
00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:15.964
<v Speaker 4>how they get paid for it or not because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that would be my main </v>

1310
00:58:19.331 --> 00:58:19.640
<v Speaker 4>focus.</v>

1311
00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.850
<v Speaker 7>You say that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think that if you were there,</v>

1312
00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:26.600
<v Speaker 7>just your competitive spirit would kick </v>
<v Speaker 7>in and you would go,</v>

1313
00:58:26.601 --> 00:58:27.434
<v Speaker 7>let me see what I could fucking do here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Give me another minute hand and a </v>

1314
00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.630
<v Speaker 7>cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1315
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:35.630
<v Speaker 7>you're at mile 79 and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>shit I'll have to do is 21 more miles.</v>

1316
00:58:38.661 --> 00:58:39.494
<v Speaker 7>I could do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you think you'd like to fight in a </v>

1317
00:58:44.811 --> 00:58:47.270
<v Speaker 7>tournament like old school,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ufc one style?</v>

1318
00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one to,</v>

1319
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:49.850
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1320
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.630
<v Speaker 1>being part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards tournament,</v>

1321
00:58:51.631 --> 00:58:55.220
<v Speaker 1>it was dope being a part of like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monthly tournaments.</v>

1322
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to be like,</v>

1323
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:58.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

1324
00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.510
<v Speaker 1>was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would again,</v>

1325
00:59:00.511 --> 00:59:01.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find some of the best fighters in the </v>

1326
00:59:02.101 --> 00:59:04.430
<v Speaker 1>world three times a night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1327
00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:06.300
<v Speaker 1>That's really what's going to test you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

1328
00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:07.950
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1329
00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:10.890
<v Speaker 1>there's so many factors involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many variables,</v>

1330
00:59:10.891 --> 00:59:12.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your opponent could get up</v>

1331
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:16.210
<v Speaker 7>quick first round knockout,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you could go a three round war,</v>

1332
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:18.250
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then you face each other in the next</v>

1333
00:59:18.251 --> 00:59:19.084
<v Speaker 7>round.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just,</v>

1334
00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 7>I get the commissions not wanting</v>

1335
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.300
<v Speaker 6>to do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get it.</v>

1336
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:25.640
<v Speaker 6>The only place that would let you do is </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably like one of them,</v>

1337
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:27.590
<v Speaker 6>native American casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1338
00:59:27.591 --> 00:59:30.590
<v Speaker 6>come on in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come on in.</v>

1339
00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:32.660
<v Speaker 6>Got The commission is the commission of </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem.</v>

1340
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:34.220
<v Speaker 6>I think they would do it in California.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think?</v>

1341
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:36.410
<v Speaker 6>So it did with glory when I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1342
00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:37.244
<v Speaker 6>But that's kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if they would do that with </v>

1343
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 6>mma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kickboxing.</v>

1344
00:59:40.251 --> 00:59:41.084
<v Speaker 6>It's wildly widely criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people think that was a bad </v>

1345
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:45.044
<v Speaker 6>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the way they can do it with </v>

1346
00:59:46.611 --> 00:59:47.444
<v Speaker 6>kickboxing is because of boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The boxing rule says up to 12 rounds or </v>

1347
00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:52.880
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for kickboxing,</v>

1348
00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Speaker 6>that's three fights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1349
00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:56.883
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how that works with them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I may though that makes sense with </v>

1350
00:59:58.581 --> 00:59:59.990
<v Speaker 6>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That make sense?</v>

1351
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.110
<v Speaker 6>Because I think they probably would have</v>
<v Speaker 6>a hard time saying like,</v>

1352
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:06.020
<v Speaker 6>have Daniel can fight 10 rounds of Ima </v>
<v Speaker 6>may tonight.</v>

1353
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:10.430
<v Speaker 6>That's what's the most rounds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>kickboxing you ever fought in the night.</v>

1354
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 6>But other than that tournament like one </v>
<v Speaker 6>single fight,</v>

1355
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:15.063
<v Speaker 6>a five,</v>
<v Speaker 6>five rounds when I was probably more </v>

1356
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:17.143
<v Speaker 6>times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Always,</v>

1357
01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.530
<v Speaker 6>always,</v>
<v Speaker 6>always like that.</v>

1358
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:19.700
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is that?</v>

1359
01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.093
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that the rule set and Thailand </v>

1360
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.153
<v Speaker 6>is based primarily around gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like human cock fighting is what </v>

1361
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:32.420
<v Speaker 6>tie isn't in Thailand essentially it </v>
<v Speaker 6>sounds negative,</v>

1362
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 6>but it's Kinda that way everybody in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>audience is,</v>

1363
01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 6>is gambling and betting and yelling and </v>
<v Speaker 6>motioning back and forth.</v>

1364
01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:40.604
<v Speaker 6>The treatment bedding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like in Thailand it's a three minute </v>

1365
01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:43.070
<v Speaker 6>round,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's two minute rest,</v>

1366
01:00:43.071 --> 01:00:45.800
<v Speaker 6>which I think is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is awesome.</v>

1367
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:46.723
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I follow for the WBC world title over </v>

1368
01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:50.270
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Wow,</v>

1369
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:55.660
<v Speaker 6>what year was this Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They played the music.</v>

1370
01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:58.931
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1371
01:00:58.931 --> 01:01:01.760
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I find a Roger Dominance Stadium and</v>

1372
01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:02.960
<v Speaker 6>Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like one of the.</v>

1373
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.100
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just dumb.</v>

1374
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.390
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and one or the two being one.</v>

1375
01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.300
<v Speaker 6>So I fought over there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1376
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:11.693
<v Speaker 6>the two minute rest is cool except that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you kind of run out of things to talk </v>

1377
01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:17.730
<v Speaker 6>about like my coach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

1378
01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:21.950
<v Speaker 6>so I'm like looking at ring girls out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fight a tie guy.</v>

1379
01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:23.330
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1380
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.060
<v Speaker 6>I'm both times now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First Time I fought a guy from Argentina</v>

1381
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.013
<v Speaker 6>at Roger Stadium and the second time </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've bought a car ped car at Pythian </v>

1382
01:01:31.011 --> 01:01:32.640
<v Speaker 6>from Golden Glory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jim,</v>

1383
01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.840
<v Speaker 6>for the WBC world title.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now when you,</v>

1384
01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.210
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fight over there in Thailand,</v>

1385
01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:42.290
<v Speaker 6>did they still expect Westerners to take</v>
<v Speaker 6>it easy on that first round?</v>

1386
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:45.020
<v Speaker 6>Because the idea is during the first </v>
<v Speaker 6>round most ties,</v>

1387
01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:46.123
<v Speaker 6>they go fairly light because they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>ready for the bedding to get </v>

1388
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.630
<v Speaker 6>established.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't want to go.</v>

1389
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:51.853
<v Speaker 6>I think you don't want to come out too </v>
<v Speaker 6>strong because then nobody will bet on </v>

1390
01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:55.724
<v Speaker 6>you are against the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they expect that from the </v>

1391
01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:02.780
<v Speaker 6>foreigners though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just as a whole.</v>

1392
01:02:02.781 --> 01:02:03.614
<v Speaker 6>They think that the foreigners suck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they think like foreigners won't </v>

1393
01:02:05.661 --> 01:02:06.494
<v Speaker 6>block leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of times you'll see like the ties </v>

1394
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:10.670
<v Speaker 6>come out and just wreck the foreigner in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the first round and again.</v>

1395
01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.460
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they're,</v>

1396
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:16.760
<v Speaker 6>they're expecting the foreigners to </v>
<v Speaker 6>participate.</v>

1397
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 6>So I would love to go back in time</v>

1398
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.873
<v Speaker 7>and watch Ramon decker when he first got</v>
<v Speaker 7>there and that was like the golden era </v>

1399
01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:25.120
<v Speaker 7>of</v>

1400
01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:28.600
<v Speaker 4>can we tie in like the nineties when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they didn't have the,</v>

1401
01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like right now it's the first round.</v>

1402
01:02:31.721 --> 01:02:33.520
<v Speaker 4>They don't really fight the second and </v>
<v Speaker 4>third round.</v>

1403
01:02:33.521 --> 01:02:34.354
<v Speaker 4>They fight in the fourth round that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>may or may not fight depending on who I </v>

1404
01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.670
<v Speaker 4>know who's who won the first two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They take it off because they do nothing</v>

1405
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:45.580
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean not nothing but almost nothing.</v>

1406
01:02:45.581 --> 01:02:46.414
<v Speaker 4>They're not really trying to win because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know they're going to fight in a </v>

1407
01:02:47.501 --> 01:02:52.501
<v Speaker 4>week and then like in the golden era of </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like when like those guys would come</v>

1408
01:02:53.171 --> 01:02:54.004
<v Speaker 4>out and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a prime time and everybody would </v>

1409
01:02:56.201 --> 01:02:59.920
<v Speaker 4>fight every round and it was supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 4>was better.</v>

1410
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:01.003
<v Speaker 7>Does Ramon decker fights?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Anybody who doesn't know anything about </v>

<v Speaker 7>was what was interesting about him is </v>

1414
01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:16.474
<v Speaker 7>like he was a small guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't like a big guy who was going </v>

<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1425
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.843

<v Speaker 4>enough name that the foreigners know </v>

1426
01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:52.700

<v Speaker 7>be fighting on the road a lot.</v>

1432
01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:06.563
<v Speaker 7>I'll go to these weird places and fight </v>
<v Speaker 7>some dude who looks like he's in real </v>

1433
01:04:09.121 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 7>trouble almost immediately.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

1438
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:19.890
<v Speaker 7>and then a lot of times the ties don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>fight each other.</v>

1439
01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.280
<v Speaker 7>Like it's very rare that you'll see </v>
<v Speaker 7>outside of like a tie stadium.</v>

1440
01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:25.200

<v Speaker 7>an interesting style too,</v>

1444
01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:39.834
<v Speaker 7>because if you looked at him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you only saw like a silhouette and </v>

1445
01:04:42.391 --> 01:04:44.190
<v Speaker 7>you saw him move around,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'd go immediately.</v>

1446
01:04:44.191 --> 01:04:45.024
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's her.</v>

1447

<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1448
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.070
<v Speaker 7>it's constantly moving,</v>
<v Speaker 7>shuffling his feet,</v>

1449
01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 7>switching back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>real light on his feet.</v>

1450
01:04:51.901 --> 01:04:53.590
<v Speaker 7>He just moves different than everybody </v>
<v Speaker 7>else.</v>

1451
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:54.703
<v Speaker 7>He does like the old wiper boron was </v>
<v Speaker 7>like the original martial art of the </v>

1452
01:04:59.100 --> 01:04:59.933
<v Speaker 7>turned into a tie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you watched like the old Tony John </v>

1453
01:05:01.471 --> 01:05:02.304
<v Speaker 7>like on bark or whatever and they run up</v>
<v Speaker 7>on your leg and like dropping the ball </v>

1454
01:05:06.331 --> 01:05:07.164
<v Speaker 7>on your head was like the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 7>stuff and like a lot of the techniques </v>

1455
01:05:09.811 --> 01:05:10.644
<v Speaker 7>that st jude does,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the cartwheel kick or like the </v>

1456
01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:13.524
<v Speaker 7>games that he plays a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Silla is another one that's really </v>

1457
01:05:15.391 --> 01:05:17.000
<v Speaker 7>similar to him on the wash.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just,</v>

1458
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.230
<v Speaker 7>when they've met laird</v>

1459
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Zilla fight in lion fight against a do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with zero fights.</v>

1460
01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:23.483
<v Speaker 2>They let him it with zero fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dude had zero Moy Thai fights over </v>

1461
01:05:29.951 --> 01:05:30.784
<v Speaker 2>$400.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got up to the top and he had kicked </v>

1462
01:05:34.091 --> 01:05:34.924
<v Speaker 2>this dude into another dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was one of those things where it </v>

1463
01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:40.300
<v Speaker 2>was inevitable from the first minute of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first round.</v>

1464
01:05:40.301 --> 01:05:43.270
<v Speaker 2>You like this guy was an mma fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a bad fighter,</v>

1465
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:45.640
<v Speaker 2>but just doesn't belong in there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>laird zillow.</v>

1466
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:47.820
<v Speaker 2>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're like glue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connor Mcgregor's going floyd.</v>

1469
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:55.473
<v Speaker 2>Floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merriweather.</v>

1470
01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's $100,000,000,</v>

1471
01:05:57.551 --> 01:05:58.960
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of different.</v>

1472
01:05:58.961 --> 01:05:59.794
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I didn't pay that guy anywhere </v>

1473
01:06:01.281 --> 01:06:02.114
<v Speaker 2>close to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty sure that guy got his head </v>

1474
01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:06.640
<v Speaker 2>knocked off for 10 bucks and it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same.</v>

1475
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:08.380
<v Speaker 2>That guy is not conor mcgregor either.</v>

1476
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if conor Mcgregor Zilla at an MMA</v>

1477
01:06:11.891 --> 01:06:13.540
<v Speaker 2>fight or more Thai fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1478
01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:15.160
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what happens.</v>

1479
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1480
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:18.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's going to win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that might be interesting.</v>

1481
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:23.530
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing those guys in the real high level</v>

1482
01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:26.890
<v Speaker 2>guys and seeing like what they are able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

1483
01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:31.180
<v Speaker 2>seeing the way they move and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important for,</v>

1484
01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:35.650
<v Speaker 2>especially for mma guys that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the levels of striking,</v>

1485
01:06:36.130 --> 01:06:38.470
<v Speaker 2>that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When guys are just striking,</v>

1486
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:42.640
<v Speaker 2>there are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some elite upon elite upon elite</v>

1487
01:06:42.641 --> 01:06:44.500
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1488
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:45.363
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a black pillow versus a </v>

1489
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:48.043
<v Speaker 2>bluebell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1490
01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:51.240
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like a really bad ass blue belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The black belt,</v>

1491
01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:54.280
<v Speaker 2>you're just completely lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's not even close to just getting</v>

1492
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:55.270
<v Speaker 2>dominated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1493
01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:58.410
<v Speaker 2>you can just get shot down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1494
01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.453
<v Speaker 2>or like you're a good high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler and you go against the world </v>

1495
01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:02.853
<v Speaker 2>chair.</v>

1496
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:05.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been one of the more unique </v>

1497
01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:09.760
<v Speaker 2>things about combat sports is that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are these deep,</v>

1498
01:07:09.761 --> 01:07:12.170
<v Speaker 2>deep levels and you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1499
01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:13.053
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you need to see like a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Khabib number got madoff is a </v>

1500
01:07:16.421 --> 01:07:17.254
<v Speaker 2>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to see him fight against guys </v>

1501
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:22.420
<v Speaker 2>who you know are bad ass and see him </v>
<v Speaker 2>smush them.</v>

1502
01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Just the real difference.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and eyes balls.</v>

1641
01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:38.360
<v Speaker 2>fighter in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.213
<v Speaker 2>went over to Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed there for six weeks and did the </v>

01:13:42.431 --> 01:13:43.264
<v Speaker 2>ultimate fighter and coached alongside </v>
<v Speaker 2>vandelay and vandelay got jumped by a </v>

1644

<v Speaker 2>Dieta and vandelay got so goofy on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show that vandelay last Brazilian fans </v>

1645
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:57.640
<v Speaker 2>because vandelay was coming after him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and shale was trying to be calm about it</v>

1646
01:13:57.641 --> 01:13:58.540
<v Speaker 2>and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1649
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:03.280
<v Speaker 2>vandelay comes near him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he grabs him,</v>

1650
01:14:03.281 --> 01:14:04.390
<v Speaker 2>takes him down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

1651
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:08.110
<v Speaker 2>it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so interesting.</v>

1652
01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Like watching him turn it all around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people mad at Vanderbilt.</v>

1653
01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Brazilians were mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evacuated the like you're making us look</v>

1654
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:16.160
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

1655
01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.350
<v Speaker 1>A perfect place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A perfect.</v>

1656
01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:20.023
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1657
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

1658
01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:24.350
<v Speaker 2>there's a time and a place for shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking and this is the time and this is</v>

1659
01:14:24.351 --> 01:14:27.770
<v Speaker 2>the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like to make money now.</v>

1660
01:14:27.771 --> 01:14:29.330
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a wise move.</v>

1661
01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's sports entertainment at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end of the day,</v>

1662
01:14:31.401 --> 01:14:33.980
<v Speaker 4>regardless of what anybody wants to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>or think about it.</v>

1663
01:14:33.981 --> 01:14:36.980
<v Speaker 4>And like I'd rather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've watched two guys that aren't</v>

1664
01:14:36.981 --> 01:14:37.701
<v Speaker 4>that good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I,</v>

1665
01:14:37.701 --> 01:14:39.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the tough man contest,</v>

1666
01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:40.074
<v Speaker 4>so if it's marketed right and think the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bouncers and bartenders are like </v>

1667
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:44.210
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the entertainment,</v>

1668
01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.053
<v Speaker 2>it's entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the best fights have been </v>

1669
01:14:46.471 --> 01:14:48.400
<v Speaker 2>against guys who aren't some of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>

1670
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Splutter being I'd love that guy was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best fights ever.</v>

1671
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1672
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to start like a fucking tough </v>
<v Speaker 4>man contest.</v>

1673
01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.220
<v Speaker 4>Promotions.</v>

1674
01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Well and even good guys who aren't world</v>
<v Speaker 2>champions.</v>

1675
01:14:59.231 --> 01:15:00.064
<v Speaker 2>Like when a god he fought micky ward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We knew that they were both perfectly </v>

1676
01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:03.814
<v Speaker 2>matched and they were just going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>collide in the middle of the ring and </v>

1677
01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:07.023
<v Speaker 2>beat the fuck out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But are some of the classic boxing </v>

1678
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:10.294
<v Speaker 2>matches</v>

1679
01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.373
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't have to be for the heavyweight </v>

1680
01:15:14.781 --> 01:15:15.450
<v Speaker 4>championship.</v>

1681
01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:16.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1682
01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:17.483
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's been some amazing fights </v>

1683
01:15:19.351 --> 01:15:20.490
<v Speaker 2>in the UFC there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Similar to that,</v>

1684
01:15:20.491 --> 01:15:22.470
<v Speaker 2>like Gilbert Melendez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>verse Diego Sanchez.</v>

1685
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:24.770
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't for a title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the greatest fights of our.</v>

1686
01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:26.010
<v Speaker 2>See that shit was crazy.</v>

1687
01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:27.950
<v Speaker 1>So classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes.</v>

1688
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:29.203
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've always like that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two fighters that don't really have too </v>

1689
01:15:34.021 --> 01:15:34.854
<v Speaker 1>much on the line and talking shit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fight hype and the hype behind the </v>

1690
01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:41.390
<v Speaker 1>fight is what makes life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always does.</v>

1691
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1692
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:42.723
<v Speaker 2>As long as you can actually still fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's makes it interesting with </v>

1693
01:15:45.581 --> 01:15:49.440
<v Speaker 2>the guy with connor or a guy like colby </v>
<v Speaker 2>day can fuckin fight it.</v>

1694
01:15:49.441 --> 01:15:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Talking a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when the,</v>

1695
01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.270
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the bell rings,</v>

1696
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:53.200
<v Speaker 2>they're backing it up.</v>

1697
01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:54.173
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're talking about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what bugs me the most about </v>

1698
01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:58.780
<v Speaker 4>cm punk was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has the,</v>

1699
01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:03.940
<v Speaker 4>the ww II background you would think </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be like great on the mic.</v>

1700
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:05.530
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're like maybe you can't back it</v>

1701
01:16:05.531 --> 01:16:06.364
<v Speaker 4>up or fight or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he goes from like cocky and </v>

1702
01:16:08.411 --> 01:16:11.560
<v Speaker 4>confident I'm the Fuck Jab or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're going to be like,</v>

1703
01:16:11.561 --> 01:16:12.341
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1704
01:16:12.341 --> 01:16:13.780
<v Speaker 4>I just believe in yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kids.</v>

1705
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:18.820
<v Speaker 4>It's like really hard to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe he has no physical,</v>

1706
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:20.730
<v Speaker 4>like no physique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't.</v>

1707
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:22.480
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of sad.</v>

1708
01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.000
<v Speaker 4>I just shit on cm punk.</v>

1709
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1710
01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:27.450
<v Speaker 2>you didn't shit on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were honest about them.</v>

1711
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:30.010
<v Speaker 2>You were honest about what you saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that shit on him.</v>

1712
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very nice guy.</v>

1713
01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 2>He's a very nice guy and he's a hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>worker,</v>

1714
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:35.134
<v Speaker 2>but he does not have athletic talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's missing a lot and he's a showman </v>

1715
01:16:39.581 --> 01:16:40.414
<v Speaker 2>and when he was in the wwe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was allowed to say I'm not fucking </v>

1716
01:16:42.881 --> 01:16:46.420
<v Speaker 2>man and throw his arms up there and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had it scripted so that he was the man.</v>

1717
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:47.703
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in there with a guy like </v>

1718
01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:49.983
<v Speaker 2>Mike Jackson who had zero fear of him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just was so casual and just popping </v>

1719
01:16:56.771 --> 01:16:57.604
<v Speaker 2>them in the face anytime he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and literally could have stopped him </v>

1720
01:17:00.231 --> 01:17:01.064
<v Speaker 2>anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he just got angry and want to stop </v>

1721
01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:03.334
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could have stopped him at any point </v>

1722
01:17:03.731 --> 01:17:07.360
<v Speaker 2>in the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even though he beat him decisively,</v>

1723
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 2>the performance was pissed white off so </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad</v>

1724
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.053
<v Speaker 7>the way he was fighting that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He called him a fucking idiot and he </v>

1725
01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:14.240
<v Speaker 7>said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll never fight in the UFC again.</v>

1726
01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.313
<v Speaker 7>Anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like if Mike Jackson went out there </v>

1727
01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:18.674
<v Speaker 7>and just start cm punk with a right hand</v>
<v Speaker 7>left hook combination and that was the </v>

1728
01:17:22.011 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 7>end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they would say,</v>

1729
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 7>well cm punk,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you gave it a shot.</v>

1730
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:25.910
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's over.</v>

1731
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:27.770
<v Speaker 7>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who would you like to fight next?</v>

1732
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:29.630
<v Speaker 7>And now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1733
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:32.350
<v Speaker 7>you're not even fighting in the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 7>anymore because you should have,</v>

1734
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:34.340
<v Speaker 7>you should have stopped him like what </v>
<v Speaker 7>you were doing.</v>

1735
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:37.940
<v Speaker 7>He tickled him fucking it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll make a joke of the sport,</v>

1736
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:40.070
<v Speaker 7>like it's already like a joke because if</v>
<v Speaker 7>this guy,</v>

1737
01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:41.990
<v Speaker 7>everyone thinks punk punks like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>joke.</v>

1738
01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:43.213
<v Speaker 7>I guess he is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but like don't make a joke of the sport </v>

1739
01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:50.130
<v Speaker 7>and like not just like poking fun of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>fence.</v>

1740
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:51.283
<v Speaker 7>I get rid and it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get ridiculous comment as to how to </v>

1741
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:54.140
<v Speaker 7>starched stem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1742
01:17:54.141 --> 01:17:57.050
<v Speaker 7>it's the whole thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was very weird.</v>

1743
01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.260
<v Speaker 7>The whole thing was very weird,</v>
<v Speaker 7>was like right away when you see cm punk</v>

1744
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:01.303
<v Speaker 7>holding,</v>
<v Speaker 7>holding his hands up and moving stiff </v>

1745
01:18:02.931 --> 01:18:03.890
<v Speaker 7>and throwing kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like,</v>

1746
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:05.143
<v Speaker 7>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I don't like that being on paper </v>

1747
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:08.540
<v Speaker 7>view.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I understand that they're,</v>

1748
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.383
<v Speaker 7>they're selling paper view cards,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but paper view in the UFC should be the </v>

1749
01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:14.900
<v Speaker 7>elite fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Curtis blades versus Alistair overeem.</v>

1750
01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.300
<v Speaker 7>Should have been on that paper view </v>
<v Speaker 7>card.</v>

1751
01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:19.070
<v Speaker 7>That's what should have been there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not,</v>

1752
01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:20.900
<v Speaker 7>not what we got to see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1753
01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:23.980
<v Speaker 7>what we got to see was just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1754
01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:25.473
<v Speaker 7>I don't like when it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you're playing a trick on the </v>

1755
01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:28.810
<v Speaker 7>fence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

1756
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:32.210
<v Speaker 7>Promoting this guys if you something and</v>
<v Speaker 7>then it's like inspiring videos come out</v>

1757
01:18:32.211 --> 01:18:33.650
<v Speaker 7>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck is this?</v>

1758
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:35.120
<v Speaker 7>Inspiring?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Videos are crazy.</v>

1759
01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:36.393
<v Speaker 7>Awful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like a guy who just showed that </v>

1760
01:18:37.301 --> 01:18:38.134
<v Speaker 7>as far awful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like you took a dude who's no </v>

1761
01:18:40.431 --> 01:18:42.410
<v Speaker 7>wrestling background,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no nothing,</v>

1762
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:45.230
<v Speaker 7>or this one I want you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is a jab.</v>

1763
01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 7>It was the right hand is when you throw </v>
<v Speaker 7>a kick.</v>

1764
01:18:47.811 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 7>I want you to pivot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Your hips go ahead and there as bar.</v>

1765
01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.073
<v Speaker 7>I mean he just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He doesn't have the ability to move his </v>

1766
01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:54.644
<v Speaker 7>body.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1767
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:55.603
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of guys that you could </v>
<v Speaker 7>take out there that are track and field </v>

1768
01:18:57.921 --> 01:18:58.754
<v Speaker 7>guys or football players and you could </v>
<v Speaker 7>get them to fight better than him in a </v>

1769
01:19:02.811 --> 01:19:05.870
<v Speaker 7>couple of weeks easily because they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>athletes,</v>

1770
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:08.840
<v Speaker 7>they're athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would understand how to shift their</v>

1771
01:19:08.841 --> 01:19:09.950
<v Speaker 7>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>throw a punch,</v>

1772
01:19:09.951 --> 01:19:13.640
<v Speaker 7>and yet the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the sparring videos that I saw was,</v>

1773
01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:16.820
<v Speaker 7>I think it was his first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but even then he wasn't.</v>

1774
01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:17.653
<v Speaker 7>He signed for like two years before he </v>
<v Speaker 7>had his first fight or something like </v>

1775
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.923
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no way that you're six years </v>

1776
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:24.650
<v Speaker 7>deep in the game and yet he's still at </v>
<v Speaker 7>that bad.</v>

1777
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:26.750
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>He doesn't have any talent.</v>

1778
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:27.793
<v Speaker 7>It's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It just doesn't have physical talent or </v>

1779
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:31.950
<v Speaker 7>whatever for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether it's a,</v>

1780
01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.290
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his approach,</v>

1781
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:35.540
<v Speaker 7>his intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether it's,</v>

1782
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:38.630
<v Speaker 7>it's not as coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So at Duke fucking Rufus,</v>

1783
01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.250
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1784
01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.253
<v Speaker 7>it has to do with cushman that he talks </v>
<v Speaker 7>about Duke roufus hit and one of the </v>

1785
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:44.750
<v Speaker 7>prefects.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said,</v>

1786
01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:46.760
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do you see this fight?</v>

1787
01:19:46.761 --> 01:19:47.091

<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>to see a head kick and like,</v>

1789
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:51.470
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that's going to happen.</v>

1806
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:33.660
<v Speaker 2>drinking beer and smoking cigarettes his</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life and had him in a fight in six</v>

<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

1809
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:39.860
<v Speaker 6>against these other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Both guys fought micky gall first.</v>

1813
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:49.520

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1815
01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:55.130
<v Speaker 2>he did like his own pre-fight a analysis</v>
<v Speaker 2>of how it was going to go.</v>

1816
01:20:55.131 --> 01:20:56.330
<v Speaker 2>It was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1819
01:21:01.911 --> 01:21:04.940
<v Speaker 2>fight and then I saw that it was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight cm punk.</v>

1820
01:21:04.941 --> 01:21:07.160
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who said Yes to this?</v>

1821
01:21:07.220 --> 01:21:08.053
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck would you say yes to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a hundred percent guaranteed </v>

1822
01:21:11.001 --> 01:21:13.100
<v Speaker 2>brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you're going to beat him.</v>

1823
01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.770
<v Speaker 2>There's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a goddamn chance in hell.</v>

1824
01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:16.843

<v Speaker 2>And I was saying that people get mad at </v>

1825
01:21:18.801 --> 01:21:20.240
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The CM punk fans get mad at me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>them in a cage with a puppy.</v>

01:26:42.981 --> 01:26:43.791
<v Speaker 7>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sugar.</v>

1960
01:26:43.791 --> 01:26:47.540
<v Speaker 7>Sean's in it too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not that we're going to watch it,</v>

1961
01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:49.880
<v Speaker 7>but he had song rampage does that too?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think so.</v>

1962
01:26:49.881 --> 01:26:50.780
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's a big Gamer.</v>

1963
01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.610
<v Speaker 7>He's always talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is he still active?</v>

1964
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.780
<v Speaker 7>Is he still gonna fight again?</v>

1965
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:55.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to get a fight with him not</v>

1966
01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:58.330
<v Speaker 4>too long ago and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure what.</v>

1967
01:26:58.470 --> 01:27:00.730
<v Speaker 7>Well he's like 290 pounds right now,</v>

1968
01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.620
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like at half six figure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>for that size I could do that.</v>

1969
01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.770
<v Speaker 4>Could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could be read pitch.</v>

1970
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:09.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'd go for like Brock </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lesnar.</v>

1971
01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.213
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the rates lower cut a heavyweight we're </v>

1972
01:27:12.241 --> 01:27:15.240
<v Speaker 7>talking about because he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he doesn't try to take it down,</v>

1973
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:16.123
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most likely is going to try to stand </v>

1974
01:27:16.981 --> 01:27:17.814
<v Speaker 7>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you have a set schedule for you </v>

1975
01:27:21.871 --> 01:27:22.860
<v Speaker 7>return to mma?</v>

1976
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:23.983
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hopefully getting at something </v>

1977
01:27:26.101 --> 01:27:27.420
<v Speaker 4>around September,</v>
<v Speaker 4>August,</v>

1978
01:27:27.421 --> 01:27:28.920
<v Speaker 4>late August,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early September,</v>

1979
01:27:28.921 --> 01:27:29.430
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1980
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:32.760
<v Speaker 7>And you just decided that we're </v>
<v Speaker 7>kickboxing is right now.</v>

1981
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:34.350
<v Speaker 7>Just doesn't have enough juice.</v>

1982
01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:35.640
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1983
01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.270
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1984
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:37.103
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to keep progressing financially </v>

1985
01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:40.990
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1986
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.801
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

1987
01:27:41.801 --> 01:27:46.210
<v Speaker 4>money motivates me a lot and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I reached the ceiling of the sport so</v>

1988
01:27:46.211 --> 01:27:48.040
<v Speaker 4>to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's,</v>

1989
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:49.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm amazed right here,</v>

1990
01:27:49.871 --> 01:27:52.480
<v Speaker 4>right next door and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1991
01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:54.480
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

1992
01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.313
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1993
01:27:58.530 --> 01:27:59.211
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1994
01:27:59.211 --> 01:28:00.740
<v Speaker 7>how many more years you think you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to do it?</v>

1995
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:04.080
<v Speaker 4>A four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>

1996
01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:05.093
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five.</v>

1997
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:08.460
<v Speaker 4>I want to make big fights as much money </v>
<v Speaker 4>as I can.</v>

1998
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:13.080
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and set up for life after fighting.</v>

1999
01:28:13.081 --> 01:28:13.681
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2000
01:28:13.681 --> 01:28:14.760
<v Speaker 4>you can't just quit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2001
01:28:14.761 --> 01:28:15.594
<v Speaker 4>You gotta find ways to market yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the highest level to get as much </v>

2002
01:28:18.901 --> 01:28:19.734
<v Speaker 4>attention as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the irrelevant in the space that you </v>

2003
01:28:21.961 --> 01:28:25.530
<v Speaker 4>pass and I just don't think they </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing is going to get me there.</v>

2004
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2005
01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.240
<v Speaker 7>it's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think you're right.</v>

2006
01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:32.000
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a smart if you're just </v>
<v Speaker 7>dealing strictly financially.</v>

2007
01:28:32.001 --> 01:28:34.670
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a very smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very unfortunate.</v>

2008
01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:37.880
<v Speaker 7>I really wish there was a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do not know what it would be though.</v>

2009
01:28:37.881 --> 01:28:39.920
<v Speaker 7>I mean everybody's tried.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Spike TV tried,</v>

2010
01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.220
<v Speaker 7>they tried the paramount network.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They tried with glory.</v>

2011
01:28:43.570 --> 01:28:44.110
<v Speaker 7>No</v>

2012
01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:46.410
<v Speaker 4>one thing it also with pellets or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2013
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:49.270
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe there's a big fight,</v>

2014
01:28:49.271 --> 01:28:50.104
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe Musashi's like you don't want to </v>

2015
01:28:51.581 --> 01:28:54.280
<v Speaker 4>think I want the bills were kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>title to be</v>

2016
01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:55.500
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2017
01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:57.490
<v Speaker 7>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah.</v>

2018
01:28:57.730 --> 01:28:59.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would fight if they let me,</v>

2019
01:28:59.521 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 4>I would fight fucking kickboxing first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>win</v>

2020
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.560
<v Speaker 6>that fight and then come back out the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same night and fight mma.</v>

2021
01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.340
<v Speaker 6>Leo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I brought it up.</v>

2022
01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:09.653
<v Speaker 6>I brought it up to coker at a meeting </v>
<v Speaker 6>not too long ago where they say they </v>

2023
01:29:13.021 --> 01:29:13.854
<v Speaker 6>just kinda looked at me like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy horse the same way they looked at </v>

2024
01:29:17.761 --> 01:29:20.010
<v Speaker 6>me when I said I wanted to fight rampage</v>
<v Speaker 6>of vandelay.</v>

2025
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:25.110
<v Speaker 6>Well his deal is he back like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's going on with vandelay?</v>

2026
01:29:25.170 --> 01:29:26.003
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just saw it as an opportunity when </v>

2027
01:29:28.661 --> 01:29:30.070
<v Speaker 6>Chell beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2028
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.400
<v Speaker 6>his complaint was that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2029
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:33.140
<v Speaker 6>he just took her panel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>laid on top of them,</v>

2030
01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.010
<v Speaker 6>which has been kind of my complaint for </v>
<v Speaker 6>a while.</v>

2031
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:37.580
<v Speaker 6>So I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they don't want that fight.</v>

2032
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:40.163
<v Speaker 6>Why don't they want their friends when </v>
<v Speaker 6>they get barely already had his face </v>

2033
01:29:42.751 --> 01:29:45.120
<v Speaker 6>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't want to have it done twice.</v>

2034
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:49.800
<v Speaker 7>Rampage is my buddy when he just.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He just doesn't want that.</v>

2035
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:52.440
<v Speaker 7>He said he wants an easy fight like </v>
<v Speaker 7>vandelay so.</v>

2036
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:55.390
<v Speaker 7>Well there's a lot of history between </v>
<v Speaker 7>those two guys to.</v>

2037
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:56.730
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that makes sense.</v>

2038
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:59.100
<v Speaker 7>You'd want to fight for him?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2039
01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:00.563
<v Speaker 7>He was A.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Vanderbilt was an interesting story to </v>

2040
01:30:01.831 --> 01:30:02.664
<v Speaker 7>write when he was fighting over in pride</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then he came over to the UFC just </v>

2041
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.570
<v Speaker 7>completely different human being.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:08.533
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just in the rampage fights when rampage </v>

2043
01:30:11.161 --> 01:30:11.994
<v Speaker 7>brought them over in prod and that also </v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of miles on them to get to think </v>

2044
01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:16.380
<v Speaker 7>of both things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

2045
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got me thinking about felony,</v>

2046
01:30:21.211 --> 01:30:22.044
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2047
01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:24.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and whatnot</v>

2048
01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:28.710
<v Speaker 7>over the felony.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The known as the crazy horse.</v>

2049
01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:31.120
<v Speaker 7>Crazy horse has now changed his name to </v>
<v Speaker 7>felony ladies.</v>

2050
01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:31.983
<v Speaker 7>Gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No longer refer to him as crazy horse </v>

2051
01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:39.020
<v Speaker 7>you ever see that fight backstage is </v>
<v Speaker 7>nothing like swear swears up and down.</v>

2052
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.690
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2053
01:30:41.690 --> 01:30:42.523
<v Speaker 1>Beat them up.</v>

2054
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:45.663
<v Speaker 7>So the sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he definitely just somebody else will </v>

2055
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:49.303
<v Speaker 7>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But didn't he say he says he killed </v>

2056
01:30:51.301 --> 01:30:52.134
<v Speaker 7>vandelay city sucker punched him after </v>
<v Speaker 7>he got choked out on the video that you </v>

2057
01:30:55.561 --> 01:30:58.050
<v Speaker 7>see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He fought later on that night and won by</v>

2058
01:30:58.130 --> 01:31:01.360
<v Speaker 7>knockout I think after being choked </v>
<v Speaker 7>unconscious in the back.</v>

2059
01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:05.550
<v Speaker 7>And he said he knocked out vandelay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

2060
01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:08.120
<v Speaker 7>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2061
01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:09.090
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It happened before.</v>

2062
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:13.610
<v Speaker 7>He fought in the locker room and he went</v>
<v Speaker 7>out and won and then he,</v>

2063
01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:16.560
<v Speaker 7>he says he knocked out vandelay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>punched him and knocked him out.</v>

2064
01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:19.650
<v Speaker 7>Vandelay went out and won a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So vandelay,</v>

2065
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:23.490
<v Speaker 7>if he's telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he killed vandelay earlier that night.</v>

2066
01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:28.350
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

2067
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:29.383
<v Speaker 7>Here's the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is vandelay when you know that </v>

2068
01:31:32.781 --> 01:31:36.740
<v Speaker 7>doesn't even look like the same person I</v>
<v Speaker 7>know is the same person.</v>

2069
01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:38.803
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2070
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Like the Mario brothers muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tacked this dude and he got caught in</v>

2071
01:31:47.811 --> 01:31:52.811
<v Speaker 3>a triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very danger.</v>

2072
01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2073
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it was that did this to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

2074
01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:06.280
<v Speaker 2>but it was one across and Gracie's black</v>

<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2117
01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:13.500
<v Speaker 2>All he has to do is Yank that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing up clockwise and that's a wrap.</v>

<v Speaker 2>across the body.</v>

2123

<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2130
01:34:47.050 --> 01:34:47.883
<v Speaker 2>I mean you got to tap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is when someone's got </v>

2131
01:34:50.171 --> 01:34:52.870
<v Speaker 2>you in this way across the body and then</v>

<v Speaker 7>You could hear a duck everything pulling</v>
<v Speaker 7>apart and snapping off the bone and </v>

2136
01:35:04.311 --> 01:35:07.160

<v Speaker 6>misconception of it as like that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not a productive person,</v>

2244
01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:59.430

<v Speaker 4>I ended up getting off on that because </v>

2306
01:42:57.311 --> 01:42:58.144
<v Speaker 4>it was a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pulled me over for turning the </v>

2307
01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:03.580
<v Speaker 4>wrong way on a one way street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I just showed that I wasn't,</v>

2308
01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.320
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do any field stuff</v>

2309
01:43:05.490 --> 01:43:06.323
<v Speaker 7>already.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tests,</v>

2310
01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:08.400
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying you shouldn't drink and </v>
<v Speaker 7>drive,</v>

2311
01:43:08.401 --> 01:43:09.620
<v Speaker 7>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to pick that.</v>

2312
01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:10.640
<v Speaker 7>But if you do drink,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2313
01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:11.660
<v Speaker 7>during,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2314
01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:13.860
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't do the field sobriety tests.</v>

2315
01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:16.140
<v Speaker 7>So they didn't have any probable cause </v>
<v Speaker 7>that it was actually drunk.</v>

2316
01:43:16.230 --> 01:43:18.480
<v Speaker 7>And when he didn't blow and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they said,</v>

2317
01:43:18.481 --> 01:43:19.314
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was driving the wrong way in one way </v>

2318
01:43:19.801 --> 01:43:20.431
<v Speaker 7>street.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I was like,</v>

2319
01:43:20.431 --> 01:43:24.440
<v Speaker 7>I've never been to that area before.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So side note technique,</v>

2320
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:28.020
<v Speaker 7>don't blow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2321
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:29.850
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Never had a dui.</v>

<v Speaker 7>not paying attention what you're doing </v>

2325
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:41.590
<v Speaker 7>with Uber and lyft and all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now it's Kinda,</v>

2326

<v Speaker 7>Dui.</v>

2327
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:47.720
<v Speaker 7>I bet it's dropped down significantly </v>
<v Speaker 7>because of uber and lyft are really bad.</v>

2328
01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:49.440
