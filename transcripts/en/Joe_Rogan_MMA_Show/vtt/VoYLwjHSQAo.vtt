00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Robin Black Gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up buddy?</v>

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great to see you.</v>

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Are you fresh back from Singapore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

6
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Singapore like 48 hours ago.</v>

7
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Did they make that special shiny silver </v>
<v Speaker 1>one for you?</v>

8
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Because that looks like this design for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

10
00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:22.624
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does Kinda look like it's designed </v>

11
00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I wanted it,</v>

12
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a rock and roll.</v>

13
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>One Championship afc championship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's it like over there man?</v>

14
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.083
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One FC is like the Asian version of the </v>

15
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:38.270
<v Speaker 1>UFC is a gigantic organization that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been going on for how long now?</v>

16
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.393
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So solid seven years and really high </v>

17
00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>level fights over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing,</v>

18
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 1>amazing fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore itself is wild.</v>

19
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 1>So I went over there to chat with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So chapter three,</v>

20
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 1>a city of tongue runs it and he and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been chatting and I love kind of how</v>

21
00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>they see martial arts.</v>

22
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.420
<v Speaker 1>So they don't call it even fc anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just one championship.</v>

23
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.840
<v Speaker 1>They don't even use the word fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really it's martial arts.</v>

24
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.883
<v Speaker 1>And the way I see it and the way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied martial arts and share it is an </v>

25
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>art form like painting or yoga or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

26
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things of that nature,</v>

27
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>less spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always how I've seen it.</v>

28
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:17.214
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how I love it.</v>

29
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's how they see it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they present it.</v>

30
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.033
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's presented from this sort of </v>

31
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.830
<v Speaker 1>inspirational own your history kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>way in Asia.</v>

32
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And that was what attracted me to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

33
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely an art form.</v>

34
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:33.034
<v Speaker 1>It's values based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're kind of seeking to inspire </v>

35
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>people through these athletes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>

36
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:39.124
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really what's motivating them to take </v>

37
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:43.174
<v Speaker 1>this sort of radical approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's wild that you say that because </v>

38
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 1>to me this is the approach.</v>

39
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.233
<v Speaker 1>So I think what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the way that we presented in North </v>

40
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 1>America is radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think martial arts is an art form.</v>

41
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts is this inspiring thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

42
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:03.820
<v Speaker 1>you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say for example,</v>

43
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.713
<v Speaker 1>on loud song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is there 185 pound and 205 pound </v>

44
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's from me and Mar.</v>

45
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.890
<v Speaker 1>They have never had a world champion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sport ever in their history.</v>

46
00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I don'T think they've had a gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>medalist in the olympics.</v>

47
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:17.914
<v Speaker 1>They've never had that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a two division champion that </v>

48
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.873
<v Speaker 1>will and when I talked to [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and he was talking sort of </v>

49
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 1>about why he sees it this way and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's proud to present it this way.</v>

50
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:31.480
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows without question that there are</v>

51
00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:32.314
<v Speaker 1>kids and he won his 205 pound title in </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and mark in a stadium in me and mark </v>

52
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.230
<v Speaker 1>and he said he knows without question </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a kid in,</v>

53
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>they're going to become a lawyer one day</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that and they can feel it and</v>

54
00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

55
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.773
<v Speaker 1>It's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a marketing strategy like </v>

56
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>this is how they see martial arts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how martial arts is viewed in asia.</v>

57
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.593
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to travel so much now it's view </v>

58
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.093
<v Speaker 1>different in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's view different in Brazil also </v>

59
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>viewed in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia is wild,</v>

60
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to work for a acb,</v>

61
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acb,</v>

62
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>some other organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big organizations.</v>

63
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:06.724
<v Speaker 1>So in Russia it's very masculine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about about victory and about </v>

64
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>showing your power and your strength and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really.</v>

65
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Russia is like that,</v>

66
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a reflection kind of of Russia.</v>

67
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the martial art thing.</v>

68
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely agree with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is an art form,</v>

69
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 2>but I also think it's a fight like </v>
<v Speaker 2>gilbert melendez versus diego sanchez.</v>

70
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an art form,</v>

71
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.883
<v Speaker 2>but it's a fight that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a fucking wild fight and </v>

72
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just art.</v>

73
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 2>That's an art and a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's both things.</v>

74
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Is that a fight is art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is in a way.</v>

75
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.290
<v Speaker 1>It's an expression of your personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your individuality.</v>

76
00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:52.890
<v Speaker 1>It's heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fearlessness.</v>

77
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.210
<v Speaker 1>A hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fight.</v>

78
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scared of the word fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

79
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

80
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that word,</v>

81
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 2>like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is an art form.</v>

82
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fights are art.</v>

83
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.371
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

84
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:07.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean like anderson silva's second </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight with shale son,</v>

85
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 2>the way he landed that need of the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground,</v>

86
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 2>but that is just art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's art,</v>

87
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.513
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you go back to leo machida </v>

88
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 2>just landing that front kick on vitor </v>
<v Speaker 2>belfort,</v>

89
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.853
<v Speaker 2>that's art is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's especially for someone who </v>

90
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.090
<v Speaker 2>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

91
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the beauty in that.</v>

92
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.120
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

93
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:28.980
<v Speaker 1>it's like a flower blossoming or sunrise</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just something perfect.</v>

94
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.950
<v Speaker 1>The impossibility of it is what's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>

95
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:32.784
<v Speaker 1>like these guys are so unwilling </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners and they have such like a </v>

96
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:39.324
<v Speaker 1>desire to accomplish what they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish to kick that guy in the face </v>

97
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.920
<v Speaker 1>from that position with vito has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime of this,</v>

98
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.263
<v Speaker 1>a lifetime of being able to not let you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that and for you to first be willing </v>

99
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:55.710
<v Speaker 1>to be free enough to try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:56.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

101
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.760
<v Speaker 1>to express it in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is definitely hard,</v>

102
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:00.630
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

103
00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Fight doesn't intimidate me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

104
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fight is a beautiful thing.</v>

105
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>A fight is we fight for things all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

106
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a metaphor for life itself.</v>

107
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:11.490
<v Speaker 1>When they fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

108
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.583
<v Speaker 2>people rightly so are concerned with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of violence against someone who's </v>

109
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 2>an unwilling participant and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they think of fighting.</v>

110
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>They think of it as this thing that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want nothing to do with.</v>

111
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 2>They don't want any violence in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

112
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 2>They don't want anybody to hurt them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely understand that.</v>

113
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I understand that position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what it is.</v>

114
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:35.194
<v Speaker 2>When it's a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a tired expression because </v>

115
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I've said it too many times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my perception of what fighting is is</v>

116
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.450
<v Speaker 2>high level problem solving with dire </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical consequences</v>

117
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 1>time and then the physical consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>are what make it so special.</v>

118
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no question.</v>

119
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.203
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

120
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.800
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make the gOod times better.</v>

121
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.113
<v Speaker 2>The the possibility that bad things can </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen to you and do sometimes happen </v>

122
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.314
<v Speaker 2>even to the great ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see great fighters had been kod and </v>

123
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:08.470
<v Speaker 2>come back and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

124
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.533
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that where you </v>

125
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

126
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 2>even fade or can get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know whaT I mean?</v>

127
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.173
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even anderson silva can play cocky and </v>

128
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 2>get caught by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris weidman left hook.</v>

129
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just the game</v>

130
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in asia in particular,</v>

131
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:26.744
<v Speaker 1>but there's different pockets of of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>these this is viewed and how the </v>

132
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:31.004
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of of connecting to martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts and fighting is viewed and in asia </v>

133
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.740
<v Speaker 1>you would see a certain amount of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters would see being losing badly is</v>

134
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.793
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chance because to come back and win </v>

135
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>again or to come back and show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're able,</v>

136
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.223
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were given the gift of trying and </v>

137
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.780
<v Speaker 1>failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know whaT I mean?</v>

138
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Do know what you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:55.441 --> 00:06:57.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a great way to approach it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great way to look at it.</v>

140
00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.101
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

141
00:06:59.101 --> 00:07:04.101
<v Speaker 2>that there really is a lesson that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>average person can take in their life.</v>

142
00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Like every time a person does have a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing happened to them.</v>

143
00:07:08.821 --> 00:07:12.270
<v Speaker 2>It's that terrible feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to rise from the ashes.</v>

144
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And winning when it's,</v>

145
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.093
<v Speaker 1>when you're winning at everything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things come easily to you that I'm sure </v>

146
00:07:20.821 --> 00:07:23.910
<v Speaker 1>if it still feels good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you've gone through really hard</v>

147
00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:27.180
<v Speaker 1>times when you've been challenged by </v>
<v Speaker 1>something or do you drop lower,</v>

148
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.170
<v Speaker 1>the high of the success is so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher at so much of a longer journey.</v>

149
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.273
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we've spoke before and when we </v>

150
00:07:34.711 --> 00:07:35.544
<v Speaker 1>talked about a cm punk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was fighting the first time I </v>

151
00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is stupid,</v>

152
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy is,</v>

153
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.663
<v Speaker 1>is pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stacking himself into a position to try </v>

154
00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:48.000
<v Speaker 1>to not fail by making the challenge so </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult that even if he fails,</v>

155
00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:51.240
<v Speaker 1>he don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is fully different now.</v>

156
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.333
<v Speaker 1>Like now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm cheering for him because he was </v>

157
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.950
<v Speaker 1>humiliated like he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't just fail.</v>

158
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.840
<v Speaker 1>He was humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

159
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.780
<v Speaker 1>he in front of everybody was shown to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

160
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.913
<v Speaker 1>People would judge them as weak or </v>
<v Speaker 1>people the judgment that he would feel </v>

161
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.340
<v Speaker 1>hIs bad and he sat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go do it again.</v>

162
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.413
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are now in a completely different </v>

163
00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:15.444
<v Speaker 1>context because that's a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>epically failed in front of everybody </v>

164
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.493
<v Speaker 1>and then dealt with that and now says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will try the journey again and this </v>

165
00:08:23.521 --> 00:08:27.030
<v Speaker 1>will make me a better person and I now I</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully endorse this.</v>

166
00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:27.864
<v Speaker 1>I'm cheering for him.</v>

167
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.853
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's now fighting a fighter who's </v>

168
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.703
<v Speaker 2>commensurate in talent and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing wrong with being a beginner in </v>

169
00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:34.914
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something wrong with </v>

170
00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:38.820
<v Speaker 2>thinking that you can be a beginner in </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

171
00:08:38.821 --> 00:08:43.821
<v Speaker 2>Mickey go big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a foolish venture and I wet my</v>

172
00:08:44.551 --> 00:08:45.384
<v Speaker 2>approach to it was this is going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good lesson for people that are </v>

173
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 2>fans of positive thinking and they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's enough.</v>

174
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 2>That shit is not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you weigh 110 pounds,</v>

175
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 3>you get positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think your way to the bank.</v>

176
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 3>For instance in Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still gonna punch your brains out.</v>

177
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.333
<v Speaker 3>There's just no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a guy who has really very little </v>

178
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 3>experience in martial arts and has </v>
<v Speaker 3>rudimentary control of his body.</v>

179
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I saw when I saw,</v>

180
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.200
<v Speaker 3>when I saw him training and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

181
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 3>he's killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not blind in that context and I,</v>

182
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 3>but he belongs here and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's contextual.</v>

183
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because I thought that was stupid.</v>

184
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 3>It was stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was stupid.</v>

185
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't mean in this context I </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't look and go.</v>

186
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy who didn't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't need to come back.</v>

187
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:37.704
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't need to try again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't need to go into the gym and </v>

188
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:39.954
<v Speaker 3>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the jam and everyone's going </v>

189
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:41.911
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

190
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 3>you did.</v>

191
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 3>You did good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do guy fucking failed miserably</v>

192
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 3>in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then show up there cleaning the mats</v>

193
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 3>and work really hard and said I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to try it again.</v>

194
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yes,</v>

195
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 3>that fight still him and this guy still </v>
<v Speaker 3>should take place somewhere else.</v>

196
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

197
00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.850
<v Speaker 3>it shouldn't even be on the tuesday </v>
<v Speaker 3>night contender show.</v>

198
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.571
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

199
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:01.404
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should be in some amateur event </v>

200
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what they are.</v>

201
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're guys learning how to compete.</v>

202
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

203
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.100
<v Speaker 3>during the first fight in the paper </v>
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>

204
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking crazy,</v>

205
00:10:12.761 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 3>but that has nothing to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a reflection on the company.</v>

206
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the choices that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine makes.</v>

207
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.863
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we also gave him a juicy </v>

208
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:23.010
<v Speaker 3>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

209
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.420
<v Speaker 3>in order to make that valid or viable to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make money off it.</v>

210
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Speaker 3>But that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes it,</v>

211
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 3>makes it deeper and harder and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>chances to fail epically and,</v>

212
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 3>and I lost twice in a row and then still</v>
<v Speaker 3>want it to fight again and still because</v>

213
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really want it to.</v>

214
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.913
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was important to me and it meant </v>

215
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:45.984
<v Speaker 3>something to me and I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>change as a human being by doing it and </v>

216
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:51.660
<v Speaker 3>I was ridiculed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can relate to what he's going through.</v>

217
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.510
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ended on a little show in,</v>

218
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 3>in winnipeg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manitoba.</v>

219
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.973
<v Speaker 3>We know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never have put myself in that </v>

220
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.023
<v Speaker 3>place to look bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here he is and here it is and I'm </v>

221
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:03.684
<v Speaker 3>cheering for him as a store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a human being in a weird situation </v>

222
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 3>that has been put himself into a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark,</v>

223
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:16.050
<v Speaker 3>hard spot and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my way out of this is to try really hard</v>

224
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:16.884
<v Speaker 3>and really go in and and the chance all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that I would want for him if I knew </v>

225
00:11:21.091 --> 00:11:25.290
<v Speaker 3>him and he was my friend is to fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>your way through some adverse situations</v>

226
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.260
<v Speaker 3>to be able to be in it and find when </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard,</v>

227
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 3>you discover I can handle the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's hard,</v>

228
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.240
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get up when I've been dropped or I</v>

229
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 3>can fight through not being able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathe.</v>

230
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 3>If he loses and does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will have been worth it for him.</v>

231
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 3>No matter how much ridicule he'll take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will have been worth it for him.</v>

232
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.373
<v Speaker 3>What was really weird watching them walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the cage was that he was approaching </v>

233
00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:45.984
<v Speaker 3>it liga pro wrestling fight because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had done so many of these pro wrestling </v>

234
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:52.230
<v Speaker 3>matches that he was walking to the cage </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like pro wrestling,</v>

235
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 3>mannerisms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and</v>

236
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.490
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was watching this and I,</v>

237
00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did like an internal head shake,</v>

238
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.840
<v Speaker 2>like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

239
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a terrible idea.</v>

240
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Like whoever on everybody's side said </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he could fight micky gall,</v>

241
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:09.724
<v Speaker 2>you're out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch that kid fight once a kid is very </v>

242
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:13.204
<v Speaker 2>good on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good at big and strong young </v>

243
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 2>standups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not bad either,</v>

244
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's tough as shit and he's smart,</v>

245
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 2>he's clever and he's mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's mean fucker.</v>

246
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 2>And that is at that stage he was maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>one to know,</v>

247
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe two,</v>

248
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.683
<v Speaker 2>but it's still the lowest level that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is in the entire elite world of </v>

249
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.470
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that it didn't matter the way.</v>

250
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you saw it,</v>

251
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.350
<v Speaker 2>you saw the wait took that guy's back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the way sinks hooks in when,</v>

252
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.080
<v Speaker 2>when he was on top and just delivered </v>
<v Speaker 2>that type.</v>

253
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

254
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 2>And you're a hundred percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if somebody is watching that?</v>

255
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.830
<v Speaker 2>That is the reality of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't really worry.</v>

256
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I'll put myself in a situation that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't win,</v>

257
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:57.850
<v Speaker 2>but I've got guts and heart and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe I'm going to do it.</v>

258
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 2>You get the metaphorical version of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>punch in the face.</v>

259
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 2>If you go through life like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes you do,</v>

260
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.873
<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't do it in fighting because </v>

261
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:07.210
<v Speaker 2>you don't want those punches in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

262
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 2>If you can avoid them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>

263
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.930
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a situation where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to prove your toughness and you</v>

264
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:14.764
<v Speaker 2>want to be battled against someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your skill level and try to figure </v>

265
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 2>your way through the maze of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>contest.</v>

266
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.813
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What doesn't make sense is getting </v>

267
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 2>punched in the face unnecessarily and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you fight,</v>

268
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I looked at that fight,</v>

269
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>micky gall is gonna smash him.</v>

270
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 2>This is just how it's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very few fights where I can tell</v>

271
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:35.970
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is absolutely gonna happen.</v>

272
00:13:35.971 --> 00:13:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a perfect example,</v>

273
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.790
<v Speaker 2>rob hoffeld dose on joe's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

274
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.663
<v Speaker 2>against a colby covington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck's gonna </v>

275
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.031
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No idea.</v>

276
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

277
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.670
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna.</v>

278
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Throw down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

279
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Micky gall versus,</v>

280
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.650
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

281
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.000
<v Speaker 2>so I forgot to cm punk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his real name?</v>

282
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Phil jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

283
00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.180
<v Speaker 2>hardman fucking fill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

284
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cm punk.</v>

285
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

286
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Jamie brooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brooks brooks.</v>

287
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Phil brooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry phil.</v>

288
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he's.</v>

289
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.940
<v Speaker 2>This is a terrible idea because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to get pr.</v>

290
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.833
<v Speaker 2>You can only get punched in the face so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many times in your life and you have a </v>

291
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the number is,</v>

292
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:15.184
<v Speaker 2>everybody's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark hunt's number seems to be </v>

293
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:17.560
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily high.</v>

294
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that could just take</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and this is true,</v>

295
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.533
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want it when you can avoid it </v>

296
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.863
<v Speaker 2>and he could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to avoid it in that </v>

297
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:27.484
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to get smashed and less </v>

298
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:29.663
<v Speaker 2>make it caught a crazy arm bar early in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight and that was what he gave him </v>

299
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

300
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's getting his face smashed in and you</v>

301
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:38.440
<v Speaker 2>should not do that if you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead that.</v>

302
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:39.643
<v Speaker 2>As I remember when we spoke about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unconscious incompetence and that </v>

303
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:44.973
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know what you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a really fucking weird place </v>

304
00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:51.990
<v Speaker 2>to be and we go through life that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of times</v>

305
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of different contexts until you</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out,</v>

306
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious incompetence where like,</v>

307
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about this.</v>

308
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.373
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't even at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's at that point and he has a </v>

309
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:03.890
<v Speaker 1>lower level thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

310
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.630
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>

311
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.820
<v Speaker 1>it was a mistake to start down this </v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

312
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.280
<v Speaker 1>But you're down at now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on it now.</v>

313
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.760
<v Speaker 1>So I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

314
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.910
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's taken what,</v>

315
00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:16.744
<v Speaker 2>two years since I've been about two </v>
<v Speaker 2>years getting there and we've </v>

316
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:21.663
<v Speaker 2>subsequently got to see micky gall and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some contests against some really tough </v>

317
00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:27.180
<v Speaker 2>guys and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

318
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.380
<v Speaker 2>beat some good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we got to see like,</v>

319
00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:31.060
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid is fucking for real,</v>

320
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:36.040
<v Speaker 2>which is what we suspected all along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know anything about phil.</v>

321
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 2>We haven't seen him spar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't seen retrained.</v>

322
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:43.030
<v Speaker 2>But from what I saw when I first saw him</v>
<v Speaker 2>training the first,</v>

323
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first saw him sparring and moving</v>

324
00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:46.144
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

325
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.220
<v Speaker 2>got damaged a lot of work to be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

326
00:15:48.221 --> 00:15:49.054
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like first steps of everest work to be </v>

327
00:15:50.891 --> 00:15:51.820
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

328
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:52.720
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

329
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.340
<v Speaker 2>we're not talking about a guy who has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep background in martial arts.</v>

330
00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.293
<v Speaker 2>Like brock lesnar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no wrestling is absolutely a martial </v>

331
00:16:00.371 --> 00:16:01.204
<v Speaker 2>art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a legit top of the food chain </v>

332
00:16:04.061 --> 00:16:06.130
<v Speaker 2>amateur wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a fucking monster</v>

333
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.220
<v Speaker 1>and a physical monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that.</v>

334
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.640
<v Speaker 1>And a psychological monster like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting his skills for sure.</v>

335
00:16:12.641 --> 00:16:17.641
<v Speaker 1>But it's your body and the mind and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a heavy competitor,</v>

336
00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:18.814
<v Speaker 1>when you focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're able to focus in the </v>

337
00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:23.980
<v Speaker 1>deepest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most fearful conditions,</v>

338
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.890
<v Speaker 1>a brock lesnar did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

339
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.600
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically when you're aware,</v>

340
00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:29.434
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're aware of where your body is in </v>

341
00:16:30.731 --> 00:16:33.790
<v Speaker 1>space and how to control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can take a lifetime.</v>

342
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.430
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a weird one,</v>

343
00:16:36.431 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

344
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.950
<v Speaker 2>something you also develop as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a young kid.</v>

345
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're in your developmental </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

346
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.150
<v Speaker 2>13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14,</v>

347
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:44.984
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're body's growing and it's growing </v>

348
00:16:46.401 --> 00:16:50.450
<v Speaker 2>into whipping kicks and punches and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting takedowns and landing chokes.</v>

349
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.403
<v Speaker 2>Your body develops that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're a full grown man in your </v>

350
00:16:54.771 --> 00:16:55.604
<v Speaker 2>thirties and then you're starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>throw roundhouse kicks and front kicks </v>

351
00:16:58.221 --> 00:16:58.530
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

352
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.070
<v Speaker 2>your body's all goofy and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>

353
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.510
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

354
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:04.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not pliable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not elastic.</v>

355
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.040
<v Speaker 2>It says that you're a different animal.</v>

356
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.790
<v Speaker 1>You can still learn anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You at 50 years old,</v>

357
00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:15.420
<v Speaker 1>you can take up anything in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can take anything and you should.</v>

358
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be shitting,</v>

359
00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into the nfl where they.</v>

360
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Or if you start to play a piano when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 50,</v>

361
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you should learn to play piano and show </v>
<v Speaker 1>all your friends,</v>

362
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the song or.</v>

363
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.950
<v Speaker 1>But you can't go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.933
<v Speaker 1>be in a concert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piano scenario where you're going to </v>

365
00:17:29.011 --> 00:17:31.020
<v Speaker 1>fail and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing it and saying,</v>

366
00:17:31.021 --> 00:17:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe doesn't make a difference when</v>

367
00:17:34.561 --> 00:17:37.740
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't physically or mentally or </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically do these things.</v>

368
00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:38.574
<v Speaker 1>But I still think learning and growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and chasing things and self improvement </v>

369
00:17:42.421 --> 00:17:43.620
<v Speaker 1>is the root of who we are.</v>

370
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:44.760
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

371
00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I think it is too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't be a 34 year old man who's</v>

372
00:17:48.181 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 2>never box a day your life and have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal</v>

373
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.510
<v Speaker 3>to in 12 months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight loma chanko no.</v>

374
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 3>It's never going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it does happen,</v>

375
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.284
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna be a disaster and that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>are giant exceptions like one in a </v>

376
00:18:03.571 --> 00:18:05.250
<v Speaker 3>million of things where people do </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

377
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.830
<v Speaker 3>but there's always some other </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation.</v>

378
00:18:07.831 --> 00:18:08.664
<v Speaker 3>And often it is as a youth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they created the neuro pathways in the </v>

379
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:14.580
<v Speaker 3>physicality and the connection to their </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

380
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was uh,</v>

381
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 3>I did gymnastics when I was a kid and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>love it.</v>

382
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.880
<v Speaker 3>It's great big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

383
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 3>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

384
00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:22.570
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

385
00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.010
<v Speaker 3>it helps you physically understand where</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body is.</v>

386
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.233
<v Speaker 3>And so later on in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always at least okay at sports </v>

387
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.223
<v Speaker 3>because I understood how to move my body</v>
<v Speaker 3>in space and I understood where my hand </v>

388
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 3>was compared to my foot and how I </v>
<v Speaker 3>balanced.</v>

389
00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.573
<v Speaker 3>And to learn that as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who was a master of something </v>

390
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:42.510
<v Speaker 3>as a kid who had 30 picks up.</v>

391
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.343
<v Speaker 3>Another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has some really advanced learning </v>

392
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:45.774
<v Speaker 3>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are exceptions that we see rare </v>

393
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:49.110
<v Speaker 3>exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

394
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 3>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean reality still reality.</v>

395
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I wonder too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if those exceptions are genetic,</v>

396
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:56.860
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if like maybe perhaps someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>in their family.</v>

397
00:18:56.861 --> 00:18:59.610
<v Speaker 3>It was a great athlete and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>transferred through their genes,</v>

398
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.940
<v Speaker 3>which I am as I get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a firm believer in,</v>

399
00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.013
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think we know enough about </v>

400
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 3>what transfers through genes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's some freaky shit I see in my</v>

401
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 3>kids in particular where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

402
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:15.350
<v Speaker 3>that is my fucking personality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something.</v>

403
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.393
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not teaching her to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something that's in her like </v>

404
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:23.430
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The repetitive like exercise,</v>

405
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.970
<v Speaker 3>like doing things over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obsessive lee,</v>

406
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.113
<v Speaker 3>like there's some weird shit that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I wonder if that's a neuropathway </v>

407
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.000
<v Speaker 3>that's passed down through the dna.</v>

408
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.143
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just seems like there could be a </v>

409
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:37.224
<v Speaker 3>person who's never engaged in athletics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe their grandfather was like a </v>

410
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:40.554
<v Speaker 3>world champion boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one day they put on the gloves </v>

411
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.560
<v Speaker 3>and then they just sorta like start </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving around and the coach was like,</v>

412
00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck's going on here?</v>

413
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Where did you learn?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or three job like that.</v>

414
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm forgetting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Francis and ghana's coach's name,</v>

415
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 3>I forget his name is fernando lopez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

416
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 3>He's a wonderful guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a smart guy.</v>

417
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.473
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been around like the best of the </v>

418
00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:07.650
<v Speaker 3>best through europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in Cameroon to France and these areas</v>

419
00:20:07.651 --> 00:20:08.484
<v Speaker 3>and he's seen the best of the best that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that genetic crop of humans has to </v>

420
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:12.774
<v Speaker 3>offer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then francis and got it walks into </v>

421
00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:15.264
<v Speaker 3>his gym and you've talked to yo next </v>
<v Speaker 3>time you see fernand to ask him about </v>

422
00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:21.054
<v Speaker 3>this because you see his eyes light up </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that thing where this like a color </v>

423
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:24.654
<v Speaker 3>in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

424
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just knew,</v>

425
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:29.370
<v Speaker 3>like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched him do things in his awareness</v>

426
00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:31.980
<v Speaker 3>of his body and how he could physically </v>
<v Speaker 3>express himself.</v>

427
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:33.750
<v Speaker 3>He said he'd just never seen anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it.</v>

428
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:34.860
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

429
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:36.360
<v Speaker 3>week one in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

430
00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:39.180
<v Speaker 3>first sparring session,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't really know how to fight yet,</v>

431
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.253
<v Speaker 3>but he said he saw him adapting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning within the round against </v>

432
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:45.990
<v Speaker 3>somebody who knew how to fight and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it in his eyes.</v>

433
00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He literally found fucking unicorn</v>

434
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:52.120
<v Speaker 1>that just strolled in off the street and</v>
<v Speaker 1>came in and then he was like,</v>

435
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's had some work ethic,</v>

436
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:55.240
<v Speaker 1>if he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

437
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's passionate about this,</v>

438
00:20:57.371 --> 00:21:00.430
<v Speaker 1>if he can commit and learn and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes physically,</v>

439
00:21:00.431 --> 00:21:02.770
<v Speaker 1>genetically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this human being,</v>

440
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:06.160
<v Speaker 1>the length of his bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speed of his neurology,</v>

441
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:06.994
<v Speaker 1>all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said you just knew and you see it in </v>

442
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:10.564
<v Speaker 1>his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

443
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.250
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must have been wild.</v>

444
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.383
<v Speaker 1>It must have been wild to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to experience that when you have a </v>

445
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:17.830
<v Speaker 1>lifetime of seeing.</v>

446
00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that scene in the color of </v>

447
00:21:21.341 --> 00:21:22.174
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever saw that movie </v>

448
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 2>was with paul move Paul Newman and tom </v>
<v Speaker 2>cruise.</v>

449
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.710
<v Speaker 2>When Paul Newman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's tom cruise,</v>

450
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:31.890
<v Speaker 2>break the balls for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns a rose.</v>

451
00:21:31.891 --> 00:21:35.410
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on over here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he looks over and he sees his kid.</v>

452
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.573
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain people that just have </v>

453
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:38.764
<v Speaker 2>this crazy talent and when someone has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been around for a long time as a coach </v>

454
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:43.294
<v Speaker 2>and had a bunch of untalented or </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably talented are very talented </v>

455
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:47.891
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

456
00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:48.724
<v Speaker 2>this big stew of humans come into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gym and you see that one unicorn that </v>

457
00:21:52.601 --> 00:21:55.600
<v Speaker 2>steps in and he's also a case where his </v>
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>

458
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:56.643
<v Speaker 2>I mean he doesn't have a backer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have a background in martial </v>

459
00:21:58.241 --> 00:21:59.074
<v Speaker 2>arts before you started training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his father was a great street </v>

460
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:06.301
<v Speaker 2>fighter and it's entirely possible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something was carried on through him or</v>

461
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:07.763
<v Speaker 1>something was present in both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That allowed them both to be capable of </v>

462
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:11.584
<v Speaker 1>doing that rather than the learn to pass</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know how that passes </v>

463
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.413
<v Speaker 1>genetically from behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that genetically we may behave </v>

464
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 1>similar to our parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our kids.</v>

465
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.090
<v Speaker 1>We don't know if that came from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

466
00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:26.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

467
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:27.453
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the oldest weirdly uncomfortable </v>

468
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.653
<v Speaker 1>thinking about genetics because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that we're limited by </v>

469
00:22:36.881 --> 00:22:39.100
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that we're not on some level,</v>

470
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.420
<v Speaker 1>but we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

471
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.820
<v Speaker 1>but we're not going to play basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

472
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.190
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since lebron james.</v>

473
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.750
<v Speaker 1>But if we identified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

474
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not where we do,</v>

475
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to go well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

476
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:51.643
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

477
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.720
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some truths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm five foot six on a tall day.</v>

478
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Like that is a genetic limitation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is undeniable.</v>

479
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.273
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we're looking at things and we </v>

480
00:23:05.141 --> 00:23:05.974
<v Speaker 1>decide that our genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen the movie gattica I've </v>

481
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 1>ever seen them and I did see them moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time ago.</v>

482
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.220
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my favorite movies ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

483
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.590
<v Speaker 1>So ethan hawke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethan hawke.</v>

484
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think of him as uma thurman.</v>

485
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's in it.</v>

486
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 1>But I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think of him because he used to be</v>

487
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:24.490
<v Speaker 1>married to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

488
00:23:24.491 --> 00:23:25.324
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's houma thurman thurman in that </v>

489
00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:31.384
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brother is genetically superior to </v>

490
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:35.650
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he beats his brother in the swimming</v>

491
00:23:35.651 --> 00:23:37.870
<v Speaker 1>contests all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end his brothers like,</v>

492
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

493
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I never saved anything for the swim </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

494
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.240
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to swim to the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

495
00:23:43.241 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 1>and his brothers like there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking other side,</v>

496
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 1>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's a movie,</v>

497
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.050
<v Speaker 1>but it was a mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

498
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.260
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is that like talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

499
00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 1>so you're talented at certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's talents,</v>

500
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 1>a certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francis and Ghana,</v>

501
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.773
<v Speaker 1>talented talent multiplied by effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>equals skill and skill multiplied by </v>

502
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:08.060
<v Speaker 1>effort equals accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So effort counts twice,</v>

503
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Effort counts fucking twice,</v>

504
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:11.063
<v Speaker 2>but then you get effort with a talented </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy with freak genetics like a lebron </v>

505
00:24:14.731 --> 00:24:17.700
<v Speaker 2>james or a Michael Jordan or brock </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesnar,</v>

506
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.450
<v Speaker 2>and then you get some crazy</v>

507
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.360
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

508
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:21.253
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big time.</v>

509
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:26.260
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who doesn't have the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent but had effort twice.</v>

510
00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Effort was applied twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll go as far as the man or woman will</v>

511
00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:32.294
<v Speaker 1>go as far as they possibly could to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actualize their true potential by </v>

512
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:40.250
<v Speaker 1>committing themselves to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to effort and not going well.</v>

513
00:24:40.251 --> 00:24:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So forget it.</v>

514
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:44.030
<v Speaker 1>By applying effort over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>

515
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:45.043
<v Speaker 1>And then once you've developed talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more effort to take that talent and do </v>

516
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:48.194
<v Speaker 1>something that twice used effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get you as far as you possibly </v>

517
00:24:51.651 --> 00:24:52.760
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you say,</v>

518
00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:53.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gifted,</v>

519
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talented so I won't put any </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>

520
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:57.134
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea how far you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I absolutely cannot beat francis and </v>

521
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.890
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by not thinking that I'm too limited</v>

522
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:06.320
<v Speaker 1>by my jeans and continuing to apply </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>

523
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:07.154
<v Speaker 1>regardless of my jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get to the best possible place I </v>

524
00:25:09.831 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 1>can as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

525
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.853
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that on some you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go down some road that you </v>

526
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.373
<v Speaker 1>cannot be accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also don't want to not go down </v>

527
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 1>roads because you're not genetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>predisposed to them.</v>

528
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I think effort can get you somewhere.</v>

529
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.943
<v Speaker 2>It definitely can get you somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think what we're talking about </v>

530
00:25:27.721 --> 00:25:30.150
<v Speaker 2>here is what I love about life is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's messy.</v>

531
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:31.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there's not,</v>

532
00:25:31.561 --> 00:25:35.130
<v Speaker 2>it's not one plus one is two zeros and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>

533
00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:38.610
<v Speaker 2>It's just there's a bunch of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does a lot of shit going on man.</v>

534
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.430
<v Speaker 2>And that's why when something magical </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes place,</v>

535
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.530
<v Speaker 2>when you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

536
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>george st pierre,</v>

537
00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:47.340
<v Speaker 2>or when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a mighty mouse,</v>

538
00:25:47.341 --> 00:25:49.140
<v Speaker 2>when you get someone who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

539
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.430
<v Speaker 2>look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

540
00:25:50.431 --> 00:25:54.990
<v Speaker 2>there's so many factors that lead you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be gennady golovkin.</v>

541
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Now there's so many different things </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to fall into place.</v>

542
00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Or here's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

543
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.523
<v Speaker 2>how about michael bisping?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael bisping is just one of the </v>

544
00:26:04.741 --> 00:26:08.720
<v Speaker 2>toughest motherfuckers ever example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

545
00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:09.623
<v Speaker 2>But you found the perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael bisbing is one of the toughest </v>

546
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.560
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not extraordinarily talented in any</v>

547
00:26:16.561 --> 00:26:20.100
<v Speaker 2>one form of mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not like the fastest guy.</v>

548
00:26:20.101 --> 00:26:23.580
<v Speaker 2>He's not the strongest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have this great background in</v>

549
00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:26.670
<v Speaker 2>brazilian jujitsu where he's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldclass strangler.</v>

550
00:26:26.671 --> 00:26:28.320
<v Speaker 2>And if he gets your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

551
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.830
<v Speaker 2>There's none of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just tough as fuck.</v>

552
00:26:31.831 --> 00:26:34.410
<v Speaker 2>And he's one of the most mentally strong</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

553
00:26:34.411 --> 00:26:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Like even tim kennedy who was here the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day,</v>

554
00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.010
<v Speaker 2>tim kennedy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>

555
00:26:38.011 --> 00:26:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I hate to give them a compliment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's so fucking tough.</v>

556
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't deny them.</v>

557
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.160
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

558
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.000
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

559
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:44.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that goes right back to this,</v>

560
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:48.120
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is at the root of </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions about life,</v>

561
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.903
<v Speaker 1>was michael bisbing genetically tough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he genetically mentally tough or did </v>

562
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.323
<v Speaker 1>work really hard and just push himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>through things and that one day when it </v>

563
00:26:57.481 --> 00:26:59.280
<v Speaker 1>got really fucking tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't give up,</v>

564
00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:01.110
<v Speaker 1>which taught him that he shouldn't give </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

565
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:04.210
<v Speaker 1>which taught him to go even further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made him push himself like,</v>

566
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 1>or was it in all likelihood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's both.</v>

567
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.960
<v Speaker 1>But michael bisping free of that effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>to continue to because what's his name?</v>

568
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Think of the mentally toughest guy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

569
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I have a thing with names sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even names I know I'll describe.</v>

570
00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 1>You guys got a chain and he's howling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he does power slam,</v>

571
00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but I can't think of ramp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of rampage,</v>

572
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.780
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a big elbows.</v>

573
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.510
<v Speaker 1>You've had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably on the podcast,</v>

574
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.870
<v Speaker 1>a tough hairy chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

575
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.073
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who am I thinking of 170 pounds fought </v>

576
00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:39.080
<v Speaker 1>demian maia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm matt brown.</v>

577
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.943
<v Speaker 1>Matt brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

578
00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:41.163
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

579
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.280
<v Speaker 1>But that's exactly what I can literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally say all these things,</v>

580
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 1>but the name will escape me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange thing.</v>

581
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Happens to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

582
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I worked with john.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're early in the morning,</v>

583
00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:56.613
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked with john ramm dean for years </v>

584
00:27:57.691 --> 00:28:00.600
<v Speaker 1>is one of my best friends and he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally just see it in my eyes,</v>

585
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:03.280
<v Speaker 1>just like I won't have the name and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw out one or two of those factoids.</v>

586
00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:04.810
<v Speaker 1>And you always had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like matt brown.</v>

587
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 1>So that's why having good friends to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work with is great.</v>

588
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Will know your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

589
00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 1>But talking to him about brandon on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

590
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing an interview with them.</v>

591
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the mentally toughest guys</v>

592
00:28:16.531 --> 00:28:17.410
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that,</v>

593
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

594
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.243
<v Speaker 1>if I think I'm mentally tough for one </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment I will not do all of the things </v>

595
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 1>necessary to walk in mentally tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

596
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:27.880
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

597
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:28.763
<v Speaker 1>I am not mentally tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mental toughness is a result of all </v>

598
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:32.844
<v Speaker 1>of the hard work and preparation that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have done to be able to do it in that </v>

599
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you heard it in his voice.</v>

600
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 1>He had no doubt that this was so and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think he's right.</v>

601
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.530
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's right.</v>

602
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:44.523
<v Speaker 2>I think he's ready to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also mentally tough because he </v>

603
00:28:46.371 --> 00:28:47.204
<v Speaker 2>also does those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that about matt </v>

604
00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:53.480
<v Speaker 2>brown that separates him is that empties</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in the cage.</v>

605
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.670
<v Speaker 2>He separates himself from the pack </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he.</v>

606
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.350
<v Speaker 2>He's so ferocious like that guys for </v>
<v Speaker 2>roche's.</v>

607
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he stepped into the cage,</v>

608
00:29:02.181 --> 00:29:04.280
<v Speaker 2>we were watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're doing a fight companion,</v>

609
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:08.180
<v Speaker 2>but we're maybe we were wearing anyway </v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

610
00:29:08.181 --> 00:29:11.720
<v Speaker 2>when he stepped into the cage and fought</v>
<v Speaker 2>diego sanchez,</v>

611
00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:12.873
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he stepped into the octagon and </v>

612
00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:17.630
<v Speaker 2>screamed and roared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was literally like an animal.</v>

613
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:18.703
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was for veracity defined and that's </v>

614
00:29:21.861 --> 00:29:23.030
<v Speaker 2>just how we fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

615
00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:26.480
<v Speaker 2>That guy just empties out like whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck he's got.</v>

616
00:29:26.481 --> 00:29:27.920
<v Speaker 2>He's not holding anything back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

617
00:29:27.921 --> 00:29:29.090
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes for it.</v>

618
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about fight and art,</v>

619
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.420
<v Speaker 1>to me that's an art of human expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that is to be a capable.</v>

620
00:29:39.221 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean whether you're you're doing jazz </v>
<v Speaker 1>or punk rock,</v>

621
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:43.893
<v Speaker 1>it's human expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether your matt brown or your some </v>

622
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 1>elegant mover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still the same art at its root.</v>

623
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.560
<v Speaker 1>But you remember that elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fired on diego sanchez fight.</v>

624
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 1>It was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are these moments.</v>

625
00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:57.394
<v Speaker 1>Are there a lot when you're analyzing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and looking at it from that </v>

626
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:03.180
<v Speaker 1>other perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fight ending moments are there.</v>

627
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:06.400
<v Speaker 1>They're there are way more often than </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys realize.</v>

628
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 1>But when they spot them like matt did in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that moment,</v>

629
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a free shot from an angle.</v>

630
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Time has slowed down enough that I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

631
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I can see the little red arc of where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going and I'm going to put this,</v>

632
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to end this fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a visceral like,</v>

633
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.190
<v Speaker 1>like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

634
00:30:24.191 --> 00:30:28.620
<v Speaker 1>When people look at you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see just like that.</v>

635
00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.340
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking art to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But watch the lefthand,</v>

636
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.680
<v Speaker 1>the reach and the hold and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no doubt what,</v>

637
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.980
<v Speaker 1>what's happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt</v>

638
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:40.023
<v Speaker 4>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go cinches is another curious example </v>

639
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:45.010
<v Speaker 4>because he's also a guy who is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ferocious,</v>

640
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.073
<v Speaker 4>like a ferociously tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's always been something about </v>

641
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 4>his movements that makes him come up </v>
<v Speaker 4>short against the best of the best.</v>

642
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 4>And I mean you're talking about a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's so fucking mentally tough as well.</v>

643
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:00.304
<v Speaker 4>Like I always bring his fight against </v>
<v Speaker 4>jake ellenberger who is a brutal </v>

644
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.220
<v Speaker 4>knockout artists at one 70 and diego </v>
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>

645
00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:08.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean diego fought at 1:45,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember?</v>

646
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:13.270
<v Speaker 4>And diego really is a tweener.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a little too small for 55.</v>

647
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the fuck he made it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>1:45.</v>

648
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:20.431
<v Speaker 4>He basically starved as body away and </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably did some irreversible damage.</v>

649
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:25.950
<v Speaker 4>But he feels like his movements are </v>
<v Speaker 4>always just shy of elite.</v>

650
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:29.230
<v Speaker 4>And I've always wondered what is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like?</v>

651
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like even if you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back to that clip again,</v>

652
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.660
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>

653
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:38.330
<v Speaker 4>But there's something about even the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>he steps in,</v>

654
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.340
<v Speaker 4>he's not stepping the way a tj dillashaw</v>
<v Speaker 4>steps,</v>

655
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.820
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so,</v>

656
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it as his sort of intention.</v>

657
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:51.850
<v Speaker 1>It's his over into god that is so nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty and so perfect.</v>

658
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.670
<v Speaker 1>But I see he wants it badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he is.</v>

659
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.653
<v Speaker 1>He's over engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's psychological as much as </v>

660
00:31:57.971 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 1>anything I would say in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in albuquerque.</v>

661
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The placement of the lefthand there.</v>

662
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.260
<v Speaker 1>There's just no doubt where this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

663
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:06.303
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

664
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.160
<v Speaker 1>And it is the moment that matt brown </v>
<v Speaker 1>created,</v>

665
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:14.100
<v Speaker 1>like he created that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see hairy chest until jerry.</v>

666
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.890
<v Speaker 1>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my reminder cues,</v>

667
00:32:17.891 --> 00:32:18.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

668
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

669
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I think so I watched diego train in </v>
<v Speaker 1>albuquerque and I love that guy.</v>

670
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I was there doing interviewing cub who </v>
<v Speaker 1>is my favorite artists probably to watch</v>

671
00:32:30.221 --> 00:32:31.054
<v Speaker 1>for many reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really sure exactly why people </v>

672
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:35.590
<v Speaker 1>can't tell you why their favorite band </v>
<v Speaker 1>is their favorite band.</v>

673
00:32:35.591 --> 00:32:37.630
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell there aren't many things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can describe,</v>

674
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.580
<v Speaker 1>but I was there to interview him for </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster zim.</v>

675
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a website in South Korea that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I became a freelancer,</v>

676
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.790
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to give you some work.</v>

677
00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:49.191

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cub swanson.</v>

681
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bad ass.</v>

682
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:57.350

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to send me to albuquerque,</v>

683
00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:58.203
<v Speaker 1>and then I hung out in the gym and </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze them and watched and made notes </v>

684
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:01.574
<v Speaker 1>about what I could and diego and super </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense and he does everything super </v>

685
00:33:05.981 --> 00:33:06.814
<v Speaker 1>intense and and as much as he loves yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the different types of yoga and </v>

686
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 1>meditation has allowed him to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

687
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:17.910
<v Speaker 1>That hyper intensity I think doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow the sort of soft relaxation that's</v>

688
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:20.870
<v Speaker 1>necessary to really do what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>

689
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.093
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

690
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.083
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the one of the things that people </v>

691
00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:25.124
<v Speaker 2>don't understand about striking hard and</v>
<v Speaker 2>having real power is that you're not </v>

692
00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:34.040
<v Speaker 2>fully tense through the entire movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of parts of striking where</v>

693
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 2>the momentum starts and you're almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like completely loose.</v>

694
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.133
<v Speaker 2>Like up until instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the point of contact and then </v>

695
00:33:43.011 --> 00:33:44.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this,</v>

696
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.900
<v Speaker 2>there's this weird thing that real </v>
<v Speaker 2>knockout artists have that you don't see</v>

697
00:33:50.211 --> 00:33:55.211
<v Speaker 2>in these fucking tense windmill guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Windmill guys are too tight.</v>

698
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.353
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a guy like ray robinson will throw </v>

699
00:33:58.221 --> 00:33:59.510
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a,</v>

700
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:03.950
<v Speaker 2>there was a gene fullmer ray robinson </v>
<v Speaker 2>kao clip from the other night.</v>

701
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

702
00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:05.283
<v Speaker 2>I was watching online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must have watched like 13 times in a </v>

703
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:09.260
<v Speaker 2>row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you watch them land this thing.</v>

704
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:11.960
<v Speaker 2>It was a left hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you watched the punchline.</v>

705
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:14.570
<v Speaker 2>He liked jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this nap that,</v>

706
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 2>that guy had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that snap is not,</v>

707
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not fully tents.</v>

708
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Here it is right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

709
00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:24.840
<v Speaker 2>look how soft it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple.</v>

710
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soft.</v>

711
00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.670
<v Speaker 2>But look at that lead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that left hook right there.</v>

712
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.560
<v Speaker 2>That one's softens them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ties him up.</v>

713
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.260
<v Speaker 2>But everything is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

714
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:35.300
<v Speaker 2>swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

715
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an amazing boxer dude.</v>

716
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:42.470
<v Speaker 2>And you're talking about a guy who had </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 100 and something fights,</v>

717
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:44.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost gentle,</v>

718
00:34:44.301 --> 00:34:46.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's soft is the right word.</v>

719
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Suppleness there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

720
00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a calmness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a relaxation and mentally too,</v>

721
00:34:50.651 --> 00:34:54.120
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that idea of there's a storm going on in</v>

722
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.600
<v Speaker 1>the middle of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this calm area,</v>

723
00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.930
<v Speaker 1>that gentleness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

724
00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.550
<v Speaker 1>that calmness has to be in your mind to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow you to do this.</v>

725
00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's where diego is,</v>

726
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just look at that,</v>

727
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that left hook right here,</v>

728
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:09.854
<v Speaker 2>here it is pink yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even just to create that moment and </v>

729
00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:14.970
<v Speaker 2>to see that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

730
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:20.030
<v Speaker 2>and to set it up and lay traps and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the guys moving his hands down,</v>

731
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.983
<v Speaker 2>see when he's coming forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see his patterns and 10 they can do </v>

732
00:35:23.151 --> 00:35:23.984
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

733
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 2>yup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yup.</v>

734
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.780
<v Speaker 2>But it's that kind of power in that left</v>
<v Speaker 2>hook that does not come from.</v>

735
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 2>That's just this little twists that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does like come on,</v>

736
00:35:37.801 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but here</v>

737
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 1>it is right here in slow mo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

738
00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's just hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I did.</v>

739
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you saw it or I think you saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

740
00:35:45.481 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I did a little breakdown of your kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did see that.</v>

741
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was.</v>

742
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.310
<v Speaker 1>So zooming in on was this double </v>
<v Speaker 1>paulson.</v>

743
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.153
<v Speaker 1>That's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

744
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.030
<v Speaker 1>That is the neurology of high athletic </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

745
00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 1>So I have these friends that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>

746
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I've gathered over the years and I love </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I do,</v>

747
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:03.954
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm happy every single day and a </v>

748
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:11.361
<v Speaker 1>big part of it is I've met these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I have these conversations with and</v>

749
00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:15.470
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're very long and deep and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've some.</v>

750
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.313
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that are a phd </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologists and this one guy dr stu </v>

751
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:20.620
<v Speaker 1>mcgill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who he is?</v>

752
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.830
<v Speaker 1>His name now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard that name.</v>

753
00:36:22.831 --> 00:36:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure somebody has mentioned it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're around different athletic</v>

754
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 1>types of all types.</v>

755
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.103
<v Speaker 1>He is the world's foremost expert in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinal cord and neurology of athletic </v>

756
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spinal cord.</v>

757
00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:35.523
<v Speaker 1>The spinal cord and how and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurology and your nerves and how your </v>

758
00:36:39.391 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 1>nervous system and george st pierre has </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked with him a lot.</v>

759
00:36:42.031 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you asked him about him this week,</v>

760
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:45.263
<v Speaker 1>he would talk about them extensively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dr stu and I became friends and it's </v>

761
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:50.454
<v Speaker 1>a big compliment because he sought me </v>
<v Speaker 1>out based on seeing my work and saying </v>

762
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:56.490
<v Speaker 1>that guy knows some things I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to him,</v>

763
00:36:56.491 --> 00:36:57.324
<v Speaker 1>which was a plaque and deep compliment </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and now we became friends and we </v>

764
00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:00.714
<v Speaker 1>chat all the time and one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>we constantly talk about is the double </v>

765
00:37:03.901 --> 00:37:08.580
<v Speaker 1>pulse in neurology and people talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>fast twitch fiber.</v>

766
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not a fiber as that's just terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've started to hear.</v>

767
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a fast twitch neurology.</v>

768
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.410
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a base,</v>

769
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.080
<v Speaker 1>a fast ball hitters have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

770
00:37:19.081 --> 00:37:22.340
<v Speaker 1>That neurology where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

771
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.513
<v Speaker 1>there's a pulse of tension and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete relaxation until the pulse of </v>

772
00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:28.194
<v Speaker 1>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

773
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.560
<v Speaker 1>the bruce lee's one inch punch was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple example of that,</v>

774
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.453
<v Speaker 1>but that is how that is the neurology of</v>
<v Speaker 1>high athletic performance and that's </v>

775
00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:39.120
<v Speaker 1>what I zoomed in on when I was looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at your kid because you can see it quite</v>

776
00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:40.740
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is the moment,</v>

777
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.540
<v Speaker 1>there's the relaxing those and it ends </v>
<v Speaker 1>up being more of a whip and stewart Dr.</v>

778
00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.373
<v Speaker 1>Stewart has all these incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogies because he's examined this in </v>

779
00:37:48.541 --> 00:37:49.374
<v Speaker 1>so many different angles and layers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the beauty of analyzing </v>

780
00:37:52.051 --> 00:37:52.884
<v Speaker 1>anything for years and he'll use terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can't shoot a cannon out of a </v>

781
00:37:56.881 --> 00:37:59.010
<v Speaker 1>canoe and you think about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

782
00:37:59.011 --> 00:38:03.300
<v Speaker 1>of course with canoes all wobbly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's tense and then shoots or you</v>

783
00:38:03.301 --> 00:38:04.920
<v Speaker 1>can't push a rope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

784
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.960
<v Speaker 1>You push a rope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

785
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.820
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can whip a rope through tension,</v>

786
00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:09.654
<v Speaker 1>relaxation and tension again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that neurology is the neurology of </v>

787
00:38:13.651 --> 00:38:16.890
<v Speaker 1>high performance and george,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked to george about neurology.</v>

788
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:17.724
<v Speaker 1>He'll go deep down some shit to george </v>
<v Speaker 1>st pierre because he studied this to </v>

789
00:38:21.181 --> 00:38:24.630
<v Speaker 1>understand himself and what he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a high level with doctors do.</v>

790
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.873
<v Speaker 1>But it is a fascinating thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think we often will say </v>

791
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.540
<v Speaker 1>fighting is 90 percent mental sipping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This cup is 100 percent mental.</v>

792
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.843
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brain told my body to reach out and </v>

793
00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:42.790
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brain made the choice.</v>

794
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I activated everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

795
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:45.754
<v Speaker 1>it's all your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and once you get to a high </v>

796
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:49.234
<v Speaker 1>level of performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how to punch and kick and you </v>

797
00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:52.414
<v Speaker 1>train like crazy and you make the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen by themselves almost by trading </v>

798
00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.920
<v Speaker 1>so much they take so little attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>and decision making.</v>

799
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 1>It becomes about maximizing your nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

800
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:01.743
<v Speaker 1>how your nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's true of almost </v>

801
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:06.670
<v Speaker 1>anything history right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

802
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:07.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That susie training with george and dr </v>

803
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.680
<v Speaker 1>stu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't see his face.</v>

804
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

805
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.750
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a bar guy and to be honest</v>
<v Speaker 1>george.</v>

806
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but got.</v>

807
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm whipping the ball around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

808
00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure exactly what he's doing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're dumbbell press,</v>

809
00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'll put you in touch with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

810
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.770
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like he's got some heavy weight</v>

811
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:31.080
<v Speaker 4>at the end of a rope.</v>

812
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess engaging the core through </v>

813
00:39:34.021 --> 00:39:35.350
<v Speaker 1>the use of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

814
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:36.503
<v Speaker 1>probably asking him to only engage </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things to counter balance the </v>

815
00:39:39.361 --> 00:39:40.194
<v Speaker 1>movement</v>

816
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:41.920
<v Speaker 4>prize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see george waring,</v>

817
00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 4>your typical a running shoe when he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>training with the thick heel.</v>

818
00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:47.524
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still surprised to this day when I </v>

819
00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:55.081
<v Speaker 4>see I'm going to talk about neurology </v>
<v Speaker 4>and activating muscles and tissues.</v>

820
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.143
<v Speaker 4>Like there's so many athletes is still </v>
<v Speaker 4>train with those big cushy bottomed </v>

821
00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:02.380
<v Speaker 4>running shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think that is crazy.</v>

822
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.700
<v Speaker 4>Big time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

823
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:04.833
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mean you should be doing that kind of </v>

824
00:40:05.621 --> 00:40:07.480
<v Speaker 4>shit barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially a fighter.</v>

825
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:08.523
<v Speaker 4>You fight barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be wearing nothing on your </v>

826
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:11.510
<v Speaker 4>feet.</v>

827
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:15.050
<v Speaker 1>The only thing connecting you to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable surface is your foot.</v>

828
00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100 percent.</v>

829
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes when we're trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of these things,</v>

830
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:25.610
<v Speaker 1>we go to multiple different sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives of it.</v>

831
00:40:25.611 --> 00:40:29.750
<v Speaker 1>So I'll take what I learned from dr stu </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's just my friend now as well.</v>

832
00:40:29.751 --> 00:40:30.584
<v Speaker 1>So I like hanging out and chatting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him about like way out there aspects of </v>

833
00:40:33.651 --> 00:40:34.484
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you talk to irwin [inaudible] as </v>

834
00:40:35.511 --> 00:40:38.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has a different sphere of connecting</v>

835
00:40:38.511 --> 00:40:39.344
<v Speaker 1>to this kind of thing in erewhon starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the foot and you've had urban on </v>

836
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:43.670
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

837
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.590
<v Speaker 1>and he starts with the foot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

838
00:40:45.591 --> 00:40:46.430
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

839
00:40:46.431 --> 00:40:47.264
<v Speaker 1>I go to throw a punch and the important </v>
<v Speaker 1>part is going to be my foot through the </v>

840
00:40:50.751 --> 00:40:51.800
<v Speaker 1>leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the hip,</v>

841
00:40:51.801 --> 00:40:55.190
<v Speaker 1>through the core and and relaxed until </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment that it hits.</v>

842
00:40:55.191 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Speaker 1>But then they'll start song is the same.</v>

843
00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.133
<v Speaker 4>when I asked nick's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me when I asked nick curse on </v>

844
00:41:00.641 --> 00:41:01.474
<v Speaker 4>about training athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what's the thing that he thinks </v>

845
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.400
<v Speaker 4>fighters work on the most?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like foot strength.</v>

846
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

847
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.570
<v Speaker 4>And I thought about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well of course.</v>

848
00:41:10.571 --> 00:41:12.250
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you push off.</v>

849
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:15.190
<v Speaker 4>That's how you move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your feet are weak and they get tired.</v>

850
00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:16.120
<v Speaker 4>You can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

851
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:17.103
<v Speaker 4>which I've experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you've experienced when your </v>

852
00:41:19.511 --> 00:41:21.520
<v Speaker 4>feet are weak and tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you.</v>

853
00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:24.520
<v Speaker 4>If you don't run and then you try to run</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the first things,</v>

854
00:41:24.521 --> 00:41:25.600
<v Speaker 4>you get tired of your feet.</v>

855
00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.173
<v Speaker 1>The very worst injury I've ever had in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my life by far was plantar fasciitis of </v>

856
00:41:32.101 --> 00:41:34.970
<v Speaker 1>both feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My last fight and I was through training</v>

857
00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:35.804
<v Speaker 1>and everything and then I had my fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>in montreal and the whole strategy was </v>

858
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.260
<v Speaker 1>put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to a place where I could be safe</v>

859
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 1>and use better knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation to fatigue the other guy.</v>

860
00:41:49.191 --> 00:41:50.024
<v Speaker 1>So the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the seven or eight minutes of </v>

861
00:41:51.561 --> 00:41:54.560
<v Speaker 1>the fight took place with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressuring him against the fence,</v>

862
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.423
<v Speaker 1>just driving off both feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressuring against the fence to try to </v>

863
00:41:57.591 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 1>land things or make create lines for </v>
<v Speaker 1>different weapons.</v>

864
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:01.453
<v Speaker 1>And it's only eight minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eight minutes of intense drive from </v>

865
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:04.934
<v Speaker 1>my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we went on vacation the very </v>

866
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:08.144
<v Speaker 1>next day and that night we grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>margarita's and we walked around the </v>

867
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:14.810
<v Speaker 1>resort and then my feet were destroyed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a acutely,</v>

868
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.240
<v Speaker 1>for three or four days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't walk.</v>

869
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And the inflammation was so unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

870
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:22.460
<v Speaker 1>It was like bricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

871
00:42:22.461 --> 00:42:24.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even for months after it was,</v>

872
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.370
<v Speaker 1>did you ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

873
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.720
<v Speaker 1>tried to ice I ice or I would get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately into the cold pool and spend</v>

874
00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:32.270
<v Speaker 1>the day in the cold pool drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>tequila and hopes that it would help.</v>

875
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:33.104
<v Speaker 1>And it kinda did</v>

876
00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.210
<v Speaker 4>foot pain is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the things that are hurt.</v>

877
00:42:39.211 --> 00:42:44.211
<v Speaker 4>Dominick cruz in his comeback fight when</v>
<v Speaker 4>he fought tj dillashaw,</v>

878
00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.020
<v Speaker 4>you notice he was kind of limping a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little.</v>

879
00:42:46.021 --> 00:42:49.260
<v Speaker 4>We were attributed to the leg kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that's not the case.</v>

880
00:42:49.261 --> 00:42:52.560
<v Speaker 4>He said what was going on was he had </v>
<v Speaker 4>plantar fasciitis because,</v>

881
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:53.493
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had multiple injuries that he was </v>

882
00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.440
<v Speaker 4>recovering from during that training </v>
<v Speaker 4>camp.</v>

883
00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:03.740
<v Speaker 4>And wHen he got knee surgery and he came</v>
<v Speaker 4>back from that and he tore his groin.</v>

884
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.500
<v Speaker 4>He tried to like really ramp up his </v>
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>

885
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:09.780
<v Speaker 4>He was doing a lot of sprinting and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of different things with his feet,</v>

886
00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:10.643
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because obviously he's very footwork </v>

887
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:14.010
<v Speaker 4>intensive with his fighting and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked his feet up.</v>

888
00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:14.844
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His feet just weren't in conditioned to </v>

889
00:43:16.351 --> 00:43:18.570
<v Speaker 4>do the kind of stuff that he used to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to do.</v>

890
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.050
<v Speaker 4>And the first thing he got was plantar </v>
<v Speaker 4>fasciitis shop had it too.</v>

891
00:43:22.051 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 4>He told me it was the worst things he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever had.</v>

892
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:25.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

893
00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.350
<v Speaker 1>think of this for the big picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning of this for dominic.</v>

894
00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:34.580
<v Speaker 1>So you got somebody else and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going about fighting and their,</v>

895
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:38.520
<v Speaker 1>their career as a martial artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a competitive fighter one way.</v>

896
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.330
<v Speaker 1>And dominic goes about a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And through dominic's choices,</v>

897
00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving training,</v>

898
00:43:44.221 --> 00:43:47.520
<v Speaker 1>footwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he avoids a lot of the damage that these</v>

899
00:43:47.521 --> 00:43:50.010
<v Speaker 1>guys will take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't avoid.</v>

900
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Something's going to go right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of taking,</v>

901
00:43:52.621 --> 00:43:55.230
<v Speaker 1>getting kicked a lot and punched in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head and taking all those things,</v>

902
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.320
<v Speaker 1>the training necessary to make that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

903
00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.110
<v Speaker 1>fucks up something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't get away from it.</v>

904
00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.750
<v Speaker 1>You're going to work yourself until your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body gives up.</v>

905
00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:04.853
<v Speaker 1>Even dom brilliantly finding a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work outside of taking the damage that </v>

906
00:44:09.031 --> 00:44:12.120
<v Speaker 1>they take still could not get away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaging his body.</v>

907
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.133
<v Speaker 4>Tj dillashaw versus cody garbrandt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rematch is one of the most </v>

908
00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:17.910
<v Speaker 4>intriguing parts of the year for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really,</v>

909
00:44:17.911 --> 00:44:18.744
<v Speaker 4>really curious about that fight because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I know those guys were tightly matched </v>

910
00:44:22.561 --> 00:44:23.394
<v Speaker 4>in the gym and I know that cody correct </v>
<v Speaker 4>him with a big right hand before tj put </v>

911
00:44:27.151 --> 00:44:30.660
<v Speaker 4>him away and so it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was stunned.</v>

912
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.513
<v Speaker 4>I mean he got rocked and I believe when </v>
<v Speaker 4>cody cracked and it was towards the end </v>

913
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 4>of the round,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>

914
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so he had an opportunity to recover.</v>

915
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:40.254
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows if he had caught that right </v>

916
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:44.130
<v Speaker 4>hand the first minute of the round what </v>
<v Speaker 4>had gone on,</v>

917
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:49.460
<v Speaker 4>but when tj recovered from that and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>lend that head kick and then knocked him</v>

918
00:44:49.711 --> 00:44:53.010
<v Speaker 4>out and put them away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to see like,</v>

919
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.520
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a high level high stakes game these</v>

920
00:44:56.521 --> 00:44:57.354
<v Speaker 4>two guys are playing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tj has through bang ludwig has really </v>

921
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:06.870
<v Speaker 4>radically improved his movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his footwork,</v>

922
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 4>his angles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his approach.</v>

923
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.630
<v Speaker 4>He's so versatile with his ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>switch stances,</v>

924
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.613
<v Speaker 4>his ability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's constantly cutting angles </v>

925
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:16.743
<v Speaker 4>and striking as you switching stances </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's so much information coming </v>

926
00:45:20.971 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 4>at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're fighting him,</v>

927
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.300
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain's overloaded.</v>

928
00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:27.420
<v Speaker 4>If you're not used to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even the guys who used to train with</v>

929
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:28.770
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in alpha male,</v>

930
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:30.930
<v Speaker 4>are not used to what he's doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

931
00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:32.090
<v Speaker 4>Because it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

932
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:32.963
<v Speaker 4>It's a at a far higher level that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cody still has a fucking missile in his </v>

933
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 4>right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so god damn fast.</v>

934
00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:41.183
<v Speaker 4>His hand speed is so fast and his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his fluidity and efficiency in his </v>

935
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:48.390
<v Speaker 4>boxing is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a very,</v>

936
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:49.620
<v Speaker 4>very interesting fight for me.</v>

937
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.120
<v Speaker 1>That's about as good as it gets right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

938
00:45:52.121 --> 00:45:57.121
<v Speaker 1>Like from the raw materials of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and the skills that they have.</v>

939
00:45:57.191 --> 00:46:00.280
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely with you as far as that.</v>

940
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.470
<v Speaker 1>My deep curiosity of the choices of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coaches because,</v>

941
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:08.050
<v Speaker 1>and you've talked to some of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ones,</v>

942
00:46:08.051 --> 00:46:09.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a few key friends that I talked</v>

943
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:13.930
<v Speaker 1>to on a very regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it will take,</v>

944
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.273
<v Speaker 1>what we would decide to do to train to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make our guy the best in the world or </v>

945
00:46:17.951 --> 00:46:19.750
<v Speaker 1>try to be the best in the world in 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

946
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:20.733
<v Speaker 1>If we take a different strategy and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to build them to be the best in </v>

947
00:46:23.321 --> 00:46:24.154
<v Speaker 1>the world in three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different game and that's what </v>

948
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.720
<v Speaker 1>dwayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwayne is sad.</v>

949
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.823
<v Speaker 1>We will and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hard work for dwayne to </v>

950
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.193
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that people won't </v>

951
00:46:35.711 --> 00:46:37.000
<v Speaker 1>necessarily appreciate it.</v>

952
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:37.441
<v Speaker 1>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

953
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:38.274
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nonstop constant searching and </v>

954
00:46:40.871 --> 00:46:41.704
<v Speaker 1>examining and trial and error and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinterpreting his language of </v>

955
00:46:46.151 --> 00:46:50.110
<v Speaker 1>understanding where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the chaos is and understanding,</v>

956
00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.153
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we make this guy believes </v>

957
00:46:52.541 --> 00:46:53.374
<v Speaker 1>something's happening or are we too deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it that he doesn't think that and it </v>

958
00:46:56.231 --> 00:46:57.064
<v Speaker 1>fails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what levels of misdirection or too </v>

959
00:46:59.651 --> 00:47:01.090
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how good is he?</v>

960
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.340
<v Speaker 1>And when I talked to them leading up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>

961
00:47:03.341 --> 00:47:04.750
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

962
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.613
<v Speaker 1>the conversation was about her making </v>
<v Speaker 1>cody believe and anticipate something </v>

963
00:47:11.051 --> 00:47:11.884
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the root of all of all </v>

964
00:47:13.091 --> 00:47:13.751
<v Speaker 1>combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

965
00:47:13.751 --> 00:47:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you make me think this is coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do this.</v>

966
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Me in the body and the layers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multiple layers,</v>

967
00:47:19.391 --> 00:47:22.090
<v Speaker 1>like you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overloading the ability to.</v>

968
00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:25.960
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to catalog what's coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how you chunk that,</v>

969
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:28.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't necessarily understand.</v>

970
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 1>So your brain be going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

971
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:33.650
<v Speaker 1>this is all the stuff from the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>which happens when this happened or the,</v>

972
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legs or doing this or you're running</v>

973
00:47:36.581 --> 00:47:38.710
<v Speaker 1>algorithms in your brain and we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

974
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:39.663
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what yours is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you categorize my </v>

975
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:42.754
<v Speaker 1>threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether you categorize </v>

976
00:47:43.271 --> 00:47:46.690
<v Speaker 1>anything from my right hand or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>in combination or if you're watching the</v>

977
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:48.700
<v Speaker 1>patterns of my shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

978
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:54.030
<v Speaker 1>So dwayne and anybody else playing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this concept is trying to figure out how</v>

979
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 1>you'll read this and use that against </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

980
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 1>And to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the layer of complete mindblowing</v>

981
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:04.960
<v Speaker 1>nature that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you say?</v>

982
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Chests with dire consequences or </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem?</v>

983
00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Solvable problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hard.</v>

984
00:48:09.431 --> 00:48:11.710
<v Speaker 1>those problems are now how many there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

985
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:12.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

986
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.210
<v Speaker 1>and it can be done at this level because</v>
<v Speaker 1>their skills are so good.</v>

987
00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.310
<v Speaker 1>they're minds are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're physically so good,</v>

988
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.840
<v Speaker 1>they're capable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fearless,</v>

989
00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:22.690
<v Speaker 1>they are confident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all of those raw materials and</v>

990
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:23.524
<v Speaker 1>now we're playing a game that most of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot comprehend and they've also </v>

991
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:27.814
<v Speaker 1>sparred countless hours together so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand each other and they've told each </v>

992
00:48:30.671 --> 00:48:34.380
<v Speaker 1>other lies for long periods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lies on lies.</v>

993
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:35.763
<v Speaker 1>I one time went with a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked for a company called the score </v>

994
00:48:38.831 --> 00:48:42.510
<v Speaker 1>fighting series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a brilliant show like it was kind</v>

995
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:43.363
<v Speaker 1>of cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bella tore like it was on the same </v>

996
00:48:44.771 --> 00:48:47.500
<v Speaker 1>network and they aired bella tour and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very,</v>

997
00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:48.334
<v Speaker 1>very good developmental league stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that company brought in forrest griffin </v>

998
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.793
<v Speaker 1>and then a bunch of poker players and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were on a train together and </v>

999
00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:57.933
<v Speaker 1>contest winners on the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to ride on this train with forrest </v>

1000
00:49:00.071 --> 00:49:00.904
<v Speaker 1>griffin and a bunch of poker high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro poker players and I was there and </v>

1001
00:49:04.691 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 1>that was the first time I met forrest </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a killer,</v>

1002
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.013
<v Speaker 1>smart dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you watch these poker players who </v>

1003
00:49:10.301 --> 00:49:11.134
<v Speaker 1>were all riding together and they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>know each other and they were just </v>

1004
00:49:12.851 --> 00:49:14.530
<v Speaker 1>telling each other lies all the time.</v>

1005
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Trying to tell stories about things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the fact that they are,</v>

1006
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative when really they're risk </v>

1007
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:21.814
<v Speaker 1>takers are trying to tell each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that make them think they're </v>

1008
00:49:23.531 --> 00:49:25.600
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really they're calculating like they</v>

1009
00:49:25.601 --> 00:49:29.410
<v Speaker 1>are telling each other lies ongoing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gambling with each other and shit,</v>

1010
00:49:29.411 --> 00:49:30.244
<v Speaker 1>it's completely degenerate generative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the kind of thing that's </v>

1011
00:49:33.581 --> 00:49:34.414
<v Speaker 1>happening on some level with these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high level fighters to making them </v>

1012
00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:38.764
<v Speaker 1>think certain things about what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will do or believe they'll do almost </v>

1013
00:49:42.101 --> 00:49:44.080
<v Speaker 1>everything they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1014
00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:49.320
<v Speaker 1>we see the fans and the audience we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should assume is a game chip is like a,</v>

1015
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:53.110
<v Speaker 1>something to make the other one believes</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that might in that moment,</v>

1016
00:49:53.111 --> 00:49:55.510
<v Speaker 1>let me land that kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he thinks that I'm,</v>

1017
00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:56.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1018
00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:58.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's manipulative stuff.</v>

1019
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:02.770
<v Speaker 1>And at that level that is just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably fascinating.</v>

1020
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.100
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

1021
00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:05.710
<v Speaker 1>When the stakes are so high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1022
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:07.270
<v Speaker 1>the kick lands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a hero,</v>

1023
00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:09.460
<v Speaker 1>the kick mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get caught with a left hook.</v>

1024
00:50:09.461 --> 00:50:10.690
<v Speaker 1>You're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1025
00:50:10.691 --> 00:50:14.930
<v Speaker 1>there's just so much at stake with every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single choice you make and all,</v>

1026
00:50:14.931 --> 00:50:15.764
<v Speaker 1>all those choices have to be almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>subconscious or semi-conscious because </v>

1027
00:50:19.691 --> 00:50:20.524
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be in the zen state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta to be flowing so everything </v>

1028
00:50:22.721 --> 00:50:24.730
<v Speaker 1>has to be prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have,</v>

1029
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're in there,</v>

1030
00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>you have</v>

1031
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.220
<v Speaker 4>to have no regrets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be able to just flow and you</v>

1032
00:50:31.221 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 4>have to be able to capitalize on any </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement,</v>

1033
00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:34.340
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any opening,</v>

1034
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:35.174
<v Speaker 4>you see you got to pounds and you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be in condition to execute all these </v>

1035
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:38.684
<v Speaker 4>things so you have to have had the </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical discipline and the mental </v>

1036
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:42.044
<v Speaker 4>fortitude to push yourself through </v>
<v Speaker 4>training to a level that you probably </v>

1037
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:45.560
<v Speaker 4>didn't think you could get to</v>

1038
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to pounce with the opening,</v>

1039
00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.660
<v Speaker 1>but what if it's a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1040
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:51.563
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if matt brown line on that </v>

1041
00:50:53.761 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 1>thing was actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one would be hard to be alive,</v>

1042
00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:58.740
<v Speaker 1>but there are other ones where it feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that one little opening.</v>

1043
00:50:58.741 --> 00:51:01.140
<v Speaker 1>But instead tj is going to catch you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>cody's line.</v>

1044
00:51:01.141 --> 00:51:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you opt to draw you into something</v>

1045
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.490
<v Speaker 4>so god damn fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to his hand,</v>

1046
00:51:05.491 --> 00:51:06.324
<v Speaker 4>speed is so ridiculously fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go back to the tom sell modified and </v>

1047
00:51:09.241 --> 00:51:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I'll made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has really never been the same again.</v>

1048
00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:13.710
<v Speaker 4>I'll made a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going into that fight was undefeated,</v>

1049
00:51:13.711 --> 00:51:14.544
<v Speaker 4>was thought to be the dark horse in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>division like will look or future world </v>

1050
00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:21.690
<v Speaker 4>champion and cody lit him up like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>christmas tree and the way he did it was</v>

1051
00:51:21.691 --> 00:51:22.524
<v Speaker 4>so definitive that you like jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there can be no doubt this guy has </v>

1052
00:51:26.851 --> 00:51:29.090
<v Speaker 4>real world championship potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1053
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:34.140
<v Speaker 4>and I think that the duane ludwig factor</v>
<v Speaker 4>is so fucking huge.</v>

1054
00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:35.460
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really do.</v>

1055
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:40.170
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen dwayne's work in like dwayne,</v>

1056
00:51:40.171 --> 00:51:41.004
<v Speaker 4>unlike a lot of guys has notebooks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>binders full of ideas and his system is </v>

1057
00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:51.000
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very declared system.</v>

1058
00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:54.810
<v Speaker 4>It's not like loosely based where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>always work off the jab.</v>

1059
00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:55.820
<v Speaker 4>We've got good footwork.</v>

1060
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.730
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's none of that.</v>

1061
00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:58.183
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a system to his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he has a belt system to his style </v>

1062
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.920
<v Speaker 4>and his style is based on for people </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know.</v>

1063
00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:09.460
<v Speaker 4>Dwayne was a world class kickboxer </v>
<v Speaker 4>worldclass,</v>

1064
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:11.490
<v Speaker 4>muy thai fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean fought ramon dekkers,</v>

1065
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.050
<v Speaker 4>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fought some of the best of the best,</v>

1066
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:14.093
<v Speaker 4>had some amazing fights in both mma and </v>
<v Speaker 4>in kickboxing and he was a really </v>

1067
00:52:18.241 --> 00:52:19.074
<v Speaker 4>talented guy and then transitioned on to</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a coach and the obsession that he </v>

1068
00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:25.374
<v Speaker 4>has towards coaching is really at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>higher level than even his obsession </v>

1069
00:52:29.401 --> 00:52:31.150
<v Speaker 4>towards fighting and he talks about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1070
00:52:31.151 --> 00:52:34.320
<v Speaker 4>that his passion is teaching people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He loves it.</v>

1071
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:35.423
<v Speaker 4>He loves being able to mold students and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's found the perfect muse or the </v>

1072
00:52:39.451 --> 00:52:40.284
<v Speaker 4>perfect willing participant in tj and tj</v>
<v Speaker 4>and him have a very unique friendship </v>

1073
00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:50.220
<v Speaker 4>and very unique student mentorship sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of relationship.</v>

1074
00:52:50.221 --> 00:52:51.054
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really interesting to watch the two of </v>

1075
00:52:52.471 --> 00:52:53.220
<v Speaker 4>them together.</v>

1076
00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Wild now the super jam with 20 guys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've got a,</v>

1077
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.660
<v Speaker 1>and dwayne has tons of athletes too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a but a commitment and connection to</v>

1078
00:53:02.661 --> 00:53:03.494
<v Speaker 1>tj.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got matt hume and demetrius </v>

1079
00:53:05.001 --> 00:53:07.820
<v Speaker 1>like you've got a few of these guys who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just like,</v>

1080
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:08.803
<v Speaker 1>we you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will funnel all of my experience </v>

1081
00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:13.130
<v Speaker 1>through everything through this super </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete,</v>

1082
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:14.143
<v Speaker 1>but like you talk about those books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way that you get to a point of </v>

1083
00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:19.604
<v Speaker 1>this level of mastery that we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about is that you must go down some </v>

1084
00:53:23.001 --> 00:53:28.001
<v Speaker 1>fucking road for six months that amounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>to nothing so that you learned that road</v>

1085
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:31.680
<v Speaker 1>isn't the road and the only way and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't give up too early.</v>

1086
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:32.663
<v Speaker 1>And what if by going down at long enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>some different concepts about how you </v>

1087
00:53:35.311 --> 00:53:39.000
<v Speaker 1>switch your feet in a certain moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think maybe that ain't it,</v>

1088
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.953
<v Speaker 1>but you have discovered that by pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>through some of these concepts long </v>

1089
00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:43.914
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find it so you stick with it long </v>

1090
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:46.134
<v Speaker 1>enough and it turns out now dwayne or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else reaching that level of </v>

1091
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:50.004
<v Speaker 1>mastery has gone down some rabbit hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>for months or years and discovered the </v>

1092
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.670
<v Speaker 1>only value they got out of it was what?</v>

1093
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:56.503
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of value.</v>

1094
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.713
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't the rabbit hole and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The process of searching this rabbit </v>

1095
00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:03.690
<v Speaker 1>hole has made me better at searching </v>
<v Speaker 1>rabbit holes,</v>

1096
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:04.583
<v Speaker 1>so those two values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the stacks of his books are </v>

1097
00:54:07.321 --> 00:54:08.154
<v Speaker 1>things that didn't work and he will </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably appreciate those just as much </v>

1098
00:54:10.741 --> 00:54:12.380
<v Speaker 1>as any of the ones that did it was also.</v>

1099
00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:13.273
<v Speaker 4>Tj is approach is really interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 4>me because tj is obsessed with </v>

1100
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:22.311
<v Speaker 4>improvement and knowledge and he keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about his fight iq and you know,</v>

1101
00:54:22.410 --> 00:54:24.030
<v Speaker 4>him and dwayne,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been around them,</v>

1102
00:54:24.031 --> 00:54:25.710
<v Speaker 4>I've trained with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have worked out with him.</v>

1103
00:54:25.711 --> 00:54:28.740
<v Speaker 4>I've watched him coach tj and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1104
00:54:28.741 --> 00:54:31.080
<v Speaker 4>they're constantly working on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>minutia.</v>

1105
00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:31.923
<v Speaker 4>That constant working on finite details </v>
<v Speaker 4>and improving every single aspect and </v>

1106
00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 4>tightening things up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's really interesting.</v>

1107
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Tj is a fucking open book man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's uh,</v>

1108
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.250
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1109
00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:48.230
<v Speaker 4>you can talk to that guy about anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's considering it.</v>

1110
00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.710
<v Speaker 4>He's thinking and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1111
00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:50.700
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're doing.</v>

1112
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:52.080
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's,</v>

1113
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:54.900
<v Speaker 4>he's a guy who's always trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>in information</v>

1114
00:54:56.110 --> 00:55:00.880
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are the things when we do watch</v>

1115
00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.073
<v Speaker 1>this kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it is martial arts or even jazz </v>

1116
00:55:05.591 --> 00:55:06.424
<v Speaker 1>or football or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are these lessons that are there </v>

1117
00:55:09.041 --> 00:55:13.240
<v Speaker 1>like we should do that corresponds to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through life doing that.</v>

1118
00:55:13.241 --> 00:55:15.220
<v Speaker 1>We're not supposed to look at tj </v>
<v Speaker 1>dillashaw and go,</v>

1119
00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:16.330
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that crazy,</v>

1120
00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:17.620
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we do that,</v>

1121
00:55:17.621 --> 00:55:19.000
<v Speaker 1>our lives will get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1122
00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to.</v>

1123
00:55:21.161 --> 00:55:26.161
<v Speaker 1>So I get to work for tsn in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like espn in the states and we,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm myself and erin brought instead or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the two person division that talks </v>

1125
00:55:29.981 --> 00:55:34.100
<v Speaker 1>about about a ufc and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1127
00:55:37.301 --> 00:55:38.590

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you approach your friends with </v>

1129

<v Speaker 1>Could you approach them about doing a </v>

1130
00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.450
<v Speaker 1>half hour long documentary on him about </v>
<v Speaker 1>his comeback and training and stuff?</v>

1131
00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:47.973
<v Speaker 1>And I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at first george was open to it and </v>

1132

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was interesting.</v>

1143
00:56:19.811 --> 00:56:21.940
<v Speaker 1>When is this going to come out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did come up before,</v>

1144
00:56:21.941 --> 00:56:24.850
<v Speaker 1>so mostly in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to send a message that I'm</v>

1145
00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:25.684
<v Speaker 1>going to send a message immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>after we get off here to simon and the </v>

00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.230
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tweet it out because he had learned</v>

1148
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:33.810
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

1149
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:34.653
<v Speaker 1>it changed my life because you don't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be around the greats of the greats </v>

1150
00:56:39.641 --> 00:56:40.474
<v Speaker 1>and study them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're friends so I can talk to him </v>

1151
00:56:43.091 --> 00:56:43.924
<v Speaker 1>like we hang out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to fucking train karate with his </v>

1152
00:56:46.211 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 1>team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like point karate,</v>

1153
00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:49.181
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be,</v>

1154
00:56:49.181 --> 00:56:50.500
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robin's training with us today.</v>

1155
00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.633
<v Speaker 1>What kind of point karate training do </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do and do they do this to practice </v>

1156
00:56:53.981 --> 00:56:54.814
<v Speaker 1>like blitzing and just think of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were big on point karate like </v>

1157
00:56:59.771 --> 00:57:00.604
<v Speaker 1>2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2013 and I didn't disagree but I didn't </v>

1158
00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.780
<v Speaker 1>really get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1159
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:07.463
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1160
00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.620
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

1161
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:11.590
<v Speaker 1>It was so magical to see like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't just like,</v>

1162
00:57:11.591 --> 00:57:12.580
<v Speaker 1>how does he kick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1163
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:15.970
<v Speaker 1>how does he think and why does he do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things he does and why?</v>

1164
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:16.803
<v Speaker 1>What's his motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really made me a better human </v>

1165
00:57:18.641 --> 00:57:19.474
<v Speaker 1>being getting to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so what I didn't really connect to </v>

1166
00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:23.683
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's something so simple </v>

1167
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:28.390
<v Speaker 1>and we don't see it because we're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep enough or whatever we're in,</v>

1168
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:32.380
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of point karate people </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away say,</v>

1169
00:57:32.381 --> 00:57:34.290
<v Speaker 1>well they're just touching each other so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could.</v>

1170
00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:36.160
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm training to just touch you,</v>

1171
00:57:36.161 --> 00:57:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1172
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:40.420
<v Speaker 1>That seems like that's not valuable when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're training to not.</v>

1173
00:57:40.421 --> 00:57:45.220
<v Speaker 1>Let me even fucking touch you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't get touched by me.</v>

1174
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.113
<v Speaker 1>How hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impossible as it for me to hit you </v>

1175
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:48.790
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1176
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:49.624
<v Speaker 1>If your movement and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your defensive systems and your </v>

1177
00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:53.344
<v Speaker 1>management of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the distance between our weapons and </v>

1178
00:57:55.811 --> 00:57:58.600
<v Speaker 1>targets are such that I can't fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch you.</v>

1179
00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.220
<v Speaker 1>How can I hurt you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1180
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:02.770
<v Speaker 1>If I can't even get touchy with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>glove.</v>

1181
00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1182
00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 4>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what I think about point fighting</v>

1183
00:58:06.221 --> 00:58:11.221
<v Speaker 4>and what I think was valid about it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're just doing point fighting with</v>

1184
00:58:11.231 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 4>a point fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is extremely frustrated.</v>

1185
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:17.260
<v Speaker 4>I fought and point fighting tournaments </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was competing and we.</v>

1186
00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.153
<v Speaker 4>There was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came from a full contact taekwondo </v>

1187
00:58:21.101 --> 00:58:21.934
<v Speaker 4>background and we fought in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>tournaments and the object was to knock </v>

1188
00:58:24.401 --> 00:58:26.660
<v Speaker 4>people unconscious and you would fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1189
00:58:26.661 --> 00:58:27.494
<v Speaker 4>they would have three minute rounds and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would fight and you would try to </v>

1190
00:58:29.261 --> 00:58:32.020
<v Speaker 4>kick people into another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very similar in Canada,</v>

1191
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:33.453
<v Speaker 4>what we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of people that are </v>

1192
00:58:35.081 --> 00:58:35.914
<v Speaker 4>trained with that openly dismissed point</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting and the reason why they openly </v>

1193
00:58:39.461 --> 00:58:42.580
<v Speaker 4>dismissed point fighting was because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would stop every time someone would</v>

1194
00:58:42.581 --> 00:58:44.350
<v Speaker 4>get touched and I would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1195
00:58:44.351 --> 00:58:47.200
<v Speaker 4>in the real world or everybody would say</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the real world,</v>

1196
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.120
<v Speaker 4>you don't just stop when you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>touched,</v>

1197
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:50.440
<v Speaker 4>you keep fighting.</v>

1198
00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:52.450
<v Speaker 4>And so with our techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it,</v>

1199
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:53.403
<v Speaker 4>you would hit someone once and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would counter and then you'd set up the </v>

1200
00:58:55.901 --> 00:58:56.734
<v Speaker 4>big shot afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this is part of the thing and if </v>

1201
00:58:58.811 --> 00:59:02.500
<v Speaker 4>the referee kept stopping you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you would never get anything done.</v>

1202
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:07.390
<v Speaker 4>But my thinking once I got into mma was </v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1203
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.343
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you can do that and do the other </v>

1204
00:59:11.441 --> 00:59:12.274
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like people dismiss taekwondo </v>

1205
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.240
<v Speaker 4>because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll talk one doe.</v>

1206
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get taken to the ground,</v>

1207
00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:20.560
<v Speaker 4>you get your legs kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1208
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 4>But if you have</v>

1209
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.940
<v Speaker 2>takedown defense and you know more thai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

1210
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 2>We'll kick someone into another fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimension.</v>

1211
00:59:29.241 --> 00:59:31.880
<v Speaker 2>And we saw that with edson barboza </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus terry adam.</v>

1212
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:32.893
<v Speaker 2>We've seen these taekwondo techniques </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest themselves in mmA and you </v>

1213
00:59:36.141 --> 00:59:36.974
<v Speaker 2>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1214
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:40.760
<v Speaker 2>these are some of the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>things you could do to a person inside a</v>

1215
00:59:40.761 --> 00:59:41.594
<v Speaker 2>cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you see the point fighting </v>

1216
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:45.764
<v Speaker 2>style though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Raymond Daniels or the michael </v>

1217
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:48.524
<v Speaker 2>venom page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disability ability to blitz if they can </v>

1218
00:59:51.051 --> 00:59:54.830
<v Speaker 2>do those other things too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is another another level.</v>

1219
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:57.050
<v Speaker 2>There's soMething to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a fighter,</v>

1220
00:59:57.051 --> 00:59:57.884
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't willing to dismiss point </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting because I had been lied to </v>

1221
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:01.964
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I when I went and took taekwondo and </v>

1222
01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:05.234
<v Speaker 2>then started kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first american kickboxing above the </v>

1223
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:08.144
<v Speaker 2>waist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first thing I realized was how easy it </v>

1224
01:00:09.801 --> 01:00:12.050
<v Speaker 2>was for me to get punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1225
01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1226
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 2>Now if I'm trapped in this ring and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't go anywhere and someone's throwing</v>

1227
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.970
<v Speaker 2>punches and I don't understand how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get away from him,</v>

1228
01:00:18.971 --> 01:00:21.950
<v Speaker 2>and I'm used to this taekwondo style of </v>
<v Speaker 2>having your hands down low.</v>

1229
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been lied to.</v>

1230
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Talk window is not the best martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mma.</v>

1231
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1232
01:00:27.571 --> 01:00:29.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no best push.</v>

1233
01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.710
<v Speaker 2>There's something absolutely legit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that blitz,</v>

1234
01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:37.280
<v Speaker 2>that karate blitz that some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys can do,</v>

1235
01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:41.720
<v Speaker 2>and I fought some really good guys in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those karate style tournaments and I got</v>

1236
01:00:41.721 --> 01:00:43.430
<v Speaker 2>an ass made out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1237
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.264
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what to do and you get </v>

1238
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:48.830
<v Speaker 2>kicked and then the reference point and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the like,</v>

1239
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:52.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't have a chance to fire back </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're separating you guys.</v>

1240
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:56.180
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really absorb those lessons.</v>

1241
01:00:56.181 --> 01:00:57.014
<v Speaker 2>And I was like in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ability to close the distance </v>

1242
01:00:59.661 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 2>because every in mma there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys and connor talked about this.</v>

1243
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:04.933
<v Speaker 2>There's so many guys that have this thai</v>
<v Speaker 2>stance and they're presenting this very </v>

1244
01:01:08.391 --> 01:01:09.224
<v Speaker 2>predictable target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're standing right in front of each </v>

1245
01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:12.830
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think this stance,</v>

1246
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.480
<v Speaker 2>and especially this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1247
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>

1248
01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:20.060
<v Speaker 2>the forward stance is one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 2>why [inaudible] has been caught,</v>

1249
01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.930
<v Speaker 2>knocked out twice with front kicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he squares off veto.</v>

1250
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Explain this to me in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1251
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 97.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was tRaining at carlson gracie's,</v>

1252
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:35.480
<v Speaker 2>he was explaining that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kickboxers are going to have a hard</v>

1253
01:01:35.481 --> 01:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>time in mma even though they're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>good kickboxers because the mma stance,</v>

1254
01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:43.670
<v Speaker 2>you really have to square off more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't stand lIke this.</v>

1255
01:01:43.671 --> 01:01:44.504
<v Speaker 2>You can't stand in like a boxer and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxer is a little more open than a </v>

1256
01:01:47.511 --> 01:01:48.344
<v Speaker 2>boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then mma is a little more open than </v>

1257
01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.070
<v Speaker 2>it was like you almost have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>square,</v>

1258
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:53.023
<v Speaker 2>but that square leaves you open to front</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks to the face and then turn turning </v>

1259
01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.214
<v Speaker 2>side kicks and side kicks to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about what [inaudible] has been </v>

1260
01:02:00.231 --> 01:02:02.810
<v Speaker 2>dropped with jon jones dropped him with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a side kick to the body.</v>

1261
01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soccer.</v>

1262
01:02:04.021 --> 01:02:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Robert dropped him with a turning side </v>
<v Speaker 2>kick to the body to fund kick front kick</v>

1263
01:02:07.381 --> 01:02:08.214
<v Speaker 2>to the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because he presents this square </v>

1264
01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:10.873
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to him this is sprawl and throw </v>

1265
01:02:12.801 --> 01:02:16.250
<v Speaker 2>punches and throw that they'll like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blitz had used on vandelay silva.</v>

1266
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it worked much of his career.</v>

1267
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 2>He either one with it or lost</v>

1268
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.903
<v Speaker 1>with respect that thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those types of doctrines like is </v>

1269
01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:29.931
<v Speaker 1>literally and in martial arts in day to </v>
<v Speaker 1>day life in anything.</v>

1270
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:31.703
<v Speaker 1>If you think anything is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're totally wrong because if we all </v>

1271
01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:36.114
<v Speaker 1>agree it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we all acting like it's the thing </v>

1272
01:02:37.951 --> 01:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>that we all start ignoring other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those things will work.</v>

1273
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>So if you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if mma you have to square up.</v>

1274
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:45.803
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some connor comes out with a different </v>

1275
01:02:47.551 --> 01:02:48.384
<v Speaker 1>thing and you were thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guard is the one that is glaRing to </v>

1276
01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:53.064
<v Speaker 1>me right now because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean I've talked to some of the </v>

1277
01:02:56.011 --> 01:03:00.120
<v Speaker 1>smartest and the best and they will and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we do this over and over again and we do</v>

1278
01:03:00.121 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 1>it in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1279
01:03:01.621 --> 01:03:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you Remember when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1280
01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.400
<v Speaker 1>you cannot cross your feet when you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>an arm bar.</v>

1281
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are like,</v>

1282
01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.400
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

1283
01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Head kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't work.</v>

1284
01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:12.630
<v Speaker 1>And mma like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1285
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:13.493
<v Speaker 1>this has been going on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So any absolute decision that this is a </v>

1286
01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:21.270
<v Speaker 1>fundamental rule is completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're gonna get fucked.</v>

1287
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.760
<v Speaker 1>How about the low calf kick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1288
01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean the benson henderson was in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

1289
01:03:26.251 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 1>the first guy to bring him in and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>started doing that back in the day,</v>

1290
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:31.254
<v Speaker 1>but not at the effectiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The level of effectIveness that we're </v>

1291
01:03:33.691 --> 01:03:34.524
<v Speaker 1>seeing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That low calf kick his fucking people </v>

1292
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.493
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting and then </v>

1293
01:03:39.031 --> 01:03:41.940
<v Speaker 1>they'll adapt and then it won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that adaptation,</v>

1294
01:03:41.941 --> 01:03:42.774
<v Speaker 1>we'll put something else available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem with the low calf </v>

1295
01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:46.554
<v Speaker 1>kyc is that you really can condition the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower part of your leg the same way you </v>

1296
01:03:50.071 --> 01:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>can your thighs and I think it's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep working,</v>

1297
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.850
<v Speaker 1>but then we have to not get hit by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll make a change to not get hit by</v>

1298
01:03:56.851 --> 01:03:57.000
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1299
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:57.833
<v Speaker 1>Once we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll force us to do something else </v>

1300
01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 1>that someone will tAke advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how quiCkly it works.</v>

1301
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Like if you see a guy get hit with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brutal leg kick,</v>

1302
01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:08.490
<v Speaker 1>like it takes one or two and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to feel it.</v>

1303
01:04:08.491 --> 01:04:10.500
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the first low </v>
<v Speaker 1>calf kick.</v>

1304
01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:11.334
<v Speaker 1>You see guys wobbly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That muscle is like really done at the </v>

1305
01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:17.610
<v Speaker 1>insertion at the bottom is so small and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still taking.</v>

1306
01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>It's taking so much work like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying so much.</v>

1307
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1308
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:23.933
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are when things work beautifully </v>

1309
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:26.603
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I used to take anything we'd talk </v>

1310
01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:29.004
<v Speaker 1>about and I'd bring it back to fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I tend to take anything in fighting </v>

1311
01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.500
<v Speaker 1>and I tried to figure out what it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>

1312
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I've kind of slow over time of </v>
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

1313
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I've started to do that.</v>

1314
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:40.163
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is true of this kick and it's </v>

1315
01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:42.774
<v Speaker 1>true of anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that it works best when the </v>

1316
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:46.854
<v Speaker 1>physiological truth that calf is small </v>
<v Speaker 1>and weak and then works with the </v>

1317
01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:52.014
<v Speaker 1>systemic issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his foot there and the way he </v>

1318
01:04:53.821 --> 01:04:57.090
<v Speaker 1>standing is such that you can hit it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those two things together,</v>

1319
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:58.103
<v Speaker 1>are making that thing work right now if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't change the strength of the </v>

1320
01:05:02.071 --> 01:05:02.904
<v Speaker 1>calf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the only thing we can change is how </v>

1321
01:05:04.711 --> 01:05:07.200
<v Speaker 1>available that calf kick is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't want to get hit with it.</v>

1322
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.750
<v Speaker 1>So we must change that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we do,</v>

1323
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:13.080
<v Speaker 1>we've changed a lot of different things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now something else is available that</v>

1324
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>dwayne or duke or somebody else has </v>
<v Speaker 1>already planning how to,</v>

1325
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:19.770
<v Speaker 1>how to take advantage that you've made </v>
<v Speaker 1>that adaptation,</v>

1326
01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is for me,</v>

1327
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>what is eternally fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but martial arts,</v>

1328
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:25.174
<v Speaker 1>but he can dots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the lessons of life that are </v>

1329
01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:27.994
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't see that the world around </v>

1330
01:05:30.281 --> 01:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you has changed dramatically and you act</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if it's the same,</v>

1331
01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get fucked up,</v>

1332
01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>you will get fucked up,</v>

1333
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:37.143
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bring this to paul daily versus john </v>

1334
01:05:39.181 --> 01:05:44.181
<v Speaker 4>fitch because that fight was extremely </v>
<v Speaker 4>frustrating to paul daley and frustrated</v>

1335
01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.533
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people that were watching it </v>
<v Speaker 4>too because john fits was just able to </v>

1336
01:05:48.961 --> 01:05:49.794
<v Speaker 4>take him down and kinda do what john </v>
<v Speaker 4>does and hit him on the ground and kind </v>

1337
01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:56.310
<v Speaker 4>of beat him up and control the position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1338
01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.720
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the fight,</v>

1339
01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:01.440
<v Speaker 4>paul's yell and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so strange,</v>

1340
01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.513
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1341
01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:06.900
<v Speaker 4>but this is a guy that if you just stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>with him,</v>

1342
01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:07.883
<v Speaker 4>he's going to fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you just decide to trade shots </v>

1343
01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:11.604
<v Speaker 4>with paul daily on your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a left hand that is a goddamn </v>

1344
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:15.400
<v Speaker 4>nuclear missile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1345
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:18.970
<v Speaker 4>and he basically everybody hits with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing goes night night.</v>

1346
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:20.640
<v Speaker 4>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even lorenz larkin,</v>

1347
01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:21.683
<v Speaker 4>who's a seasoned striker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got clipped by that left hand is </v>

1348
01:06:24.031 --> 01:06:24.864
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yo,</v>

1349
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.983
<v Speaker 1>the ability to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate and create that amount of </v>

1350
01:06:28.271 --> 01:06:31.180
<v Speaker 1>impact is elegant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1351
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.433
<v Speaker 1>it's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are human bodies and minds don't do </v>

1352
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:36.634
<v Speaker 1>all that many things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unbelievably beautiful and rooted </v>

1353
01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:42.460
<v Speaker 1>in our history as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1354
01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:43.294
<v Speaker 1>This is at the basis of what it was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive and protect and expand and </v>

1355
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:49.450
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see it right there.</v>

1356
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:51.880
<v Speaker 1>When paul daley hit somebody like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreal.</v>

1357
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:52.953
<v Speaker 1>The opposite of that scenario is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Hendricks was fighting Stephen </v>

1358
01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Thompson and Johnny Hendricks wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>when stephen would come in,</v>

1359
01:07:01.091 --> 01:07:01.924
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to drill him with hooks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>upper cuts and then get to his body and </v>

1360
01:07:04.901 --> 01:07:06.730
<v Speaker 1>take him down and do what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1361
01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:07.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1362
01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.810
<v Speaker 1>john fitch did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But steven's like you doing that.</v>

1363
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And after he kicked him and beat him up </v>
<v Speaker 1>at distance and then finish the fight,</v>

1364
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>johnny was being interviewed and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1365
01:07:17.021 --> 01:07:17.854
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't my neck and johnny is a </v>

1366
01:07:18.761 --> 01:07:21.910
<v Speaker 1>classy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overall over the length of his career,</v>

1367
01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.920
<v Speaker 1>he sometimes gets heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who cares?</v>

1368
01:07:23.921 --> 01:07:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the opinion of the people shouldn't</v>

1369
01:07:26.471 --> 01:07:29.320
<v Speaker 1>matter to Johnny Hendricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But johnny said after he said,</v>

1370
01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:30.154
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kinda hoping he'd come in trade a </v>

1371
01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:32.314
<v Speaker 1>little more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1372
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.260
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck would he do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not his style.</v>

1373
01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to do what you don't want.</v>

1374
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:40.263
<v Speaker 1>The whole goal is to do something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits him in the scenario and does </v>

1375
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:45.940
<v Speaker 1>not benefit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be exactly what he did.</v>

1376
01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.230
<v Speaker 4>Which is why what brings me back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>paul daley,</v>

1377
01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:51.770
<v Speaker 4>john fitch fight like this is the answer</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that style.</v>

1378
01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:52.813
<v Speaker 4>The answer to that styles take you down </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not ever let you get up and force </v>

1379
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:59.083
<v Speaker 4>john fitches game on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is what makes fighting so </v>

1380
01:08:01.551 --> 01:08:02.384
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If john fitch had just decided to go </v>

1381
01:08:04.401 --> 01:08:07.820
<v Speaker 4>cowboy and bite down his mouthpiece and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just wing punches.</v>

1382
01:08:07.821 --> 01:08:10.460
<v Speaker 4>At paul daily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>until one of them went to sleep,</v>

1383
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:12.550
<v Speaker 4>that would have been a great fight for </v>
<v Speaker 4>paul dalian.</v>

1384
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:13.500
<v Speaker 4>Great childhood.</v>

1385
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when nick diaz,</v>

1386
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.170
<v Speaker 1>paul daley did that</v>

1387
01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.690
<v Speaker 3>mean that was pretty amazing and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>only happens again.</v>

1388
01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:21.583
<v Speaker 3>You're creating a moment and it only </v>
<v Speaker 3>happenS because nick was motivated by </v>

1389
01:08:26.751 --> 01:08:27.584
<v Speaker 3>who he is in that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't motivated by stRategy even </v>

1390
01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:31.010
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1391
01:08:31.011 --> 01:08:34.130
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

1392
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:34.930
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1393
01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:36.770
<v Speaker 3>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

1394
01:08:36.771 --> 01:08:38.840
<v Speaker 3>people will look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is again,</v>

1395
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:41.660
<v Speaker 3>it is an expression of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individuality,</v>

1396
01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:45.560
<v Speaker 3>the authentic truth of who nick diaz is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>

1397
01:08:45.561 --> 01:08:49.190
<v Speaker 3>That's art [inaudible] art and fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fight.</v>

1398
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.420
<v Speaker 3>This was great and he got clipped a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1399
01:08:51.421 --> 01:08:53.710
<v Speaker 3>But this year man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>

1400
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:55.880
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just kept the pace.</v>

1401
01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.620
<v Speaker 3>He's just refusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1402
01:08:57.621 --> 01:08:59.850
<v Speaker 3>Paul just got too tired too quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

1403
01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:02.600
<v Speaker 3>he was whinging big shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And look at nick just.</v>

1404
01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:04.043
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got clipped his left hook you're </v>

1405
01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:06.900
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1406
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.761
<v Speaker 3>This is over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1407
01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:08.690
<v Speaker 3>It's over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're done.</v>

1408
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:10.520
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nick won't be done.</v>

1409
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1410
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if paul's in better condition,</v>

1411
01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:17.930
<v Speaker 3>but this is the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The end is nick just gathering him.</v>

1412
01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:20.580
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that he beat his striking </v>
<v Speaker 3>contest,</v>

1413
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.680
<v Speaker 3>but he did it with will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was always a great boxer.</v>

1414
01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:26.720
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1415
01:09:26.721 --> 01:09:29.060
<v Speaker 3>we're this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're this a metaphor for life.</v>

1416
01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:30.023
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>victories ever that that's the </v>

1417
01:09:34.730 --> 01:09:37.720
<v Speaker 3>quintessential nick diaz fight to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at them.</v>

1418
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:41.590
<v Speaker 3>And there are people who don't like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1419
01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:45.140
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that what we're,</v>

1420
01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:46.003
<v Speaker 3>what we're searching for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think is we're trying to be </v>

1421
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:50.510
<v Speaker 3>authentically who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's all we're doing.</v>

1422
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what nick diaz's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you think he is,</v>

1423
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:54.343
<v Speaker 3>he is authentically nick diaz and w.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the metaphor to me is paul daley is </v>

1424
01:09:59.301 --> 01:10:00.134
<v Speaker 3>a wall and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can dig under it or you can go </v>

1425
01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:04.784
<v Speaker 3>around it or you can trick somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gives you a rope or you can climb it or </v>

1426
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:08.510
<v Speaker 3>you can dissemble it.</v>

1427
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:09.410
<v Speaker 3>And nick's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

1428
01:10:09.411 --> 01:10:11.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go through it.</v>

1429
01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.613
<v Speaker 3>And there are many ways to choose to </v>
<v Speaker 3>live your life and that's how nick diaz </v>

1430
01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:16.460
<v Speaker 3>lifts his fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1431
01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:17.503
<v Speaker 3>that's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What sucks is that he hasn't fought in </v>

1432
01:10:19.581 --> 01:10:20.570
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1433
01:10:20.571 --> 01:10:22.400
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't fought since the anderson </v>
<v Speaker 3>silva fight.</v>

1434
01:10:22.401 --> 01:10:23.234
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that they suspended him for </v>

1435
01:10:25.341 --> 01:10:26.174
<v Speaker 3>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When anderson silva tested positive for </v>

1436
01:10:28.221 --> 01:10:31.130
<v Speaker 3>steroids in that fight and he got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shorter suspension.</v>

1437
01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:33.140
<v Speaker 3>The nick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a reflection.</v>

1438
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:36.110
<v Speaker 3>That's a cultural leftover cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflection.</v>

1439
01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:36.973
<v Speaker 3>That's also that nick refused to pay the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine because that's nick diaz being </v>

1440
01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:42.800
<v Speaker 3>authentically nicholas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting that money from me,</v>

1441
01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:47.330
<v Speaker 3>but you can admire that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some,</v>

1442
01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.850
<v Speaker 3>some people will look at that and go do </v>
<v Speaker 3>just pay it.</v>

1443
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:50.690
<v Speaker 3>It'll go this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

1444
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.640
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fundamentally who I am,</v>

1445
01:10:52.641 --> 01:10:53.474
<v Speaker 3>I cannot do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will get negative consequences in my </v>

1446
01:10:55.881 --> 01:10:59.060
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I will be authentic to who I am.</v>

1447
01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:01.470
<v Speaker 3>But nick is like 36 now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1448
01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:02.810
<v Speaker 3>How old is nick diaz?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1449
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Thirty four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's 34 now.</v>

1450
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:05.860
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh dude.</v>

1451
01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:07.130
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his first fight in ufc,</v>

1452
01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:12.131
<v Speaker 3>I believe he was 20 when he fought </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Jackson like way back in the day.</v>

1453
01:11:12.141 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>He was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

1454
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.920
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's been around man,</v>

1455
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:17.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been a brown so he still like </v>

1456
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:20.723
<v Speaker 2>literally in his physical prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is crazy considering the fact </v>

1457
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 2>that I want to say the anderson silva </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight was three years ago,</v>

1458
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.833
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see him back in there </v>

1459
01:11:33.211 --> 01:11:34.230
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1460

<v Speaker 1>truly.</v>

1463

<v Speaker 1>He'll,</v>

1464
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.273
<v Speaker 1>he'll find a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he doesn't know George George </v>

<v Speaker 1>but I'll go ask george.</v>

1478
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:23.450
<v Speaker 1>so I asked george who we are friends we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked yesterday and uh,</v>

1479
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.660
<v Speaker 1>we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will tell me the truth and then,</v>

1480
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:30.450
<v Speaker 1>and something as simple as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1481
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:32.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as fucking bullshit and maybe not in</v>

1482
01:12:32.851 --> 01:12:34.380
<v Speaker 1>exactly those terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he would say,</v>

1483
01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.120
<v Speaker 1>but when I asked him about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1484
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.670
<v Speaker 1>no bro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't signed nothing.</v>

1485
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.430
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at that and like,</v>

1486
01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:42.900
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's george tried to be deceptive.</v>

1487
01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Like george would normally go ads bs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1488
01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:48.210
<v Speaker 1>that's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I haven't signed anything.</v>

1489
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:49.103
<v Speaker 1>Well I know they've offered him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was george who's shitty at </v>

1490
01:12:52.321 --> 01:12:54.720
<v Speaker 1>being deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be deceptive.</v>

1491
01:12:54.721 --> 01:12:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Like he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1492
01:12:55.891 --> 01:12:57.390
<v Speaker 1>So like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've offered it to.</v>

1493
01:12:57.391 --> 01:12:58.224
<v Speaker 1>They've offered it to him and by saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't signed it means he's </v>

1494
01:13:00.061 --> 01:13:00.620
<v Speaker 1>considering it.</v>

1495
01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he's considering it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's also considering khabib</v>

1496
01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:05.053
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's always the great irish </v>

1497
01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:10.610
<v Speaker 2>leprechaun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1498
01:13:10.611 --> 01:13:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those are the two big fights.</v>

1499
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:13.703
<v Speaker 2>The two big fights or could be at 1:55</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even one 70 gsp wants to winter of </v>

1500
01:13:17.821 --> 01:13:22.821
<v Speaker 2>conor mcgregor versus could be not nate </v>
<v Speaker 2>diaz insider drops bombshell and this is</v>

1501
01:13:23.161 --> 01:13:24.660
<v Speaker 2>a May 19th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saturday.</v>

1502
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:26.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he wants that.</v>

1503
01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:29.560
<v Speaker 2>But that fight would have to take place </v>
<v Speaker 2>first and who the fuck knows when connor</v>

1504
01:13:29.561 --> 01:13:32.420
<v Speaker 2>or be but fight afteRwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's connor,</v>

1505
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:34.050
<v Speaker 2>it might be a decade later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1506
01:13:34.051 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows who that guy is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do now when you give a guy like conor</v>

1507
01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:40.010
<v Speaker 2>$100,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1508
01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:43.110
<v Speaker 2>This is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's throwing dollars at bus windows and</v>

1509
01:13:43.111 --> 01:13:43.944
<v Speaker 2>losing his fucking mind and Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come out of jamie that ufc inside </v>

1510
01:13:47.101 --> 01:13:47.934
<v Speaker 2>of a shop.</v>

1511
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:48.911
<v Speaker 2>Was It?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1512
01:13:48.911 --> 01:13:50.840
<v Speaker 2>it was on his podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did saw that.</v>

1513
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I just scrolled down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ufc,</v>

1514
01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:57.630
<v Speaker 2>brendan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brendan schaub as you fucking idiots.</v>

1515
01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Some of secure inside or some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1516
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he does want that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if they offer him a fat paycheck and</v>

1517
01:14:05.731 --> 01:14:06.790
<v Speaker 2>they really should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they want.</v>

1518
01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ufc is in a weird position that they</v>

1519
01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:13.030
<v Speaker 2>bought the company for $4,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's worth,</v>

1520
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:16.090
<v Speaker 2>but I would guess it's probably not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really worth $4,000,000,000.</v>

1521
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.210
<v Speaker 2>They have a giant monthly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not it's fucking huge.</v>

1522
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:23.650
<v Speaker 2>The monthly nut that they have to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>caused them to fIre a hundred employees.</v>

1523
01:14:23.651 --> 01:14:24.484
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot going on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been some great fights and it's </v>

1524
01:14:28.061 --> 01:14:28.894
<v Speaker 2>obviously still incredibly popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want to make those big pay per </v>

1525
01:14:32.861 --> 01:14:35.380
<v Speaker 2>view bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need the big name stars.</v>

1526
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:36.423
<v Speaker 2>Gsp was always a big name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Star became even bigger when he came </v>

1527
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:40.564
<v Speaker 2>back and beat bisping and one by finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got them in a rear naked choke </v>

1528
01:14:45.191 --> 01:14:48.640
<v Speaker 2>and put them to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's still a giant star.</v>

1529
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.410
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hasn't fought in a while,</v>

1530
01:14:50.411 --> 01:14:52.690
<v Speaker 2>vacated the title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have the title anymore,</v>

1531
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:57.100
<v Speaker 2>so it's not as big of a deal to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>public size when his sit though.</v>

1532
01:14:57.190 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1533
01:14:58.151 --> 01:14:59.530
<v Speaker 2>People are dumb as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1534
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the funny thing to me is like I always </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like,</v>

1535
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.100
<v Speaker 1>and and I always feel like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these mechanisms,</v>

1536
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.750
<v Speaker 1>title shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rankings,</v>

1537
01:15:10.751 --> 01:15:12.550
<v Speaker 1>belts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1538
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:13.384
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beef.</v>

1539
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:14.223
<v Speaker 1>They weren't Intended to be there as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>short term solution to give people a </v>

1540
01:15:18.641 --> 01:15:23.350
<v Speaker 1>talking point until they saw how till </v>
<v Speaker 1>they got deeply invested and connected.</v>

1541
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:24.543
<v Speaker 1>I think that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet somehow these sort of extra </v>

1542
01:15:27.671 --> 01:15:32.050
<v Speaker 1>outside distractions became the focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck cares?</v>

1543
01:15:32.051 --> 01:15:32.884
<v Speaker 1>Who is the number eight guy and who </v>
<v Speaker 1>cares if these guys are mad at each </v>

1544
01:15:36.581 --> 01:15:39.880
<v Speaker 1>other on twitter and the belt itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mechanism for discussion.</v>

1545
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.520
<v Speaker 1>What matters is the fight and and I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1546
01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:43.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1547
01:15:43.991 --> 01:15:47.170
<v Speaker 1>but you're obsessed wIth fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>

1548
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:48.063
<v Speaker 1>if you show them what's really going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and contextualize the fact that </v>

1549
01:15:50.891 --> 01:15:51.724
<v Speaker 1>these two human beings who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated their life and taking all of </v>

1550
01:15:54.191 --> 01:15:55.024
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge in human history to put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line in this moment of of severe </v>

1551
01:15:59.081 --> 01:15:59.914
<v Speaker 1>intensity and consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't care as much about whether </v>

1552
01:16:02.711 --> 01:16:05.650
<v Speaker 1>somebody has an interim title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't know</v>

1553
01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:10.140
<v Speaker 2>and it won't and you won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the average joe blow by a paper view</v>

1554
01:16:10.141 --> 01:16:12.750
<v Speaker 2>once a year is going to care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

1555
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:16.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the idea behind stripping </v>
<v Speaker 2>tony ferguson.</v>

1556
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1557
01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:17.913
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

1558
01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.140
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why takeaways?</v>

1559
01:16:19.141 --> 01:16:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Interim title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them keep the interim title.</v>

1560
01:16:20.941 --> 01:16:23.200
<v Speaker 2>If you want to strip connor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just strip connor,</v>

1561
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:26.220
<v Speaker 2>strip connor and then tony's obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go through surgery.</v>

1562
01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:28.290
<v Speaker 2>tony didn't do anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fell and hurt himself,</v>

1563
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:32.420
<v Speaker 1>but I think at the root of it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>filicides isn't incorrect.</v>

1564
01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Philosophical belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I,</v>

1565
01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.353
<v Speaker 1>if I talk to people at the ufc and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to them periodically and I'll </v>

1566
01:16:41.061 --> 01:16:43.010
<v Speaker 1>discuss somethinG with them about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1567
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:45.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's generally at different times </v>
<v Speaker 1>been like,</v>

1568
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.943
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the work that i'M doing and </v>

1569
01:16:47.631 --> 01:16:50.810
<v Speaker 1>you can see people like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could I contribute something x or y?</v>

1570
01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.570
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll mention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1571
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.340
<v Speaker 1>they will then say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1572
01:16:55.341 --> 01:16:56.174
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got like a really unique way of </v>

1573
01:16:58.581 --> 01:16:59.414
<v Speaker 1>approaching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think we got so many casual fans </v>

1574
01:17:01.371 --> 01:17:05.230
<v Speaker 1>watching on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on fox or on these tv stations.</v>

1575
01:17:05.231 --> 01:17:08.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's just such a casual audience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about it,</v>

1576
01:17:08.271 --> 01:17:09.104
<v Speaker 1>it's like nobody questions at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The percentage of people that are a </v>

1577
01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:16.550
<v Speaker 1>casual fan that is watching anything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very close to zero,</v>

1578
01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:17.953
<v Speaker 1>very close to zero because the casual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the not actively choosing what to watch </v>

1579
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:24.643
<v Speaker 1>is being on a netflix search or is </v>
<v Speaker 1>someboDy put something on and I go in </v>

1580
01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:30.890
<v Speaker 1>and see what the rock is cooking in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchen.</v>

1581
01:17:31.150 --> 01:17:31.983
<v Speaker 1>You Said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your dog's name and the gold dog </v>

1582
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:34.363
<v Speaker 1>marshall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go see what fucking joe is feeding </v>

1583
01:17:35.691 --> 01:17:37.880
<v Speaker 1>marshall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's watching something.</v>

1584
01:17:37.881 --> 01:17:40.820
<v Speaker 1>They're not interested in ever in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1585
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:41.743
<v Speaker 1>We are all conscious constantly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously choosing what we consume at </v>

1586
01:17:46.941 --> 01:17:47.774
<v Speaker 1>all times and if we're sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our boyfriend or girlfriend or </v>

1587
01:17:49.701 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 1>husband or wife and they're watching it </v>
<v Speaker 1>were somewhere else,</v>

1588
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:57.970
<v Speaker 1>by feeding this nonexistent casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and really believing they exist</v>

1589
01:17:58.071 --> 01:18:00.530
<v Speaker 1>despite all the evidence that there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>no such thing,</v>

1590
01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you are now giving less importance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the your actual audience who is ready to</v>

1591
01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 1>go deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to see something more meaningful,</v>

1592
01:18:09.141 --> 01:18:09.974
<v Speaker 1>ready to be brought somewhere different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no casual audience of almost </v>

1593
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:14.990
<v Speaker 1>anything in our modern world.</v>

1594
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:16.663
<v Speaker 2>I like what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I disagree because people are </v>

1595
01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:21.650
<v Speaker 2>watching and they don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck they're watching.</v>

1596
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.090
<v Speaker 2>I've done it with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1597
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:23.953
<v Speaker 2>I've unfortunately watch fights over </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends houses before because they </v>

1598
01:18:27.341 --> 01:18:29.060
<v Speaker 2>happened to be there and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1599
01:18:29.061 --> 01:18:31.640
<v Speaker 2>there'll be people sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching a why doesn't he just do this?</v>

1600
01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:35.360
<v Speaker 2>But they still chose to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still may pay attention.</v>

1601
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:36.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they made that choice barely paying </v>

1602
01:18:37.851 --> 01:18:39.670
<v Speaker 2>attention and they don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck they're watching.</v>

1603
01:18:39.710 --> 01:18:43.560
<v Speaker 2>So a guy like you comes in talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>artistry and all this.</v>

1604
01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:47.060
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you are great.</v>

1605
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.923
<v Speaker 2>I love your approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think your approach in their eyes </v>

1606
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:51.283
<v Speaker 2>is a little bit too esoteric and complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it'd be balanced out better </v>

1607
01:18:55.521 --> 01:18:57.240
<v Speaker 2>with someone like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1608
01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:58.483
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1609
01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.850
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>

1610
01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.700
<v Speaker 1>we're not over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the last sort of year or so,</v>

1611
01:19:04.701 --> 01:19:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1612
01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.573
<v Speaker 1>trying to force something like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sort of happily saying that I </v>

1613
01:19:13.161 --> 01:19:13.994
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be in a relationship with you </v>

1614
01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:16.484
<v Speaker 1>and accept what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying I think we should be in a </v>

1615
01:19:18.741 --> 01:19:22.190
<v Speaker 1>relationship only I want to change you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not right.</v>

1616
01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:22.920
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1617
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:23.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally saying I'm not saying put </v>

1618
01:19:26.121 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 1>a role here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what that role you need and I'll</v>

1619
01:19:28.641 --> 01:19:31.490
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually saying I think it should be</v>

1620
01:19:31.491 --> 01:19:33.410
<v Speaker 1>different and that's why it's not a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit.</v>

1621
01:19:33.411 --> 01:19:34.244
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I say a one championship </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a more logical fit for me because </v>

1622
01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:41.660
<v Speaker 1>it's younger and it's in its evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still growing.</v>

1623
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:42.913
<v Speaker 2>I think I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it goes back to the money </v>

1624
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:46.363
<v Speaker 2>because I think there's so much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in the use that they have to </v>

1625
01:19:48.771 --> 01:19:50.360
<v Speaker 2>make money every month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1626
01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.570
<v Speaker 2>they're in a tricky situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1627
01:19:53.970 --> 01:19:54.803
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a guy and you make 500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks a week and you really liked this </v>

1628
01:19:58.611 --> 01:19:59.421
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god damn.</v>

1629
01:19:59.421 --> 01:20:00.940
<v Speaker 2>The core of it is so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really like it.</v>

1630
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much is the lease?</v>

1631
01:20:01.851 --> 01:20:05.060
<v Speaker 2>The lease is a thousand dollars a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you only make $2,000</v>

1632
01:20:05.061 --> 01:20:05.900
<v Speaker 2>a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to do that?</v>

1633
01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I only pay 500 bucks a month in rent,</v>

1634
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:12.420
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of pull it off key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you can,</v>

1635
01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:16.410
<v Speaker 2>but you got to watch every penny and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to be cautious and I think you could</v>

1636
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:17.244
<v Speaker 2>put yourself in these traps and then you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to like really micromanage </v>

1637
01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:20.910
<v Speaker 2>everything you do.</v>

1638
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Like we've got to make money but we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to make money,</v>

1639
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:23.423
<v Speaker 2>but we got to make money instead of we </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to do what we like and put together </v>

1640
01:20:28.861 --> 01:20:32.470
<v Speaker 2>what we like and do the best possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of what we like.</v>

1641
01:20:32.670 --> 01:20:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Like a perfect example is like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

1642
01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no overhead.</v>

1643
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have a couple of employees.</v>

1644
01:20:41.521 --> 01:20:43.740
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no worries.</v>

1645
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:48.860
<v Speaker 2>So I don't give a fuck if I have you on </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about stuff or a sleep expert or</v>

1646
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:51.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have anybody on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1647
01:20:51.871 --> 01:20:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>

1648
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.070
<v Speaker 2>And I'll talk about whatever the fuck I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>

1649
01:20:56.071 --> 01:20:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

1650
01:20:57.091 --> 01:20:57.810
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1651
01:20:57.810 --> 01:20:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest in this.</v>

1652
01:20:59.581 --> 01:21:02.730
<v Speaker 2>I need that advertising money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to say if you.</v>

1653
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:04.103
<v Speaker 2>Because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of the reasons why the </v>

1654
01:21:05.671 --> 01:21:09.630
<v Speaker 2>show has been successful because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly represents my thinking.</v>

1655
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:10.703
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm allowed to pursue my </v>
<v Speaker 2>interests and have these conversations </v>

1656
01:21:14.821 --> 01:21:16.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and let it be pure.</v>

1657
01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.110
<v Speaker 2>I think if the ufc took that exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>approach,</v>

1658
01:21:19.111 --> 01:21:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I think the product would be better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if they had some,</v>

1659
01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:26.490
<v Speaker 2>like you breaking down the artistry of </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific techniques,</v>

1660
01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:31.940
<v Speaker 2>the air quote casual fan would be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>educated and they would learn more about</v>

1661
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:32.990
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1662
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.823
<v Speaker 2>and you get some of that from dominick </v>
<v Speaker 2>cruz when he does his breakdowns on fox </v>

1663
01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:39.320
<v Speaker 2>and some of the other fighters who do </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakdowns.</v>

1664
01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:42.660
<v Speaker 2>And when daniel cormier does wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>breakdowns,</v>

1665
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:46.620
<v Speaker 2>breakdowns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific techniques of whY they work and</v>

1666
01:21:46.621 --> 01:21:48.690
<v Speaker 2>why they don't work and what someone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing right or wrong,</v>

1667
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:50.610
<v Speaker 2>you get educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1668
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:53.450
<v Speaker 2>and I tried to do the best I can to when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to the ground and particularly,</v>

1669
01:21:53.451 --> 01:21:54.284
<v Speaker 2>which is where I think is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>confusing aspect of mma for the casual </v>

1670
01:21:57.001 --> 01:21:58.110
<v Speaker 2>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BuT,</v>

1671
01:21:58.190 --> 01:22:00.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should approach the,</v>

1672
01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:03.610
<v Speaker 2>the entire sport in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1673
01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:04.483
<v Speaker 2>the most illuminating way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think a guy like you and your </v>

1674
01:22:08.911 --> 01:22:11.790
<v Speaker 2>approach is very valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I love your breakdowns.</v>

1675
01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of them,</v>

1676
01:22:13.171 --> 01:22:18.090
<v Speaker 2>so I retweet them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that you have a very unique</v>

1677
01:22:18.091 --> 01:22:21.750
<v Speaker 2>and passionate and it is not just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>passionate approach,</v>

1678
01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:23.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My guy.</v>

1679
01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:24.324
<v Speaker 2>No you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to you when the cameras are </v>

1680
01:22:25.891 --> 01:22:28.410
<v Speaker 2>not on and you are just as interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1681
01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we're just going through.</v>

1682
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:32.881
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1683
01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:33.714
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going through whatever </v>

1684
01:22:36.091 --> 01:22:36.924
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to seek some kind of </v>

1685
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:40.860
<v Speaker 1>mastery and if you realize you're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>early in it,</v>

1686
01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:43.500
<v Speaker 1>you can do it by studying yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people do,</v>

1687
01:22:43.501 --> 01:22:45.040
<v Speaker 1>some people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they they are in,</v>

1688
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:45.953
<v Speaker 1>they go to church twice a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just looking to try to grow and </v>

1689
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:50.583
<v Speaker 1>if you do it with something that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply fascinated and eventually you </v>

1690
01:22:53.461 --> 01:22:55.860
<v Speaker 1>kind of learn about connections and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1691
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:56.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the study of martial arts or the </v>

1692
01:22:57.631 --> 01:22:58.464
<v Speaker 1>study of yoga or the study of jazz or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever teaches you about connections </v>

1693
01:23:02.431 --> 01:23:07.390
<v Speaker 1>and all things and my life is so good </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these little moments where I'm like,</v>

1694
01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't work for them.</v>

1695
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1696
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:11.823
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense for me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that because I get up in the </v>

1697
01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:17.440
<v Speaker 1>morning and I sit in my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make my wife and I coffee and I sit in</v>

1698
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:20.500
<v Speaker 1>my kitchen and I fucking analyze </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

1699
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I sit down and I look at it and I look </v>
<v Speaker 1>for moments and I look for things.</v>

1700
01:23:24.941 --> 01:23:25.774
<v Speaker 1>I think people will find fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look for things that will teach us </v>

1701
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:29.044
<v Speaker 1>something about life and I look for </v>
<v Speaker 1>these and I make them then what I make </v>

1702
01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:32.674
<v Speaker 1>and people seem to like them and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets me jobs commentating where I </v>

1703
01:23:35.561 --> 01:23:36.394
<v Speaker 1>fly off and I get to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got it so fucking good to try </v>

1704
01:23:39.371 --> 01:23:44.371
<v Speaker 1>to square peg my way into a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation because years back I dreamed</v>

1705
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:48.370
<v Speaker 1>about working there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you change your dream.</v>

1706
01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's okay to change your route</v>
<v Speaker 1>and find the world changes.</v>

1707
01:23:52.421 --> 01:23:53.254
<v Speaker 1>Constantly</v>

1708
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:56.060
<v Speaker 4>be afraid to be flexible and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1709
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.943
<v Speaker 4>the idea of holding onto a dream for </v>
<v Speaker 4>your entire life despite your interest </v>

1710
01:24:00.871 --> 01:24:02.330
<v Speaker 4>is pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1711
01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean There's things that I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do when I was young,</v>

1712
01:24:04.651 --> 01:24:06.330
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

1713
01:24:06.460 --> 01:24:08.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should follow your interest period.</v>

1714
01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.690
<v Speaker 4>If they change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're changing as you change and grow.</v>

1715
01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:13.853
<v Speaker 4>I mean these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I talked about my waning love or </v>

1716
01:24:17.191 --> 01:24:20.220
<v Speaker 4>talk one doe when I realized that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't really the right way to go.</v>

1717
01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.313
<v Speaker 4>When I first started doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was the most effective </v>

1718
01:24:22.921 --> 01:24:24.900
<v Speaker 4>martial art.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once I realized it wasn't.</v>

1719
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:28.350
<v Speaker 4>I lost interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lost interest in competing in it.</v>

1720
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.273
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't seem like the thing to do </v>

1721
01:24:30.511 --> 01:24:34.620
<v Speaker 4>anymore and I think that as you grow as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a human being,</v>

1722
01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.380
<v Speaker 4>you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should have oTher interests.</v>

1723
01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:38.543
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think the ones that are the most </v>

1724
01:24:40.261 --> 01:24:43.710
<v Speaker 4>intriguing in the most passionate or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're the,</v>

1725
01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:44.544
<v Speaker 4>you're the most passionate of theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to give you the most </v>

1726
01:24:46.831 --> 01:24:47.664
<v Speaker 4>reward that if you pursue them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're more passionate about music </v>

1727
01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:51.923
<v Speaker 4>than you are about accounting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you decide to stick with accounting </v>

1728
01:24:54.481 --> 01:24:56.460
<v Speaker 4>because it's what's paying your bills </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

1729
01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:57.910
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a dark road.</v>

1730
01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.050
<v Speaker 4>That's a soul sucking road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to go,</v>

1731
01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:02.830
<v Speaker 1>damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels scary in.</v>

1732
01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.690
<v Speaker 1>For somebody in that setting to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just in the short run,</v>

1733
01:25:06.691 --> 01:25:07.524
<v Speaker 1>it will be painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the long run it will be so </v>

1734
01:25:09.211 --> 01:25:13.770
<v Speaker 1>valuable and less painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years have way less.</v>

1735
01:25:13.771 --> 01:25:17.520
<v Speaker 1>PaIn is such a great trade for two years</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pain,</v>

1736
01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:18.453
<v Speaker 4>but if you're that guy with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>corvette that you've got that lease on </v>

1737
01:25:20.801 --> 01:25:22.810
<v Speaker 4>and you could barely fucking make those </v>
<v Speaker 4>payments,</v>

1738
01:25:22.811 --> 01:25:27.490
<v Speaker 4>you can not take any chances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to just work those extra hours.</v>

1739
01:25:27.491 --> 01:25:28.324
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I just put in two hours of overtime </v>

1740
01:25:29.561 --> 01:25:30.394
<v Speaker 4>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's still only 10 hours of work a </v>

1741
01:25:31.691 --> 01:25:32.524
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was two hours at 20 bucks an </v>

1742
01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:36.130
<v Speaker 4>hour and a little out and start doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>those calculations.</v>

1743
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.590
<v Speaker 4>And that's how you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how you get fucked and that's how</v>

1744
01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 4>you get trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And next thIng you know,</v>

1745
01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:41.014
<v Speaker 4>you've got a family and you've got kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you definitely can't move and you </v>

1746
01:25:43.551 --> 01:25:46.210
<v Speaker 4>got a mortgage and you definitely ain't </v>
<v Speaker 4>pursued any music dreams.</v>

1747
01:25:46.211 --> 01:25:47.460
<v Speaker 4>Now motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

1748
01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the trap that life leads.</v>

1749
01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:50.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1750
01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched.</v>

1751
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:55.500
<v Speaker 1>So I do a one man show now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I belt with a friend.</v>

1752
01:25:55.501 --> 01:25:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I built a one man show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a theater setting,</v>

1753
01:25:58.591 --> 01:25:59.311
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1754
01:25:59.311 --> 01:26:00.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>

1755
01:26:00.450 --> 01:26:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you use video for now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is for,</v>

1756
01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:07.580
<v Speaker 1>we put it for punchdrunk ted talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1757
01:26:07.581 --> 01:26:12.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's four story driven parts of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

1758
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:13.603
<v Speaker 1>take you on a bit of an in theory and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>practice so far people seem to be </v>

1759
01:26:17.391 --> 01:26:21.860
<v Speaker 1>inspired or find it compelling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have cried out of before,</v>

1760
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:24.620
<v Speaker 1>which was really quite moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I people just go to a dog day.</v>

1761
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>They may be shut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially.</v>

1762
01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:27.404
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1763
01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:28.483
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1764
01:26:28.570 --> 01:26:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it with,</v>

1765
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:30.944
<v Speaker 1>so I decided I wanted to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided I want to get up and tell </v>

1766
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:37.580
<v Speaker 1>stories and hopefully a fun and </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertain people,</v>

1767
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:40.730
<v Speaker 1>find them and inspire them or take them </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

1768
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:46.270
<v Speaker 1>And I did it partly I watched your show </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I would have never in a million</v>

1769
01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:47.234
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I saw you in vegas would never </v>

1770
01:26:48.141 --> 01:26:48.974
<v Speaker 1>in a million years thought I could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it's clearly a lifetime of </v>

1771
01:26:51.471 --> 01:26:52.304
<v Speaker 1>training and development and improvement</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trial and error and thousands and </v>

1772
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:57.163
<v Speaker 1>thousands of repetitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you look at that and you don't look </v>

1773
01:26:59.091 --> 01:27:01.910
<v Speaker 1>at an olympic gymnast and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do that.</v>

1774
01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't think of it at all,</v>

1775
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:04.873
<v Speaker 1>but then I saw brendan do his show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome and I realized he only </v>

1776
01:27:08.781 --> 01:27:11.000
<v Speaker 1>started working on this two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1777
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:14.210
<v Speaker 1>And all he represents is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard work,</v>

1778
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.770
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice and drive to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's possible.</v>

1779
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:19.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which shop is doing is what I said to </v>

1780
01:27:21.471 --> 01:27:22.304
<v Speaker 2>him as you are essentially using an </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete's work ethic and applying it to </v>

1781
01:27:26.601 --> 01:27:28.780
<v Speaker 2>an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's awesome about it.</v>

1782
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:33.020
<v Speaker 2>He's a funny guy who realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do standup,</v>

1783
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I just need to put the time in and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1784
01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that guy kill kill and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing comedy for like two years,</v>

1785
01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

1786
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:42.070
<v Speaker 1>is inspiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should,</v>

1787
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:43.383
<v Speaker 1>you should be aware when you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that means something you work on </v>

1788
01:27:46.481 --> 01:27:49.350
<v Speaker 1>for only a couple of years as possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're driven and smart and,</v>

1789
01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.670
<v Speaker 1>and really committed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I took out of his shell.</v>

1790
01:27:51.671 --> 01:27:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Plus he explained to me the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I decided I'm doing it right.</v>

1791
01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:55.983
<v Speaker 1>So I booked about five months ahead in </v>
<v Speaker 1>winnipeg because there was a ufc in </v>

1792
01:27:58.961 --> 01:28:01.930
<v Speaker 1>winnipeg and that's my hometown to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>small theater and I'm like,</v>

1793
01:28:01.931 --> 01:28:02.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five months.</v>

1794
01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do I do?</v>

1795
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:07.080
<v Speaker 1>So I called up a good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greg,</v>

1796
01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.250
<v Speaker 1>when you booked a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a show.</v>

1797
01:28:10.110 --> 01:28:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have the shell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe force yourself.</v>

1798
01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1799
01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:14.573
<v Speaker 1>And I cut but I had one plan that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to call it my friend graham </v>

1800
01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:17.963
<v Speaker 1>isadore who is a playwright and I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer for vice and a bunch of other </v>

1801
01:28:21.671 --> 01:28:24.130
<v Speaker 1>stuff and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very smart and interesting and we're</v>

1802
01:28:24.131 --> 01:28:26.320
<v Speaker 1>good friends but we have very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives.</v>

1803
01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.570
<v Speaker 1>And I said I booked this show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in six months.</v>

1804
01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I need 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be.</v>

1805
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:31.703
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has told some of my stories and vice </v>

1806
01:28:33.431 --> 01:28:36.820
<v Speaker 1>before getting drunk with sumo wrestlers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different,</v>

1807
01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:38.800
<v Speaker 1>different stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much do you weigh?</v>

1808
01:28:39.630 --> 01:28:40.463
<v Speaker 1>About 1:56.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you got drunk with sumo risks was </v>

1809
01:28:42.941 --> 01:28:45.110
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really like,</v>

1810
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:47.630
<v Speaker 1>it was joyous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.190
<v Speaker 1>That guy looks like a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There is a muscular person underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those additional layers of fat and </v>

1835
01:29:46.761 --> 01:29:48.230
<v Speaker 1>flush and skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

1836
01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:52.200
<v Speaker 1>there's a powerful athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real benefit and being that fat,</v>

1837
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:53.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1838
01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:56.400
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power generation like momentum,</v>

1839
01:29:56.401 --> 01:29:57.234
<v Speaker 1>the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if the other guy is that big and </v>

1840
01:29:59.581 --> 01:30:03.270
<v Speaker 1>our goal is just to smash into each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other until one of us has taken from the</v>

1841
01:30:03.271 --> 01:30:05.040
<v Speaker 1>platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not that big,</v>

1842
01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be very difficult.</v>

1843
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:07.623
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like An arms race of size over </v>

1844
01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:10.704
<v Speaker 1>generations where they just got bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bigger out of necessity because if </v>

1845
01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you're a bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1846
01:30:14.431 --> 01:30:15.830
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

1847
01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:18.660
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in theory,</v>

1848
01:30:18.661 --> 01:30:20.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe I could use your size against </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

1849
01:30:20.941 --> 01:30:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I could use technique and strategy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarts to,</v>

1850
01:30:24.570 --> 01:30:28.010
<v Speaker 1>to take you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could be big and also to that.</v>

1851
01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1852
01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.753
<v Speaker 1>So why not v also big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it good arms raced to that point and </v>

1853
01:30:33.391 --> 01:30:37.780
<v Speaker 1>there are little guys but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to watch this guy that's with them,</v>

1854
01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I think he was an impractical jokers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1855
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:43.163
<v Speaker 1>beyond that it's like he's the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous sumo guy in the world and I got </v>

1856
01:30:45.721 --> 01:30:49.080
<v Speaker 1>wasted with him at the world combat </v>
<v Speaker 1>games and st petersburg,</v>

1857
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got to commentate it,</v>

1858
01:30:51.570 --> 01:30:52.403
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was in saint petersburg and I </v>

1859
01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:55.763
<v Speaker 1>absolutely love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a niche where I get to </v>

1860
01:30:57.901 --> 01:31:00.420
<v Speaker 1>commentate like real traditional martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts,</v>

1861
01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:01.254
<v Speaker 1>a fair bit of done taekwondo and karate </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the pan am games and I did the world </v>

1862
01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.530
<v Speaker 1>so much championships or the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat games.</v>

1863
01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I do the world championships which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>kung fu and sanda.</v>

1864
01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:14.700
<v Speaker 1>And so I've carved out this niche where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I get called for these and,</v>

1865
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:19.110
<v Speaker 1>and develop expertise in these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas and get to experience them and see</v>

1866
01:31:19.111 --> 01:31:21.330
<v Speaker 1>the little details that change when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>change something.</v>

1867
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:26.070
<v Speaker 1>And so I got to commentate sumo and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>after he seemed to like me and he's kind</v>

1868
01:31:26.071 --> 01:31:31.071
<v Speaker 1>of like you would drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must suck that mad.</v>

1869
01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Like a fizzy drink vodka while you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia to Russia.</v>

1870
01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:38.500
<v Speaker 1>So I love Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1871
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the russians.</v>

1872
01:31:40.651 --> 01:31:41.484
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our view of combat and of artists </v>

1873
01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:47.970
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very straight.</v>

1874
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:48.833
<v Speaker 1>Like you know when you negotiate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentate or to do some work that just </v>

1875
01:31:51.691 --> 01:31:53.580
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we can pay you.</v>

1876
01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 1>This is what we expect of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

1877
01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:58.540
<v Speaker 1>we're all going to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's very sinister story.</v>

1878
01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Little bullshit.</v>

1879
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:04.270
<v Speaker 4>Frank mir does commentary for them over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and he's very good.</v>

1880
01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Frank mir,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would hope that someone would hire him</v>

1881
01:32:07.061 --> 01:32:07.894
<v Speaker 4>in America.</v>

1882
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.903
<v Speaker 1>They can't afford them because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting paid way too well in Russia in </v>

1883
01:32:12.091 --> 01:32:12.841
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1884
01:32:12.841 --> 01:32:13.674
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had for him and he said that's why </v>

1885
01:32:15.210 --> 01:32:18.230
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't do a deal with bella toi </v>
<v Speaker 1>know and,</v>

1886
01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.313
<v Speaker 1>and his deal with acb who he loves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>respects and it's become sort of </v>

1887
01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:23.090
<v Speaker 1>partners in there with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1888
01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:25.470
<v Speaker 1>with mr haas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who runs it,</v>

1889
01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:29.580
<v Speaker 1>where frank is now a part partner of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presentation of it,</v>

1890
01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.770
<v Speaker 1>went for american shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll be part,</v>

1891
01:32:31.771 --> 01:32:32.604
<v Speaker 1>he'll be part promoter and I think Frank</v>
<v Speaker 1>May even get away from some of the </v>

1892
01:32:36.151 --> 01:32:38.130
<v Speaker 1>commentary as much as he's good at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and loves it.</v>

1893
01:32:38.370 --> 01:32:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I thiNk he's interested in some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other aspects of it now,</v>

1894
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.500
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1895
01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:45.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pay very well.</v>

1896
01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:47.760
<v Speaker 1>They and they pay the athletes very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

1897
01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:51.930
<v Speaker 1>You can be a guy that had a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ufc fIghts or a belt or fighter to.</v>

1898
01:32:51.931 --> 01:32:52.764
<v Speaker 1>They'll give you 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>us cash in your hand in an envelope at </v>

1899
01:32:55.561 --> 01:32:56.394
<v Speaker 1>the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1900
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1901
01:32:57.230 --> 01:32:58.220
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1902
01:32:58.221 --> 01:33:00.230
<v Speaker 4>it's always great that fighters have </v>
<v Speaker 4>more options,</v>

1903
01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:01.253
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know bella tour has become a </v>

1904
01:33:03.051 --> 01:33:05.150
<v Speaker 4>viable option to a lot of fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1905
01:33:05.151 --> 01:33:08.480
<v Speaker 4>like guys like ryan bader making good </v>
<v Speaker 4>money over there now and,</v>

1906
01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:09.573
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roy Mcdonald obviously who's their </v>

1907
01:33:11.121 --> 01:33:13.100
<v Speaker 4>champion now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think,</v>

1908
01:33:13.101 --> 01:33:14.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need more of those.</v>

1909
01:33:14.571 --> 01:33:15.404
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1910
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:18.380
<v Speaker 4>I know that oscar de la hoya is getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the mix now,</v>

1911
01:33:18.381 --> 01:33:23.240
<v Speaker 4>but just the approach that he's making </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems to me to be ridiculous</v>

1912
01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:25.160
<v Speaker 1>old school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promote us approach,</v>

1913
01:33:25.161 --> 01:33:29.690
<v Speaker 1>get some big name and then invest all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your time in that big fight.</v>

1914
01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:30.553
<v Speaker 1>But It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the same thing you were just </v>

1915
01:33:31.821 --> 01:33:32.654
<v Speaker 1>talking about the ufc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The challenge they face now is that we </v>

1916
01:33:35.031 --> 01:33:36.770
<v Speaker 1>need another big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need another big one.</v>

1917
01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:39.130
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like that,</v>

1918
01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:40.790
<v Speaker 4>that approach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we just,</v>

1919
01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:41.631
<v Speaker 4>we know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1920
01:33:41.631 --> 01:33:44.360
<v Speaker 4>if this wasn't the upper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would this be the ideal approach?</v>

1921
01:33:44.530 --> 01:33:46.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never the ideal approach.</v>

1922
01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:48.350
<v Speaker 4>The ideal approach is to do the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights possible.</v>

1923
01:33:48.710 --> 01:33:49.543
<v Speaker 4>The ideal approach is not necessarily to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make the most money or to have the like </v>

1924
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:56.560
<v Speaker 4>the most spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1925
01:33:56.810 --> 01:34:01.810
<v Speaker 4>like when they were really promoting </v>
<v Speaker 4>ronda rousey and the rematch with or the</v>

1926
01:34:01.851 --> 01:34:04.400
<v Speaker 4>fight with Amanda Nunez and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>promote nunez at all.</v>

1927
01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:05.840
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1928
01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:06.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1929
01:34:06.981 --> 01:34:10.020
<v Speaker 4>this is a huge ronda rousey fan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody knows that too.</v>

1930
01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she's a,</v>

1931
01:34:11.630 --> 01:34:14.240
<v Speaker 4>she's a legend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what she did for women's mma,</v>

1932
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:15.343
<v Speaker 4>she essentially was the reason why the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ufc decided to have women's mma was one </v>

1933
01:34:19.971 --> 01:34:20.300
<v Speaker 4>woman</v>

1934
01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:22.910
<v Speaker 1>that woman fighting now I was here that </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1935
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:25.980
<v Speaker 4>It just passed her By and it happened so</v>
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>

1936
01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:27.593
<v Speaker 4>But Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking even before holly holm </v>

1937
01:34:31.741 --> 01:34:33.750
<v Speaker 4>beater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amanda Nunez was the big threat.</v>

1938
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.823
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that girl could knock you fucking dead </v>

1939
01:34:36.451 --> 01:34:40.230
<v Speaker 4>with one punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She is such a ruthless striker and she's</v>

1940
01:34:40.231 --> 01:34:41.940
<v Speaker 4>a brazilian jujitsu black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1941
01:34:41.941 --> 01:34:44.670
<v Speaker 4>this is a terrible matchup for rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

1942
01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.200
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because rhonda is hands,</v>

1943
01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.870
<v Speaker 4>although good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1944
01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:48.773
<v Speaker 4>and getting better and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really we're starting to look like a </v>

1945
01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:51.684
<v Speaker 4>polished striker still doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>nearly the kind of power that nunez has </v>

1946
01:34:56.370 --> 01:35:01.370
<v Speaker 4>and the that I could nunez nunez is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she can take it as well as receive it.</v>

1947
01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.273
<v Speaker 4>We had just seen rhonda sort of have </v>
<v Speaker 4>these bullets moments with like betco </v>

1948
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:07.140
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1949
01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:10.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of cerebral manner than bricks just</v>

1950
01:35:10.281 --> 01:35:11.114
<v Speaker 4>smashed through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when You see the overall game like </v>

1951
01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.840
<v Speaker 4>versus holly holm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you got to see all this.</v>

1952
01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:18.013
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot oF limitations here and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to smash through the bricks if </v>

1953
01:35:19.971 --> 01:35:22.040
<v Speaker 4>the bricks aren't there and the bricks </v>
<v Speaker 4>head kick,</v>

1954
01:35:22.041 --> 01:35:23.210
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1955
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.073
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're seeing the laYers upon layers </v>

1956
01:35:26.991 --> 01:35:27.824
<v Speaker 4>upon layers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what happens after you get to the </v>

1957
01:35:29.391 --> 01:35:31.550
<v Speaker 4>first layer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh well you don't have a second layer.</v>

1958
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:33.150
<v Speaker 4>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is your layer,</v>

1959
01:35:33.151 --> 01:35:35.030
<v Speaker 4>your layers straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Move ahead.</v>

1960
01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.700
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coaching is to blame as well.</v>

1961
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:38.703
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of things there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that they weren't even </v>

1962
01:35:41.121 --> 01:35:41.954
<v Speaker 4>promoting Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have the very first ever openly gay </v>

1963
01:35:45.741 --> 01:35:47.220
<v Speaker 4>women's mma champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1964
01:35:48.450 --> 01:35:50.320
<v Speaker 1>There's Interesting aspects and she's</v>

1965
01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:51.333
<v Speaker 4>fun girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's interesting and she's a fucking </v>

1966
01:35:54.551 --> 01:35:56.650
<v Speaker 4>killer man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a fucking killer,</v>

1967
01:35:56.651 --> 01:35:57.484
<v Speaker 4>and they showed it in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had an opportunity to make Another </v>

1968
01:35:59.591 --> 01:36:00.424
<v Speaker 4>star instead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't make this other star and </v>

1969
01:36:03.101 --> 01:36:04.990
<v Speaker 4>then you look at her most recent paper </v>
<v Speaker 4>view.</v>

1970
01:36:05.230 --> 01:36:07.080
<v Speaker 4>I heard the numberS were abysmal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bailey,</v>

1971
01:36:07.150 --> 01:36:07.983
<v Speaker 4>I heard see if you could find out what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the numbers were because someone told </v>

1972
01:36:10.571 --> 01:36:11.404
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was shop told me there were </v>

1973
01:36:12.281 --> 01:36:13.550
<v Speaker 4>85,000.</v>

1974
01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:16.530
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be,</v>

1975
01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:17.653
<v Speaker 1>but at this point you have to stop and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder is there anything we could do </v>

1976
01:36:21.690 --> 01:36:22.523
<v Speaker 1>strategically different like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because something worked all the way </v>

1977
01:36:25.771 --> 01:36:28.230
<v Speaker 1>along in any business or in anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>

1978
01:36:28.410 --> 01:36:29.243
<v Speaker 1>there might be a time to take a slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>different approach or to change one of </v>

1979
01:36:32.731 --> 01:36:35.430
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental beliefs of how we do </v>
<v Speaker 1>business or something.</v>

1980
01:36:35.730 --> 01:36:37.770
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you can't do is just go,</v>

1981
01:36:37.771 --> 01:36:39.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully the next one will be good.</v>

1982
01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:40.013
<v Speaker 1>I mean you watch that happen all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to some massive change in your </v>

1983
01:36:42.901 --> 01:36:47.901
<v Speaker 1>business or in life and that change at </v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

1984
01:36:48.861 --> 01:36:50.770
<v Speaker 1>People deny that it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1985
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:51.643
<v Speaker 1>They deny and then they say it's a niche</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they say it's a blip and then </v>

1986
01:36:54.021 --> 01:36:54.854
<v Speaker 1>by the time that it's actually in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat of something scary or challenging </v>

1987
01:36:58.701 --> 01:36:59.534
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've wasted two or three years that </v>

1988
01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:02.090
<v Speaker 1>you could have used adapting to</v>

1989
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:04.300
<v Speaker 4>ready for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1990
01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.280
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do know what you mean.</v>

1991
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:06.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1992
01:37:06.331 --> 01:37:07.164
<v Speaker 4>I think that what you gotta do when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a champion that has spectacular </v>

1993
01:37:11.941 --> 01:37:12.774
<v Speaker 4>results like Amanda Nunez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to hype the shit up or </v>

1994
01:37:14.850 --> 01:37:16.350
<v Speaker 4>invest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>invest,</v>

1995
01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:19.680
<v Speaker 4>hype the shit out of her and that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have made the ronda rousey fight.</v>

1996
01:37:19.681 --> 01:37:23.250
<v Speaker 4>I think even bigger if you show her </v>
<v Speaker 4>smashing misha tate,</v>

1997
01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.480
<v Speaker 4>you show her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1998
01:37:24.481 --> 01:37:27.480
<v Speaker 4>smashing Sarah Mcmahon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You show what she's capable of.</v>

1999
01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:28.650
<v Speaker 4>She's a fucking gun</v>

2000
01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.750
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

2001
01:37:29.751 --> 01:37:30.584
<v Speaker 1>I know you talked to Mike Brown or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone there who's been around the </v>

2002
01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:34.243
<v Speaker 1>greats and they talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this level now where they are the </v>

2003
01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:39.463
<v Speaker 1>brilliance of where what we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another example if you think that </v>

2004
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:47.870
<v Speaker 1>all only fighting to stand up when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in guard is right or only keeping</v>

2005
01:37:47.871 --> 01:37:50.110
<v Speaker 1>somebody down is the game and the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing you have to worry about us,</v>

2006
01:37:50.111 --> 01:37:51.500
<v Speaker 1>they'll stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll submit you.</v>

2007
01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Like as soon as you don't recognize </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are in the change of the river</v>

2008
01:37:56.791 --> 01:37:57.624
<v Speaker 1>of life and time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sometimes get fucked up and and you </v>

2009
01:38:01.771 --> 01:38:03.000
<v Speaker 1>know it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating thing.</v>

2010
01:38:03.001 --> 01:38:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I know I literally was just in Singapore</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just spent days with this company,</v>

2011
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:12.050
<v Speaker 1>but they see the world differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're strategy is simply.</v>

2012
01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:13.163
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a values based company that </v>

2013
01:38:15.241 --> 01:38:16.074
<v Speaker 1>believes in the values of these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tries to to show people and share </v>

2014
01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:24.000
<v Speaker 1>martial artists reef for the greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>good and it's not some business.</v>

2015
01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:24.893
<v Speaker 1>It's what they truly believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They truly are going about making </v>

2016
01:38:28.621 --> 01:38:30.450
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when chattery says,</v>

2017
01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I would not hire conor mcgregor because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he represents,</v>

2018
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:37.140
<v Speaker 1>he's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking serious people see represent his</v>

2019
01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:39.990
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his and what he sees.</v>

2020
01:38:40.050 --> 01:38:42.450
<v Speaker 1>And I shouldn't speak for him at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a brilliant man,</v>

2021
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.291
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

2022
01:38:43.291 --> 01:38:46.230
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a homeless kid with,</v>

2023
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:47.223
<v Speaker 1>with a single parent that later became </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated and then move to America and </v>

2024
01:38:50.851 --> 01:38:51.684
<v Speaker 1>went to harvard and then started </v>
<v Speaker 1>managing a corporate funds and became a </v>

2025
01:38:55.381 --> 01:38:57.930
<v Speaker 1>moitai champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is all easily documented.</v>

2026
01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:03.500
<v Speaker 1>This is who that individual is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's lived that life based on honor,</v>

2027
01:39:04.321 --> 01:39:06.250
<v Speaker 1>respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2028
01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teamwork excellence,</v>

2029
01:39:08.370 --> 01:39:11.280
<v Speaker 1>that mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what built that company.</v>

2030
01:39:11.281 --> 01:39:14.630
<v Speaker 1>And one is a billion dollar company now </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a billion dollar company.</v>

2031
01:39:14.631 --> 01:39:16.980
<v Speaker 1>It's in one point 7 billion homes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>asia.</v>

2032
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:18.143
<v Speaker 1>This isn't some mythological idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy who's built a massive </v>

2033
01:39:21.691 --> 01:39:23.790
<v Speaker 1>company based around these values.</v>

2034
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:25.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

2035
01:39:25.831 --> 01:39:27.240
<v Speaker 1>But what does he say about common?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2038
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:30.210
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2039
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:34.890
<v Speaker 1>so he looks at it as the things that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says and the way that,</v>

2040
01:39:34.891 --> 01:39:36.150
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't speak for him,</v>

2041
01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:37.590
<v Speaker 1>this was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've gathered,</v>

2042
01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:38.813
<v Speaker 1>throwing things and creating conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>and controversy as your currency is not </v>

2043
01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:45.150
<v Speaker 1>something to be proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting way of putting it as</v>

2044
01:39:45.151 --> 01:39:47.220
<v Speaker 1>your currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2045
01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:48.450
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2046
01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:52.500
<v Speaker 1>and that sounds because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not quite all that although I've</v>

2047
01:39:52.501 --> 01:39:53.334
<v Speaker 1>drank the koolaid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in what they're doing and I </v>

2048
01:39:54.691 --> 01:39:55.524
<v Speaker 1>see it as real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only because my values line up with </v>

2049
01:39:57.781 --> 01:39:58.614
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they are going to grow </v>

2050
01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.530
<v Speaker 1>dramatically as a result of some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2051
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.960
<v Speaker 1>the way they see the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

2052
01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:08.100
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still also immersed here and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like connor,</v>

2053
01:40:08.490 --> 01:40:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I think of connor.</v>

2054
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:11.183
<v Speaker 1>I work for tsn because connor fell out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a march to a red carpet to shake my </v>

2055
01:40:15.061 --> 01:40:17.070
<v Speaker 1>hand while the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my boss was watching.</v>

2056
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:18.960
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2057
01:40:18.961 --> 01:40:19.794
<v Speaker 1>Like the great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the most interesting moments </v>

2058
01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I've had are with that guy and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting,</v>

2059
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many dozens of hours of trying to figure</v>

2060
01:40:27.811 --> 01:40:31.470
<v Speaker 1>out what's happening in research and </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth has happened by studying that guy</v>

2061
01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:32.633
<v Speaker 1>and I see his games that he is willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play as part of his strategy for </v>

2062
01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:38.544
<v Speaker 1>success as a fighter and success trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be successful for his family and his </v>

2063
01:40:43.321 --> 01:40:44.154
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it all connected so I don't </v>

2064
01:40:45.391 --> 01:40:47.310
<v Speaker 1>dislike him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I respect this,</v>

2065
01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:52.410
<v Speaker 1>this idea that conflict and controversy </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not good for us.</v>

2066
01:40:52.470 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also understand</v>

2067
01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.193
<v Speaker 2>psychological warfare and I think the is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a master of that and that has a huge </v>

2068
01:40:57.761 --> 01:40:59.020
<v Speaker 2>factor in victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2069
01:40:59.021 --> 01:41:01.690
<v Speaker 2>this is something me and mo musashi use </v>
<v Speaker 2>to his advantage.</v>

2070
01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2071
01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:05.340
<v Speaker 2>when you read the book of five rings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2072
01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:09.490
<v Speaker 2>what connor's doing is fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's heads to the point where they,</v>

2073
01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.600
<v Speaker 2>he has space in their head and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>conor goes into the cage,</v>

2074
01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:17.080
<v Speaker 2>like loose as a goose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed and calm.</v>

2075
01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:18.093
<v Speaker 2>So he's letting you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about you but you </v>

2076
01:41:20.801 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 2>give a fuck about me and I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you up right now.</v>

2077
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:23.981
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2078
01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:25.060
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better not.</v>

2079
01:41:25.061 --> 01:41:25.894
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

2080
01:41:26.050 --> 01:41:29.020
<v Speaker 2>This is too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And josie all was the perfect example,</v>

2081
01:41:29.021 --> 01:41:29.854
<v Speaker 2>although was so out of composure a </v>
<v Speaker 2>although charged at him would that just </v>

2082
01:41:34.331 --> 01:41:37.630
<v Speaker 2>leaping left hook and just got fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>waylaid on the way in.</v>

2083
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:39.850
<v Speaker 2>And eddie alvarez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>The greatest game day performer,</v>

2084
01:41:39.851 --> 01:41:42.340
<v Speaker 2>one of the great game day performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've ever seen.</v>

2085
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:43.923
<v Speaker 2>and I talked to eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie is one of my favorites and I </v>

2086
01:41:47.230 --> 01:41:51.490
<v Speaker 2>admire and am inspired by eddie alvarez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Chandler tail,</v>

2087
01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:52.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those two are like the same guy on last </v>

2088
01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:56.620
<v Speaker 2>year almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But eddie was like,</v>

2089
01:41:56.770 --> 01:42:01.540
<v Speaker 2>the plan was to wrestle a lot and stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>at distance and barely at all.</v>

2090
01:42:01.570 --> 01:42:03.490
<v Speaker 2>And I stayed at a distance almost the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole time.</v>

2091
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Barely wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's just like,</v>

2092
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:06.183
<v Speaker 2>it was real like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I am by not accepting it was real </v>

2093
01:42:09.461 --> 01:42:11.890
<v Speaker 2>coming in and suddenly find yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it's real.</v>

2094
01:42:11.891 --> 01:42:13.510
<v Speaker 2>And you feel different in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2095
01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:14.353
<v Speaker 2>your mind is working differently and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hormones are working differently </v>

2096
01:42:16.421 --> 01:42:18.790
<v Speaker 2>and who you are in that moment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different and you're like,</v>

2097
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:20.320
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

2098
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:21.183
<v Speaker 2>Had I prepared for it to be real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be in a different state right </v>

2099
01:42:23.921 --> 01:42:24.754
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I denied that this was going to be </v>

2100
01:42:25.691 --> 01:42:27.010
<v Speaker 2>real and now it's fucking real.</v>

2101
01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Santa claus is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>

2102
01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:32.470
<v Speaker 2>I also think he got clipped early on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a factor.</v>

2103
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:34.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get caught on the chin like that and</v>

2104
01:42:34.511 --> 01:42:36.650
<v Speaker 2>your legs give out real quick and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

2105
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Your brain doesn't work right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body doesn't work right anymore.</v>

2106
01:42:39.551 --> 01:42:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2107
01:42:41.150 --> 01:42:41.983
<v Speaker 2>the ability that connor has to land </v>
<v Speaker 2>those sharp shots that come out of </v>

2108
01:42:45.941 --> 01:42:50.941
<v Speaker 2>nowhere and blitz you and come at you so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast and just drop those shots on you.</v>

2109
01:42:51.101 --> 01:42:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean his left hand is a fucking laser </v>
<v Speaker 2>beam and planning it.</v>

2110
01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:58.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The definition of it.</v>

2111
01:42:58.960 --> 01:42:59.793
<v Speaker 2>He's so good at landing that shot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's also good at landing a bunch of </v>

2112
01:43:02.911 --> 01:43:03.930
<v Speaker 2>other shit too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2113
01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:05.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pick you apart.</v>

2114
01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.360
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a real dynamo.</v>

2115
01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:08.253
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to see things like what happened </v>

2116
01:43:11.231 --> 01:43:12.064
<v Speaker 2>in New York and brooklyn and he threw </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dolly at the bus and smashed the </v>

2117
01:43:14.741 --> 01:43:15.100
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>

2118
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:17.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's so fucking stupid.</v>

2119
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.863
<v Speaker 2>All that thug is shit running in with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other guys and everyone's </v>

2120
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:24.490
<v Speaker 2>screaming at will was what would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be due.</v>

2121
01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:27.550
<v Speaker 2>He smacked your friend in the face </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your friend was talking shit.</v>

2122
01:43:27.610 --> 01:43:28.520
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2123
01:43:28.530 --> 01:43:30.670
<v Speaker 2>and even the way smacked him was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>gentle,</v>

2124
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:32.083
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And artem called hIm a coward and he </v>

2125
01:43:34.571 --> 01:43:35.760
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't he doesn't fight.</v>

2126
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Conor is a real fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is like,</v>

2127
01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.310
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a russian.</v>

2128
01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:40.293
<v Speaker 2>your a russian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys got to sort this out on your </v>

2129
01:43:41.831 --> 01:43:42.664
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is how they saw it was a pretty </v>

2130
01:43:44.621 --> 01:43:47.800
<v Speaker 2>calm sorting out in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't stomp him,</v>

2131
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:51.160
<v Speaker 2>they didn't beat his ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once we get to that point,</v>

2132
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean I get</v>

2133
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2134
01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.710
<v Speaker 1>once you're doing something and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>responding,</v>

2135
01:43:54.711 --> 01:43:55.544
<v Speaker 1>which he responds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens everyday in gangs and wars </v>

2136
01:43:57.891 --> 01:43:58.724
<v Speaker 1>in northern Ireland and Ireland and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>types of religions that's been going on </v>

2137
01:44:01.821 --> 01:44:03.710
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever wins.</v>

2138
01:44:03.711 --> 01:44:05.080
<v Speaker 1>When that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just goes.</v>

2139
01:44:05.150 --> 01:44:05.983
<v Speaker 1>It just perpetuates it and when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it and then there'll be a lot of </v>

2140
01:44:08.811 --> 01:44:09.644
<v Speaker 1>people you see this scenario and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>habib's fans or friends or supporters </v>

2141
01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:16.140
<v Speaker 1>and condos and they're Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did this,</v>

2142
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.980
<v Speaker 1>he did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both wrong and nobody.</v>

2143
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:20.143
<v Speaker 1>Everybody always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when soMebody does something bad to </v>

2144
01:44:21.921 --> 01:44:22.754
<v Speaker 1>somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost always feel like something </v>

2145
01:44:23.901 --> 01:44:24.734
<v Speaker 1>was done bad to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few people instigate that was </v>

2146
01:44:26.931 --> 01:44:27.764
<v Speaker 1>perceived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something happened to perceive a slight </v>

2147
01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:32.960
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people you do one thing to them and</v>

2148
01:44:32.961 --> 01:44:33.741
<v Speaker 1>then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2149
01:44:33.741 --> 01:44:35.660
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's to eternity.</v>

2150
01:44:37.330 --> 01:44:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Well that doesn't make any sense either.</v>

2151
01:44:39.110 --> 01:44:40.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look like a fool,</v>

2152
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2153
01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:45.110
<v Speaker 1>you just can't throw a dolly at a bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2154
01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:46.223
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with other fighters because it's </v>

2155
01:44:47.571 --> 01:44:49.370
<v Speaker 1>so selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2156
01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.480
<v Speaker 1>all those people that got caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2157
01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:52.333
<v Speaker 1>I mean ray bore got cuts in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the whole thing is a </v>

2158
01:44:55.881 --> 01:44:58.190
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my theory,</v>

2159
01:44:58.191 --> 01:45:00.980
<v Speaker 1>based on bits of information that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

2160
01:45:01.730 --> 01:45:03.620
<v Speaker 1>is that connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on some level,</v>

2161
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it reinforces constantly.</v>

2162
01:45:06.710 --> 01:45:07.543
<v Speaker 1>If your kid does something terrible that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know is bad and you gave them candy </v>

2163
01:45:10.701 --> 01:45:14.270
<v Speaker 1>every time they're going to give her </v>
<v Speaker 1>candy,</v>

2164
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:18.050
<v Speaker 1>every time she does something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reward conn has been rewarded.</v>

2165
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:19.670
<v Speaker 1>He gets richer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more famous,</v>

2166
01:45:19.671 --> 01:45:21.350
<v Speaker 1>more influential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a belts,</v>

2167
01:45:21.351 --> 01:45:26.060
<v Speaker 1>and he's been given candy every time </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done this.</v>

2168
01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:26.953
<v Speaker 1>And it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean there is parallels in the </v>

2169
01:45:29.391 --> 01:45:30.860
<v Speaker 1>political system in America.</v>

2170
01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:31.693
<v Speaker 1>There's parallels all oVer the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that by acting out in these strange </v>

2171
01:45:34.251 --> 01:45:35.084
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so bizarre and unsettling that </v>

2172
01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:38.360
<v Speaker 1>we've rewarded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2173
01:45:38.361 --> 01:45:40.580
<v Speaker 1>the name for a Band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candy for bad behavior.</v>

2174
01:45:40.610 --> 01:45:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be fun.</v>

2175
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.800
<v Speaker 1>But that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2176
01:45:45.801 --> 01:45:46.634
<v Speaker 1>And so now we take it and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you add the strategy element </v>

2177
01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.111
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2178
01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:52.910
<v Speaker 1>So he's looking at it and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2179
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:56.270
<v Speaker 1>a b would be a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to fight in Russia.</v>

2180
01:45:56.271 --> 01:45:59.570
<v Speaker 1>He likes challenges is just hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's do it now.</v>

2181
01:45:59.571 --> 01:46:03.160
<v Speaker 1>If I create some viral controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I did with,</v>

2182
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:05.300
<v Speaker 1>with mala malignaggi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is,</v>

2183
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:07.040
<v Speaker 1>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know polly?</v>

2184
01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I've only talked to him on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2185
01:46:08.690 --> 01:46:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love polly.</v>

2186
01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:14.240
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love math and I liked him as a dude.</v>

2187
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2188
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:17.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2189
01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.850
<v Speaker 1>so he created that and it worked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2190
01:46:19.851 --> 01:46:20.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether,</v>

2191
01:46:20.751 --> 01:46:23.120
<v Speaker 1>how on what level he's strategizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2192
01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:23.953
<v Speaker 1>He's lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go do some pushing and shoving </v>

2193
01:46:25.641 --> 01:46:26.474
<v Speaker 1>with habib in his guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some given the finger will be caught on </v>

2194
01:46:28.071 --> 01:46:29.060
<v Speaker 1>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2195
01:46:29.061 --> 01:46:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what one thing we know about connor,</v>

2196
01:46:30.501 --> 01:46:32.900
<v Speaker 1>he's always late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always late.</v>

2197
01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:34.910
<v Speaker 1>He didn't plan to get there when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a bus.</v>

2198
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:36.710
<v Speaker 1>He planned to get there when they're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hall,</v>

2199
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:37.723
<v Speaker 1>he planned to get their windows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people around and security </v>

2200
01:46:39.501 --> 01:46:43.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's easy to manage little push and </v>
<v Speaker 1>little shove and a couple of cameras and</v>

2201
01:46:43.131 --> 01:46:45.270
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden his $5,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>payday,</v>

2202
01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.000
<v Speaker 1>so $12,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>payday in Russia.</v>

2203
01:46:47.001 --> 01:46:48.380
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll work.</v>

2204
01:46:48.381 --> 01:46:49.710
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's late.</v>

2205
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:51.023
<v Speaker 1>So he shows up there on the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the cameras are out and what's he </v>

2206
01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:54.660
<v Speaker 1>gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to perform.</v>

2207
01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:55.673
<v Speaker 1>He came there to perform it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came there to do a thing we showed up </v>

2208
01:46:57.510 --> 01:47:01.560
<v Speaker 1>and now it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it goes sideways and that's the most</v>

2209
01:47:01.561 --> 01:47:04.740
<v Speaker 1>likely scenario is that it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

2210
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:07.260
<v Speaker 1>It'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll feel right for us as,</v>

2211
01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:08.333
<v Speaker 1>as defending our friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it'll have some inherent value </v>

2212
01:47:10.501 --> 01:47:12.540
<v Speaker 1>in the cameras come out and nobody will </v>
<v Speaker 1>get hurt.</v>

2213
01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:14.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're probably right there.</v>

2214
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:15.920
<v Speaker 4>It's got to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a good point,</v>

2215
01:47:16.610 --> 01:47:20.060
<v Speaker 4>but obviously it's a terrible thing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do and stupid.</v>

2216
01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:20.801
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2217
01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:23.120
<v Speaker 4>there's a way to manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then people say,</v>

2218
01:47:23.121 --> 01:47:23.661
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2219
01:47:23.661 --> 01:47:26.830
<v Speaker 4>now becomes like the wwe and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2220
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:27.833
<v Speaker 4>there's people that love real fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have a real hard time with these </v>

2221
01:47:32.631 --> 01:47:37.631
<v Speaker 4>fake wwe style scenarios where you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that whether it's colby,</v>

2222
01:47:38.631 --> 01:47:39.920
<v Speaker 4>covington,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2223
01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.310
<v Speaker 4>like he did a promo recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had a,</v>

2224
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:47.480
<v Speaker 4>a girl bY the pool and the girl sat in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his lap and she was like obviously had a</v>

2225
01:47:48.711 --> 01:47:52.490
<v Speaker 4>plan script and it seemed kind of corny </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2226
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:56.120
<v Speaker 4>There's people who think that's great </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's people fucking hate it.</v>

2227
01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm the heyday.</v>

2228
01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:58.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the hated too.</v>

2229
01:47:58.181 --> 01:47:59.200
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2230
01:47:59.210 --> 01:48:00.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a real problem with pro </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling.</v>

2231
01:48:00.951 --> 01:48:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I joke around about it all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I get the fact that people like it.</v>

2232
01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:07.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that kind of shit bleeding </v>
<v Speaker 4>into mma.</v>

2233
01:48:07.190 --> 01:48:08.090
<v Speaker 4>I think it's dumb</v>

2234
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:09.980
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>

2235
01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2236
01:48:12.230 --> 01:48:17.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're viewing it as inspiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistry with which there are lessons to</v>

2237
01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:18.524
<v Speaker 1>fucking live your life on one hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>on and that's how I truly see it and </v>

2238
01:48:23.211 --> 01:48:27.280
<v Speaker 1>interface with it and experience it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and share it and,</v>

2239
01:48:27.281 --> 01:48:28.114
<v Speaker 1>and want to see people get to feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then on the other hand you're </v>

2240
01:48:32.330 --> 01:48:35.420
<v Speaker 1>putting together these weird scripts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell pay per views,</v>

2241
01:48:35.421 --> 01:48:36.254
<v Speaker 1>but wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff that came up in wrestling </v>

2242
01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:42.600
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't inherently real needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those extras.</v>

2243
01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:43.453
<v Speaker 1>it needed all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we understood how brilliant colbY </v>

2244
01:48:46.491 --> 01:48:47.324
<v Speaker 1>covington was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we understood how brilliant of a </v>

2245
01:48:48.681 --> 01:48:51.680
<v Speaker 1>combat sportsman he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't have to do that.</v>

2246
01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:53.900
<v Speaker 1>But he's doing that and that's what got </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a title shot.</v>

2247
01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:54.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on the other side,</v>

2248
01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.570
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the coin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're wrong.</v>

2249
01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:59.960
<v Speaker 1>You want know if we understood he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it based on that,</v>

2250
01:49:00.110 --> 01:49:01.400
<v Speaker 1>but we don't understand.</v>

2251
01:49:01.570 --> 01:49:02.121
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2252
01:49:02.121 --> 01:49:03.800
<v Speaker 1>the royal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't get it.</v>

2253
01:49:03.801 --> 01:49:08.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'll see people talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting after and they'll be like there</v>

2254
01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.093
<v Speaker 1>and some people's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is their idea of covering a fight </v>

2255
01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:14.780
<v Speaker 1>and our fans or people and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>entitled to their own thing,</v>

2256
01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:16.010
<v Speaker 1>but they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2257
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:18.890
<v Speaker 1>the show is kind of a lackluster fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of finishes.</v>

2258
01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:20.173
<v Speaker 1>Fuck in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 brilliant athletes have interact in </v>

2259
01:49:23.631 --> 01:49:28.631
<v Speaker 1>some of your opinion of how it did or </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't excite you is super valid to you.</v>

2260
01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:29.953
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what we were watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm talking about is like what </v>

2261
01:49:32.571 --> 01:49:33.404
<v Speaker 1>got them a title shot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My title shot is being an asshole </v>

2262
01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:37.640
<v Speaker 1>because of the reality that we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he had to do.</v>

2263
01:49:37.641 --> 01:49:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2264
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:40.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean like what he did in Brazil after </v>
<v Speaker 4>he beat damien,</v>

2265
01:49:40.041 --> 01:49:40.874
<v Speaker 4>maia said this is a shit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's literally what got in the title </v>

2266
01:49:42.951 --> 01:49:44.720
<v Speaker 4>shot mean if you really stop and think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

2267
01:49:44.721 --> 01:49:46.760
<v Speaker 4>He's ranked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is he ranked number three?</v>

2268
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 4>He's only beaten maya.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's beaten some other people,</v>

2269
01:49:49.631 --> 01:49:54.010
<v Speaker 4>but it terms of top 10 contenders in </v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of like real world class fighters.</v>

2270
01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:55.353
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of guys that are out there</v>
<v Speaker 4>that have fucked up a lot of other </v>

2271
01:49:57.341 --> 01:50:00.790
<v Speaker 4>people like wonder wonderboy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is this guy fighting for the title,</v>

2272
01:50:00.910 --> 01:50:01.743
<v Speaker 4>for an interim title and I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After he's gone through those two big </v>

2273
01:50:04.391 --> 01:50:06.970
<v Speaker 4>fights with tyron woodley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beaten jorge mas,</v>

2274
01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:07.813
<v Speaker 4>vidar beaten all these debate and Johnny</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hendricks beaten all these different </v>

2275
01:50:10.181 --> 01:50:11.014
<v Speaker 4>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Colby beat damien maia and that's the </v>

2276
01:50:12.801 --> 01:50:13.634
<v Speaker 4>really the big name on his resume and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's also because he's going to be </v>

2277
01:50:16.691 --> 01:50:18.670
<v Speaker 4>fighting hartfield oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is a brazilian?</v>

2278
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 4>He said a lot of stupid shit about </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazil.</v>

2279
01:50:20.831 --> 01:50:21.664
<v Speaker 4>Brazilians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hayden.</v>

2280
01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.150
<v Speaker 4>Brazil is a giant market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an easy sell and this is.</v>

2281
01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:27.760
<v Speaker 4>This is what he's talked himself into </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's a tough fight.</v>

2282
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:31.540
<v Speaker 4>Don't make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy that beat damien maia is a tough</v>

2283
01:50:31.630 --> 01:50:32.790
<v Speaker 4>fucking fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Colby.</v>

2284
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2285
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:35.783
<v Speaker 1>you talked to dean thomas or Mike Brown </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they two years back when they were </v>

2286
01:50:39.691 --> 01:50:42.960
<v Speaker 1>taught and I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a jorge mosfet all freak,</v>

2287
01:50:42.961 --> 01:50:43.521

2288
01:50:43.521 --> 01:50:45.750
<v Speaker 1>that's one of those special artists to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2289
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll be asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2290
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:51.480
<v Speaker 1>when I'll see mike or dean or these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anybody around that.</v>

2291
01:50:51.481 --> 01:50:51.961
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2292
01:50:51.961 --> 01:50:52.950
<v Speaker 1>how's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's jorge doing?</v>

2293
01:50:52.951 --> 01:50:53.784
<v Speaker 1>What's he working on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is he changes and they'll talk and </v>

2294
01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.120
<v Speaker 1>he's always traded with colby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2295
01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:00.750
<v Speaker 1>he's deadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the greats in the gym.</v>

2296
01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:01.593
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two of them are first there last to </v>

2297
01:51:02.821 --> 01:51:03.654
<v Speaker 1>leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've heard about how good he was </v>

2298
01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:09.390
<v Speaker 1>under that public surface and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I see what you're saying,</v>

2299
01:51:09.410 --> 01:51:10.243
<v Speaker 1>the based on what we've created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have much of a choice if he </v>

2300
01:51:15.571 --> 01:51:16.404
<v Speaker 1>wants to achieve his goals other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it this way and the guys who are </v>

2301
01:51:18.961 --> 01:51:19.860
<v Speaker 1>good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jail,</v>

2302
01:51:19.861 --> 01:51:23.940
<v Speaker 1>obviously the tail is really good at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the greatest entertainer.</v>

2303
01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And don'T you love kale?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to fucking love child.</v>

2304
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:28.583
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something I find distasteful </v>

2305
01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:33.090
<v Speaker 1>about this art form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that game.</v>

2306
01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Yet somehow child is so lovable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love child,</v>

2307
01:51:36.810 --> 01:51:37.643
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's because there's a natural love </v>

2308
01:51:40.861 --> 01:51:43.630
<v Speaker 1>of that kind of performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And colby and I've,</v>

2309
01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:44.753
<v Speaker 1>I've played around with it a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I played in a band where you would </v>

2310
01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:48.990
<v Speaker 1>be rude and arrogant and play that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of game.</v>

2311
01:51:49.410 --> 01:51:51.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

2312
01:51:52.170 --> 01:51:53.370
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do.</v>

2313
01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:55.650
<v Speaker 1>It's hard when it's hard to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>convincing.</v>

2314
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:57.600
<v Speaker 1>It's also hard to behave it all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2315
01:51:57.720 --> 01:51:58.770
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you.</v>

2316
01:51:59.010 --> 01:51:59.843
<v Speaker 1>You will feel the hatred of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>brazilians who truly hate you even </v>

2317
01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:07.900
<v Speaker 1>though you're playing a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting real about that shit.</v>

2318
01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:12.110
<v Speaker 4>Zillions are extremely patriotic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very nationalistic.</v>

2319
01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:14.630
<v Speaker 4>You talk shit about Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You better duck.</v>

2320
01:52:15.650 --> 01:52:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

2321
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:25.450
<v Speaker 1>even if you were talk to somebody like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical he passionate person we're</v>

2322
01:52:26.121 --> 01:52:26.954
<v Speaker 1>talking about here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you said it's a joke and they'd be </v>

2323
01:52:28.881 --> 01:52:30.710
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't make that joke.</v>

2324
01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:31.583
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at their point isn't that I don't </v>

2325
01:52:33.531 --> 01:52:34.364
<v Speaker 1>care if he was kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he was willing to do that </v>

2326
01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:37.903
<v Speaker 1>is so disrespectful to all of us that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>must slit his throat and that's what </v>

2327
01:52:41.901 --> 01:52:44.690
<v Speaker 1>they'll chant when he goes to walk out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they mean it.</v>

2328
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 1>They do mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile</v>

2329
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:48.770
<v Speaker 3>he just doubled down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't give a fuck even after get hit</v>

2330
01:52:48.771 --> 01:52:51.140
<v Speaker 3>in the head with the boomerang still </v>
<v Speaker 3>doubling down,</v>

2331
01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:53.150
<v Speaker 3>swinging for the fences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What other choice?</v>

2332
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:54.350
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well look,</v>

2333
01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:55.273
<v Speaker 3>it has got him to the dance and if he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wins two saturdays from this one or one </v>

2334
01:53:01.011 --> 01:53:02.000
<v Speaker 3>saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's it going?</v>

2335
01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is tail and wonderboy.</v>

2336
01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another one to talk.</v>

2337
01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:10.190
<v Speaker 3>But if he wins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he wins,</v>

2338
01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:11.660
<v Speaker 3>he will have a belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2339
01:53:11.661 --> 01:53:14.870
<v Speaker 3>it's not the real belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's an interim belt,</v>

2340
01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:17.270
<v Speaker 3>but it guarantees him a shot at the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>belt.</v>

2341
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:18.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2342
01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:21.460
<v Speaker 3>so it gets very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I,</v>

2343
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I know that I my look at these sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems and the areas around it,</v>

2344
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:31.860
<v Speaker 3>I have a negative bias.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2345
01:53:32.210 --> 01:53:33.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about that and I know that's </v>

2346
01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:39.640
<v Speaker 3>that's negative to me about the belt or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rankings or the beefs or whatever,</v>

2347
01:53:39.860 --> 01:53:43.430
<v Speaker 3>but the belt cannot mean what it meant </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2348
01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:44.473
<v Speaker 3>By the nature of once upon a time there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were only ever 27 of them and now there </v>

2349
01:53:47.901 --> 01:53:51.830
<v Speaker 3>has been 340 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By nature it cannot be as valuable as it</v>

2350
01:53:51.831 --> 01:53:52.664
<v Speaker 3>once was and when there's two in yours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it inherently cannot have the value </v>

2351
01:53:56.871 --> 01:53:58.880
<v Speaker 3>because scarcity is where value comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>

2352
01:53:58.970 --> 01:54:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really just a promotional tool.</v>

2353
01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:03.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a marketing tool and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a questionable one.</v>

2354
01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:04.611
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2355
01:54:04.611 --> 01:54:05.444
<v Speaker 3>there's a real good argument that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad idea to have these interim title </v>

2356
01:54:08.781 --> 01:54:10.070
<v Speaker 3>shots because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2357
01:54:10.071 --> 01:54:11.570
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what's the rules?</v>

2358
01:54:11.571 --> 01:54:13.460
<v Speaker 3>You just decide when to have an interim </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot,</v>

2359
01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:15.230
<v Speaker 3>especially with a guy like tony </v>
<v Speaker 3>ferguson,</v>

2360
01:54:15.231 --> 01:54:16.064
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beats Kevin Lee spectacular five </v>

2361
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:21.830
<v Speaker 3>triangles and off to nobody after that </v>
<v Speaker 3>last one.</v>

2362
01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:22.693
<v Speaker 3>One the interim title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you strip it because he falls </v>

2363
01:54:25.341 --> 01:54:28.100
<v Speaker 3>down during a promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He trips on some wires.</v>

2364
01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:29.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't,</v>

2365
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:30.163
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like he went and did something </v>

2366
01:54:31.221 --> 01:54:32.054
<v Speaker 3>stupid outside of fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just doing promotion and tripped </v>

2367
01:54:35.991 --> 01:54:40.340
<v Speaker 3>on some wires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so freak accident and that really,</v>

2368
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:44.390
<v Speaker 3>if we move away all other things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just look at the systems at play and how</v>

2369
01:54:44.391 --> 01:54:46.160
<v Speaker 3>and why it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he was,</v>

2370
01:54:46.161 --> 01:54:48.620
<v Speaker 3>if he had another 2 million instagram </v>
<v Speaker 3>followers,</v>

2371
01:54:48.621 --> 01:54:50.030
<v Speaker 3>that would not happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2372
01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:51.200
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2373
01:54:51.201 --> 01:54:53.000
<v Speaker 3>It's strictly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is true,</v>

2374
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.863
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:55.940
<v Speaker 3>It was a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge star.</v>

2376
01:54:55.941 --> 01:54:57.350
<v Speaker 3>There's no way they would strip him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2377
01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2378
01:54:58.150 --> 01:54:59.660
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but by not being,</v>

2379
01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.210
<v Speaker 3>because he's a character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2380
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:03.410
<v Speaker 3>he's an oddball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is a unique.</v>

2381
01:55:03.411 --> 01:55:05.960
<v Speaker 3>He's one of a kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should celebrate that.</v>

2382
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:08.270
<v Speaker 3>He's one of a kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an individual.</v>

2383
01:55:08.271 --> 01:55:10.150
<v Speaker 3>He's different than everybody that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sale.</v>

2384
01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:11.990
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to strip connor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they did,</v>

2385
01:55:12.290 --> 01:55:16.220
<v Speaker 3>and you have khabib fight for the title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the true title and,</v>

2386
01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:16.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2387
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:17.743
<v Speaker 3>that's arguable whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should do that as you'd probably be two </v>

2388
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:21.290
<v Speaker 3>interim fights are transgender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2389
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:22.610
<v Speaker 3>titles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will be cool.</v>

2390
01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:25.370
<v Speaker 3>He's not beating the champion if he </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't beat the champion,</v>

2391
01:55:25.371 --> 01:55:27.980
<v Speaker 3>he beat out quinta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is him beating out?</v>

2392
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I quinta more valid than tony beating </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Lee.</v>

2393
01:55:30.741 --> 01:55:31.850
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>

2394
01:55:32.180 --> 01:55:33.680
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2395
01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:35.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not taking anything away against albert.</v>

2396
01:55:35.901 --> 01:55:38.540
<v Speaker 3>Al took that fight on unfucking one </v>
<v Speaker 3>day's notice.</v>

2397
01:55:38.541 --> 01:55:39.374
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's even more ridiculous and </v>

2398
01:55:40.431 --> 01:55:41.420
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2399
01:55:41.590 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 3>and that was a great fight too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was</v>

2400
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:44.813
<v Speaker 1>really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2401
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a puncher.</v>

2402
01:55:46.650 --> 01:55:47.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really fun and I like la quinta </v>

2403
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:53.910
<v Speaker 1>is another one of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you not be inspired seeing a guy</v>

2404
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:55.703
<v Speaker 1>like life is traveling along and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden you have this one shot at </v>

2405
01:55:58.951 --> 01:56:00.450
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not ready.</v>

2406
01:56:00.451 --> 01:56:01.284
<v Speaker 1>You're don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't prepared in the ways you </v>

2407
01:56:02.491 --> 01:56:03.920
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm going to go for.</v>

2408
01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:08.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a life lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also like I.</v>

2409
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:12.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a forgiving nature to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine that is kind of admirable.</v>

2410
01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:13.253
<v Speaker 1>Like alice created problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al has had conflict with that company </v>

2411
01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:18.840
<v Speaker 1>and then they were still like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2412
01:56:18.841 --> 01:56:19.674
<v Speaker 1>Let's do this.</v>

2413
01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Did it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did it because they wouldn't,</v>

2414
01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.160
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't use paul felder the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking athletic commission.</v>

2415
01:56:28.161 --> 01:56:29.570
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

2416
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:30.703
<v Speaker 2>I mean all their wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decided that paul felder isn't </v>

2417
01:56:36.111 --> 01:56:37.360
<v Speaker 2>ranked high enough like who</v>

2418
01:56:37.610 --> 01:56:38.443
<v Speaker 1>you don't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't even know where rankings come </v>

2419
01:56:39.681 --> 01:56:40.514
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bunch of people like hanging </v>

2420
01:56:41.871 --> 01:56:43.950
<v Speaker 1>out who kind of watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting a bunch of,</v>

2421
01:56:43.951 --> 01:56:46.200
<v Speaker 1>making an arbitrary choice and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>combining it like,</v>

2422
01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:47.560
<v Speaker 1>do you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2423
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:50.610
<v Speaker 1>what a first class noticer is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard this term?</v>

2424
01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:55.700
<v Speaker 1>So a first class noticer in business or </v>
<v Speaker 1>any number of things.</v>

2425
01:56:55.701 --> 01:56:56.534
<v Speaker 1>as somebody who over times you start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the different systems and how they </v>

2426
01:57:00.981 --> 01:57:02.660
<v Speaker 1>interact with each other and you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2427
01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:06.950
<v Speaker 1>you clearly are a first class noticer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see big picture,</v>

2428
01:57:06.951 --> 01:57:09.800
<v Speaker 1>small picture combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the outside right now you're like,</v>

2429
01:57:09.801 --> 01:57:10.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2430
01:57:10.410 --> 01:57:13.250
<v Speaker 1>the commission did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but paul felter did that.</v>

2431
01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:14.233
<v Speaker 1>Rankings are this way and you're able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull all these things together and look </v>

2432
01:57:16.851 --> 01:57:17.684
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2433
01:57:17.690 --> 01:57:21.710
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at any of these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that perspectiVe of how the systems</v>

2434
01:57:21.711 --> 01:57:24.080
<v Speaker 1>all work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing barely makes sense.</v>

2435
01:57:24.110 --> 01:57:24.943
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul felder is brilliant if it needs a </v>

2436
01:57:28.570 --> 01:57:30.890
<v Speaker 1>dangerous one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>55,</v>

2437
01:57:30.891 --> 01:57:35.180
<v Speaker 1>including khabib and committed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentally strong and a striver</v>

2438
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:36.143
<v Speaker 2>world class striker and his striking his</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking deadly and he's not just a </v>

2439
01:57:39.691 --> 01:57:44.040
<v Speaker 2>striker in terms of punching like al.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a really nasty kicker.</v>

2440
01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:45.090
<v Speaker 2>I now can kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2441
01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.650
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But paul was a bit more achieved in,</v>

2442
01:57:48.651 --> 01:57:49.540
<v Speaker 2>in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2443
01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:52.740
<v Speaker 2>he's got more weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more complex,</v>

2444
01:57:52.741 --> 01:57:57.741
<v Speaker 2>spinning back fists and elbows and knees</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nasty leg kicks and you know,</v>

2445
01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:01.350
<v Speaker 2>went three hard rounds with barboza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went toe to toe with them.</v>

2446
01:58:01.351 --> 01:58:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's that good.</v>

2447
01:58:02.251 --> 01:58:02.960
<v Speaker 2>He's that good on it</v>

2448
01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:03.793
<v Speaker 1>and smart he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great analyst for such a young </v>

2449
01:58:06.621 --> 01:58:07.730
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you look,</v>

2450
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:09.350
<v Speaker 1>so you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is that possible?</v>

2451
01:58:09.740 --> 01:58:10.573
<v Speaker 1>Because that's really hard and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different skill set than just being a </v>

2452
01:58:12.621 --> 01:58:13.454
<v Speaker 1>good fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This language and being able to </v>

2453
01:58:14.811 --> 01:58:16.940
<v Speaker 1>rationalize things and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different things.</v>

2454
01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.060
<v Speaker 1>But you look back and he did it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>small leaks,</v>

2455
01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:24.030
<v Speaker 1>which he didn't need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pursued because it was of interest to</v>

2456
01:58:24.031 --> 01:58:24.864
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pursued it to get good at it because </v>

2457
01:58:26.571 --> 01:58:29.570
<v Speaker 1>he loved it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means he's predisposed to thinking</v>

2458
01:58:29.571 --> 01:58:31.610
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you also have a thinker,</v>

2459
01:58:32.090 --> 01:58:35.810
<v Speaker 1>a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly dangerous striker,</v>

2460
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:40.190
<v Speaker 1>a guy who can play complex games in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you in your infinite wisdom,</v>

2461
01:58:40.191 --> 01:58:41.024
<v Speaker 1>don't think he can fight habib because </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody somewhere said that he put a </v>

2462
01:58:44.531 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 1>seven next to his name instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>three</v>

2463
01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:51.490
<v Speaker 2>real real problems with the athletic </v>
<v Speaker 2>commission and we won't go into depth.</v>

2464
01:58:51.710 --> 01:58:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to cause any problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2465
01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:55.640
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had some real issues.</v>

2466
01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:56.630
<v Speaker 2>they're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're new.</v>

2467
01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of nonsense that was going</v>

2468
01:58:58.251 --> 01:58:59.084
<v Speaker 2>on behind the scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that what was interesting </v>

2469
01:59:02.811 --> 01:59:06.620
<v Speaker 2>about that fight was we got to see al </v>
<v Speaker 2>step up.</v>

2470
01:59:06.650 --> 01:59:10.780
<v Speaker 2>We got to see khabib have some issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>with striking and you know,</v>

2471
01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:13.010
<v Speaker 2>we got to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2472
01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:16.610
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I don't like about it is this whole</v>

2473
01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:19.390
<v Speaker 2>the whole championship thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I don't like about this,</v>

2474
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:21.620
<v Speaker 2>he didn't beat the champion to become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

2475
01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:24.260
<v Speaker 2>They just sort of like set this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight up our.</v>

2476
01:59:24.261 --> 01:59:27.350
<v Speaker 2>And preparing for that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was preparing for a three round fight</v>

2477
01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:29.750
<v Speaker 2>and then tony gets stripped all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2478
01:59:30.570 --> 01:59:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

2479
01:59:31.150 --> 01:59:32.960
<v Speaker 1>because they don't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2480
01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:36.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't really make any sense because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we go back to the.</v>

2481
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:37.143
<v Speaker 1>if we have some kind of value root of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're about other than the </v>

2482
01:59:40.541 --> 01:59:44.820
<v Speaker 1>necessity to to sell things based on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same marketing that we used,</v>

2483
01:59:45.130 --> 01:59:47.050
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have to be in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

2484
01:59:47.051 --> 01:59:49.810
<v Speaker 1>but we find ourselves there and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on,</v>

2485
01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:52.810
<v Speaker 1>when you're on the bottom of half guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to work your way on a half</v>

2486
01:59:52.811 --> 01:59:54.550
<v Speaker 1>guard and that's what that machine has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

2487
01:59:54.551 --> 01:59:58.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's what habib has to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's got an artificial standup.</v>

2488
01:59:58.780 --> 01:59:59.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2489
02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:01.693
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2490
02:00:02.370 --> 02:00:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Got stood up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2491
02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

2492
02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:08.020
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy until man,</v>

2493
02:00:08.160 --> 02:00:10.020
<v Speaker 2>that's a big fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's this saturday.</v>

2494
02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:11.810
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's chaos stuff.</v>

2495
02:00:11.811 --> 02:00:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Fight is very interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am very,</v>

2496
02:00:14.371 --> 02:00:16.050
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interested in that fight.</v>

2497
02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2498
02:00:17.160 --> 02:00:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what happens when till </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

2499
02:00:18.901 --> 02:00:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was stunned by how easily till</v>

2500
02:00:22.711 --> 02:00:27.120
<v Speaker 2>ran through cowboy and cowboy in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>fairness is not,</v>

2501
02:00:27.330 --> 02:00:29.280
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real one 70.</v>

2502
02:00:29.610 --> 02:00:33.450
<v Speaker 2>He's a tweener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think cowboy would be a one 65,</v>

2503
02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:34.553
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think maybe his struggles to make </v>

2504
02:00:36.151 --> 02:00:36.984
<v Speaker 2>1:55</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you should be 10 pounds heavier </v>

2505
02:00:38.341 --> 02:00:41.460
<v Speaker 2>and I think that 10 pound weight class </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is real.</v>

2506
02:00:41.461 --> 02:00:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where it should be every </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 pounds.</v>

2507
02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Darren till is a fucking huge guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So steve,</v>

2508
02:00:48.690 --> 02:00:52.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're both very tall and strong,</v>

2509
02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:55.750
<v Speaker 2>but till you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gregory's well over 100.</v>

2510
02:00:56.160 --> 02:01:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Well over 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's walking around like um,</v>

2511
02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:02.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking two.</v>

2512
02:01:02.281 --> 02:01:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five and shit.</v>

2513
02:01:03.181 --> 02:01:05.670
<v Speaker 2>And cutting down to one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good one man.</v>

2514
02:01:05.670 --> 02:01:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2515
02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2516
02:01:07.230 --> 02:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>there's so many little odd ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>variables and unknowns,</v>

2517
02:01:10.921 --> 02:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we literally when we go and we look</v>

2518
02:01:14.461 --> 02:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>at these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you've studied and analyzed and</v>

2519
02:01:18.541 --> 02:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>commutative fighting for 20 years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

2520
02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>the more you realize how little we </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually know,</v>

2521
02:01:23.071 --> 02:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>like we have about two or seven or 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the actual information.</v>

2522
02:01:27.570 --> 02:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're trying to work with it and the</v>

2523
02:01:29.611 --> 02:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

2524
02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>when cody fought tgr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dominic,</v>

2525
02:01:35.370 --> 02:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't see how he can win.</v>

2526
02:01:37.710 --> 02:01:40.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how cody can win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then somebody say,</v>

2527
02:01:40.391 --> 02:01:41.151
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why'd he say that?</v>

2528
02:01:41.151 --> 02:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out all these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2529
02:01:42.141 --> 02:01:42.974
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get to dominic and we've </v>

2530
02:01:44.901 --> 02:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>never seen evidence of him doing well </v>
<v Speaker 1>after those minutes.</v>

2531
02:01:47.451 --> 02:01:52.451
<v Speaker 1>The evidence isn't there to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course 100 percent wrong but there.</v>

2532
02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:55.610
<v Speaker 1>But you have to go by what evidence you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

2533
02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:56.473
<v Speaker 1>what have we seen or what information </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we gathered that can allow us to </v>

2534
02:01:59.391 --> 02:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>make this decision to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cody garbrandt did not have.</v>

2535
02:02:03.381 --> 02:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>There was no evidence he can be dominant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then boom,</v>

2536
02:02:06.130 --> 02:02:08.240
<v Speaker 1>he beats up dominic and you're blown </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2537
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's an exciting feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

2538
02:02:11.001 --> 02:02:11.834
<v Speaker 1>I think what's at play here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any evidence that that darren </v>

2539
02:02:14.811 --> 02:02:15.644
<v Speaker 1>till can do what rory macdonald couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and jorge mass fidel couldn't do and </v>

2540
02:02:19.221 --> 02:02:23.740
<v Speaker 1>get to a guy who has that movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that blitz thinking that karate's a,</v>

2541
02:02:23.890 --> 02:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>those karate instincts we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2542
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>We've seen no real evidence of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean he can't do it.</v>

2543
02:02:30.230 --> 02:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean he can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the evidence isn't there.</v>

2544
02:02:32.871 --> 02:02:33.704
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was stunned by his ability to close </v>

2545
02:02:35.871 --> 02:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>the distance on cowboy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nasty left elbow that he learned it</v>

2546
02:02:39.291 --> 02:02:40.124
<v Speaker 1>over the top.</v>

2547
02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:42.050
<v Speaker 1>The way he put them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2548
02:02:42.051 --> 02:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that's pretty good evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking monster.</v>

2549
02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:45.853
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And his fights previous in the ufc as </v>

2550
02:02:47.571 --> 02:02:48.404
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they didn't have a lot of </v>

2551
02:02:49.161 --> 02:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>fanfare behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stunning results.</v>

2552
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>And then you talked to people that know </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

2553
02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:55.293
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to people that know his striking </v>

2554
02:02:56.451 --> 02:02:57.284
<v Speaker 1>aquaman and people that have seen him in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gym and understand what he's been </v>

2555
02:02:59.871 --> 02:03:01.400
<v Speaker 1>through in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's a young guy.</v>

2556
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I thInk he's only 25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old darren till?</v>

2557
02:03:05.090 --> 02:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he's 25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Celso,</v>

2558
02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:09.950
<v Speaker 1>never lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never so fuckIng pissed man.</v>

2559
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you see the pictures.</v>

2560
02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:12.014
<v Speaker 1>Even that 25 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wild man and but what I'm saying </v>

2561
02:03:14.931 --> 02:03:15.764
<v Speaker 1>is I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not be the slightest bit </v>

2562
02:03:18.051 --> 02:03:21.740
<v Speaker 1>surprised if he could do it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen enough over time to know that</v>

2563
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.750
<v Speaker 1>what a 23 year old is capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll see the whole game differently.</v>

2564
02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:31.670
<v Speaker 1>They'll see their understanding of where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are in relation to the other guy is</v>

2565
02:03:31.671 --> 02:03:32.504
<v Speaker 1>so different that it just on one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden all of these 25 year </v>

2566
02:03:36.171 --> 02:03:37.004
<v Speaker 1>olds are just so fucking good and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really have the language to </v>

2567
02:03:39.261 --> 02:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>explain why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2568
02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:42.830
<v Speaker 1>can we just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2569
02:03:42.831 --> 02:03:45.020
<v Speaker 1>he was able to close the distance on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Thompson.</v>

2570
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:46.183
<v Speaker 1>IF he does will say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the question will be how when </v>

2571
02:03:49.131 --> 02:03:52.760
<v Speaker 1>nobody else could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how and why could he do it?</v>

2572
02:03:52.761 --> 02:03:56.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's always what obsesses me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see him do it,</v>

2573
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:57.643
<v Speaker 1>there is now the explanation isn't he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was better at closing the distance or </v>

2574
02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:03.740
<v Speaker 1>his range management was excellent dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true for a bit.</v>

2575
02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:06.140
<v Speaker 1>But then my next question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next morning will be like,</v>

2576
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:07.820
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did he do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2577
02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:08.733
<v Speaker 1>What changed now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the entirety of the game </v>

2578
02:04:12.171 --> 02:04:13.004
<v Speaker 1>itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The systems of the relationships have </v>

2579
02:04:14.361 --> 02:04:15.194
<v Speaker 1>two fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What changed in such a way because of </v>

2580
02:04:16.971 --> 02:04:20.840
<v Speaker 1>his behavior and that's where it gets to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me really,</v>

2581
02:04:20.841 --> 02:04:21.674
<v Speaker 1>really wild because right now nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to Stephen Thompson and I mean </v>

2582
02:04:24.411 --> 02:04:25.244
<v Speaker 1>nobody really at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyrone is knocked down twice about them </v>

2583
02:04:28.271 --> 02:04:30.410
<v Speaker 1>really badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just 50 minutes,</v>

2584
02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fight.</v>

2585
02:04:32.810 --> 02:04:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Those are the moments in the fight where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they engaged.</v>

2586
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:36.650
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with those two tyron woodley</v>

2587
02:04:36.651 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>fights is what they fought</v>

2588
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:40.560
<v Speaker 2>wonderboy the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you got to fIght them.</v>

2589
02:04:40.561 --> 02:04:41.394
<v Speaker 2>You don't engage and when you do engage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to be absolutely convinced </v>

2590
02:04:43.321 --> 02:04:44.154
<v Speaker 2>you're going to land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And tyron did and did land and hurt </v>

2591
02:04:46.291 --> 02:04:48.120
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you looked at those two fights.</v>

2592
02:04:48.150 --> 02:04:48.983
<v Speaker 2>Tyron is the one who's the wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also the one that hurt </v>

2593
02:04:51.181 --> 02:04:52.014
<v Speaker 2>wonderboy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy never heard tyron and those </v>

2594
02:04:53.011 --> 02:04:53.844
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

2595
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.863
<v Speaker 2>Tyron had him very close to being out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just wonder if wonderboy is </v>

2596
02:05:00.271 --> 02:05:01.920
<v Speaker 2>starting to slip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2597
02:05:01.921 --> 02:05:02.754
<v Speaker 2>you've got to wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta wonder if all his years of </v>

2598
02:05:04.861 --> 02:05:07.110
<v Speaker 2>combat sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of his years of kickboxing.</v>

2599
02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:08.133
<v Speaker 2>I mean you to remember this guy is one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the most spectacular kickboxing </v>

2600
02:05:09.901 --> 02:05:11.130
<v Speaker 2>records ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2601
02:05:11.131 --> 02:05:13.520
<v Speaker 2>what is it like $57 or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

2602
02:05:13.770 --> 02:05:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he gets into mma and you know,</v>

2603
02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:21.000
<v Speaker 2>he loses to matt brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets kind of beat up on the ground,</v>

2604
02:05:21.810 --> 02:05:22.643
<v Speaker 2>comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has some really good fights and you </v>

2605
02:05:24.751 --> 02:05:25.584
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been in there with world class </v>

2606
02:05:26.221 --> 02:05:28.230
<v Speaker 2>fighters and beaten some world class </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>

2607
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:30.990
<v Speaker 2>But he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say he's 34,</v>

2608
02:05:30.991 --> 02:05:31.824
<v Speaker 2>35</v>

2609
02:05:32.410 --> 02:05:33.243
<v Speaker 1>and that was a lot of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we didn't get until recently </v>

2610
02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>until those three examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ever really get hit all that much.</v>

2611
02:05:39.041 --> 02:05:41.080
<v Speaker 1>But it's still the where Stephen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thompson</v>

2612
02:05:41.170 --> 02:05:44.380
<v Speaker 2>find out how wonderful is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might even be thirtY five.</v>

2613
02:05:44.410 --> 02:05:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2614
02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:48.340
<v Speaker 1>The hips and the knees and the shoulders</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that whole 5:35.</v>

2615
02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also that what he.</v>

2616
02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean he developed mastery in what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

2617
02:05:56.890 --> 02:05:57.723
<v Speaker 1>And once you've developed that elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elite top level of reached your highest </v>

2618
02:06:01.781 --> 02:06:03.880
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to keep going.</v>

2619
02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And then the masses start to close that </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance though the,</v>

2620
02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:10.570
<v Speaker 1>the general young kid start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2621
02:06:10.571 --> 02:06:12.610
<v Speaker 1>a kid at tristar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of the young guys,</v>

2622
02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:13.593
<v Speaker 1>they have that and they've had thompson </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there for years and for us has been </v>

2623
02:06:16.331 --> 02:06:20.220
<v Speaker 1>able to study people like that up close </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they all studied leonardo.</v>

2624
02:06:20.410 --> 02:06:21.243
<v Speaker 1>Now the young guy can do a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things at a much higher level than </v>

2625
02:06:25.180 --> 02:06:28.810
<v Speaker 1>fighters that came before them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your level of mastery starts,</v>

2626
02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:31.540
<v Speaker 1>you plateau to a point that it's hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go beyond.</v>

2627
02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:32.473
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard work and sometimes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires you to get a little shittier </v>

2628
02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:36.213
<v Speaker 1>for a bit too to go past that plateau to</v>
<v Speaker 1>weaken or get worse by having to </v>

2629
02:06:41.201 --> 02:06:45.370
<v Speaker 1>reexamine what you believe and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you train or the way that you fight</v>

2630
02:06:45.550 --> 02:06:46.630
<v Speaker 1>to break through a plateau.</v>

2631
02:06:46.630 --> 02:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kind of be willing to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards a bit.</v>

2632
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:51.580
<v Speaker 1>And when you're fighting tyron woodley's</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

2633
02:06:51.581 --> 02:06:52.414
<v Speaker 1>you cannot go backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of kind of stalls you </v>

2634
02:06:54.761 --> 02:06:55.594
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2635
02:06:55.780 --> 02:07:00.670
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately the big question also is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there some other strategy that hasn't</v>

2636
02:07:00.671 --> 02:07:01.504
<v Speaker 1>yet been done that is a Stephen Thompson</v>
<v Speaker 1>beater and that loW leg kick you talked </v>

2637
02:07:04.481 --> 02:07:09.481
<v Speaker 1>about may so I cannot get to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would I prefer when I'm fighting</v>

2638
02:07:10.631 --> 02:07:11.464
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Thompson body lock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can get to the body lock cover up </v>

2639
02:07:13.061 --> 02:07:15.520
<v Speaker 1>and down to get to a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I got to touch him,</v>

2640
02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:16.713
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stops me from doIng that or I got to </v>

2641
02:07:19.031 --> 02:07:19.864
<v Speaker 1>hit them or kick them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I do that he moves away and </v>

2642
02:07:21.731 --> 02:07:22.564
<v Speaker 1>hits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if I can just get to the edge of </v>

2643
02:07:24.911 --> 02:07:27.070
<v Speaker 1>his sort of bubble of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2644
02:07:27.130 --> 02:07:30.040
<v Speaker 1>of hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hot range where he can hurt you and</v>

2645
02:07:30.041 --> 02:07:31.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe that low leg kick is a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2646
02:07:32.330 --> 02:07:33.163
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that low leg kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting on the outside of it where </v>

2647
02:07:35.171 --> 02:07:38.380
<v Speaker 1>you're still somewhat safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can smash him up a little bit.</v>

2648
02:07:38.381 --> 02:07:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe those with a weapon that hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been used.</v>

2649
02:07:40.450 --> 02:07:41.283
<v Speaker 2>Well it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is also arguably the best striker </v>

2650
02:07:44.591 --> 02:07:48.030
<v Speaker 2>that wonder boys ever faced in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arguably right,</v>

2651
02:07:48.130 --> 02:07:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean moskva dolls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very talented striker as well,</v>

2652
02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:52.083
<v Speaker 2>but wonderboy is a master of that front </v>
<v Speaker 2>leg in that front leg is a real tricky </v>

2653
02:07:56.891 --> 02:07:59.320
<v Speaker 2>one because that karate style that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses,</v>

2654
02:07:59.321 --> 02:08:00.154
<v Speaker 2>he keeps his hands down low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He stands totally sideways on you and </v>

2655
02:08:03.161 --> 02:08:03.994
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get past that front leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>side kick and johnny couldn't get past </v>

2656
02:08:06.281 --> 02:08:08.590
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>hendrix got lit up by that front leg,</v>

2657
02:08:08.591 --> 02:08:11.470
<v Speaker 2>side kick and then front roundhouse kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the face right afterwards.</v>

2658
02:08:11.471 --> 02:08:12.304
<v Speaker 2>It's just there's a lot going on with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that front leg if you're not used to </v>

2659
02:08:14.771 --> 02:08:15.800
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if you.</v>

2660
02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:18.280
<v Speaker 2>If you get too obsessed with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the backlash comes.</v>

2661
02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>till is a way better way better.</v>

2662
02:08:23.321 --> 02:08:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Master of distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He understands distance and straight and</v>

2663
02:08:26.051 --> 02:08:29.290
<v Speaker 2>he knows how to close that distance with</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosive power.</v>

2664
02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:30.453
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting.</v>

2665
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:31.703
<v Speaker 1>Just before he fought cowboy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his successes were fighting at distance </v>

2666
02:08:35.821 --> 02:08:39.300
<v Speaker 1>and smashing guys who came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he does do that.</v>

2667
02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:41.520
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By doing it,</v>

2668
02:08:41.521 --> 02:08:44.250
<v Speaker 1>you understand it on a different level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You connect to it.</v>

2669
02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:48.120
<v Speaker 2>It is tie way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas wonderboy doesn't across way and</v>

2670
02:08:48.150 --> 02:08:48.983
<v Speaker 2>wonderboy is fantastic at moving his </v>
<v Speaker 2>waist back and forth like a snake and </v>

2671
02:08:53.641 --> 02:08:55.190
<v Speaker 2>jumped on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really good at that too.</v>

2672
02:08:55.210 --> 02:08:56.043
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony ferguson's really fucking good at </v>

2673
02:08:57.301 --> 02:08:58.120
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2674
02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2675
02:08:58.530 --> 02:09:03.420
<v Speaker 1>And that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I get to go study sunda and kung</v>

2676
02:09:03.421 --> 02:09:06.630
<v Speaker 1>fu and woo shu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some of my friends are like,</v>

2677
02:09:06.631 --> 02:09:07.464
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2679
02:09:08.671 --> 02:09:09.504
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some brilliant shit </v>

2680
02:09:10.471 --> 02:09:11.304
<v Speaker 1>to learn over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This and some of that long fist stuff </v>

2681
02:09:14.010 --> 02:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>like people will often say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well kung fu is not super relevant.</v>

2682
02:09:16.710 --> 02:09:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Some of that long fist reaching where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>move my body through space to reach you,</v>

2683
02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:22.133
<v Speaker 1>which people would say is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get countered while I check the </v>

2684
02:09:24.361 --> 02:09:25.194
<v Speaker 1>answer is don't get countered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer isn't discard a valuable </v>

2685
02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:30.900
<v Speaker 1>weapons and so you see some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony does that stuff really,</v>

2686
02:09:30.901 --> 02:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really a lot of really cool.</v>

2687
02:09:32.911 --> 02:09:35.940
<v Speaker 1>He does some work with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool man.</v>

2688
02:09:35.941 --> 02:09:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't love roast wing chung too.</v>

2689
02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:40.920
<v Speaker 1>When I'm sitting in your guard wanting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to beat you up,</v>

2690
02:09:41.070 --> 02:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>tell me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't wing chung just were attached.</v>

2691
02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is,</v>

2692
02:09:45.271 --> 02:09:45.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2693
02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:49.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's techniques in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single art that are established.</v>

2694
02:09:50.050 --> 02:09:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Realistic art that are valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2695
02:09:52.461 --> 02:09:54.340
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be something in wing chung</v>

2696
02:09:54.341 --> 02:09:56.520
<v Speaker 2>the people are missing for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

2697
02:09:56.550 --> 02:09:57.383
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

2698
02:09:57.630 --> 02:10:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean art like that.</v>

2699
02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:04.710
<v Speaker 1>People would look at and mike discard </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they would think they're limited</v>

2700
02:10:04.711 --> 02:10:07.860
<v Speaker 1>to only this scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that scenario happens.</v>

2701
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm in your garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to fight.</v>

2702
02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.880
<v Speaker 1>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that scenario.</v>

2703
02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:14.610
<v Speaker 1>So that thing may not be useful to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2704
02:10:14.970 --> 02:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank mir.</v>

2705
02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:19.410
<v Speaker 1>But that thing will be useful in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>context when you're fighting.</v>

2706
02:10:19.690 --> 02:10:20.523
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about jon jones is use of you grab </v>

2707
02:10:22.421 --> 02:10:26.390
<v Speaker 2>his wrist and he comes over the top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the elbow that is hand tramping.</v>

2708
02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2709
02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:30.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or when he leveraged his sherif oh yeah,</v>

2710
02:10:30.681 --> 02:10:33.120
<v Speaker 2>that's limb structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's old school structure.</v>

2711
02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>How and</v>

2712
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:37.040
<v Speaker 3>why that hasn't been rabid hall a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

2713
02:10:37.041 --> 02:10:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Although you do start to see that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment where were,</v>

2714
02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:42.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get to all four,</v>

2715
02:10:42.621 --> 02:10:45.680
<v Speaker 3>I get to four points that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stand up and you just kind of decide,</v>

2716
02:10:45.681 --> 02:10:46.491
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all right.</v>

2717
02:10:46.491 --> 02:10:49.400
<v Speaker 3>We'll get back to the fence in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>process of standing up.</v>

2718
02:10:49.401 --> 02:10:50.234
<v Speaker 3>A loT of guys throw a fight finishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>kick there or just at least take that </v>

2719
02:10:53.631 --> 02:10:57.920
<v Speaker 3>chance to smash your leg with one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if there's free shots that exist in</v>

2720
02:10:57.921 --> 02:11:00.800
<v Speaker 3>these moments and jon jones is a master </v>
<v Speaker 3>of finding them.</v>

2721
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:02.260
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2722
02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:05.660
<v Speaker 3>I hope they figure out what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to do with him soon.</v>

2723
02:11:05.690 --> 02:11:06.523
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where they stand now in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of his suspension or what have </v>

2724
02:11:11.151 --> 02:11:13.700
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's my ultimate goal,</v>

2725
02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:14.593
<v Speaker 3>my hope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dream is that cormier fight for the </v>

2726
02:11:18.651 --> 02:11:23.651
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight title and somewhere around </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they announced when jon jones,</v>

2727
02:11:23.751 --> 02:11:24.584
<v Speaker 3>the suspension is up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they announced John Jones versus brock </v>

2728
02:11:26.841 --> 02:11:27.674
<v Speaker 3>lesnar.</v>

2729
02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

2730
02:11:30.081 --> 02:11:31.130
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2731
02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:32.053
<v Speaker 3>look at their body types and look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they are and whether they come </v>

2732
02:11:34.491 --> 02:11:34.941
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2733
02:11:34.941 --> 02:11:39.110
<v Speaker 3>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know you've sat down with john and</v>

2734
02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:41.360
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what did you like?</v>

2735
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:43.910
<v Speaker 3>What did he feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2736
02:11:43.911 --> 02:11:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What reed did you get from him?</v>

2737
02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:48.193
<v Speaker 3>Did you feel like he was saying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that he thought you wanted to </v>

2738
02:11:50.841 --> 02:11:53.810
<v Speaker 3>hear or did you feel he was being honest</v>
<v Speaker 3>and genuine?</v>

2739
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:54.763
<v Speaker 3>Definitely both being honest and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>also had some things that he planned </v>

2740
02:11:57.711 --> 02:11:59.420
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like john a lot.</v>

2741
02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:00.313
<v Speaker 3>I really love that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he surrounds himself with a </v>

2742
02:12:02.271 --> 02:12:04.460
<v Speaker 3>bunch of knuckleheads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Think he's,</v>

2743
02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:09.080
<v Speaker 3>he's around too many people that are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad influence and I think he's,</v>

2744
02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:09.973
<v Speaker 3>he's a wild man and I think when he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild man around other people that are </v>

2745
02:12:13.731 --> 02:12:15.530
<v Speaker 3>sort of indulging that stuff with them.</v>

2746
02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:18.710
<v Speaker 3>This is the word that I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just from what I know,</v>

2747
02:12:18.711 --> 02:12:19.544
<v Speaker 3>but from the people that know him very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well is that he just around the wrong </v>

2748
02:12:22.551 --> 02:12:23.420
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2749
02:12:23.421 --> 02:12:24.254
<v Speaker 3>he's got bad influences and I mean if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can identify that then you must </v>

2750
02:12:29.181 --> 02:12:29.740
<v Speaker 3>change it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2751
02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:30.573
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not to take any personal </v>

2752
02:12:31.461 --> 02:12:36.461
<v Speaker 3>responsibility away from him either </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm sure he also makes for a bad</v>

2753
02:12:36.591 --> 02:12:37.424
<v Speaker 3>influence to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know the fucking baddest man on the </v>

2754
02:12:39.441 --> 02:12:41.880
<v Speaker 3>planet can live like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll live like this to fuck it.</v>

2755
02:12:42.170 --> 02:12:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Let's do more coke and know let's party </v>
<v Speaker 3>harder.</v>

2756
02:12:44.781 --> 02:12:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's drive fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go drunk.</v>

2757
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:47.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2758
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:49.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the answer is.</v>

2759
02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:51.320
<v Speaker 3>We're a guy like john,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2760
02:12:51.321 --> 02:12:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a,</v>

2761
02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.610
<v Speaker 3>he's got to have that come to jesus </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

2762
02:12:55.611 --> 02:12:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or not.</v>

2763
02:12:57.110 --> 02:12:57.943
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he just keeps doing what he's </v>

2764
02:12:59.541 --> 02:13:00.374
<v Speaker 3>doing and keeps beating everybody's ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people keep forgiving them and </v>

2765
02:13:03.230 --> 02:13:04.670
<v Speaker 3>hopefully it doesn't wind up in jail.</v>

2766
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:07.460
<v Speaker 3>BuT you should for sure get a driver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2767
02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:09.260
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get someone to fucking driving around.</v>

2768
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:10.820
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good band aid,</v>

2769
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:12.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's not going to be the problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>solver.</v>

2770
02:13:12.851 --> 02:13:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is I think,</v>

2771
02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:18.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean we get to live the life that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

2772
02:13:18.770 --> 02:13:20.870
<v Speaker 3>like we get to choose the things that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

2773
02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:23.690
<v Speaker 3>like we have free to a certain extent to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain extent.</v>

2774
02:13:23.691 --> 02:13:24.524
<v Speaker 3>I know free will is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been discussed and it's a fascinating </v>

2775
02:13:27.621 --> 02:13:29.420
<v Speaker 3>concept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to some degree,</v>

2776
02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are offering our own lives,</v>

2777
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:32.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it isn't going the way that you </v>

2778
02:13:34.441 --> 02:13:35.274
<v Speaker 1>want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small tiny changes can push it a </v>

2779
02:13:37.831 --> 02:13:38.600
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

2780
02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:39.433
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a matter of whether or not he's </v>

2781
02:13:40.821 --> 02:13:42.510
<v Speaker 4>willing to make those changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2782
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:45.800
<v Speaker 4>right now I'm sure he just wants to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>his license back,</v>

2783
02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:46.953
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like when I see him like having </v>

2784
02:13:48.981 --> 02:13:52.160
<v Speaker 4>these battles back and forth with chuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>ladell online,</v>

2785
02:13:52.170 --> 02:13:53.003
<v Speaker 4>like bark away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like chuck liddell's and old warrior </v>

2786
02:13:57.321 --> 02:14:01.090
<v Speaker 4>who's clearly taken too many shots like </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2787
02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:06.120
<v Speaker 4>this calling him an old man and saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>all this stuff and it's like just be the</v>

2788
02:14:07.251 --> 02:14:09.190
<v Speaker 4>better man and this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

2789
02:14:09.191 --> 02:14:12.200
<v Speaker 4>you're the top of the heap right now at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the top of your game.</v>

2790
02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:13.393
<v Speaker 4>You don't want some young guy doIng this</v>
<v Speaker 4>to you 15 years from now talking to you </v>

2791
02:14:17.751 --> 02:14:18.990
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is,</v>

2792
02:14:19.100 --> 02:14:20.600
<v Speaker 4>these are the dark days,</v>

2793
02:14:21.170 --> 02:14:22.003
<v Speaker 1>but when we turn the tv on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you watch cnn or fox or </v>

2794
02:14:24.981 --> 02:14:29.981
<v Speaker 1>cnbc or whatever or the nfl or hockey or</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting or whatever.</v>

2795
02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:31.633
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what we see is a bunch of heads</v>
<v Speaker 1>who somebody has said you choose </v>

2796
02:14:34.670 --> 02:14:38.060
<v Speaker 1>different sides or they know that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should do and then they just argue,</v>

2797
02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we watch it.</v>

2798
02:14:39.230 --> 02:14:41.120
<v Speaker 1>We're taught it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see it every single day,</v>

2799
02:14:41.180 --> 02:14:42.013
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

2800
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:43.223
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It drives me crazy and fighting the </v>

2801
02:14:45.281 --> 02:14:46.114
<v Speaker 4>sports guy talk I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That drives me nuts when it comes to </v>

2802
02:14:49.771 --> 02:14:50.604
<v Speaker 4>fighting because they have this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>robotic predetermined pattern of </v>

2803
02:14:55.081 --> 02:14:55.914
<v Speaker 4>behavior that they apply to football and</v>
<v Speaker 4>baseball and and I just feel like </v>

2804
02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:04.440
<v Speaker 4>fighting is more personal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more intimate.</v>

2805
02:15:04.620 --> 02:15:06.780
<v Speaker 4>There's more on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more at stake.</v>

2806
02:15:06.781 --> 02:15:07.614
<v Speaker 4>It means more to me and when I see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>dopey sports guide jock talk applied to </v>

2807
02:15:12.421 --> 02:15:13.740
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes me angry.</v>

2808
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:14.633
<v Speaker 1>It makes me angry too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it for for different reasons as </v>

2809
02:15:17.281 --> 02:15:19.440
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is this,</v>

2810
02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:20.633
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't apply exactly as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other one is the city of and </v>

2811
02:15:23.611 --> 02:15:24.444
<v Speaker 1>apply to football or anything because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ritualistic like it act as if the </v>

2812
02:15:28.081 --> 02:15:31.080
<v Speaker 1>show doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the reason it looks.</v>

2813
02:15:31.110 --> 02:15:34.350
<v Speaker 1>So we were talkIng about how things </v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings change once upon a time.</v>

2814
02:15:34.351 --> 02:15:38.130
<v Speaker 1>That was a professional speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that is a rehearsed over,</v>

2815
02:15:38.131 --> 02:15:38.964
<v Speaker 1>strategized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed artificial speaker and in a </v>

2816
02:15:41.101 --> 02:15:41.934
<v Speaker 1>world where someone watches the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>joe rogan podcast or goes on and sees </v>

2817
02:15:45.390 --> 02:15:49.860
<v Speaker 1>dwayne training guys or watches a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermodel on instagram or sees what the</v>

2818
02:15:49.861 --> 02:15:51.330
<v Speaker 1>rock has cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

2819
02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:52.673
<v Speaker 1>we see real people everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now this becomes ritualistic and </v>

2820
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:57.623
<v Speaker 1>artificial.</v>

2821
02:15:57.710 --> 02:16:00.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a strip club dj to hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come into the top stage.</v>

2822
02:16:00.710 --> 02:16:05.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like that predetermined sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern of behavior.</v>

2823
02:16:05.150 --> 02:16:05.983
<v Speaker 4>The they adopt this pattern and you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that adopt that </v>

2824
02:16:09.711 --> 02:16:13.970
<v Speaker 4>sports guy pattern and there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>shitty writers that do it too.</v>

2825
02:16:15.010 --> 02:16:15.843
<v Speaker 4>They apply that insulting style of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Writing to combat sports and some of </v>

2826
02:16:20.841 --> 02:16:21.674
<v Speaker 4>them have never been inside a cage and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fucking life and apparel even </v>

2827
02:16:23.931 --> 02:16:24.830
<v Speaker 4>trained.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2828
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:25.850
<v Speaker 1>no it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2829
02:16:26.450 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have not been kicked</v>

2830
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:31.690
<v Speaker 3>in the fucking head in front of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother,</v>

2831
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:36.420
<v Speaker 3>you have no right to criticize me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight my fucking god.</v>

2832
02:16:36.450 --> 02:16:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got.</v>

2833
02:16:38.710 --> 02:16:39.543
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want that pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a couple of punches happening and I </v>

2834
02:16:42.251 --> 02:16:43.084
<v Speaker 3>get caught in a guillotine and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking I'm okay and I'm driving my </v>

2835
02:16:45.551 --> 02:16:47.680
<v Speaker 3>shoulder in and then I start to go out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm just.</v>

2836
02:16:47.810 --> 02:16:48.643
<v Speaker 3>And I kind of hit them in the tap and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>look up and my mom is right fucking </v>

2837
02:16:51.761 --> 02:16:53.200
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's right there.</v>

2838
02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:56.770
<v Speaker 3>and my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my family is wonderful,</v>

2839
02:16:56.771 --> 02:16:57.604
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I got the best wife that humans </v>

2840
02:16:59.411 --> 02:17:01.960
<v Speaker 3>have ever had in my parents and her </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>

2841
02:17:01.970 --> 02:17:02.803
<v Speaker 3>I'm surrounded by great people and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that my mother literally was </v>

2842
02:17:06.401 --> 02:17:08.580
<v Speaker 3>looking at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm proud of you.</v>

2843
02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:10.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry,</v>

2844
02:17:10.241 --> 02:17:12.400
<v Speaker 3>this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my memory has her going,</v>

2845
02:17:14.010 --> 02:17:16.480
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's probably just sad.</v>

2846
02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2847
02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:18.810
<v Speaker 3>She's gonna shake shaker here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2848
02:17:19.170 --> 02:17:19.990
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2849
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:23.380
<v Speaker 3>But if you haven't been through that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't experienced failure,</v>

2850
02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:25.480
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't been carried out on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stretcher,</v>

2851
02:17:25.481 --> 02:17:29.080
<v Speaker 3>whereas everybody booze you or felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>victory or been terrifying,</v>

2852
02:17:29.290 --> 02:17:34.290
<v Speaker 3>you cannot logically criticize them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you don't understand the thIng.</v>

2853
02:17:36.570 --> 02:17:39.310
<v Speaker 3>If you haven't done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have some respect for it,</v>

2854
02:17:39.311 --> 02:17:40.144
<v Speaker 3>I'll respect you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just just understand what they're going </v>

2855
02:17:42.101 --> 02:17:42.934
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't think you necessarily have </v>

2856
02:17:43.631 --> 02:17:45.700
<v Speaker 3>to have gone to war to be a war </v>
<v Speaker 3>correspondent,</v>

2857
02:17:46.090 --> 02:17:47.730
<v Speaker 3>to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk about it.</v>

2858
02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:48.573
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have shot someone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to understand what people are </v>

2859
02:17:51.731 --> 02:17:54.670
<v Speaker 3>going through or at least try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehend it,</v>

2860
02:17:54.671 --> 02:17:58.510
<v Speaker 3>but have some respect about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a way to criticize technique and</v>

2861
02:17:58.511 --> 02:17:59.344
<v Speaker 3>movement without being insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is a part of the </v>

2862
02:18:02.141 --> 02:18:02.974
<v Speaker 3>problem with this.</v>

2863
02:18:03.130 --> 02:18:06.220
<v Speaker 3>The sports guy attitude isn't insulting </v>
<v Speaker 3>attitude.</v>

2864
02:18:06.430 --> 02:18:07.263
<v Speaker 3>It's a judgmental one that's judgmental </v>
<v Speaker 3>and mocking and I think they played </v>

2865
02:18:11.590 --> 02:18:12.423
<v Speaker 3>johnny lunchbox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they play to dumb dumbs and I </v>

2866
02:18:15.401 --> 02:18:16.234
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really hurts my feelings when I see </v>

2867
02:18:17.831 --> 02:18:21.730
<v Speaker 3>that sort of strategy applied to </v>
<v Speaker 3>covering mixed martial arts.</v>

2868
02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like I said,</v>

2869
02:18:23.590 --> 02:18:24.423
<v Speaker 3>it acts as if as less and less people </v>
<v Speaker 3>consume this older but valid interface </v>

2870
02:18:32.890 --> 02:18:33.723
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less and less and more and more are </v>

2871
02:18:36.041 --> 02:18:39.640
<v Speaker 3>consuming other things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>different and new and and stuff.</v>

2872
02:18:39.970 --> 02:18:43.000
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre that the old one starts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2873
02:18:43.001 --> 02:18:44.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we still do it this way.</v>

2874
02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:45.293
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it that way because people </v>

2875
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:47.103
<v Speaker 3>now it looks weird and old now it looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>as context has changed because we have </v>

2876
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:52.863
<v Speaker 3>seen thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've seen Michael Chandler eight today </v>

2877
02:18:55.361 --> 02:18:57.940
<v Speaker 3>and how he held his son and this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2878
02:18:57.941 --> 02:18:58.571
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2879
02:18:58.571 --> 02:19:00.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the striker versus grappler like,</v>

2880
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:03.340
<v Speaker 3>and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They haven't evolved.</v>

2881
02:19:03.370 --> 02:19:03.870
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2882
02:19:03.870 --> 02:19:08.170
<v Speaker 3>you have to step in and this applies to </v>
<v Speaker 3>us all.</v>

2883
02:19:08.290 --> 02:19:09.123
<v Speaker 3>You have to step in and look at where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are and what it's meaning is and </v>

2884
02:19:11.771 --> 02:19:12.604
<v Speaker 3>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2885
02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:14.260
<v Speaker 3>technology changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The audience changed.</v>

2886
02:19:14.261 --> 02:19:15.760
<v Speaker 3>The world changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My life changed.</v>

2887
02:19:16.330 --> 02:19:17.980
<v Speaker 3>The economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed the market.</v>

2888
02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:20.290
<v Speaker 3>All of these things have changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still the same.</v>

2889
02:19:20.470 --> 02:19:21.850
<v Speaker 3>I've met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dinosaur.</v>

2890
02:19:21.851 --> 02:19:23.260
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that.</v>

2891
02:19:23.261 --> 02:19:26.410
<v Speaker 3>I must change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason sports,</v>

2892
02:19:26.411 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nfl or</v>

2893
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:32.060
<v Speaker 1>many of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>news doesn't is it starts out that there</v>

2894
02:19:32.061 --> 02:19:34.880
<v Speaker 1>are innovators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in fighting it was dana white and the</v>

2895
02:19:34.881 --> 02:19:39.881
<v Speaker 1>fertittas and you guys and this vital </v>
<v Speaker 1>young innovative creators and then as it</v>

2896
02:19:42.171 --> 02:19:44.540
<v Speaker 1>grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need organized thinkers.</v>

2897
02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:48.950
<v Speaker 1>You need people who can organize and </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure something so that can grow.</v>

2898
02:19:49.430 --> 02:19:50.263
<v Speaker 1>The problem is they get really good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>structuring hierarchies to get really </v>

2899
02:19:52.401 --> 02:19:53.234
<v Speaker 1>good at structuring business in such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that they are then in charge and </v>

2900
02:19:56.541 --> 02:19:58.760
<v Speaker 1>then when it changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need those creatives again,</v>

2901
02:19:59.090 --> 02:19:59.923
<v Speaker 1>but the but these structure guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they've built these formulas </v>

2902
02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:05.540
<v Speaker 1>that they are then bound by where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2903
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:06.463
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we're going starting with the </v>

2904
02:20:07.041 --> 02:20:09.500
<v Speaker 1>opening shot and then we're gonna go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're right here in Brazil,</v>

2905
02:20:09.740 --> 02:20:10.573
<v Speaker 1>shot of christ the redeemer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll go and here we've got an </v>

2906
02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.250
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable matchup with the winner </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a title shot.</v>

2907
02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:17.113
<v Speaker 1>Those are rituals was a bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>formulaic rituals created when they </v>

2908
02:20:20.841 --> 02:20:24.740
<v Speaker 1>mattered and that we're valuable by </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly intelligent people that that,</v>

2909
02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:27.350
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're required to make this work.</v>

2910
02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:29.810
<v Speaker 1>But now you meet different people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a different thought,</v>

2911
02:20:29.811 --> 02:20:32.960
<v Speaker 1>you need crude the creatives back in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually don't want that.</v>

2912
02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:34.763
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I like your point about </v>

2913
02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:37.313
<v Speaker 4>different approaches and I think one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best ways to maybe perhaps have a </v>

2914
02:20:41.251 --> 02:20:45.720
<v Speaker 4>different approach is to have more </v>
<v Speaker 4>intense coverage of training footage.</v>

2915
02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:46.301
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2916
02:20:46.301 --> 02:20:49.680
<v Speaker 4>and I think they're doing that with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>embedded series of those online things.</v>

2917
02:20:49.681 --> 02:20:50.514
<v Speaker 4>I'd like more people to check those out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if more people got an </v>

2918
02:20:53.371 --> 02:20:55.590
<v Speaker 4>understanding of how much is involved in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2919
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:57.890
<v Speaker 4>like when people get injured and pull </v>
<v Speaker 4>out a fight,</v>

2920
02:20:57.891 --> 02:20:58.724
<v Speaker 4>it's like some people will freak out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>complained and write a bunch of stupid </v>

2921
02:21:01.291 --> 02:21:02.970
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know what happened to mirko</v>

2922
02:21:02.971 --> 02:21:06.090
<v Speaker 4>cro cop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't say anything bad about him</v>

2923
02:21:06.091 --> 02:21:07.910
<v Speaker 4>because he's a superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy,</v>

2924
02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:09.870
<v Speaker 4>if that guy pulls out of a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to go,</v>

2925
02:21:09.871 --> 02:21:10.704
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he obviously must be too hurt to fight </v>

2926
02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:14.970
<v Speaker 4>and this is part of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2927
02:21:14.971 --> 02:21:15.804
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've read some ridiculous shit that </v>

2928
02:21:17.221 --> 02:21:18.054
<v Speaker 4>people have said about mirko online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I went to canelo's page the other </v>

2929
02:21:21.121 --> 02:21:22.710
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just ruthlessly fucking insult</v>

2934

<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is just the world we live </v>

02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:52.173
<v Speaker 1>at least in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the least negative because it's the </v>

2939
02:21:54.351 --> 02:21:56.870
<v Speaker 1>newest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the most negatively youtube.</v>

2940
02:21:56.871 --> 02:21:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2941
02:21:57.550 --> 02:21:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Probably because it's the oldest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2942
02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:03.020
<v Speaker 1>It's these elements because as things </v>
<v Speaker 1>get older,</v>

2943
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:05.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of negativity is a random </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

2944
02:22:05.271 --> 02:22:09.020
<v Speaker 1>People leave positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People leave because they go on there on</v>

2945
02:22:09.021 --> 02:22:12.740
<v Speaker 1>the early part of the technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>adoption lifecycle.</v>

2946
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:13.703
<v Speaker 1>Positive people are innovators and early</v>
<v Speaker 1>adopters and they go onto the newer </v>

2947
02:22:16.731 --> 02:22:17.564
<v Speaker 1>thing and then you leave behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are negative and made the </v>

2948
02:22:20.151 --> 02:22:22.460
<v Speaker 1>whole place go septic and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>argued with each other.</v>

2949
02:22:22.810 --> 02:22:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

2950
02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if that's the case I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never figured out</v>

2951
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.903
<v Speaker 2>what is wrong with youtube comments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are so ruthless like whenever </v>

2952
02:22:30.151 --> 02:22:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I have a liberal woman on in particular</v>

2953
02:22:35.340 --> 02:22:38.740
<v Speaker 1>who you have on with an open mind and </v>
<v Speaker 1>are interested in their perspective.</v>

2954
02:22:38.770 --> 02:22:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are my friends like abby </v>
<v Speaker 2>martin when she's on.</v>

2955
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:45.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't even fucking touch those comms </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whitney when whitney cummings is on.</v>

2956
02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:48.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at the comments period </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

2957
02:22:48.081 --> 02:22:51.500
<v Speaker 2>But if I did those would be the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones that I would because they've looked</v>

2958
02:22:51.501 --> 02:22:53.780
<v Speaker 2>at them before and like whitney contract</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me and she's like,</v>

2959
02:22:53.781 --> 02:22:54.040
<v Speaker 2>what</v>

2960
02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:55.560
<v Speaker 1>the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2961
02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:56.633
<v Speaker 1>don't read that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like don't taste the poison that </v>

2962
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:03.990
<v Speaker 1>wherever the positive people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to spend time.</v>

2963
02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:08.940
<v Speaker 1>And I liked to because if 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people watched me do a break down,</v>

2964
02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:13.110
<v Speaker 1>that means a lot to me and if 60 of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>commented,</v>

2965
02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can schedule in the day 45 minutes,</v>

2966
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take the time and think as </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them as I can,</v>

2967
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:20.910
<v Speaker 1>but only where the goodwill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only where the positive ones are,</v>

2968
02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:23.430
<v Speaker 1>not that I want to be reinforced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing,</v>

2969
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:24.623
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to spend the time on </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are going through life so </v>

2970
02:23:27.751 --> 02:23:29.880
<v Speaker 1>negative that I can't get through to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them anyways.</v>

2971
02:23:30.030 --> 02:23:30.863
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who's going through life </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for something and trying to to </v>

2972
02:23:33.570 --> 02:23:36.780
<v Speaker 1>either be inspired or learn something or</v>
<v Speaker 1>by positive.</v>

2973
02:23:36.930 --> 02:23:37.763
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people that you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend time with and it's also like the </v>

2974
02:23:40.621 --> 02:23:43.160
<v Speaker 1>reverse of giving candy to your kid when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bad.</v>

2975
02:23:43.830 --> 02:23:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Don't go give those people candy when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're negative.</v>

2976
02:23:46.140 --> 02:23:49.530
<v Speaker 1>You want them to get away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want their lives to get better,</v>

2977
02:23:49.531 --> 02:23:52.020
<v Speaker 1>which it will if they stop having that </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

2978
02:23:52.410 --> 02:23:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe of</v>

2979
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:58.810
<v Speaker 2>them are just so broken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like their structure is so</v>

2980
02:23:58.811 --> 02:23:59.644
<v Speaker 2>poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The structure of their thinking is so </v>

2981
02:24:01.571 --> 02:24:02.404
<v Speaker 2>poor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all a lot of them are shut ins and </v>

2982
02:24:04.881 --> 02:24:05.714
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people with mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness that are just constantly </v>

2983
02:24:07.691 --> 02:24:09.320
<v Speaker 2>commenting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2984
02:24:09.630 --> 02:24:12.280
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the argument to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>the comments,</v>

2985
02:24:12.310 --> 02:24:13.143
<v Speaker 2>but then people get furious at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had an issue for a while and it was </v>

2986
02:24:16.661 --> 02:24:17.494
<v Speaker 2>an accidental issue and the issue was </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the stream we don't allow the </v>

2987
02:24:20.921 --> 02:24:25.921
<v Speaker 2>live chat because it was always like con</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your mother's a like our shit because</v>

2988
02:24:27.371 --> 02:24:28.630
<v Speaker 2>people were just trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

2989
02:24:28.631 --> 02:24:32.440
<v Speaker 2>If we read that stream while we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the show,</v>

2990
02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:35.980
<v Speaker 2>the show would be inexorably altered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2991
02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:38.630
<v Speaker 2>you would you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be altered by like what?</v>

2992
02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:39.910
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you saying?</v>

2993
02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Don't say that like you would read it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that would be the show.</v>

2994
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:43.833
<v Speaker 2>The show would be these people as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not necessary or valuable </v>

2995
02:24:48.370 --> 02:24:53.110
<v Speaker 2>because of the fact that we had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments killed during the live feed.</v>

2996
02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:55.870
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't chat during the live feed.</v>

2997
02:24:56.110 --> 02:24:58.300
<v Speaker 2>When we would transfer it over to </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>

2998
02:24:59.250 --> 02:25:00.083
<v Speaker 2>the comments would be disabled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people went crazy and I had a tweet </v>

2999
02:25:03.431 --> 02:25:04.121
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

3000
02:25:04.121 --> 02:25:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not disabling the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what this glitches,</v>

3001
02:25:07.571 --> 02:25:08.404
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she decided to disable his comments </v>

3002
02:25:12.911 --> 02:25:17.680
<v Speaker 2>on purpose and do they fucking went </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy and they were attacking him.</v>

3003
02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:21.990
<v Speaker 2>But what are the numbers that give a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit like who?</v>

3004
02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever commented a youtube video?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have</v>

3005
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:25.940
<v Speaker 4>you ever watched a youtube video and </v>
<v Speaker 4>commented on it?</v>

3006
02:25:25.950 --> 02:25:27.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never have either.</v>

3007
02:25:27.940 --> 02:25:30.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anybody worth a fuck that </v>
<v Speaker 4>has that.</v>

3008
02:25:30.221 --> 02:25:31.054
<v Speaker 4>That's part of the problem is like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know there's some really positive </v>

3009
02:25:33.401 --> 02:25:34.234
<v Speaker 4>comments and people who are healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People were just interested in debate </v>

3010
02:25:37.001 --> 02:25:37.834
<v Speaker 4>and discussion about particular topics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you're dealing with all these </v>

3011
02:25:41.261 --> 02:25:43.030
<v Speaker 4>negative people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what are the numbers?</v>

3012
02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:44.013
<v Speaker 4>If you have a million people watching a </v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube video or are we talking about a </v>

3013
02:25:47.081 --> 02:25:49.510
<v Speaker 4>100 people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it even.</v>

3014
02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:52.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might not even be 100.</v>

3015
02:25:52.361 --> 02:25:53.194
<v Speaker 4>You might be dealing with like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>cousins and they're the ones that are </v>

3016
02:25:56.051 --> 02:25:57.940
<v Speaker 4>going to be mad that you disable the </v>
<v Speaker 4>comments,</v>

3017
02:25:57.941 --> 02:26:01.510
<v Speaker 4>but is that really matter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it is keeping the,</v>

3018
02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:02.453
<v Speaker 4>that cesspool open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping that commode open for them to </v>

3019
02:26:05.801 --> 02:26:10.570
<v Speaker 4>dump their fucking verbal diarrhea into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that really feeding the bay?</v>

3020
02:26:10.690 --> 02:26:12.940
<v Speaker 4>Is that giving the kid candy for being </v>
<v Speaker 4>an asshole?</v>

3021
02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:13.450
<v Speaker 4>Is it the same</v>

3022
02:26:13.450 --> 02:26:14.283
<v Speaker 1>that maybe maybe I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw you a stand and talk to 600 people </v>

3023
02:26:20.281 --> 02:26:23.160
<v Speaker 1>who came to a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had an in depth conversation,</v>

3024
02:26:23.161 --> 02:26:27.630
<v Speaker 1>chem trails this and fucking fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that with each of them in the eye.</v>

3025
02:26:27.690 --> 02:26:28.523
<v Speaker 1>You spent for sure four hours when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>took a bunch of friends out for dinner </v>

3026
02:26:31.891 --> 02:26:33.660
<v Speaker 1>and invited me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was really cool by the way.</v>

3027
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brag about it,</v>

3028
02:26:35.041 --> 02:26:36.040
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3029
02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:39.270
<v Speaker 1>and then I saw you walk across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was four hours for sure.</v>

3030
02:26:39.930 --> 02:26:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two to four hours.</v>

3031
02:26:41.551 --> 02:26:42.384
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I see a walk across the casino and </v>

3032
02:26:44.910 --> 02:26:49.350
<v Speaker 1>in that time you do it again for another</v>
<v Speaker 1>half hour as you know joey diaz.</v>

3033
02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3034
02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:53.910
<v Speaker 1>And then we sit down and somebody comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

3035
02:26:53.911 --> 02:26:55.290
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you sit down and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3036
02:26:55.291 --> 02:26:56.910
<v Speaker 1>can I go fuck off man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm meeting.</v>

3037

<v Speaker 1>That's the guy who will tell the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe rogan's an asshole.</v>

3038
02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:01.680
<v Speaker 1>That guy say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

3039
02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:04.470

<v Speaker 1>I'm whenever I can't.</v>

3040
02:27:04.471 --> 02:27:09.471
<v Speaker 1>You can't just stop your meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time someone comes over 200 inter,</v>

3041
02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:13.260
<v Speaker 1>like human deep interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful interactions,</v>

3042
02:27:13.261 --> 02:27:14.760
<v Speaker 1>that one can fuck off.</v>

02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:16.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say fuck off.</v>

3044
02:27:16.211 --> 02:27:21.211
<v Speaker 4>I just think that people have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>distorted idea of space that they should</v>

3045
02:27:21.761 --> 02:27:24.940
<v Speaker 4>just be able to invade your space while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you literally have a mouthful of food.</v>

3046
02:27:24.941 --> 02:27:25.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I mean,</v>

3047
02:27:25.571 --> 02:27:26.650
<v Speaker 4>I've had it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had.</v>

3048
02:27:26.651 --> 02:27:28.180
<v Speaker 4>It happened when I was feeding my </v>
<v Speaker 4>daughter.</v>

3049
02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:30.820
<v Speaker 4>Have her in my lap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll go get a selfie and you definitely</v>

3050
02:27:30.821 --> 02:27:32.740
<v Speaker 4>can't get a selfie right now while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding my daughter.</v>

3051
02:27:32.741 --> 02:27:33.970
<v Speaker 4>Get the fuck outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3052
02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:37.150
<v Speaker 1>That's a misunderstanding of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of space.</v>

3053
02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

3054
02:27:40.971 --> 02:27:42.020
<v Speaker 1>A strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3055
02:27:42.260 --> 02:27:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch my wife was asking me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was in Singapore.</v>

3056
02:27:46.460 --> 02:27:48.770
<v Speaker 1>If I watched the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the royal wedding,</v>

3057
02:27:48.771 --> 02:27:49.604
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>

3058
02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:50.753
<v Speaker 1>fuck to stand out at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the motivation for </v>

3059
02:27:54.711 --> 02:27:55.540
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3060
02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to get it through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those are still humans.</v>

3061
02:27:59.750 --> 02:28:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Like those are still people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't understand that woman shit.</v>

3062
02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:07.850
<v Speaker 1>She thought so this way here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3063
02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:09.193
<v Speaker 1>There are people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And can you imagine if the person who </v>

3064
02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:12.980
<v Speaker 1>asks you why you're feeding your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter?</v>

3065
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did that for maybe the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3066
02:28:14.811 --> 02:28:15.231
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3067
02:28:15.231 --> 02:28:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wants to selfie with me.</v>

3068
02:28:17.241 --> 02:28:19.970
<v Speaker 1>But after that it will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still living your human life.</v>

3069
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:20.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the only one you have just can't </v>

3070
02:28:21.771 --> 02:28:22.280
<v Speaker 1>interrupt</v>

3071
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.040
<v Speaker 2>people while they're sitting at dinner </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their family or with their friends.</v>

3072
02:28:25.041 --> 02:28:28.820
<v Speaker 2>They're sitting there cutting food up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like they don't owe you that.</v>

3073
02:28:28.850 --> 02:28:30.390
<v Speaker 2>Like can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't ask for that.</v>

3074
02:28:30.450 --> 02:28:33.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just not the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not.</v>

3075
02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:35.690
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta know when people can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>

3076
02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:38.000
<v Speaker 2>they just can't just say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just say hi?</v>

3077
02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:39.193
<v Speaker 2>No one can say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to dress up their </v>

3078
02:28:40.491 --> 02:28:42.920
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone needs that fucking selfie.</v>

3079
02:28:42.921 --> 02:28:43.754
<v Speaker 2>It's just like we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a weird space with that stuff </v>

3080
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.400
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole social media shit.</v>

3081
02:28:49.401 --> 02:28:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Because people want something from you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they get up.</v>

3082
02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:55.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not just they're a fan and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to say hi.</v>

3083
02:28:55.520 --> 02:28:57.850
<v Speaker 2>They want something from you to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>them look cooler.</v>

3084
02:28:57.860 --> 02:28:59.010
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like you,</v>

3085
02:28:59.011 --> 02:28:59.844
<v Speaker 2>you can give them some currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're a pokemon and they can </v>

3086
02:29:02.481 --> 02:29:03.400
<v Speaker 2>pick you up and</v>

3087
02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:05.420
<v Speaker 1>get a point for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

3088
02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I told you,</v>

3089
02:29:08.841 --> 02:29:09.674
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit for breezy over doom got flat </v>

3090
02:29:13.171 --> 02:29:14.780
<v Speaker 1>and he was just going to fight in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

3091
02:29:14.781 --> 02:29:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I think against all neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3092
02:29:17.100 --> 02:29:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not happening.</v>

3093
02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:20.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap on that.</v>

3094
02:29:20.280 --> 02:29:21.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's 40 years old.</v>

3095
02:29:21.761 --> 02:29:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to compete in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a young man's game.</v>

3096
02:29:24.890 --> 02:29:27.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can get mad,</v>

3097
02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:31.640
<v Speaker 1>you can get outraged and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable result,</v>

3098
02:29:31.660 --> 02:29:33.980
<v Speaker 1>a reasonable response if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you rationalize,</v>

3099
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.823
<v Speaker 1>if you have empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this guy still wants to do </v>

3100
02:29:36.891 --> 02:29:38.720
<v Speaker 1>this thing that his body won't allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to do.</v>

3101
02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And so he's willing to bend the rules to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt it.</v>

3102
02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:44.260
<v Speaker 1>He failed and now he's going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay the.</v>

3103
02:29:45.020 --> 02:29:45.853
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a month after his knock out last </v>

<v Speaker 1>frame,</v>

3127
02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:36.530
<v Speaker 1>but I was trying to interview and it's </v>

<v Speaker 1>nine or six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight or something.</v>

3129
02:30:38.031 --> 02:30:41.030
<v Speaker 1>But it was the physical frame of him and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

3130
02:30:41.031 --> 02:30:43.870
<v Speaker 1>it was so wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A triple h and a restaurant one time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

3132
02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:46.340
<v Speaker 1>Like giant dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The force that they can generate like in</v>

3135
02:30:51.631 --> 02:30:56.631
<v Speaker 1>god and that ability to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create that type of power and impact.</v>

3136
02:30:56.780 --> 02:30:57.613
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy</v>

3137
02:30:57.650 --> 02:31:01.340
<v Speaker 2>picture of in Ghana standing next to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional basketball player and a god</v>

3138
02:31:01.341 --> 02:31:03.960
<v Speaker 2>who looks like a tiny person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>

3139
02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:07.010
<v Speaker 2>It god who looks like I look what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand next to him.</v>

3140
02:31:07.330 --> 02:31:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Not quite as much contrast but pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous,</v>

3141
02:31:10.041 --> 02:31:11.030
<v Speaker 2>but there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3142
02:31:11.340 --> 02:31:15.760
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

3143
02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:17.140
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more always,</v>

3144
02:31:17.141 --> 02:31:21.060
<v Speaker 1>but I have a chihuahua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a chihuahua and you have your dog.</v>

3145
02:31:21.240 --> 02:31:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Put them beside each other and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3146
02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:24.590
<v Speaker 1>that can't be the same species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3147
02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:25.440
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3148
02:31:25.441 --> 02:31:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Then humans are just like dogs in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

3149
02:31:27.390 --> 02:31:28.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we vary.</v>

3150
02:31:28.111 --> 02:31:30.110
<v Speaker 1>so wildly size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3151
02:31:30.470 --> 02:31:31.860
<v Speaker 1>he listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's wrap this up.</v>

3152
02:31:32.020 --> 02:31:32.853
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people where they can get your </v>

3153
02:31:34.530 --> 02:31:37.170
<v Speaker 1>breakdowns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mma stuff.</v>

3154
02:31:37.380 --> 02:31:39.180
<v Speaker 1>If you're from dublin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland.</v>

3155
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm there doing my one man show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>June 22nd.</v>

3156
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:42.623
<v Speaker 1>How often do you do in this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this will be the fifth I </v>

3157
02:31:44.221 --> 02:31:46.440
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was one practice,</v>

3158
02:31:46.770 --> 02:31:47.603
<v Speaker 1>one sort of friends and family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot from it then winnipeg </v>

3159
02:31:49.691 --> 02:31:50.524
<v Speaker 1>than london,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ontario and I did because I knew </v>

3160
02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:53.693
<v Speaker 1>harmonic and now I've got some good </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends there that would be supportive </v>

3161
02:31:55.891 --> 02:31:56.460
<v Speaker 1>and that was good.</v>

3162
02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Then I sold out a little venue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>toronto and went really,</v>

3163
02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:01.410
<v Speaker 1>really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then now Ireland,</v>
