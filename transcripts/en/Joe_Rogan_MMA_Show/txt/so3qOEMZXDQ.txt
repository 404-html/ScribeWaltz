Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Three, two, one

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       cool thing going on here. Now we'll circle, oh jeff, merry Christmas. What's up Joe? Youtube not been the easiest week in my life or my career is last week, but hanging in there to make this a standalone so that people don't have to go figuring this out on their own. And I'm sure many, many fans are tuning in already. Know that. The gist of the details, let's lay this out from the beginning. John Jones. Initial failed test. Yeah. So that was July of 2017 he tested positive for approximately 20, anywhere from 20 to 60 Pika grams of a longterm metabolite known as the m three metabolite of a substance called to hydro chloral methyl testosterone, Dh cmt, also known as oral to rentable. And this was over a year ago. Um, what was determined to be the source of this stuff, never determined what the source was. So John went through a full arbitration hearing, um, was never able to determine where it came from.

Speaker 2:          00:01:13       Tested all the supplements he was using, you know, went through many, uh, interviews with Usada, had a full on arbitration hearing. Uh, the source was never determined where it came from. Why was his suspension so low or so short? Well, I mean it wasn't that determined. So I mean there's many factors that go into what that suspension was. I would argue in the toe tap totality of the evidence that was presented in that arbitration that it, that it wasn't a short suspension. Um, because really one key thing came out at arbitration. So John went to arbitration before an individual by the name of Richard Mclaren. Richard Mclaren has an arbitration group up in Canada and Mclaren is probably worldwide known as one of the most credible guys in anti-doping. I know you had the ICARUS producer director on the Mclaren report was the report that came from all that.

Speaker 2:          00:02:07       He basically investigated the Russian state being involved in doping and Sochi Games and put out, actually a series of reports on it, detailing it up to 1000 Russian athletes. Um, you know, we're breaking the rules and the Russian laboratory was helping them get around it. So he's a very, very respected guy. He's independent of obviously the UFC. He's independent of Usada. Um, he acts on his own and his determination was his determination. And I'll read you kind of what he said. He said, I find that all evidence available to me leads me to conclude that the violation was not intended, nor could it have enhanced the athletes' performance. So a non-intentional so not unintentional ingestion. I mean, there's no argument that it was in his system that he found the evidence to show non-intentional use. And then he went further saying that based on the numbers of what he saw and the evidence that was not even a performance enhancing benefit afforded to John for having this longterm metabolite in his system.

Speaker 2:          00:03:10       And I think that's significant when you talk about hey, 15 months is that that's, you know, kind of light being that this is the second time through. I would argue that if there was an argument that maybe it's on the higher end and certainly, you know, we'll talk about the California commission. Andy Foster took that position, uh, in John's recent California hearing, he was a little bit critical of Usada. Um, he thought, you know, he's intimately familiar with this evidence both in the previous case and this occurrence that, and he also saw that there was no evidence that an independent arbitrator, you know, made this statement and decision of John Intentionally cheating. Um, so if anything, you know, I'd say that potentially there could be an argument that, that it was, you know, on the higher end versus the lower end because of the fact that it was an unintentional ingestion.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Exactly. Now what is John's excuse? What is, what is, John said how he got this into a system. We'll look and it's detailed in the arbitration hearing at all. John John fully admits that, you know, some of the lifestyle, lifestyle decisions he was making, you know, the partying and things, you know, probably did not lead to making smart decisions and making smart choices in terms of what was being ingested in the body. But certainly his testimony was under oath that I have never intentionally cheated and did not intentionally put this substance in my body. And not only this case, but it as we talk about the subsequent case here, I think you'll see that based on the numbers, you know, coming out of his tests and based on some studies that have been done on some of these substances, it would tend to support that. Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't John tests negative then test positive for extremely low numbers?

Speaker 2:          00:04:52       This is the initial test before we get into the most recent field test she did. So that's negative then test positive very shortly after with a very small trace amounts. Correct. So you have two negative tests on July 7th and July 8th, I believe, of 2017 and then weigh in day, I think it was July 28th he was positive for a very low level of the m three metabolite and, and we might as well start here. So again, going back to ICARUS, remember, remember the doctor, I mean he's the main character in that were chink of, in 2011 he put out a study on oral Terenna Ball. Um, he actually, my understanding is dosed himself and then studied the excretion of his urine and what was coming out of it over the weeks and months after and determined that there were multiple maybe up to 50 metabolites that once this Dh cmt was ingested into the body, the body converted into other substances and these metabolites stayed around.

Speaker 2:          00:05:54       He identified some short term, some medium term metabolites and some longterm metabolites, specifically the m three that John's tested positive for it. So these longterm metabolites would indicate that it was taken long time ago. They would stay around for the longest. Why, why was he testing negative and then testing positive for these extremely, so yeah, the numbers. That's a good question and that's, that's basically the question, that point. But what was not occurring and what has never occurred in any of John's samples is any presence of the short and medium term metabolites. And if you look at a [inaudible] study, he identifies a couple of these medium term metabolites, Roman numeral one and Roman numeral two. And he says these metabolites based on his study will stay in the body at least 22 days. Well, let's look back to the July 7th and eighth you know, positive tests.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       He's negative on July 7th and eighth for everything. For the parent compound, for the short term, medium term term metabolites and the longterm metabolites go 2021 days later. So within that 22 day window, which is study shows the short and medium term metabolites would still be showing up and there's no presence whatsoever of the short or medium term metabolites. Now again, we'll get into this a little bit more, but I think the science, what it's showing is a pulsing effect for this longterm metabolite. Meaning once you ingest, whether intentionally or not unintentionally oral Terenna ball into the body, the body breaks it down, produces short term and medium term, which is you know, visible for a short and medium amount of time. And then this end three which is produced for a long period of time. I think with the issue appears to be, and we'll get into this, the UFC program is not the only program had seen this.

Speaker 2:          00:07:49       There's another professional sports league that has seen it very frequently. You saw it as also seen this on the Olympic side, but we're seeing this strange action with the longterm and three metabolite. And the theory is it may be hiding in the fat tissues surrounding organs and maybe have a pulsing effect where it's released at certain times and other times you can't detect it. And this is not the actual substance itself, but it's a metabolite correct. Which indicates a reaction to this substance in the body, breaking down the parent compound the, the oral Terenna ball and turning it into these other things which are stored in the body. Those metabolites are not performance enhancing drugs that are the result of the breakdown of the parent drug in the body. How much time is it detectable, the actual drug itself? So pretty quick, uh, it's a pretty quick clearance time.

Speaker 2:          00:08:40       I think we're Cenk Golf Studies says, you know, maybe a week. Uh, so it's not around for very long. And that's why he conducted the study ironically enough. And I was going to go watch bicker is here last night and I just, I've had too much going on in the last week to kind of refresh mind. But um, apparently he, he knew this was part of his protocol for Russian athletes. He knew a coach that was still giving the oral Terenna ball to Russian athletes and he had a falling out with the coach. So he goes off on the side and studies, Hey, the parent compound is going to get in and out of the body pretty quick. It's going to be difficult to detect that. Let's try to figure out what stays around and leaves markers in the body for a long time. And so he developed the short and longterm metabolite tests and was able to catch some of this coaches athletes for using the oral terminable.

Speaker 2:          00:09:28       Interesting. So the actual drug itself, it's gone from the system, but the metabolite remains. Now what is the window that the, this metabolite is supposed to be detectable in the body? Cause we're talking now, what are we at like 18 months? So here, here's the show. Here's the problem is that initial ingestion, cause my question is these same longterm metabolites, these existed a year plus ago. It was more than a year. How long ago that that's the thing. So July, 2017 was your initial test. So with all the experts and we'll get through this with all the experts are telling us is there is no evidence of re ingestion and most likely this is still remnants from the July, 2017 tests. However it was to enter into a system. Um, and we'll go through some of these testing numbers that have shown negatives followed by very low level Pika Pika gram quantities.

Speaker 2:          00:10:19       You know, was that the ingestion that happened that he tested positive for in July of 2017 indicated a long term effect. Right? It was a long term term metabolite. Correct. So meaning it had already been an assistant for a year or so. It absolutely could have predated, you know, the theory the first time through was something had to have entered a system between July 7th and July 8th those negatives and this low pika gram reading on July 28th over this last year, there's been a lot of study into this longterm metabolite. As I mentioned, this isn't just a UFC issue. There's another major professional sports league that for the time being wants to keep their, their testing confidential, but they've shared that information with scientists, with Usada, with myself. They saw it on multiple occasions. This pulsing effect over a year where you'd see this positive tests over a year. We're talking two and a half years now.

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       Right. If it's a year, if they, if it's a, if in July he had to ride in the 17th and you were talking a year and a half, right? July, 2000 second half. July 17 but it could have been an assistant a year prior. I don't know. Yeah, it could have been a couple of months a year. I don't know. He had never showed up for that end three metabolite for he had been tested for it. He had been tested multiple times in the program from wrong isn't the same level, isn't it? Approximately the same Pika grams that exists today in 2018 that were there in 2017 generally if you look in and we can go over these numbers, it, it fluctuates, you know, from single digits and never gets into a triple digits to, to mid double digits. So there's some as low as nine peak of grams over that time.

Speaker 2:          00:11:58       Um, there was some at 60 peak of grants, however, a peak grant to someone because it's a preposterously small. It's insane. And you know, the, the analogy that I heard early on was, and I think John uses throw a pinch of salt and Olympic swimming pool and I'm like, okay, well that's Kinda wrap your head around. Now let's go the other side. Let's talk about something really small that we know of and how many times you have to break down that small particle to get to a peak of Graham. So one grain of salt. I mean, we all know what that looks like, right? You put that in front of you and you split that, and I'd mentioned this week, 50 million, it's actually 58 million. If you split that 58 million times a grain of salt, each one has a pika gram. I mean it's incomprehensible the detection level and how small that is.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       It really is. It's crazy. And how many peak of grams that they find in his system. So he's gone from, and I'll, I'll read through it here. So here's, here's since the initial appearance of the n three metabolite, here's what John's tests look like and those peak gram reading. So the first one was collection date was July 28th, 2017 he had a concentration of ADP grams. However, let me caution and I'll read something from an expert. When you get down to these pika gram levels, um, the science is somewhat inexact because it's such a small amount. So the variable, the plus or minus, you know, can be anywhere from 2030 I've seen in, in some instances, 50 or 60. So what this scientist name, his name is Larry Bowers. Um, he was formerly the, the Usada Science director. He's currently retired and independently consults. Before that he ran an Olympic, uh, Olympic Committee, a accredited laboratory at the University of Indiana.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       The guy's got 20 to 25 years of anti-doping experience. Here's what he, he told me about, uh, you know, when you're, when you're analyzing small picogram levels, although the two lab, a respective laboratories report a concentration, I would caution against becoming too fixated on the numbers. First, the numbers are really estimates of concentration and probably should be considered a range of about plus or minus 20 picograms per ml. And he said the December 9th result would be in the range of John's and we'll get to that between 60 and a hundred second while the adjustment of concentration by specific gravity attempts to deal with the variability of urinary excretion rates, it is an exact, it is inexact and adds variability to the estimates. Finally, and most importantly, science has no clear understanding of the variance of urinary excretion of drugs at ultra trace concentration. So basically saying, look, I mean we have a general idea how this works in science but and I think this instance comes to play, be real careful if you're to be the guy with the pseudoscience out there saying, wait a second, John jumped from 20 to 60 from September to December and that means he re ingested it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:01       What he's saying here is slow your roll on that. That that it's such a small incomprehensible level that we don't really know what those variances are going to look like. Now I think if we saw jumps and John from single digit eight or nine peak of Graham to multiple hundred digit Pika grams, there would be a concern and maybe some meat read administration, but the experts I've speaking to when you're talking variability of 10 2030 40 it's not that significant at the peak of gram level. What is the window where this longterm metabolites starts to express itself? Like what you said, there's short term and there's medium term. This is the long term. How long does it take before the law? That's a good question. I, I don't have the answer to that. And maybe in rich hank hubs report here and I would encourage those that are at home, you know, playing playing scientist at their computer a, the journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology.

Speaker 2:          00:15:55       A Raw Chekhov writes a report detection and mass spec spectrometric characterization of novel Longterm Dehydro Chloro method testosterone metabolites in human urine. I'm not sure when that longterm metabolite, how long it takes to to show up. Here's the problem though with this substance. He did a real brief study. My understanding is administered it to himself. That's the only study that exists. Oral Terenna Ball, DH CMT to my understanding is not approved for use for human consumption consumption anywhere, anywhere in any country. So you can't have clinical trials ethically in the medical world because it's just not legal to give this to human beings. So, you know, we're, we're already kind of behind the eight ball here and that, you know, as compared to other substances where you can do clinical trials because they're readily available, would be a per prescription or whatever. This substance is not, the substance was created by the East Germans in the seventies and eighties and was part of their state sponsored doping program where they were doping their athletes.

Speaker 2:          00:17:02       Can you correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe what I've read is that this is particularly effective when people are cutting weight. Yeah. I mean, is that true or is this just more, I don't know about that. I think some may be confusing to rentable with oral Terenna Ball. Two completely different substances, actually. Very important. Yeah, there's, there's very different effects on the body. There's very different windows in terms of detection time ex explain that. Yeah. You gotta be really careful in this world of performance enhancing drugs. There's names that are interchangeable. There's different, you know, chemical names where you change a little bit of that chemical name. It could mean mean a completely different substance. There's instances where the chemical name is different, but the substance is actually the same. So when trying to compare two substances, you know, make sure if you're at home

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       doing that analysis, you're comparing the right ones. Straight Terenna ball is different than oral to rentable. What is the difference? Uh, yeah, I, I can't tell you, I'm not as familiar with Toronto ball other than it's not oral to ball. So, but there is a difference in terms of the detection window. Yeah, there would be, I mean, different substances create and throw out different metabolites. Um, and different substances have different detection windows. So I haven't done my study and research on straight Terenna ball other than knowing it's different than the substance here. So, uh, Gregory reaching cough, that's how you say his last name, right. He was the only guy to do an actual verified study? Correct. Now is this study been, is it been peer reviewed? Yeah, I mean it will, it's, it's published in the Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology. So in order to get something published, it needs to be peer reviewed.

Speaker 3:          00:18:40       So it's, has it been replicated anywhere? Not that I'm aware of, no. So it's just, so we have one study, which is really fascinating. So we know that w first of all, we know this is an effect of steroid. We know it works. Yeah. These Germans I think show that they wouldn't have been using it. Um, it, it's not a difficult, it's not an easy, easy substance to get ahold of. Look when it's not approved for use anywhere in the world, um, it's only available on the black market. Um, so you'd probably have to go to China to get it manufactured or you know, research chemical supply company that's not supposed to be provided to, to humans. Now, I'm certainly not attributing this to you, but there were rumors, this was one discussion. Was that one of the possible ways he could have ingested this.

Speaker 3:          00:19:25       Um, and let's be very kind. John Likes to party. Okay. One of the things about partying is people do cocaine and one of the things about cocaine is sometimes cocaine is cut with creatine. One of the things about creatine is oftentimes you're buying cheap creatine. I spent a little, one of the things that we've had with on it on, it's our, our products are all third party verified, but in the initial goings when we tried different manufacturers, especially for Alpha brain, we found there were other trace elements that were in Alpha brain that weren't supposed to be in there. And it's because of the vats that they mix these things up with. And one of the things that we had heard was that creatine oftentimes is made in the same place where they might be making oral Terenna Ball, they might be making animal, they might be making a bunch of different things and trace amounts of this stuff can get into the create team and they use creatine to cut cocaine with, is this, is this possible or am I just, yeah, it's, it's absolutely a theory. I don't, you know, I, I, I can't sit here and said that happened, but I will have heard similar things. I have heard similar things. I know for a fact, based on my previous career, I worked closely with the DEA. I was with the FDA, I worked cases involving street distribution of recreational drugs, including cocaine. I know for a fact that creatine is one of the most common substances that cocaine is cut with because as a similar look, some more color, some more feel. So getting back to

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       Mclaren's arbitration decision, I mean this is publicly available records, I'm not saying anything new, but Mclaren addresses at least John's lifestyle around this time. And he says the athlete openly admitted to Usada that prior to and for a period of time after the reporting of his second adverse analytical finding on July 28 2017 the athlete used illicit so called street drugs, including cocaine now, okay. For me to sit here and say, hey, that's where it came from. I don't know that. What's the time period? He's talking about the, the athlete admitted, um, that prior to and for a period of time after the reporting of a second adverse analytical finding on July 27, 2017 admitted. So before that test and sometime after. Okay. So does that make sense though? If it, it's cut. If that's what where the, the source of it is, does it make sense that that would show up as a longterm metabolite?

Speaker 2:          00:21:45       Doesn't it need a long time in the body to digest or do we not know enough about the window of time? Yeah. I don't know if we know enough about the window of time. You know my, my theory and looking at it is even if there's a small amount of the oral Terenna ball in that it's going to for a period of time, show that parent compound at a small peak of gram amount and the short and midterm metabolites in the small peak gram amount. We have never seen those in the history of Johns testing. It's only this longterm metabolite. So that may be indication that it occurred. Maybe even prior to what we're talking about here. Is it something that could be accentuated in some way by the weight cutting process? I absolutely think that could be a factor. Um, there are studies not necessarily with this, but another substance clomiphene and look, I want, while I'm cautioning people to be careful about comparing different substances, the commonality between Clomiphene, which there are multiple clinical studies on cause it is approved for use to be distributed to humans and oral Terenna ball is or both chlorinated.

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       So they both contain a chlorine atom on the molecule. And there is a recently published study on clomiphene and its excretion rates. Um, again for those at home that want to look it up. The study was published in the endocrine society publication. It's pure reviewed, the name of it is hpt axis affects and urinary detection following clomiphene administration and males. So what they did is they basically, you know, got a group of males, um, gave them a one month, um, cycle of clomiphene, you know, I think 25 milligrams a day and then have them get off and then continue to look at their year and up to 261 days after. And what you saw and what you see in this study is that pulsing effect. So, you know, I'm looking at some of the studies subjects here. Um, subject one on day one 21 still showed 147 Pika grams of clomiphene day one 28 showed 174 pika grams.

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       Day One 35 shows nothing. He's below the minimum courting, uh, reporting limit. And then day one 49, he's back up to two 36. There are one, two, three, four, five, six out of I think 12 subjects in that study that showed this pulsing effect of this chlorinated substance coming and going again. You know, it's, it's different than oral Terenna Ball, but it has that common factor of being chlorinated in this study. They do talk about, um, a fat tissue called the, let me look this up and make sure I got this right. Adipose tissue, this is fat that surrounds the internal organs. It's one of the last things that the body burns when it's going, you know, starving itself and going to fat. It protects those organs. But yeah, you look at these, you know, extreme weight gains and cuts that the UFC athlete goes through.

Speaker 2:          00:24:55       I don't think you're going to find possibly another human subject anywhere that goes through putting weight on other than maybe that, I don't think Olympic wrestling matches with an MMA fighter, um, goes through, at least in my experience over these three or four years talking to those in the Olympic world. I think we're at the extreme and it's, it's something obviously we've talked about before, we're trying to curtail, but you know, there's, there's clearly never been a study for anybody who dehydrates and readwrite hydrates themselves to the extent that some of our athletes do. You could never find, there would never be anybody with any ethics that would support a study because some of that dehydration exceeds World Health Organization standards. So there's no studies out there, you know, on this stuff. But clearly, you know, looking from afar I, I'd say that it likely has some impact over what's being released by this adipose tissue.

Speaker 2:          00:25:48       We should certainly talk about that in the future, about the, the weight cutting aspect of it. So, but this adipose tissue loss at extreme weight cuts could potentially be the reason why this stuff is excluding itself. It's, it's definitely a theory out there. What about micro dosing? So here's the thing with microdosing microdosing has done with indogenous substances. So only test, well, I mean someone could try it with something else, but the reason you microdose with endogenous substances is there already produced in the body, right? So the theory of, okay, I'm going to microdose oral Terenna Ball, we'll oral Terenna ball still producing these short term and longterm metabolites in theory, whether you're taking a hundred milligrams or one milligram of oral Terenna Ball, those excretion rates of those metabolites are still going to be consistent. They're going to be in a much smaller level or a way to those excretion rates.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       Is there a way to mask that in some way? I'm not aware of any, um, I'm sorry. The only study we have is Gregory, correct? That's it. Correct. But you know, just taking it from a common sense approach, it's certainly, you know, those that know about micro grossing know that you microdose with endogenous substances, things that are already pouring in the body so your body knows what to do with them. Those what to do. And you're fooling, you know, not only are these metabolizing and there's no metabolites of them, but you could also be fooling the biological passport. That's the concern I think and why people microdose. So you saw it as looking not only testing for specific substances, but our testosterone epitestosterone ratio is going up. They're looking at at blood values, how many young red blood cells, how many mature red blood cells.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       So microdosing and those two areas wouldn't set off alarms in the biological passport world. Um, I've never heard personally of microdosing of exotic his substances that are not found in the body. Microdosing and my understanding has done with things that are endogenous body for people that are not familiar with this terminology, we were just talking about microdosing performance enhancing drugs because a micro dosing in today's world is a very common thing with mushrooms and Lsd. And a lot of, I mean I saw a ton of microdosing in the, in the cycling world that was test towels, testosterone, epo, hgh, all those natural occurring in the body and said, I don't produce any really a red flag metabolites if you do them. At very, very small levels. They'll, the parent will clear quickly not produce any metabolites and will not throw off the biological passport analysis. Um, is there a what you mean when Victor Conte came out with a clear and all that stuff with ball co, they were fooling people.

Speaker 2:          00:28:34       Is it, is it, I mean one of the things that we've talked about before is that it's a constant race to try to keep up with more advanced cheaters. It is. And, and you know what's interesting in this, I mean, if I were to talk to you and maybe the first time we did talk a couple of years ago, um, it, it's come a long way from them, but clearly if I would have talked to you 15, 16, 17 years ago when I got my start in the anti-doping world, I would have told you definitively the testing is way behind, you know, what's being used out there. Um, they were testing, able to test to multiple nanogram, um, limits. That's as far down as we can go. Now they can go down to single digit Pika, gram. There's another professional sports league out there that recently had a one pika gram and three metabolite case.

Speaker 2:          00:29:19       I mean do the math coming down from you know, four or five nanograms, which used to be the lower limit now to one Pika Gram ten thousand twenty thousand times. I am almost under the theory that the pendulum has swung maybe a little bit too far in the other direction and that that certainly is part of my job to the UFC. Look, I want catch every intentional cheater that's out there. I want to make sure we have a rock solid program, use all the latest and greatest, you know, um, techniques to do it. But I also want to keep an eye on it to make sure it's being administrated fairly. And when you're getting down to detection of one, you know, single digit Pika Grams, I have a concern that what kind of level of sensitivity we're talking about. Are we going to talk about environmental contamination where you walk through a room and somebody has just opened a container of something and there's, you know, minuscule powders in the air.

Speaker 2:          00:30:15       There are documented cases that some of the regularly prescribed prescription drugs, specifically diuretics are getting in water supplies in some areas. You know, you get a lot of old people on them that flushed their old pills down the toilet. There's documented cases of it getting into the water supply and being detectable at that peak at ground level. So you've gotta be really, really careful about that. And I think, you know, this case exemplifies that you saw it and, and really the world antidoping agency world and community are aware of that. Um, you know, with greater sensitivity and testing in my opinion, because you know, makes greater responsibility to be objective and look fairly at what really we're doing here when we're detecting and that small amount. But this, this task of John's where he's testing for the same level of peak of Graham's today as he was in July of 2017 is it safe to say that this is unprecedented?

Speaker 2:          00:31:18       Repeat that again, that John's test for the same levels of peak of grams of these metabolites in 2018 that he was testing for in 2017 this is unprecedented. No. If the answer's no, it's so maybe I'm precedent and in the UFC program, but what the United States anti-doping agency did over these last five or six months as they reached out to the science community outside the scope of the UFC, they reached out to other professional sports organizations. They reached out to otherwise water laboratories and what they were seeing was multiple instances of this pulsing effect where over time you would see a reading, the next test it would go away and the next time you'd see that reading again, maybe back up to or even above this much time was correct. Yes. So you see that in the, in the clomiphene study here too, I mean almost 260 they stopped the study, what it was still appearing and Pika gram levels in some subjects and they stopped the study at 261 days.

Speaker 2:          00:32:20       And you see those numbers I was reading to you. See this one subject at one 74, he's negative the next time and then he pops up to two in the two hundreds after. So it's actually more than the time before. Again, apples and oranges, different substances. But the commonality here is chlorinated substance. So is the, is it safe to say that this is an emerging science and that we're still learning and understanding this as we go along? Absolutely. It's still very young. Look, the first, you know, the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles were established the first drug testing laboratory by Doctor Catlin. Um, so really, you know, in the scope of science going back to the earliest days, then are talking about, you know, what, 30, 30 years, 30, 35 years. Um, again, when I started off in this 16 or 17 years, the science still wasn't good.

Speaker 2:          00:33:13       They were unable to detect anything. And the peak of gram level, um, again for reference, very interesting. So the, the Wada, the world anti-doping agencies accredits laboratories across the world and they have certain standards that those laboratories must meet or to retain that accreditation and keep that accreditation. So they have a technical document called the minimum required performance levels of their laboratory. So would they tell the laboratories is you must detect these substances down to this amount. If you can't get them down to this amount, then you can't have an accreditation from water. So the class of substances that oral Terenna ball would be in, um, which would be other anabolic agents, the required minimum level that they must attack two is only two nanograms. So look, watch, it even says, as long as you can get to two nanograms, you can retain our accreditation.

Speaker 2:          00:34:13       Well what's happening is an arms race in these laboratories, they're saying, well two's the minimum standard but I can get down further. And you know, these are private entities that you know, are looking for customers. So to be able to reach out and say, well even though a lot of tells us too is as low as we need to go, we can go down to one pika gram. I think in a sense, maybe you need to slow the reigns on that a little bit. That we're getting too far and too sensitive of a level of detection when it comes to implementing a fair program because you can't determine where a one pika gram co came from. You could be breathing again, contaminated air, drinking contaminated water. It gets real dangerous when you get down that low. Now how does this reflect on past suspensions? This is a what when you, you deal with something like, look, let's bring up Frank Mir for example. Didn't frank near also test for oral, turn the ball. Okay, I want to get back to Frank Mir but let's, let's go back to John and this instance and why you saw it. It has come out and said, look, this is not a violation. So if you go to the Wada, the world anti-doping code, there's a section 10.7 0.4 0.1 are UFC program. You know, basically mirrors that and we're bringing that up on the screen there. So for purposes of imposing sanctions under tab 10.7 and anti doping rule violation will only be a second

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       violation if the anti-doping organization can establish the athlete or other person committed. The second anti-doping rule violation after the athlete or other person received notice pursuant to article seven et Cetera. This is what's known as a double jeopardy clause. The sanction test positive for something and if he's test positive for the exact same substance that is still in his system a year later or whatever the amount of time is, you don't include that as a new positive tasks. One more thing has to happen. Science has to determine that there hasn't been a real administration so test positive for the same substance and science says based on all the numbers we see, there is no evidence of any readminister ration and the non evidence of the readministered nation is the lack of short term and medium term singling. Never ever. And John's or an issue though that this is only one test that gregory would shank goes test is the only study that showed at these medium and short term metabolites exist.

Speaker 3:          00:36:39       It's the only study, but I think then if there's only one study, you have to go to anecdotal evidence. Right? Why don't we do studies on UFC employees because we're all Toronto Ball. He'll do it. Oral Terenna ball is illegal to distribute what's due to Mexico and any country throughout the world. It's really eagle. Every contracts go, they just let you do whatever you want to do. I don't know, maybe we can look into that, but shelby may be out for that. And that's the reason for living there. Um, I, I have a problem with that in that we're relying on one study. This seems to me to be like a, a critical thing that could affect, I mean we're, we're, we're, we're hoping and we're, uh, we're putting faith in this study that this is the only way that these metabolites express themselves. Is it possible that, what, that these be like, you see what the pulsing effect that you see positive effects and negative or positive results and negative results that these short term and medium term metabolites don't always express themselves and that what we're considering a longterm metabolite could in fact just be a metabolite.

Speaker 3:          00:37:49       Yeah. I, I mean, I guess it's possible, but what are you, are you going to sanction and athlete again because you know, potentially it's possible. And then the theory of that universe. You can't do that. Let me read it to you real quick. What, what these experts came out at and terms of readministered ration. So Dr. Daniel Eichner runs the Salt Lake City. It's called a smart sports medicine research testing laboratory, or smurter. They're one of two water accredited laboratories in the United States. The other one being a ucla, um, again, one of the most respected minds in anti-doping phd chemist. Um, his answer in terms of readminister ration, um, was this, and you very rarely see scientists at his level talk in a absolute absolute. So there you go.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       And here he says, there is no evidence that Dh cmt has been readministered that's in writing to us. So very definitive on that, right. Um, you saw it as science director now, Dan Daniels independent even of Usada. So those who criticize, Hey, you saw it as in bed with the UFC. Daniel lackner doesn't work for you. Soda. He runs an independent laboratory. You sought to send samples there. The NFL send samples, they're major league baseball, send samples there. The NCA, he's independent, owns his own laboratory. Um, you saw to also put out, um, a letter to us in, in writing, um, upon careful consideration of the very low concentration of the DH cmt longterm metabolite. And Mr. Jones is sample and taking into account the Human Pharma kinetic characteristics of this particular longterm anabolic steroid metabolites, uh, based on data to which you saw to, has access to and in consult, in consultation with scientific experts, some of whose opinions aren't close, you sought.

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       It has concluded consistent with prior residual amounts detected. And Mr. Jones sample that the presence of Dh cmt longterm metabolite is consistent with residual amounts from exposure prior to to that July 28th, 2017. Um, look, I'm not, I'm not an expert. I don't profess to be, um, my, my background's in finance and accounting. I traced the money back in the old days, but I know who those experts are out there in the world and these are them. Um, they're my putting these things in writing, putting their reputations on the line now and forever going forward. Um, they're never going to do something like that because you know, the UFC pays, you sought it to administer our program or because Jon Jones is, you know, a popular fighter and they want to see him fight this weekend. That's just not the way this world works. Of course in in fact it works the opposite way.

Speaker 2:          00:40:29       There would be a great benefit if they could catch him cheating. Absolutely. And you know, historically experts like this are very, very conservative when it comes to talking in absolutes like this. They don't normally do it. In all fairness. The real question is guys like you and me because we are UFC employees, so we got to handle this fairly yet. That argument, you know, and I saw that left and right that hey, jeff and joe are paid by the UFC. Of course they're going to come out and this way, but look, all these things that I'm reciting today, we do that in regards to cheating, I would either, I've, I side with the UFC on a lot of things because I support the sport. I wanted to excel. I don't side ever with cheating. If I think that there's some way somehow that someone has given an unfair advantage and this is somehow being covered up, I would rather not work for them.

Speaker 2:          00:41:18       Joe, my seven, my last 17 years of my career, my, my, my, you know, everything that I've worked for is to protect the rights of clean athletes and to eradicate cheating from the sport. I can't tell you how strongly I feel about that. Sports given me everything in my life. My Dad was a high school basketball coach. Um, it paid for my college and scholarships. It, you know, at least the good characteristics in me. I can all trace directly to sports and entering into the equation the issues of breaking the rules, the issues of the health and safety aspects when you have young, and I talked to many parents whose kids, you know, use steroids because they saw the professional athletes doing, answering that into the body when your homeowner levels are already out of control is very, very dangerous. Both short and longterm. Can't tell you how passionate I am about this issue.

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       And those out there that are saying that I'm corrupt and my reputation has is out the window. I would never ever in a million years sales people, I mean you obviously you have, but you just, you can't listen to those people because they want to find things wrong. Um, one of the things that I've said about you is you're a guy loves to catch people cheating. You like it, you enjoy it. That's not true, man. You do. I don't mind if someone is cheating and you catch them in the UFC program now with what we've established here. Absolutely. Back in the old days, and we've talked about this, look when you had in baseball or in cycling, no testing going on. Literally the organizations were looking in the other direction. I've often said that, look, I don't agree with what they did, but there's a portion of me and that's why I think a lot of these athletes respected me and share that information.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       But there's a portion of me that said, I don't agree with what you did. I like to think I wouldn't make the same decision, but I damn well understand why you did this. You're fighting for millions of dollars in contracts. You know your teammates are doing it, you know your competitors are doing it and your know your professional sports organization doesn't give a shit because of the weakness of the testing program or total lack thereof. So in instances like that, there was, I never came away saying that guy's an idiot or an asshole for choose. And I came away saying, I kind of get why he did it. If I was 21 or 22 years old and immature, I may have made the same decision. Now come into our program here where you have an organization that cares very much, that spends multimillion dollars a year. This program has done nothing but costs the UFC money.

Speaker 2:          00:43:46       It costs us money and how we implement the program costs us money on canceling fights. Anybody who thinks moving this fight to California is that a financial benefit to the UFC is crazy. We're taking a bath on this one. People really do need to understand that the UFC decided themselves, they self imposed. You sought as sanctioning of fights. Correct. Nobody forced us to do that. So this is a, this was a big step in the right direction of trying to make the sport cleaner because we recognize that first of all, there was some legal stuff with the testosterone replacement therapy that just threw everything out of whack. Right. Where it was essentially it was sanctioned cheating. I mean, let's be honest about what that was. It was, it was clearly a my understanding being manipulated. Yeah. I'm the very easy to manipulate when you get permission to use any prohibited substance like that.

Speaker 2:          00:44:36       And we went from that to unbelievably strict protocols. And now what you're seeing is you're seeing, first of all, we saw a radical change in the physiques of some fighters where we, we did have some suspicions and those suspicions, at least in my eyes had been confirmed. And now we're seeing the good side of this with what in your estimation might have been moved over into a position where okay now now it's getting a little bit ridiculous in terms of like what we can detect and what is, what is causing fights to be canceled. Exactly. So interestingly enough, the world antidoping agency, a lot of their next code revision is 2021 and so they regularly put out, hey, what are the issues going forward that we want to address? And one of the major issues is potentially establishing thresholds for these low level substances that keep appearing.

Speaker 2:          00:45:35       Um, DH cmt being one of them, Austrian being one of them. And so the idea that water is looking at and has a working group of worldwide experts is, hey, if if something that gets reported back and under 50 Pika grams, all the evidence is showing, more likely than not, this is from a very low level contaminant issue. We've never seen an issue of a micro dosing or an intentional use that's reached that level. Why are the labs even reporting at sub at quantities lower than 50 pika grams or 100 peak grounds? I think very soon they're going to come out with a recommendation. We are going to adopt that before 2021 once that working group and we're in communication with them, comes up with those recommendations. You'll see it it implement it first in the UFC program, again, I've always said fairness. Due process in a program is just as important as the strength and comprehension, comprehensiveness of that program.

Speaker 2:          00:46:32       You'll lose faith in your athletes. You could have the strongest loophole free program in the world, but you start implement tink things unfairly. You'll lose faith just as much as if you had a bunch of loopholes in the program. It's got to be fair. Are you aware of the female skier that tested positive because of lip balm? I think, yeah, it's vaguely recall about that. What was someone else use the lip balm before her? No, no, no, no. It was a, uh, a lip balm for sunburn. It was for sunburnt lips and it had some ridiculously small trace amount. Was it Austin Green cv? Give her name? Is Jo Jo Burg?

Speaker 2:          00:47:14       Trying to remember her name? Well, there was the, the cocaine kissing defense was actually one an arbitration. So something similar, somebody tested positive for, you know, low level metabolites, a cocaine and basically said, look, you know, hey, whether that was good or not, but um, you know, the arbitrator bought it and the science shows, hey that, that is a possibility. The detection levels are so low. If you kiss somebody who had just done cocaine, they're now able to detect at those levels in the, the person that kiss that person. That makes sense. Do you find this woman doping label on the label, which is why they gave her a penalty apparently. Oh, I see. Okay. What is the, um, who fucks reading labels on lip off, you know what I mean? See, that's, that's how crazy it's gotten. I mean, all our athletes know when, when they're using a creatine or a protein or whatever, I think most of them are pretty careful right now.

Speaker 2:          00:48:06       But to tell them, hey, you need to read your lip balm and your deodorant. I mean, where, what level are we get into here? And these are the levels of detection. So she 21, nine year old starved Norway's powerhouse squad of a skiing cross country skiing tested positive for an hour anabolic agent listed in the contents of a treatment for sunburn. Um, this could be similar in some ways to what Chad Mendez tested positive for, for something for psoriasis. Correct. Sat chatman is, has obvious psoriasis. You'd see it on his body. He's talked about it pretty openly and to use some sort of a cream and accepted his penalty wasn't a word of this cream had something, some type of a steroid into it. Yeah. I had seen him publicly state that now he chose not to present a defense or go to arbitration. So I haven't seen anything in detail to you.

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       He just rode knowledgeable on that. Yeah, he did. What? So let's get back to the Frank Mir case. Frank near tested positive was it also also same thing, longterm metabolite of world Terenna Ball. Here's the difference. Frank Mir as the same as John Jones. His first time through was sanctioned. John didn't get off the first time that showed up in his system. He got, you know, he was looking at potential for years, went to arbitration, presented evidence and act as some other clauses in the policy that reduced his sanction. What does that mean? Uh, well, one of them was uh, um, substantial assistance where he assisted Usada and some way, shape or form and he got a reduction for, for doing that. Assisted in what way? So I don't know. And this is the exact reason why I do this. So I insulate myself from that interaction between you sought it and the athlete, they are the soldier to adjudicate or in this they do not.

Speaker 2:          00:49:54       You know, get me on the phone and say, hey, we're thinking about going this way. They adjudicate completely in a vacuum and you are, you're just so people know. Your title is safety, health and safety. Athlete health and performance. Vice President of athlete health and performance. Yeah. So you no longer work for you saw it. It never worked for Usada. That's, that's a big misconception a lot of our fighters think that I've never worked for, you saw it. I was a federal agent for 22 and a half years. Um, the latter part of my career got involved with all these ped distribution cases. 2015 Lorenzo Fertitta and Dana white through a mutual friend contacted me and said, hey, would you come out and kind of talk to us? We're contemplating maybe putting our own program together. We've had some recent high profile positive. So I came out to vegas a talk with them and a week later I get a phone call asking if I want to come work for him and kind of implement this new program.

Speaker 2:          00:50:47       But I've never been an employee of Usada. Okay. So that's, that's good to know because that's been stated by some public figures that you used to work for Usada and now you work for the UFC. Never that on a shale. That's one of my favorite words. Um, so you never worked for you soda, you, uh, brought Usada to the UFC or communicated with Usada and facilitated this agreement. Correct. So I never worked for Usada. I did work very closely with Usada. So you saw that when I first started these series of investigations back in 2002, look, I knew all about how to work a heroin distribution organization and cocaine distribution organization, methamphetamine. But when it came to performance enhancing drugs, there was no class that myself or really any other federal agent or law enforcement agent goes through surrounding distribution of performance enhancing drugs. So I was examining the discarded garbage of Balco every week when they put it out to the curb, began seeing notes, rappers, all these substances.

Speaker 2:          00:51:49       I had no idea what these things were. I didn't know the difference between testosterone epitestosterone, arithroid tin, hgh. I knew nothing. So what I did is I figured out who those experts were, who were the people that could very quickly get me up to speed on what I was looking at. Um, doctor Catlin who ran the UCL Olympic loud was one of the first and he started, um, you know, kind of walking me through this. He put me in touch with Usada and you know, they began educating me as well. So, um, over the course of those investigations, um, I got a lot from them in terms of educating on the substances. They were bringing some of their cooperating witnesses to me and then we go off and running on criminal investigations. Um, but never, never worked for them. So you sought a, correct me if I'm wrong, but the way they would work would be very compartmentalized.

Speaker 2:          00:52:40       Like they would not specifically communicate with you on all of the details of this. Correct. And they don't now, I mean, you don't, independence aspect. I don't as these deliberations are going on what they're looking at, I don't know. It's cooperation. Just for me to be Frank Wood in my eyes would mean that something was done purposely illegally and this person had some knowledge of purpose, purposeful, illegal activity, and that they would somehow communicate this to facilitate some sort of catching of someone involved in a criminal act or an act of cheating. Yeah, that, that would make sense to me too. Yeah. That would be what we were talking about. Usada would allow John a shorter suspension if he actively participated in helping them catch people that were cheating that that's the understanding. I don't know, implied that would be implied. I don't know to what level that was done.

Speaker 2:          00:53:34       I don't know if it was that or if it was, hey, here's how this drug works in more general. Here's the, I don't know what it was. I purposely, that would mean that John would have to know about cheating. If you're saying like this, this is how this jug drug works. This is how I used it. I mean, this would, he would, that would mean his initial defense would have to be thrown out the window because it wasn't an accident. Well, I mean, I don't know about that. If you knew something separate from, you know, that he wasn't someone else. Yeah. And again, I don't, I don't want anybody to reach that conclusion. I have no idea what his substantial assistance entailed. None. Um, and it's a slippery slope. It is a slippery slope and look, transparency's important in any program, but you know, only to a certain level, look, if you are transparent about what everyone's, you know, cooperation or substantial assistant was and the whole world knew about it, you're never going to get anybody after that coming in and, and, and, and cooperating.

Speaker 2:          00:54:30       I saw this definitely on the criminal side with informants, you don't, that's not something that's, that you want to be transparent about or disclose. Right. But there's going to be a bunch of people that have a real issue with that. And the idea that Jon Jones, you know, one of the greatest fighters of all time is actually working as an informant. I mean it's, it's listed in the, in the, you know, in the Mclaren's ruling that that was one of the reasons for the mitigating factor and the reduction. But I don't, again, I know nothing about to leave that alone and about it. It's been stated, we know what it is. Okay. Or we know that it's a thing. Um, when it comes to the John's initial test where he was sanctioned and was suspended for a determined period of time, Frank Mir also was sanctioned for a determined period of time as well.

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       He was two years. He was, John was shorter than that. John was sean cooperate on a bunch of other deal. [inaudible] not only cooperative, he went to arbitration and put on a defense. He put on a defense that, look, the evidence here shows no intentional ingestion of it. And in fact the Clara and gave him a further reduction based on, there was no evidence of this was intentionally done. Frank Mir didn't put on any, he had every right to go to arbitration put on his own offense. Didn't do that. What about Josh Barnett? Uh, Josh Barnett, you know, a completely different set of facts. His came from a contaminated supplement. It was a different substance. He went to an arbitration hearing, the arbitrator ruled with Josh and said, Yep, you know, based on where we are now based on the care and effort that you took your right, you deserve to have time served at the time of that arbitration.

Speaker 2:          00:56:13       So again, I think that's a good example of the checks and balances in place here. You've gotten me overseeing the program, taking a look at how these things come out. You've got the ability from the athlete to go to Mclaren's group and judge, you know, the set of facts. And in that case, Mclaren's group said you saw Usada I think maybe overreached a little bit here and I believe Josh and Josh is, you know, basically time served. So you know, you want to see, you want to see them get it perfect, right every time. But you know, and the reality in the real world is that doesn't necessarily happen and that's why you have these checks and balances available. Um, Josh Barnett take on. The matter is that they tried to paint him as guilty even though he was not and that he, he feels like he definitely got a bad deal and that he was labeled as someone who is taking this substance.

Speaker 2:          00:57:03       He was suspended for a long period of time when he was going through this and although he was found not guilty that he feels like not enough emphasis was put into establishing that he was not guilty and that you know, he, he feels like they chased him down over something that he didn't do. Yeah, I mean we'll, well here's what he did do is he used a supplement that if he would have listened to anything that we educate on that you sought a sends out regular reminders are fighters are required on a quarterly basis to go through videos and their whereabouts, filing that deals with these issues. If he would have followed any of that advice when it came to his supplement choices, he would have never chosen the supplement he used. I, you know, when, when I heard about that supplement and what was on the label and how it was marketed, I said, okay, well that's, that's likely the candidate of where it came from.

Speaker 2:          00:57:52       Yeah. So I mean, the analysis would be, hey, you know, that pool will be careful. There's sharks swimming in that pool. It can eat you. And the person jumps in the water anyway saying, look, I didn't want to get eaten by a shark, but a shark comes up and aid them. It's like, Hey, we told you that this was the case. She didn't follow that. Now there also needs to be a differentiation between someone who's intentional, cheating, intentionally cheating, and someone that's just, you know, makes a naive supplement choice. There. There needs to be a differentiation between that. And there was, and that case Josh didn't get, you know, the full penalty of what was, what that substance, you know, would have rendered, but he did have to go through a long period of time where he was unable to fight. He did. But you know, again, he had the prohibited substance in his body.

Speaker 2:          00:58:38       Um, as you saw it, it has to look at, Hey, even though you did that, didn't do that on purpose, did that give you a performance enhancing benefit? Did it allow you to recover a little bit better? Did it make you a little bit stronger? And you know, that's why those strict liability provisions are in there. Otherwise people would just take these prohibited supplements and say, Oh, I didn't know exactly it was an accident. Meanwhile, they're getting a benefit for exactly. So they have to have some sort of penalty in place. I think so, yeah. I also think, again, there needs to be a differentiation between the intentional non-intentional and we do have that in our policy. There are definitely mitigating factors available in our policy that if you didn't do thing on purpose, you're not, you know, you're not sanctioned as tim means is a great example there.

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       So Tim means use a relatively benign supplement. It was a creatine, creatine, you know, generally doesn't have an issue as, as, as opposed like testosterone booster supplements. We tell our athletes stay away from anything marketing as a testosterone booster. It's one of the most common with contaminants are purposely spiking purposeful. Spikings two means uses a Korea 10. It had a asta and in a very small amount, uh, we founded in there, you know, Austrian has to your sanction. He got six months, um, you know, so back relatively quickly. So I think that's the thing with Yoel Romero. So correct. Yoel Romero used a natural diuretic product that had um, a SAR minute. Um, and all of these cases, not only does the prohibited substance need to show up and with the athlete has says they've used ready but to protect against making sure the athlete isn't purposely spiking it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:19       You saw it, we'll go out on their own, on the market, independently procure, hopefully the same lot of product. And in the case of eol and Tim, they were able to do that, test it completely independently of the athlete, determine what level the prohibited substances in that based on the interview with the athlete of how much did you use, when's the last time you used it relative to this test? Do the science calculations just to make sure an athlete's not saying, well I know this Korea tennis spiked with fostering, so I'm going to go use Austrian. And then I have a built in excuse when I test positive for Australian in order to be able to match contaminant levels with what's being excreted in the urine, you would literally have to have phd chemistry degree and I'm not aware of of any our athletes have in that, it'd be very, very difficult to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:05       And so these detection levels, again we're talking about nanograms, we're not talking about large quantities. That would be a pika grams. Correct. Now what, why was, why was this moved from Vegas to California and why? Why did the California State Athletic Commission, why did they accept this fight taking place here and why did Vegas say no to it? So internally, the UFC wise, we first, in fact Donna Mark Illini who you know who works with me, uh, we're out to Donna. Exactly. We're a two person shop and the woman's a hawks and one of the hardest workers I know. So she's, she's awesome. She's taken a look at something that we have access to called the clearing house. And it's basically a recording of all the tests on our athletes. So we can get on there. Somebody says, Hey, how many times was John Tested last quarter? We can get on there and pull that up.

Speaker 2:          01:02:02       The public also has access to our testing records, not with a specificity that the clearinghouse has, but the public can get on. And you saw it on a weekly basis. Um, updates how many tests and athletes done. So there's some of these, some guys out there on the Internet from the day one of the program have kept track of what week they're numbers tick up. So you can go find spreadsheets on the Internet, at least from a, from a weekly basis of when our athletes were tested and how many times every week. God bless those dorks. Crazy. Huh? So the clearing house program is very specific. We can get on there and see the actual date of the collection. And next to that we see negative, positive or pending. So Donna came to me late November, early December saying, Hey, I'm looking at John's tests and I'm seeing pending still back from I think was maybe August, September, thinks something's going on here.

Speaker 2:          01:02:56       And of course I'm like, okay, well he's fighting pretty soon. I hope not, but let me reach out to you Sada. So I reached out to them. They said, we're working on something. We're, you know, conducting a study. We're talking to other professional sports leagues. We're talking to the laboratories out there and don't have an answer for you now that, but stand by. So I think it was September, December six, they sent a letter to us and they sent a letter to the Nevada state athletic commission saying, just so you're aware, over the last six months, um, early in this six months, we've seen a reemergence of this longterm metabolite, uh, in John's samples, we've always was this. So this was early December, December 6th, we and the Nevada Athletic Commission were notified. You were notified, but the test was from previous. So the tests, these tests, um, covered from August through November.

Speaker 2:          01:03:53       Okay. So there's [inaudible] test several of them. Oh, some more than one test show this metabolite. So what they said was August 9th, negative August 29th, eight picograms September 18th, eight eight September 18th. So I mean there's a, there's a good, so he's negative on the ninth 20 days later. So inside the 22 checkups, 22 day window, he shows an eight peak gram, no short term metabolites, no longterm, no parent, no medium term, no medium. I'm sorry. No media. Only longterm. Thank you. Um, we then go to the 18th of September, 19 Pika grams and then that's followed by four negative tests. September 21st, October 2nd, October 11th and November 14th. So at this point, late November, early December, you saw it and says, okay, we've done our studying those two low levels in August, our residual, there's no evidence of any readminister ration based on lack of short and medium term and parent. Um, based on our consultation with other leagues with these labs that are seeing this, we're calling this, this is would be double jeopardy if we did them again.

Speaker 2:          01:05:07       Okay, this is awesome. This is something that should be really emphasized because there's a lot of people that don't understand this. This is not just this one test. These are many tasks that have been done over course of John's suspension and then ultimately relicensing that are showing this exact same metabolite at a very similar level that according to previous tests, specifically on Clomiphene, that this could be this pulsing correct result of existing and not existing. But this is not indicative in any way that can be provable of microdosing. Correct. And not only that, but this is over. We're talking about this being over long term, long periods of time. Many months. Okay. And consistent numbers over many months. So, and again, going back to what one expert Dr. Bauer said, you've gotta be careful what you're talking about. He's single and double wall number, grams. And you see some bearings.

Speaker 2:          01:06:03       You gotta be careful about saying, well it went from nine to 18 that means re administration. No, it's inexact science at that level. The water labs, this is a non threshold substance. So all water requires them to say, to report back to water, positive or negative. They're not required to quantify. However, these water labs have also realized there's an issue when you're getting under Pika grams. So what they're doing is going back after reporting the positive, hey, let's see if we can estimate with this level is it's an inexact science at Pika gram quantities in my understanding, um, to, you know, estimate what those levels are. Okay. You can see some variations. So Nevada is unwilling to sanction the fight based on all this information. So they get, they get the initial notice that we got. Also, I think it was December six saying, look, there was an issue in, in August, these longterm metabolites reappeared again.

Speaker 2:          01:07:00       But we've since had four negative tests. We don't believe that the August, you know, reappearance is a re administration. There's no sanction here. Nevada, you don't even have jurisdiction over the August tests. Again, keep in mind, these are UFC tests. Nevada doesn't mandate it, but Nevada says, look closer to a fight. We do take jurisdiction. We will adopt these Usada tests. So you saw it. It didn't need to, to, to notify. They thought out of an abundance of caution, let's let Nevada know that this issue exists. God Damn saw what the fuck they said, hey wait, that's, that's all good. And you saw it, good, bad. It gets this. I talk with them. They're like, Whoa, this is, this is concerning. But we don't see anything within our jurisdiction here. So I certainly hope that no subsequent tests show up positive because that could be an issue.

Speaker 2:          01:07:46       And sure enough, you sought it collects a sample from John on 12, nine. They expedited the results cause they knew a fight was coming up and they do that now when fights or close or the collections are done close to a fight, and here, you know, he pulses back up to, uh, you know, between 60 and 80 pika grams. So Nevada gets this, uh, this was last week, man, the days of run together for me. So, uh, a week ago, Friday we have in, uh, Bob Bennett who's the executive director. While I'm a big fan of these great guys out in Nevada, but I remember FBI agent, so we got it done around. He is. He's one of the reasons why it probably wasn't sanctioned in Nevada was because they're so by the book I get angry because I wanted to fight to be in Nevada. But I understand Bob's position.

Speaker 2:          01:08:34       Yep. Implicitly. So. So let me make clear what happened. Bob came in, Anthony Martin Marinell, the chairman of the commission came in and a couple representatives from the Nevada attorney general's office. So they are the ones that prosecute cases involving ped, you said violates Nevada regs. So we share all this with them and lists like you did with me. Correct. Share it all with them. And look, there's some misconception out there. They did not say this fight. Absolutely not happening next week. In fact, they, I think we're understanding these issues, but said, look, you know, optically this doesn't look great and we feel that out of an abundance of caution that we need to have a public hearing and be very transparent about this cause this is, this is some weird shit. Um, this was last Friday. So we're eight days out from the fight. So, you know, we start talking about, hey, when can we potentially have this?

Speaker 2:          01:09:30       And unfortunately, Christmas holiday, several of the commissioners weren't even in town. And basically what they said is, look, we will absolutely do this if you want us to, but likely that hearing would not be until today, Thursday or maybe tomorrow, Friday. And you know, Marinello is like, look, I, I, I'm starting to get my head around this, but I can't guarantee you that my other commissioners or me are going to come out the same way. So you're taking, you know, you're taking a chance here that, that we could say, well, we need more information. So, so basically they were willing to listen to it. Um, I think they were starting to wrap their heads around it, but didn't feel that they were up to speed enough on it. They didn't have the luxury that Andy Foster and California have. Remember when John tested positive in July, 2018 that fight was in California because that fight was in California, California retained jurisdiction.

Speaker 2:          01:10:30       They've had two very public hearings on John when they suspended his license. And most recently, a week and a half ago when they reinstated his license. So Andy and the commission, we're very familiar with the world termina ball. They were very familiar with the longterm metabolite. And in fact Andy was somewhat critical of Usada during the last hearing. He thought after looking at all the details after reading, you know, Mclaren's a position that there was no evidence that this was done on purpose. He thought, man, maybe they went a little bit hard on him. And he stated that in that, in that second hearing. So with the reemergence of the Pika gram quantity of this m three longterm metabolite Andy in the commission, unlike Nevada, didn't need to get up to speed on it. They've already had two public hearings on John's issue. They were intimately familiar with, you know, some of these dynamics of this drug and the metabolites and, and that's why he felt comfortable based on their familiarization with it.

Speaker 2:          01:11:31       And based on these written absolute statements by these experts. So there was no ray ingestion one. And then the second thing which we haven't covered is these experts said, based on these low level Pika grams, there's no performance enhancing benefit. And that's an important point because if you would have told you fc look, this is still remnants from a year and a half ago, but we can't rule out that he's not getting a performance enhancing benefit from it. Well in that instance, I'll tell you, and you know I, I stand by this, I w I would leave this company if somebody told me otherwise, if there was any indication that there would be a benefit from him, even though it technically wasn't a violation, I'm not going to stand by while anybody licenses that guy to fight. Could it been, could this have been somehow or another mitigated by communicating these results to Nevada earlier?

Speaker 2:          01:12:27       Well, we didn't announce the fight. The John was going to fight and in Nevada and tell October, but in October, so you have said, hey look, here's this issue. Sure. Potentially buy. But the issue was you saw to hadn't come to that. They were in the middle of that point of consulting with other professional sports leagues with the other water labs. They hadn't reached their conclusion. Their science expert hadn't determined, Hey, this is definitely residual, no performance dancing. They were still going through that data at that point. So what they've told me is, look, we, we tried to hurry that along as fast as possible. We wanted to make sure that, that, you know, we went through this and very, very detailed and no stone left unturned. When, when did they reach this conclusion does, so this was early December, so December six that letter went out saying we've had these two low level positives back in August.

Speaker 2:          01:13:18       Okay. But here we are. I mean, this is the end of December. What could this have been headed off at the pass? Well, again, when Nevada first got notified, they thought like, we were hoping, well, he's had four negative tests, so he's probably going to be negative going forward here. Right? I mean, that's what, you know, the lay person would think, okay, he's probably out of the woods now. But you know, again, getting back to what period of time is this and John's preparation and if you look at some of these numbers and when these metabolites appear and disappear in early August, John was preparing his defense for this arbitration. I think he had an idea based on talking to his attorneys like, Hey, we've got a pretty good shot here of some mitigating factors where this is potentially going to get reduced. So I think, you know, he starts to get a little bit motivated, gets in the gym, start training again clearly in early December.

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       That's a period of time when our fighters that close to a fight are bringing down that body weight right there, cutting body fat, they're losing, you know, a little bit of water. So it certainly seems to correlate these, these, these pulsing, you know, affects with when is just theoretical, right? That it's released from adipose tissue. Absolutely. It is. So, uh, this positive result was announced when, so a week ago yesterday as you saw it as announced, you saw, it notifies us the UFC. That always happens and they notify if any commission has jurisdiction. At this point, this close to a fight. Nevada has jurisdiction. So I get the call and you can imagine what's going through my head. I mean I, I've gotten so many of these calls now. I literally for the first five or 10 minutes, can bury my head in my hand and think through exactly how this thing's going to play out and you know, it's going to be, hey, Nevada is going to say, wait a second.

Speaker 2:          01:15:12       What's going on here? We need to root this out. John's going to say, Jesus Christ, like, what is going on in my life? I can't get a fucking break. I'm trying to be careful. I even went through with DC. DC's going to react and he reacts. He's going to be, I fucking told you this was the case. This guy's a cheater. You know, you saw it as bullshit. Novitsky is bullshit. All this stuff goes through my head and the first five or 10 minutes, what's, how's Dana gonna React? How's hundred are going to react when I have to go over to his office and explain this out to them? It played out exactly as I saw it. It's, it's, it's some of the worst days of my career when I get these calls. Um, but you know, every bone was notified in Nevada was in our office two days later.

Speaker 2:          01:15:54       And again, I mean there's been some criticism of them out there. Um, I don't fault them. This is a complicated issue that optically doesn't look great and to do anything in a rush manner would be difficult. They did everything they could to afford us. Having a hearing problem was, it was just, it was too close to, to a fight essentially to get this out, this issue with optics, right? Cause if you go on twitter, everybody's calling him a cheat. Everybody's saying that you know, anybody that sanctions this is you're sanctioning cheating for someone to get an understanding of what this is like. It actually requires probably more than we've done now over the last hour and 15 minutes. Yeah. And I appreciate this forum. I mean, Dana and I went on sports center and announced it in three minute hit and I came out of there going, absolutely everyone in the world is going to say this is bullshit.

Speaker 2:          01:16:45       You can't, this is what, we're going to have a hard time doing this in two hours here, Mrs Things. Yeah, you've got, you've got to delve into it and you've also have to put your trust and reliance on these experts. They have a education professional career of 20 to 25 years to come up with these absolutes. There's no one else in the world, but maybe a dozen people that can come up with these conclusions. You do have to put your, you know, your faith and in their background and their careers and their knowledge and education and you know, a red which those absolutes were, that there was no evidence of any read ingestion. This is by multiple, um, experts and that John would not have retained any performance benefit based on these low level Pika gram amounts. Well, I'm happy that we were going to have this out there.

Speaker 2:          01:17:33       So people, if they have the time, if they're really that interested in it, this is probably a more in depth discussion of this, then you're going to get anywhere else. But I really wish we could have gotten something like this to Nevada and Nevada could have gone over this and looked at what, what I'm saying, what you're saying. It seems to me that we could have just had some sort of a meeting and kept this fight in Nevada and it would have saved everybody a lot of heartache. Yeah, I mean I think things were pointing in that, but there was no guarantees on that nice baby. It's still come on. It's Vegas. You know, the other thing that was being looked at was, was fairness to these athletes. Really you're going to put, you're going to put John and gus, maybe more importantly in a position where he doesn't know until two days or a day before whether this fight is happening or not.

Speaker 2:          01:18:19       I mean these and not even mentioning the other fighters on the card. And Look, you can talk to, and I have to Sean and Mick and Dana and hunter. All these fighters want to be on the big paper views. They know the bigger the fight at the top of the card, the more eyes are on that fight. And when you have a spectacular fight in the first second fight on the card, if it's on a big paper view with a giant fight at the top of it that can propel your career, your next fight, you could be fighting the main event on fight pass and progressed from there. So I think, you know, I think it's accurate to say that generally everybody wants these, these cards to be as big as possible. And when all the experts are telling us 100% this isn't a sanction b, he's not retaining any performance enhancing benefits.

Speaker 2:          01:19:06       I think, and clearly Dane and hunter thought this, we have an obligation to do what we can do for fairness for John. Definitely for gus for the rest of the card to try to make this fight happen going forward. Is there any way we could ever prevent something like this from happening again with the similar situation in place like Nevada? So here's, I think we have a couple solutions to that and it's not necessarily relative to the commission, but one thing that obviously protected John a lot, and this was the frequency of testing, you know, if you look at his numbers and these were, these were instances where they collected samples, but in many of these cases they did multiple tests on him. And that means, you know, the tests I'm reading were for the anabolic steroid panel. But in addition to that, they may have done a biological passport test on that same collection the May have done in hgh test and epo test.

Speaker 2:          01:19:56       And this is all confidential that you sought. It doesn't release all this information to these numbers on the publicly available website that you don't see what those tests are done. So the reality, and they just told me this is John was one of the most, if not the most tested athlete over these last six months. When you look at total amount of tests on his samples, excuse me, one thing that obviously protecting them here was that volume of testing and so you saw it, it came to us and said, hey, we think that you probably should, you know, up the amount of tests that you're doing. So, um, we just renewed a contract with Usada and were reduce. We're increasing our testing numbers by 30 to 40%. We currently, uh, the first three years of the program went under contract for approximately 2,700 tests and starting this next year we're going to up that to around 43 4,400 tests.

Speaker 2:          01:20:47       So I think there is going to be more of a burden they're going to be, you know, you saw to showing up in more doorsteps early in the morning of more of our athletes. But I think this is a perfect example that that increased volume of testing actually can be a protectant to the athlete, especially when you're talking in these low level Pika gram quantities and contaminated cases and things like that. We just got to get athletes to stop taking any supplement. That's not third party tested great points. So here's what we've done in that area. So about three months ago you sought a hosted a working group and included the UFC. Myself and our worst nutritionist, Clinton Wattenberg who you've met were there majorly baseball was there, the Department of Defense was there. There's been war fighters who have purchased supplements at bases over in Iraq and Afghanistan that contain a federal and another bad products.

Speaker 2:          01:21:38       Some of them potentially have died as a result of ingesting them. So they definitely have an interest in safety and dietary supplements. And you saw it as experts were there. What we did is we invited in the major third party certification companies and each one took a half day presenting what their programs look like. We went back and huddled after each one and huddled at the conclusion and said, what is a platinum standard third party certification look like? Let's all these presentations we got, what was strengths and one's weaknesses and the others and we have to put a perfect one together. What was it? What does it look like over the last month we've been offering, um, a paper that's going to be published in a scientific journal going over with that gold standard platinum standard looks like, um, going forward any third party certification company that can meet that and there's some that are very close.

Speaker 2:          01:22:30       I think we'll be able to do it very quickly. We are going to say, you saw it is going to say this is an approved line of supplements. We approve you to take this and this something that we've been unable to do in the first three and a half years of the program. And I'll tell you joe, it's the most common question I get from our athletes. What's you sought approved? And as soon as I say you saw, doesn't approve any supplements, but here's how you ensure your safety. They stop listening, goes in one ear out the other. This is a silly suggestion, but why doesn't the UFC come up with its own supplement and provide them to the fighters and say, you can't take anything else. Yeah, I mean it's definitely been talking through sponsorships with other supplement line. Exactly. There's a lot of dynamics to it.

Speaker 2:          01:23:16       It's not as easy as doing it overnight and it's distribution method. Just see if he could say, hey, you can take creatine, you could take, you know, all the multivitamins, you could take, you know, a branch chain amino acids and all these things that have been proven to be effective. But that's, that's weird too. Right? It's like they're effective. Meaning they enhance performance and recovery, but they don't do enough to be considered a performance enhancing drug. Yeah. And they're present in the food supply. So like basically out of community, you can go eat 10 chicken breasts or you know, have us a couple scoops of protein if you're on the go and don't have time to do it. So I think, again, apples and oranges in terms of performance enhancing or not. Um, so the theory would be we have an approved when, when I'm or dawn or ask that question, what's approved, I can say, here's, let's say NSF NSF has 1200 supplements that are approved.

Speaker 2:          01:24:07       I'd say all 1200 of these are approved. You should only use these. If something were to happen to an athlete, they'd used and approved line of supplements to get out of jail free card. If they can prove it and you saw it independently prove it, there's no sanction. I think that is going to go a long way and I'll give you a reason for that. Majorly baseball does that. They have for the last couple of years now they have some advantage and that all their athletes are employees and are coming in to the same facility for during the season, so they have some control over there as well. We don't, our athletes are spread amongst, I think 46 countries throughout the world, so it's more of a challenge. But baseball said the only supplements we're allowing in the clubhouse or in a facility are, and they use NSF supplements.

Speaker 2:          01:24:51       They had zero contaminated supplement cases last year. They had, I think they're testing numbers were four times the amount of our testing numbers and zero contaminated supplements. I mean the proof's in the pudding right there, so they have to deal with NSF. I don't know if it's a deal other than they've examined who those certification companies are and they feel that they're, you know, at the top of the line, we don't want to exclude any and that's why we're contributing to this paper to say, look, anyone could be one of these approved lines, but you must meet this criteria for platinum standard program, but it's coming from someone who was in his supplement business. Me, that's the wild west out there. Boy Is, I mean there's a, there's a lot of shit out there that's just, they purposely add performance enhancing drugs to their stuff because it's cheap and people take it and they experience these gains and then they sell a lot of it and then you get a following. Exactly. I saw that when I was with the FDA there is, and what they normally will do for maybe the first six months of the product, they'll spike it with something if they're going that route and then to decrease liability thereafter. They've already got the following. The bad stuff's working like, like hell. And then they back off just in the government and people go, oh, my body must have adapted. Exactly. Choose Sun.

Speaker 2:          01:26:10       This. It's really such a shame because this is such a fantastic fight. I mean, there's so much drama involved already. Just having John Jones returning, having Alexander Gustafson looking absolutely sensational in his last fight with glover to sharer all the trash talk and hype and intensity in the fact that this is really other than DC versus John. This is the fight that people want to see in the light heavyweight division. And look, nobody is saying, and I'm certainly not saying that John didn't do anything wrong, he obviously did. John has two times now tested positive for prohibited substance says. However, in both occasions, arbitrators have determine that it was not done intentionally. So anyone who says it all, John's getting off light on this, he's been suspended for almost two and a half years, for lack with a lack of evidence of any intentional use are cheating. You know how much money he's probably lost in those two and a half years?

Speaker 2:          01:27:09       How many tens of millions of dollars doesn't reputation anybody who says that he got off Scot free on this. I would argue the otherwise he was felled to the strictest of liability standards out there. Some of the top of their game money earning potential like him. This is also an incredible amount of stress and, and absolutely it's on him. He feels and he hears what people are saying about them and that's, that's got to be very difficult also again coming off of this massive suspension. So he's coming off of the suspension, which was huge bay, very public, very worldwide, right after the cocaine, the car accident, the, the previous, the, the Dick Pills that had the, the stuff. And I mean this is so many things. And then to have this happen literally the week of and have the fight moved to California. I mean, and I get the skepticism that's out there again, without delving into this, I've spent hours and hours and these experts have spent their careers looking into that.

Speaker 2:          01:28:04       That's really what's required to get a comprehension and understanding of it. Um, another thing, another argument, John's being treated specially because he's John, but we had another athlete that this somewhat identical thing happened too, but nowhere near at the level of John. So a kid by the name of grant Dawson. So Grant Dawson last summer was in the date and white contender series had an awesome fight. Dana's like you got a contract kid, uh, we get them into the Usada program there. Would you solder quote program requires you to disclose everything you've used going back 12 months or one year. The idea being, look, even though you weren't under the program, if you used, you know, oral Terenna ball eight or nine months ago, there could still be an advantage that you beginning, you know, we're not going to necessarily suspend you because you weren't subject to the program then, but we're not going to let you fight or right away you can have to be in the program for a certain amount of time testing clean.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       So he didn't, he didn't disclose it. He was using anything. His first test, he tests positive for m three metabolite low levels. He goes to arbitration, argues, testifies under oath. I've never heard of this substance. I've never taken it. I would never cheat. Here are all the Suttons I was using. I can't find it. The arbitrator, heres the hearing you saw to goes to them and says, hold on a second, we're looking into this matter. Talking to baseball, whatever you saw it, it comes out that hey, we can't prove that this didn't enter his substance a year before that disclosure required him to disclose what he was using. So he was basically led off and an eligible, so John's not the only person in the UFC that this has happened to, not, not withstanding other professional sports leagues, other Olympics, it's happened to other athletes. He's not the only one.

Speaker 3:          01:29:56       So I think what's important for people, I get the skepticism, but I think it's very important that people don't accuse someone of something that they didn't do. And I want you, if you're listening to this, I want you to imagine if you're John Jones and you trying to get your shit together and you didn't do anything new, he didn't do anything different. We've got to have a path of redemption for people. You got, you have to, and if John, as you're saying, and all these tests conclude, if he didn't do anything, folks, you got to stop saying he's cheating. You get you got, he's not cheating if he's not cheating. And if it's showing that these are these longterm residual metabolites that are an incredibly small dosage, it's, there's a real cheaters out there and John's fucked up. He has fucked up and you were all right to be upset at him when he fucked up.

Speaker 3:          01:30:49       This is not as Lisa's my conclusion after talking to you and, and, and I've, I've talked to some independent scientists that were skeptical about some of the aspects of it, but they're also, they're skeptical because they're not up to date perhaps on the differences in this, this pulsing effect or the fact that this is something that is relatively, there's not a lot of, a lot of documentation on this mean this is, this is something that's relatively new in terms of our ability to understand Pika grams. Our ability to understand this pulsing affect all these different v these variables that you have to take into account when it comes to this. People love to call cheat, they love to and it's good. It's good that the people were out there keeping people honest. But I think you got to, we got to look at this the right way and I think the right way is what you're, the way you're laying it out here. I don't see any holes.

Speaker 2:          01:31:41       So you know, a couple things in the future that people can look forward to. Look, we want, and John was to fight in Nevada again and Nevada has basically said, look, I think we understand this his shoe, but we need to have this hearing. There will be a public hearing on this. My understanding is early quarter one, so look, you know, don't take word for it. Wait until

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       January. I'm sure they'll call some of these experts to testify, introduced some of these documents to the public record longer even than this conversation. Yes. My, that would be my guess. Yeah. Um, so yeah, I mean that's, that's to come, the whole thing is such a disaster for everybody else on the card for Amanda Nunez and Cris Cyborg and for all the people on the undercard. I mean it's just to have them to move all the way to California when I'm happy about though is that the fight is still happening. I'm very happy the fight is still happening. I am, and again, I have to take an objective look about is this fair as it relates to how our policy and what the rules are. And you know, when you have, you know, one of the experts in the world, Dr. Daniel Wagner of this myrtle laboratory issue, an absolute statement like there is no evidence the Dh cmt has been readministered and that based on these low levels, he does not retaining a performance enhancing benefit.

Speaker 3:          01:32:58       How out of fairness and implementing the program do you prevent this fight from happening? You can't do that. It would be categorically unfair. Um, moving forward from here, what changes and what do we do to stop something like this from happening? Well, again, I think the increased volume of testing is going to help. I think being able to specifically direct our athletes to approve line of supplements will help. Um, but you know, hey, we can dawn and I can message the hell out of these things. But you know, it, it, it, it takes the athletes and their camps to listen to what we're saying. So I mean if anything good comes out of this, hopefully it's a warning to those other hours, others out there about hair, how careful you need to be. So to, just to wrap this up so people understand if you, if you want to put a button on this, there's no evidence whatsoever of any microdosing.

Speaker 3:          01:33:51       So this is one of the concerns people were worried about microdosing no evidence whatsoever of microdosing wouldn't be a substance. You were generally microdose you do the endogenous substances, not exotic genus is also no evidence of the short term and medium term. Medium. A medium term. Yup. Metabolites that were recognized by her chank off. Does that any say his name again? I think it is. Why don't I Gregory Gregory. It's not even Gregory [inaudible] that's the only test we have no parent compound ever found as well. These are these the only tests we have that show these longterm short term and medium term metabolites. These, the short term in the medium term ones that would be indicative of him taking it recently don't exist at any point in time during these tests. Correct. So this is most likely something that is inside of his body that is an incredibly small levels. And is it safe to say that the detection levels, that the detection methods are far superior today than they were a year ago, two years ago, three years ago,

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       increase by thousands of percentage points in sensitivity? I mean again, and how recently over the last five years and how recently have they, if they improve from today versus a year ago? Yeah, I believe so. Again, you know, when I heard about the one pika gram detection of the m three metabolite, you know, that was something that happened this year. I'm not aware of that ever being that low of a number in any time in the past. So I think, you know, literally week by week, month by one month as we're going here, that level of sensitivity is increasing and off essentially no possible performance enhancing benefits from these incredibly low levels. That's what the experts are telling me. Look, and again, I'm, I'm not the expert. I don't want to profess that I am, but what, what do I have to go to? I need to go to those experts that have made careers out of studying these substances and the benefits.

Speaker 2:          01:35:51       And they were all universally telling me that there's no performance enhancing benefit, full compliance by Jon Jones in terms of being there for Usada at every single task. Uh, notifying his whereabouts, doing everything by the book. In terms of what the UFC requires and what you saw to require. Yeah, so our program has a three strike policy. So basically, you know, if you miss a test for an unexplained reason three times, then it could be a violation. John's never had one whereabouts strike. He's always been available when you saw it as tried to test them. And again, especially recency. Recently one of the most tested athletes in the UFC. Wasn't there one test in the past where you sought a showed up at the gym and there was some sort of speculation that John was hiding under the ring pre Usada that that was pre Usada before I got here.

Speaker 2:          01:36:38       I've, I've heard about that at all. The details. I don't know whether it's true or not. I think it was a Nevada state athletic commission test. My recollection's. Right. But it wasn't, he sought a test. Okay. So there's no reason in terms of how you're looking at this particular case that this fight should not take place or that John should be sanctioned to any further. There isn't and look, it's, it's the least compelling argument, but I think you know, you have to look at it. You have to look at the common sense approach to this. A guy who went through a year and a half almost suspension to vary, I would categorize as embarrassing public hearings in California along arbitration hearing before Mclaren. All this science is rooted out about how long this stuff stays in your system. Longterm metabolites for months, maybe years you're going to choose to use oral Terenna ball still after going through all of that leading up to a fight. I don't buy that. See, I don't think, I think I agree with what you're saying, but in terms of people fucking up, there are no bounds on human stupidity and in terms of people's ability to do impulsive things that are irrational, that wind up sabotaging their career is almost more of an indication that people are willing to do than not. There's,

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       it's very, it's low, you're less likely. And this is in terms of, especially in particular [inaudible] fighters, fighters are ridiculously impulsive. It's one of the things that categorizes and it's a characteristic of the, the type of human being that gets involved in that line of work in the first place. They're wild motherfuckers. They're crazy. They do crazy shit. And I just, I don't, I don't buy that. That would be new level crazy. And look again, I categorize as a new level, crazy guy, least compelling argument. I agree. At least compelling, but I think we'd be remiss if we didn't at least consider that. Uh, I, okay, I see your point. I don't buy it that, that, that part I don't buy. I buy all the science and I'm a big John Jones Fan. I mean, you can call me a John Jones suck up all day long. I think he's one of the greatest of all time and I think it's not over for him.

Speaker 3:          01:38:42       I think he still could reach, I don't even think he's at his peak. I think he's still got time to be the greatest of all time. If he hasn't already achieved that. But I think that he's also, he's a wild man. You know, it's one of the reasons why he's so great. It's one of the reasons why you opened up the fight with Shogun at 22 years old with a flying knee. And he's a wild motherfucker. That's who he is. And it's one of many reasons besides his talent that he's so God damn good. I know the lows of the lows. He's gone through these last two years. You really can't leave how low those lines. And so again, look, I don't disagree with you that that's not out of the area of consideration, but man, I, I just don't, I don't get anybody. It could be by reckless.

Speaker 3:          01:39:26       I hope you're right. Um, I also worry that fighters often in times, and I'm not accusing John of doing this, but oftentimes surround themselves with morons and these morons give them poor advice. And these morons think that they have ways to skirt systems and get around the rules and they have people that, you know, throw a bunch of fancy words their way and they want to believe. And this happens all the time. This happens all the time with fighters in regards to financial management and advice that they get with that. Uh, I mean I've seen like world class fighters do ridiculous shit in terms of strength and conditioning because some asshole with a good vocabulary talks him into some nonsense. This is just one of the things that happens with fighters and oftentimes they can be around someone who gives him poor advice in terms of what they can and cannot get away with when it comes to supplementation and when it comes to steroid use.

Speaker 3:          01:40:21       Yeah, absolutely. And I see that that all over the place. In John's case, however, to give credit where credit's due, you know, his team after the initial positive with a dick pills was very interactive with me and Donna and you know, checking supplements, Hey, what line should we go to show they, you know, to give them credit. They definitely showed a increase exercise of care when it came to supplementation with John. Well, that's great to hear. And I really hope this is a thing of the past, and I hope this is the last time we ever have to talk about John in this term and that moving forward, we just talk about in terms of his performances

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       and his, his fights, and you know, what he's already achieved. So any youngest UFC champion of all time, uh, anything else? Yeah, so I was going to bring this up at the beginning, but the golden snitch, that's Presevo, that's Brendan Shop's name. He gave it to you. So taking on a life of its own, and I think, I think you know the last time we talked about Donna asking Alexa, who, let me see, we'll see what Siri says. Hold on a sec. Let's see what Siri says. Well, I've never tried this. Hold on a second. Who is the Golden Snitch? He's some inflammation. Wow. Oh yeah. Quite niche. It's something in Harry Potter, which I did last time on. And I mentioned it was in, I think, my wikipedia profile. It had me as Aka the golden snitch. Hey Siri, who is the golden snitch?

Speaker 2:          01:41:54       Wow. Siri. Siri keeps going with quad itch. So someone took it down from yeah, yeah, yeah. I do that. Well I think we talked about, you're like, Eh, I dunno. They just did it. Um, so I think I told you about us backup already. Coworkers call me. Yes. My family calls me. They call you. The goldens friends called me. I was at the MMA awards last year and some Yahoo had a few pops back in me is screaming in between presentations, the golden snitches. I'm slinking down in my chair, my girlfriend and I, we got damn the golden stitch. It's backup already popped up. Beautiful. Just fucking when they do that, just put your hands up in the air shake q one. So you know, definitely should make a shirt during shows. All sit pretty close to the cage. Go out in between a fight into the bathroom and it's not Joe Rogan level half the damn arena standing up.

Speaker 2:          01:42:47       Excited to see you walking in and out of the fight or walk. But two or three people in that walk when I go backstage to check on each side of the golden snitch. And so give them wreck. You know Steve Reed, you know, so you've read our bald security, that bad ass looking guy on stage. He'll come back stage just mate, they're calling me the snitch out there, man. I think I'm you. That poor God pays for it. Um, we were in a scary guy, dude. He's a great dude. That guy is at the top of his game. Insecurity. Just background is unbelievable. I saw him one time in Las Vegas during a fight. He was sitting on the floor. Something's happened in the fight. The crowd goes fucking bananas and everybody stands up on the floor. Steve stands up and just motions sit down and the entire fucking section sat down.

Speaker 2:          01:43:35       200 plus people. I'm like, dude, if you can, without even having to touch somebody, just stand up by your presence alone and control something like that. I mean, the best I've ever seen, he's legit as it gets. So are you going to do anything to market this? Well, that's getting to my story. It's not marketing, but let me finish the story here. So I'm in Chicago this year. I think there was a paper review. You were there, right? Yes. So something happened and I was late getting to the arena and they had cut off kind of the loading dock. I couldn't get to it. So I had my oldest daughter with me. And so we're having to walk through where all the crowds walking in and you know, dudes, all of Golden Snitch, hey, can we get a picture golden snitch? My daughter's like, what the fuck is going on?

Speaker 2:          01:44:18       How old is your daughter? So she's 22 so two days ago, Christmas morning, I'm opening up presence. So I get the presidents from my daughters, the three of them, and my middle daughter's very artistic. And so they create these cool sculpted beer mugs and there's four of them. One of them's like Bald Guy Brewing Novitsky something and one of them says golden snitch brewing company. So it's cool looking thing. And she, she drew me a black and white kind of rendition of all four, which I'm gonna hang up really cool. So then my girlfriend's there. So she hands me the box and she's been telling me all along, she goes, I got you the best fucking present ever in the history of presence. I'm like, the hell is this? So I open up the box. Oh my gosh, she's got this series of tee shirts and I think, what size are you? Large. Large. There we go. Nancy, you, since you created it, you literally and figuratively have to wear it. Now this is outrageous. So that picture, there's some,

Speaker 4:          01:45:22       oh,

Speaker 2:          01:45:25       say who you go baby ladies and gentlemen, circle close. Look at that. So I posted a boot on this or something. Man That's pretty sure can came from Moscow. I think I can say this. Hopefully they'll let me back in, but it's out in front of KGB or FSP headquarters to that building in the background is kgb. F has now known as FSB. Oh Wow. So yeah. So I posted a picture of, she got me like 20 shirts. I put them on, not private instagram, facebook, everybody in the world's like, take my money man. Where can I get one wearing wearing the weigh ins tomorrow. Alright, you guys created it. You've got to own it now. I got one for shop too that you can feel that on the shops mad at you. Is He? Yeah, he's, he called you the golden wrap now I'll change. I thought maybe you got him in here. He's informed. Misinformed. He thinks first of all that you were an employee of you saw it. Oh, there you go. And that now you're an employee of the UFC. Uh, he's misinformed about that and I think he, he likes to call skeptical. He skeptical hippo. I am skeptical as well, but I, one thing that I've learned from doing this podcast over the years is that there's no fucking way there's, it's an, it's impossible to know everything. It is impossible

Speaker 3:          01:46:51       and you have to rely on the expertise of the people who have spent a lifetime studying these things. It's very important. Here's another thing. There's no way these people could be lying about this and it wouldn't

Speaker 2:          01:47:05       massively damaged their career going forward. It'd be done. Someone would find out, someone would get to them, the other scientists without them. There would be studies done, there would be papers done, the Internet would find out about it. Everybody would know. There's no way it's, it's pretty unprecedented in writing with the lack of these studies. They were Chenko one being the my sanding even right. How'd he say it? The check. Yeah. It's pretty unprecedented that they would put these absolutes in writing. Um, you know, with his law, you know, I think they looked at it very hard and detailed and obviously they weren't quick and turning it around. And we would have loved this decision to be made a lot earlier so we could have rooted and vetted it out with Nevada. But they did indeed sign their names to these pretty absolute statements and what, what else can the UFC and I do, um, when these experts are putting those absolutes out there and I get the people go, oh, whoops, could you actually do,

Speaker 3:          01:47:59       you got to understand folks, this would be career suicide. This is, this is the, this is cutting edge science we're talking about. There's too many people that would have a vested interest in calling bullshit. It's, it's not something they don't fuck around when it comes to these things that people that are at the, the front of the line, when it comes to catching people on these things and the science that they're important, they're, they're, they're, they're involved with. It's, this is not, you get, you can't like gas on the outside with no education. It's just not wise. And this is what I keep seeing over and over again is people that have some knowledge, a little bit of knowledge, and they're, they're pretending that they are, they have a phd in this shit

Speaker 2:          01:48:44       go. I mean, for those that want to, you know, do more detective work, go read Mclaren's written decision on John's July, 2018 July, 2018 tests. Go read the rich hank off study on the DH CMT and the metabolites and go read the recent clomiphene. Um, study where it shows is chlorinated substance. It's pulsing, it goes away, comes back higher than before. It goes away, comes back, lower, goes away, comes back higher. Crazy stuff. Okay. Um, we good when, when can someone get one of these? She only made about 15 of them for me, man. You got to sell these. You have to sell these. Maybe do something for, maybe do something for charity or something. Jamie. Dot. Yeah. Someone needs to stop. We can talk, but then it's not exclusive. You want to have the exclusive shirt when nobody else can get on line and not into that man. All right, Jeff. Thank you very much. The clarifying please folks, please have an open mind. Please. I know you want to call it bullshit. There's times there's times call bullshit, but there's times

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       to recognize that this is a complicated issue and that we've laid it out as I'm, I'm pretty convinced. Appreciate it Joe. And I'm dumb, so you might be smarter than me. All. Bye everybody. Yeah.
