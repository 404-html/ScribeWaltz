Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Robin Black Gentlemen. What's up buddy? Hey man, it's great to see you. Are you fresh back from Singapore? I am, yeah. I was in Singapore like 48 hours ago. Did they make that special shiny silver one for you? Because that looks like this design for you know, it's, I mean, yeah, it does Kinda look like it's designed for me, which is why I wanted it, you know, it's a rock and roll. One Championship afc championship. So what's it like over there man? So let me explain to everybody. One FC is like the Asian version of the UFC is a gigantic organization that has been going on for how long now? Two thousand 11. So solid seven years and really high level fights over there. Amazing, amazing fight. Singapore itself is wild. So I went over there to chat with them. So chapter three, a city of tongue runs it and he and I had been chatting and I love kind of how they see martial arts.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       So they don't call it even fc anymore. It's just one championship. They don't even use the word fighting. Really it's martial arts. And the way I see it and the way I studied martial arts and share it is an art form like painting or yoga or you know, things, things of that nature, less spectacle. That's always how I've seen it. Oh, is how I love it. And that's how they see it and that's how they present it. And that's, it's presented from this sort of inspirational own your history kind of way in Asia. And that was what attracted me to them right away. I mean it's, it's definitely an art form. It's values based, like they're kind of seeking to inspire people through these athletes and artists. It's pretty fucking cool. Really what's motivating them to take this sort of radical approach. So it's wild that you say that because to me this is the approach.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       So I think what we do, or the way that we presented in North America is radical. I think martial arts is an art form. Martial arts is this inspiring thing. I mean, you take, say for example, on loud song, he is there 185 pound and 205 pound champion. He's from me and Mar. They have never had a world champion in any sport ever in their history. I don'T think they've had a gold medalist in the olympics. They've never had that. This guy's a two division champion that will and when I talked to [inaudible] about it and he was talking sort of about why he sees it this way and why he's proud to present it this way. He's like, he knows without question that there are kids and he won his 205 pound title in me and mark in a stadium in me and mark and he said he knows without question there's a kid in, they're going to become a lawyer one day because of that and they can feel it and it's real.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       It's not like. It's not like a marketing strategy like this is how they see martial arts and it's how martial arts is viewed in asia. Martial arts. I get to travel so much now it's view different in Russia. It's view different in Brazil also viewed in Russia. Russia is wild, man. I've got to work for a acb, you know, acb, some other organization, big organizations. So in Russia it's very masculine and it's about about victory and about showing your power and your strength and it really. And, and Russia is like that, you know, it's a reflection kind of of Russia.

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       Yeah. I'm the martial art thing. I absolutely agree with you on that. It is an art form, but I also think it's a fight like gilbert melendez versus diego sanchez. Yep. That's an art form, but it's a fight that was, that was a fucking wild fight and there's no way. That's just art. That's an art and a fight. It's both things.

Speaker 1:          00:03:43       Is that a fight is art. It is in a way. It's an expression of your personality, your individuality. It's heart, your fearlessness. A hundred percent, but it's a fight. I'm not scared of the word fight. No, I'm not.

Speaker 2:          00:03:56       I like it. I liked that word, like it's. But it is an art form. Yes. Fights are art. Yes, definitely. I mean like anderson silva's second fight with shale son, the way he landed that need of the body on the ground, but that is just art. That's art, you know? I mean if you go back to leo machida just landing that front kick on vitor belfort, that's art is. It's especially for someone who practices. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:04:21       martial arts, you see the beauty in that. You're like, ah, it's like a flower blossoming or sunrise or just something perfect. The impossibility of it is what's so beautiful, like these guys are so unwilling partners and they have such like a desire to accomplish what they want to accomplish to kick that guy in the face from that position with vito has a lifetime of this, a lifetime of being able to not let you do that and for you to first be willing to be free enough to try it, you know, and, and to, to express it in that moment. It is definitely hard, but I, I'm with you. Fight doesn't intimidate me at all. It, you know, a fight is a beautiful thing. A fight is we fight for things all the time. You know, it's a metaphor for life itself. When they fight, I think

Speaker 2:          00:05:11       people rightly so are concerned with the idea of violence against someone who's an unwilling participant and that's how they think of fighting. They think of it as this thing that they want nothing to do with. They don't want any violence in their life. They don't want anybody to hurt them and I completely understand that. I understand that position, but that's not what it is. When it's a competition. I mean it's a tired expression because I've said it too many times, but my perception of what fighting is is high level problem solving with dire physical consequences

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       time and then the physical consequences are what make it so special. Yes, no question. No question. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:05:54       [inaudible]. Make the gOod times better. The the possibility that bad things can happen to you and do sometimes happen even to the great ones. You see great fighters had been kod and come back and you know, there's, that's, there's something about that where you realize like, hey, even fade or can get knocked out. You know whaT I mean? hey, even anderson silva can play cocky and get caught by that. Chris weidman left hook. I mean this is just, this is just the game

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       and you know, I think in asia in particular, but there's different pockets of of how these this is viewed and how the philosophy of of connecting to martial arts and fighting is viewed and in asia you would see a certain amount of the fighters would see being losing badly is an opportunity, a chance because to come back and win again or to come back and show that you're able, you, you were given the gift of trying and failing. You know whaT I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       Do know what you mean? Yeah. That's a great way to approach it. It's a great way to look at it. You know, I mean that, that there really is a lesson that the average person can take in their life. Like every time a person does have a bad thing happened to them. It's that terrible feelings and opportunity to rise from the ashes.

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       Yeah. And winning when it's, when you're winning at everything and things come easily to you that I'm sure if it still feels good, but when you've gone through really hard times when you've been challenged by something or do you drop lower, the high of the success is so much higher at so much of a longer journey. Personally, when we've spoke before and when we talked about a cm punk, when he was fighting the first time I was like, this is stupid, you know, and this guy is, is pushing, stacking himself into a position to try to not fail by making the challenge so difficult that even if he fails, he don't really. But this is fully different now. Like now I'm, I'm cheering for him because he was humiliated like he was. He didn't just fail. He was humiliated. He, he in front of everybody was shown to be. People would judge them as weak or people the judgment that he would feel hIs bad and he sat. I'll go do it again. He, we are now in a completely different context because that's a guy who epically failed in front of everybody and then dealt with that and now says, I will try the journey again and this will make me a better person and I now I fully endorse this. I'm cheering for him.

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       Well, he's now fighting a fighter who's commensurate in talent and there's nothing wrong with being a beginner in martial arts, but there's something wrong with thinking that you can be a beginner in fight. Mickey go big time. So it was a foolish venture and I wet my approach to it was this is going to be a very good lesson for people that are fans of positive thinking and they think that's enough. That shit is not enough. If you weigh 110 pounds,

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       you get positive. Think your way to the bank. For instance in Ghana, still gonna punch your brains out. There's just no way around it. And a guy who has really very little experience in martial arts and has rudimentary control of his body. I mean, that's what I saw when I saw, when I saw him training and was like, oh my god, he's killed. He's not blind in that context and I, but he belongs here and that's everything's contextual. Like, just because I thought that was stupid. It was stupid. It was stupid. But that doesn't mean in this context I can't look and go. There's a guy who didn't need it. He doesn't need to come back. He doesn't need to try again. He doesn't need to go into the gym and I've been there. You're in the jam and everyone's going on, man, you did.

Speaker 3:          00:09:42       You did good. I didn't do guy fucking failed miserably in front of everybody. And then show up there cleaning the mats and work really hard and said I'm going to try it again. Uh, and yes, that fight still him and this guy still should take place somewhere else. One hundred percent. I mean, it shouldn't even be on the tuesday night contender show. No, no. It shouldn't. Should be in some amateur event somewhere. That's really what they are. They're, they're guys learning how to compete. Yeah. Um, during the first fight in the paper view, yeah, that's fucking crazy, but that has nothing to do with them. That is a reflection on the company. That's one of the choices that the machine makes. Um, and then we also gave him a juicy contract. Yes, in order to make that valid or viable to make money off it. But that again, I think it makes it, makes it deeper and harder and more chances to fail epically and, and I lost twice in a row and then still want it to fight again and still because it, I really want it to.

Speaker 3:          00:10:43       And, and it was important to me and it meant something to me and I was going to change as a human being by doing it and I was ridiculed. I can relate to what he's going through. But I, they ended on a little show in, in winnipeg, manitoba. We know what I mean. I would never have put myself in that place to look bad. But here he is and here it is and I'm cheering for him as a store, as a human being in a weird situation that has been put himself into a deep, dark, hard spot and saying, my way out of this is to try really hard and really go in and and the chance all of that I would want for him if I knew him and he was my friend is to fight your way through some adverse situations to be able to be in it and find when it's hard, you discover I can handle the. When it's hard, I can, I can get up when I've been dropped or I can fight through not being able to breathe. If he loses and does that, it will have been worth it for him. No matter how much ridicule he'll take, it will have been worth it for him. What was really weird watching them walk to the cage was that he was approaching it liga pro wrestling fight because he had done so many of these pro wrestling matches that he was walking to the cage with like pro wrestling, mannerisms, everything and

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       all. I was watching this and I, you know, I did like an internal head shake, like fuck, like this, you can't. It was a terrible idea. Like whoever on everybody's side said that he could fight micky gall, you're out of your fucking mind. Watch that kid fight once a kid is very good on the ground, very good at big and strong young standups. Not bad either, you know, and he's tough as shit and he's smart, he's clever and he's mean. He's mean fucker. And that is at that stage he was maybe one to know, I think uh, maybe two, but it's still the lowest level that there is in the entire elite world of fighting. Not that it didn't matter the way. One, like you saw it, you saw the wait took that guy's back and the way sinks hooks in when, when he was on top and just delivered that type.

Speaker 2:          00:12:43       Yeah. That's. And you're a hundred percent right. What if somebody is watching that? That is the reality of thinking. I won't really worry. I'll put myself in a situation that I can't win, but I've got guts and heart and I believe I'm going to do it. You get the metaphorical version of that punch in the face. If you go through life like that, yes you do, and you know what? You shouldn't do it in fighting because you don't want those punches in the face. If you can avoid them, like if, if you're in a situation where you're, you want to prove your toughness and you want to be battled against someone who's of your skill level and try to figure your way through the maze of this contest. That makes sense. What doesn't make sense is getting punched in the face unnecessarily and when you fight, in my opinion, when I looked at that fight, I was like, micky gall is gonna smash him.

Speaker 2:          00:13:31       This is just how it's going to go. There's very few fights where I can tell you, this is absolutely gonna happen. Like, here's a perfect example, rob hoffeld dose on joe's, uh, against a colby covington. I don't know what the fuck's gonna happen. No idea. I don't know. No, we're going to get in there. They're gonna. Throw down. Let's see. Let's see. Micky gall versus, you know. Um, so I forgot to cm punk. What's his real name? Phil jackson. No, hardman fucking fill. Whatever. Yeah. Cm punk. Yeah. What is it? Jamie brooks. Brooks brooks. Phil brooks. Sorry phil. I was like, well he's. This is a terrible idea because he's just going to get pr. You can only get punched in the face so many times in your life and you have a number. Whatever the number is, everybody's different. Mark hunt's number seems to be extraordinarily high.

Speaker 2:          00:14:19       There's some people that could just take it and this is true, but you know, you don't want it when you can avoid it and he could. He's not going to avoid it in that fight. I'm just going to get smashed and less make it caught a crazy arm bar early in the fight and that was what he gave him the. Yeah. Other than that, he's getting his face smashed in and you should not do that if you don't have to lead that. As I remember when we spoke about it, it's unconscious incompetence and that if you don't know what you don't know, like it's a really fucking weird place to be and we go through life that a lot of times

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       in a lot of different contexts until you find out, you know, conscious incompetence where like, oh fuck, I don't know anything about this. He wasn't even at that point. Now he's at that point and he has a lower level thing. So, and you know, he didn't, it was a mistake to start down this road. But you're down at now. You're on it now. So I guess, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:15:12       it seems to me that, I mean he's taken what, two years since I've been about two years getting there and we've subsequently got to see micky gall and some contests against some really tough guys and yeah. Yeah, beat some good guys. And we got to see like, okay, this kid is fucking for real, which is what we suspected all along, but we don't know anything about phil. We haven't seen him spar, we haven't seen retrained. But from what I saw when I first saw him training the first, you know, when I first saw him sparring and moving around, I was like, got damaged a lot of work to be done, like, you know, like first steps of everest work to be done. It's like, this is, um, we're not talking about a guy who has a deep background in martial arts. Like brock lesnar, no wrestling is absolutely a martial art. He was a legit top of the food chain amateur wrestler. He was a fucking monster

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       and a physical monster. I mean that. And a psychological monster like fighting his skills for sure. But it's your body and the mind and when you are a heavy competitor, when you focus, when you're able to focus in the deepest, most fearful conditions, a brock lesnar did that, you know, and uh, physically when you're aware, like you said, we're aware of where your body is in space and how to control. And that can take a lifetime. And uh, so it's a weird one, but I think, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16:36       something you also develop as a child, as a young kid. Like when you're in your developmental years, 13, 14, 15, you're body's growing and it's growing into whipping kicks and punches and shooting takedowns and landing chokes. Your body develops that way. When you're a full grown man in your thirties and then you're starting to throw roundhouse kicks and front kicks in. You're, your body's all goofy and shit and doesn't, doesn't want to listen. Right? It's not pliable. It's not elastic. It says that you're a different animal.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       You can still learn anything. You at 50 years old, you can take up anything in the world. You can take anything and you should. Yeah, you shouldn't be shitting, you know, go into the nfl where they. Or if you start to play a piano when you're 50, you should learn to play piano and show all your friends, you know, the song or. But you can't go like, you know, be in a concert, piano scenario where you're going to fail and, and doing it and saying, you know, I believe doesn't make a difference when he doesn't physically or mentally or psychologically do these things. But I still think learning and growing and chasing things and self improvement is the root of who we are.

Speaker 2:          00:17:43       I agree. Yeah. I think it is too. But you can't be a 34 year old man who's never box a day your life and have a goal

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       to in 12 months, fight loma chanko no. It's never going to happen. If it does happen, it's gonna be a disaster and that there are giant exceptions like one in a million of things where people do things, but there's always some other explanation. And often it is as a youth, they created the neuro pathways in the physicality and the connection to their body. You know, I was uh, I did gymnastics when I was a kid and I love it. It's great big. Yeah. I loved it. And, and, and you know, it helps you physically understand where your body is. And so later on in life, I was always at least okay at sports because I understood how to move my body in space and I understood where my hand was compared to my foot and how I balanced. And to learn that as a child, somebody who was a master of something as a kid who had 30 picks up.

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       Another thing, it has some really advanced learning abilities. There are exceptions that we see rare exceptions, but, but you're right, I mean reality still reality. I wonder too, if those exceptions are genetic, I wonder if like maybe perhaps someone in their family. It was a great athlete and it's transferred through their genes, which I am as I get older, a firm believer in, um, I just don't think we know enough about what transfers through genes. But there's some freaky shit I see in my kids in particular where I go, okay, that is my fucking personality. That's something. And I'm not teaching her to do this. This is something that's in her like this. The repetitive like exercise, like doing things over and over again. Obsessive lee, like there's some weird shit that like, am I wonder if that's a neuropathway that's passed down through the dna.

Speaker 3:          00:19:33       I mean, it just seems like there could be a person who's never engaged in athletics, but maybe their grandfather was like a world champion boxer. And then one day they put on the gloves and then they just sorta like start moving around and the coach was like, hey, what the fuck's going on here? Where did you learn? Or three job like that. I'm forgetting. Francis and ghana's coach's name, I forget his name is fernando lopez. Yes. He's a wonderful guy, a smart guy. Really? He's been around like the best of the best through europe. So in Cameroon to France and these areas and he's seen the best of the best that that genetic crop of humans has to offer. And then francis and got it walks into his gym and you've talked to yo next time you see fernand to ask him about this because you see his eyes light up like that thing where this like a color in the eye. And he's like, you know, I just knew, like he said, I watched him do things in his awareness of his body and how he could physically express himself. He said he'd just never seen anything like it. And this is, you know, week one in the gym. He said, first sparring session, he didn't really know how to fight yet, but he said he saw him adapting and learning within the round against somebody who knew how to fight and you see it in his eyes. He. He literally found fucking unicorn

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       that just strolled in off the street and came in and then he was like, man, if he's had some work ethic, if he is, you know, if, if he's passionate about this, if he can commit and learn and all that, it goes physically, genetically speaking, this human being, the length of his bones, the speed of his neurology, all of these things. He said you just knew and you see it in his face. You're like, oh fuck. That must have been wild. It must have been wild to, to experience that when you have a lifetime of seeing.

Speaker 2:          00:21:19       Yeah. It's like that scene in the color of money. I don't know if you ever saw that movie was with paul move Paul Newman and tom cruise. When Paul Newman, here's tom cruise, break the balls for the first time. It turns a rose. What the fuck is going on over here? And he looks over and he sees his kid. There's, there's certain people that just have this crazy talent and when someone has been around for a long time as a coach and had a bunch of untalented or reasonably talented are very talented people. This, this big stew of humans come into the gym and you see that one unicorn that steps in and he's also a case where his father, I mean he doesn't have a backer, he didn't have a background in martial arts before you started training, but his father was a great street fighter and it's entirely possible that something was carried on through him or

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       something was present in both. That allowed them both to be capable of doing that rather than the learn to pass because we don't know how that passes genetically from behavior. We know that genetically we may behave similar to our parents, our kids. We don't know if that came from that. But, uh, I, I just, I'm the oldest weirdly uncomfortable thinking about genetics because I don't like the idea that we're limited by them. And I know that we're not on some level, but we are, we are, but we're not going to play basketball. He, yes, since lebron james. But if we identified. No, no, we're not where we do, it's not going to go well. Okay. No, there's some, there's definitely some truths. I mean I'm five foot six on a tall day. Like that is a genetic limitation that is undeniable. Right? But if we're looking at things and we decide that our genes, if you've seen the movie gattica I've ever seen them and I did see them moving a long time ago.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       That's one of my favorite movies ever. Matt. So ethan hawke, ethan hawke. Yeah. I always think of him as uma thurman. Yeah, she's in it. But I know, but I think of him because he used to be married to her. I'm like, oh, that's houma thurman thurman in that movie, his brother is genetically superior to him, but he beats his brother in the swimming contests all the time. And at the end his brothers like, how are you doing this? And he said, I never saved anything for the swim back. I was just going to swim to the other side, and his brothers like there is no fucking other side, but it was. I know it's a movie, but it was a mindset, right, and the truth is that like talent. Okay, so you're talented at certain things. Jamie's talents, a certain things. Francis and Ghana, talented talent multiplied by effort equals skill and skill multiplied by effort equals accomplishment. So effort counts twice, right? Effort counts fucking twice,

Speaker 2:          00:24:10       but then you get effort with a talented guy with freak genetics like a lebron james or a Michael Jordan or brock lesnar, and then you get some crazy

Speaker 1:          00:24:19       results. Yes. Oh, big time. And the guy who doesn't have the the talent but had effort twice. Effort was applied twice. We'll go as far as the man or woman will go as far as they possibly could to actualize their true potential by committing themselves to, to effort and not going well. I can't do it. So forget it. By applying effort over and over and over again. And then once you've developed talent, more effort to take that talent and do something that twice used effort, we'll get you as far as you possibly can. If you say, well, I'm not gifted, I'm not talented so I won't put any effort. You have no idea how far you can go. So I absolutely cannot beat francis and new, but by not thinking that I'm too limited by my jeans and continuing to apply effort, regardless of my jeans, I can get to the best possible place I can as an individual. Do you know what I mean? So I think that that on some you don't want to go down some road that you cannot be accomplished, but you also don't want to not go down roads because you're not genetically predisposed to them. I think effort can get you somewhere.

Speaker 2:          00:25:25       It definitely can get you somewhere. But I think what we're talking about here is what I love about life is that it's messy. Yeah. That there's not, it's not one plus one is two zeros and ones. It's just there's a bunch of factors. Does a lot of shit going on man. And that's why when something magical takes place, when you get a, you know, uh, george st pierre, or when you, you get a mighty mouse, when you get someone who's like, whoa, look at that, like this, there's so many factors that lead you to be gennady golovkin. Now there's so many different things have to fall into place. Or here's a guy, like, how about michael bisping? Michael bisping is just one of the toughest motherfuckers ever example. Yeah. But you found the perfect. Michael bisbing is one of the toughest motherfuckers ever. He's not extraordinarily talented in any one form of mma. He's not like the fastest guy. He's not the strongest guy. He doesn't have this great background in brazilian jujitsu where he's just a worldclass strangler. And if he gets your back, you're fucked. There's none of those things. He's just tough as fuck. And he's one of the most mentally strong guys. Like even tim kennedy who was here the other day, tim kennedy's like, god, I hate to give them a compliment, but he's so fucking tough. Can't. You can't deny them. You

Speaker 1:          00:26:42       can't. So, and, and that goes right back to this, and I think this is at the root of questions about life, was michael bisbing genetically tough? Is he genetically mentally tough or did work really hard and just push himself through things and that one day when it got really fucking tough, he didn't give up, which taught him that he shouldn't give up, which taught him to go even further, which made him push himself like, or was it in all likelihood? It's both. But michael bisping free of that effort to continue to because what's his name? Think of the mentally toughest guy that I'm just, I have a thing with names sometimes. Even names I know I'll describe. You guys got a chain and he's howling and he does power slam, but I can't think of ramp. I can't think of rampage, but I'm a big elbows.

Speaker 1:          00:27:27       You've had. I'm probably on the podcast, a tough hairy chest. Um, uh, who am I thinking of 170 pounds fought demian maia. I'm matt brown. Matt brown. Oh, south. Yeah. But that's exactly what I can literally literally say all these things, but the name will escape me. It's a strange thing. Happens to me too. I will. I worked with john. We're early in the morning, right? I worked with john ramm dean for years is one of my best friends and he would literally just see it in my eyes, just like I won't have the name and I'll throw out one or two of those factoids. And you always had it. It'd be like matt brown. So that's why having good friends to work with is great. Will know your. Yeah. But talking to him about brandon on the phone, I, I'm doing an interview with them. I said, you're one of the mentally toughest guys there is. And he said that, I don't think I am. He said, if I think I'm mentally tough for one moment I will not do all of the things necessary to walk in mentally tough. He said, he's like, man, I am not mentally tough. The mental toughness is a result of all of the hard work and preparation that I have done to be able to do it in that moment. And you heard it in his voice. He had no doubt that this was so and I think he's right. He's right. He's right.

Speaker 2:          00:28:43       I think he's ready to, but he's also mentally tough because he also does those things, but one of the things that about matt brown that separates him is that empties out in the cage. He separates himself from the pack because he. He's so ferocious like that guys for roche's. Remember when, when he stepped into the cage, we were watching. I think we're doing a fight companion, but we're maybe we were wearing anyway when, when he stepped into the cage and fought diego sanchez, when, when he stepped into the octagon and screamed and roared, it was literally like an animal. I mean it was, it was for veracity defined and that's just how we fight, man. That guy just empties out like whatever the fuck he's got. He's not holding anything back, man. He, he goes for it.

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       And that's why I think when we were talking about fight and art, to me that's an art of human expression. Like I think that is to be a capable. I mean whether you're you're doing jazz or punk rock, it's human expression. Whether your matt brown or your some elegant mover, it's still the same art at its root. But you remember that elbow, he fired on diego sanchez fight. It was there. And there are these moments. Are there a lot when you're analyzing, fighting and looking at it from that other perspective, these fight ending moments are there. They're there are way more often than these guys realize. But when they spot them like matt did in that moment, this is. I have a free shot from an angle. Time has slowed down enough that I see it. I can see the little red arc of where it's going and I'm going to put this, I'm going to end this fight it. There's a visceral like, like it's. Here it is. When people look at you see it, see just like that. That is fucking art to me. But watch the lefthand, the reach and the hold and it's like there is no doubt what, what's happening here. There is no doubt

Speaker 4:          00:30:39       going to happen. Go cinches is another curious example because he's also a guy who is ferocious, like a ferociously tough guy, but there's always been something about his movements that makes him come up short against the best of the best. And I mean you're talking about a guy who's so fucking mentally tough as well. Like I always bring his fight against jake ellenberger who is a brutal knockout artists at one 70 and diego really. I mean diego fought at 1:45, remember? And diego really is a tweener. He's a little too small for 55. I don't know how the fuck he made it to 1:45. He basically starved as body away and probably did some irreversible damage. But he feels like his movements are always just shy of elite. And I've always wondered what is that like? It's almost like even if you see that, go back to that clip again, but you don't have to. It's okay. But there's something about even the way he steps in, he's not stepping the way a tj dillashaw steps, you know what I'm saying? He's so,

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       I, I see it as his sort of intention. It's his over into god that is so nasty, nasty and so perfect. But I see he wants it badly. Like he is. He's over engaged. I think it's psychological as much as anything I would say in, in albuquerque. Look at that. The placement of the lefthand there. There's just no doubt where this is going. It's perfect. It's. And it is the moment that matt brown created, like he created that moment, see hairy chest until jerry. That's fun. That's one of my reminder cues, right? Uh, but, uh, I think so I watched diego train in albuquerque and I love that guy. I was there doing interviewing cub who is my favorite artists probably to watch for many reasons. I'm not really sure exactly why people can't tell you why their favorite band is their favorite band. But I can tell there aren't many things that you can describe, but I was there to interview him for monster zim.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       It's a website in South Korea that when I became a freelancer, they were like, we'd like to give you some work. I'm like, well, that'd be amazing. We'd like you to go. He just fought. Do whoa choice. We'd like you to go interview mr. Cub swanson. I'm like, this is bad ass. It's like my favorite fighter. I'm going to send me to albuquerque, and then I hung out in the gym and analyze them and watched and made notes about what I could and diego and super intense and he does everything super intense and and as much as he loves yoga and the different types of yoga and meditation has allowed him to do it differently. That hyper intensity I think doesn't allow the sort of soft relaxation that's necessary to really do what you're describing. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       I know what you're saying. Like the one of the things that people don't understand about striking hard and having real power is that you're not fully tense through the entire movement. There's a lot of parts of striking where the momentum starts and you're almost like completely loose. Like up until instance, before the point of contact and then it's, there's this, there's this weird thing that real knockout artists have that you don't see in these fucking tense windmill guys. Windmill guys are too tight. Totally. But a guy like ray robinson will throw up, like there's a, there was a gene fullmer ray robinson kao clip from the other night. Uh, I was, I was watching online. I must have watched like 13 times in a row. But you watch them land this thing. It was a left hook, but you watched the punchline. He liked jesus, like this nap that, that guy had. But that snap is not, it's not, it's not fully tents. Here it is right here. Like, look how soft it is. Simple. Yeah. Soft. But look at that lead, that left hook right there. That one's softens them up, ties him up. But everything is like, yeah, swimming. Yeah. I mean it's just, he was an amazing boxer dude. And you're talking about a guy who had like 100 and something fights, right? It's almost gentle, right? Like he's soft is the right word. Suppleness there. So

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       there's a calmness, there's a relaxation and mentally too, like you know, that idea of there's a storm going on in the middle of this, this calm area, that gentleness, that, that calmness has to be in your mind to allow you to do this. And that's where diego is,

Speaker 2:          00:35:03       that man. Just look at that, that's fucking incredible. And that left hook right here, here it is pink yet. And even just to create that moment and to see that moment, you know, and to set it up and lay traps and see when the guys moving his hands down, see when he's coming forward, see his patterns and 10 they can do those things. Yup, yup, yup. But it's that kind of power in that left hook that does not come from. That's just this little twists that he does like come on, but here

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       it is right here in slow mo. Bang. And it's just hip. And so I did. I'm sure you saw it or I think you saw it. I did a little breakdown of your kicks. I did see that. And it's just, that's what I was. So zooming in on was this double paulson. That's real, that's. That is the neurology of high athletic performance. So I have these friends that I've developed, I've gathered over the years and I love what I do, man, like I'm happy every single day and a big part of it is I've met these people that I have these conversations with and sometimes they're very long and deep and and they've some. I have friends that are a phd psychologists and this one guy dr stu mcgill. Do you know who he is? His name now? You've probably heard that name. I'm sure somebody has mentioned it because you're around different athletic types of all types.

Speaker 1:          00:36:27       He is the world's foremost expert in the spinal cord and neurology of athletic performance, spinal cord. The spinal cord and how and your neurology and your nerves and how your nervous system and george st pierre has worked with him a lot. He, if you asked him about him this week, he would talk about them extensively. So dr stu and I became friends and it's a big compliment because he sought me out based on seeing my work and saying that guy knows some things I want to talk to him, which was a plaque and deep compliment to me and now we became friends and we chat all the time and one of the things we constantly talk about is the double pulse in neurology and people talk about fast twitch fiber. It's not a fiber as that's just terms we've started to hear. It's a fast twitch neurology.

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       It's, it's a base, a fast ball hitters have it. You know what I mean? That neurology where you, you, there's a pulse of tension and then a complete relaxation until the pulse of tension. Again, the bruce lee's one inch punch was the simple example of that, but that is how that is the neurology of high athletic performance and that's what I zoomed in on when I was looking at your kid because you can see it quite clearly. There is the moment, there's the relaxing those and it ends up being more of a whip and stewart Dr. Stewart has all these incredible analogies because he's examined this in so many different angles and layers, which is the beauty of analyzing anything for years and he'll use terms like you can't shoot a cannon out of a canoe and you think about that and you're like, of course with canoes all wobbly, but if it's tense and then shoots or you can't push a rope, right?

Speaker 1:          00:38:04       You push a rope, right, and so, but you can whip a rope through tension, relaxation and tension again, and that neurology is the neurology of high performance and george, you talked to george about neurology. He'll go deep down some shit to george st pierre because he studied this to understand himself and what he was doing at a high level with doctors do. But it is a fascinating thing because when you think we often will say fighting is 90 percent mental sipping. This cup is 100 percent mental. You know, my brain told my body to reach out and do it. My brain made the choice. I activated everything, use, it's all your brain, everything and once you get to a high level of performance, you know how to punch and kick and you train like crazy and you make the things happen by themselves almost by trading so much they take so little attention and decision making. It becomes about maximizing your nervous system, how your nervous system. And I think that's true of almost anything history right there. Yeah. Yeah. That susie training with george and dr stu. I couldn't see his face. Yeah, that's true. It looks like a bar guy and to be honest george. Yeah, but got. I'm whipping the ball around. Yeah. I'm not sure exactly what he's doing or why they're dumbbell press, but I'll put you in touch with them often.

Speaker 4:          00:39:26       So it's like a, it looks like he's got some heavy weight at the end of a rope.

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       Yeah. And I guess engaging the core through the use of, you know, probably asking him to only engage certain things to counter balance the movement

Speaker 4:          00:39:40       prize, to see george waring, your typical a running shoe when he's training with the thick heel. And you know, I'm still surprised to this day when I see I'm going to talk about neurology and activating muscles and tissues. Like there's so many athletes is still train with those big cushy bottomed running shoes. I mean I think that is crazy. Big time. It's weird. It's weird, mean you should be doing that kind of shit barefoot. Especially a fighter. You fight barefoot. You should be wearing nothing on your feet.

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       The only thing connecting you to a stable surface is your foot. Yeah, I agree 100 percent. And sometimes when we're trying to make sense of these things, we go to multiple different sort of perspectives of it. So I'll take what I learned from dr stu and he's just my friend now as well. So I like hanging out and chatting with him about like way out there aspects of these things. But you talk to irwin [inaudible] as well, who has a different sphere of connecting to this kind of thing in erewhon starts with the foot and you've had urban on the. Yeah, and he starts with the foot and everything else. It makes sense, right? I go to throw a punch and the important part is going to be my foot through the leg, through the hip, through the core and and relaxed until the moment that it hits. But then they'll start song is the same.

Speaker 4:          00:40:57       when I asked nick's. Excuse me when I asked nick curse on about training athletes, like what's the thing that he thinks fighters work on the most? He's like foot strength. I was like, wow. And I thought about it like, well of course. Right? That's how you push off. That's how you move. Your feet are weak and they get tired. You can't move. Well, which I've experienced. I'm sure you've experienced when your feet are weak and tired. Like if you. If you don't run and then you try to run one of the first things, you get tired of your feet.

Speaker 1:          00:41:26       The very worst injury I've ever had in my life by far was plantar fasciitis of both feet. My last fight and I was through training and everything and then I had my fight in montreal and the whole strategy was put, getting to a place where I could be safe and use better knowledge of the situation to fatigue the other guy. So the whole, a lot of the seven or eight minutes of the fight took place with me, pressuring him against the fence, just driving off both feet, pressuring against the fence to try to land things or make create lines for different weapons. And it's only eight minutes, but eight minutes of intense drive from my feet. And then we went on vacation the very next day and that night we grabbed margarita's and we walked around the resort and then my feet were destroyed for a acutely, for three or four days. Like I couldn't walk. And the inflammation was so unbelievably bad. It was like bricks. And, uh, even for months after it was, did you ask him, uh, tried to ice I ice or I would get in immediately into the cold pool and spend the day in the cold pool drinking tequila and hopes that it would help. And it kinda did

Speaker 4:          00:42:35       foot pain is, that's one of the things that are hurt. Dominick cruz in his comeback fight when he fought tj dillashaw, you notice he was kind of limping a little. We were attributed to the leg kicks. He said that's not the case. He said what was going on was he had plantar fasciitis because, you know, he had multiple injuries that he was recovering from during that training camp. And wHen he got knee surgery and he came back from that and he tore his groin. He tried to like really ramp up his training. He was doing a lot of sprinting and a lot of different things with his feet, you know, because obviously he's very footwork intensive with his fighting and he fucked his feet up. Man. His feet just weren't in conditioned to do the kind of stuff that he used to be able to do. And the first thing he got was plantar fasciitis shop had it too. He told me it was the worst things he's ever had. I mean, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       think of this for the big picture meaning of this for dominic. So you got somebody else and there are going about fighting and their, their career as a martial artist, a competitive fighter one way. And dominic goes about a different way. And through dominic's choices, uh, moving training, footwork, he avoids a lot of the damage that these guys will take. But you can't avoid. Something's going to go right. So instead of taking, getting kicked a lot and punched in the head and taking all those things, the training necessary to make that not happen, fucks up something else. Like you can't get away from it. You're going to work yourself until your body gives up. Even dom brilliantly finding a way to work outside of taking the damage that they take still could not get away from damaging his body.

Speaker 4:          00:44:12       Tj dillashaw versus cody garbrandt. The rematch is one of the most intriguing parts of the year for me. I'm really, really curious about that fight because I know those guys were tightly matched in the gym and I know that cody correct him with a big right hand before tj put him away and so it was. He was stunned. I mean he got rocked and I believe when cody cracked and it was towards the end of the round, he was. Yeah, and so he had an opportunity to recover. I mean, who knows if he had caught that right hand the first minute of the round what had gone on, but when tj recovered from that and then lend that head kick and then knocked him out and put them away, you got to see like, oh, what a high level high stakes game these two guys are playing and you know, tj has through bang ludwig has really radically improved his movement, his footwork, his angles, his approach.

Speaker 4:          00:45:08       He's so versatile with his ability to switch stances, his ability. I mean he's constantly cutting angles and striking as you switching stances and there's so much information coming at you. If you're fighting him, your, your brain's overloaded. If you're not used to that. And even the guys who used to train with them, I believe in alpha male, are not used to what he's doing now. I agree. Because it's a. It's a. It's a at a far higher level that said, cody still has a fucking missile in his right hand. It's so god damn fast. His hand speed is so fast and his, his fluidity and efficiency in his boxing is so good. It's just a very, very interesting fight for me.

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       That's about as good as it gets right now. Like from the raw materials of those guys and the skills that they have. But I, I'm definitely with you as far as that. My deep curiosity of the choices of the coaches because, and you've talked to some of them different ones, you know, I've got a few key friends that I talked to on a very regular basis. And so what it will take, what we would decide to do to train to make our guy the best in the world or try to be the best in the world in 10 months. If we take a different strategy and we start to build them to be the best in the world in three years, it's a different game and that's what dwayne, dwayne is sad. We will and it's, it's fucking hard work for dwayne to like, that's the thing that people won't necessarily appreciate it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:37       They'll be like, oh, he's a brilliant coach. That's nonstop constant searching and examining and trial and error and reinterpreting his language of understanding where the, where the chaos is and understanding, you know, can we make this guy believes something's happening or are we too deep in it that he doesn't think that and it fails. Like what levels of misdirection or too deep, how good is he? And when I talked to them leading up to that one, it was like, you know, the conversation was about her making cody believe and anticipate something wrong. And that's the root of all of all combat, right? Like you make me think this is coming and I do this. Me in the body and the layers, the multiple layers, like you just said, overloading the ability to. You're trying to catalog what's coming and how you chunk that, uh, we don't necessarily understand.

Speaker 1:          00:47:28       So your brain be going, okay, this is all the stuff from the left which happens when this happened or the, the, the legs or doing this or you're running algorithms in your brain and we don't know. I don't know what yours is. I don't know how you categorize my threats. I don't know whether you categorize anything from my right hand or anything in combination or if you're watching the patterns of my shoulders, I have no idea. So dwayne and anybody else playing with this concept is trying to figure out how you'll read this and use that against you. And to me, that's the layer of complete mindblowing nature that like, what did you say? Chests with dire consequences or problem? Solvable problem. Fucking hard. those problems are now how many there are. That's the game. And, and it can be done at this level because their skills are so good.

Speaker 1:          00:48:16       they're minds are so good. They're physically so good, they're capable, they're fearless, they are confident. They have all of those raw materials and now we're playing a game that most of us cannot comprehend and they've also sparred countless hours together so they stand each other and they've told each other lies for long periods. He lies on lies. I one time went with a. I worked for a company called the score fighting series. It was a brilliant show like it was kind of cannabis. Bella tore like it was on the same network and they aired bella tour and it was very, very good developmental league stuff and that company brought in forrest griffin and then a bunch of poker players and they were on a train together and contest winners on the thing. Got to ride on this train with forrest griffin and a bunch of poker high level pro poker players and I was there and that was the first time I met forrest and this is a killer, smart dude, but you watch these poker players who were all riding together and they all know each other and they were just telling each other lies all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:49:14       Trying to tell stories about things that represent the fact that they are, you know, conservative when really they're risk takers are trying to tell each other things that make them think they're crazy, but really they're calculating like they are telling each other lies ongoing and the gambling with each other and shit, it's completely degenerate generative, but that's the kind of thing that's happening on some level with these, the high level fighters to making them think certain things about what they will do or believe they'll do almost everything they say. Um, we see the fans and the audience we should assume is a game chip is like a, something to make the other one believes something that might in that moment, let me land that kick. If he thinks that I'm, you know, whatever, right? Let's manipulative stuff. And at that level that is just so unbelievably fascinating. It really is. It really is. When the stakes are so high, you know, the kick lands, you're a hero, the kick mrs. and you get caught with a left hook. You're a loser. You know, there's just so much at stake with every single choice you make and all, all those choices have to be almost subconscious or semi-conscious because you've got to be in the zen state, you gotta to be flowing so everything has to be prepared. You have to have, you know, while you're in there, you have

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       to have no regrets. You have to be able to just flow and you have to be able to capitalize on any movement, any, any opening, you see you got to pounds and you have to be in condition to execute all these things so you have to have had the physical discipline and the mental fortitude to push yourself through training to a level that you probably didn't think you could get to

Speaker 1:          00:50:46       and, and I want to pounce with the opening, but what if it's a lie, right? Right. But what if matt brown line on that thing was actually. That one would be hard to be alive, but there are other ones where it feels like that one little opening. But instead tj is going to catch you or cody's line. Do you opt to draw you into something

Speaker 4:          00:51:03       so god damn fast, to his hand, speed is so ridiculously fast. I go back to the tom sell modified and I'll made. Has really never been the same again. I'll made a. Going into that fight was undefeated, was thought to be the dark horse in the division like will look or future world champion and cody lit him up like a christmas tree and the way he did it was so definitive that you like jesus, like there can be no doubt this guy has real world championship potential. Yeah, and I think that the duane ludwig factor is so fucking huge. Really, really do. And I, I've seen dwayne's work in like dwayne, unlike a lot of guys has notebooks, binders full of ideas and his system is a, it's a very declared system. It's not like loosely based where we always work off the jab. We've got good footwork.

Speaker 4:          00:51:55       No, there's none of that. Like there's a system to his, like he has a belt system to his style and his style is based on for people don't know. Dwayne was a world class kickboxer worldclass, muy thai fighter, I mean fought ramon dekkers, mean, fought some of the best of the best, had some amazing fights in both mma and in kickboxing and he was a really talented guy and then transitioned on to being a coach and the obsession that he has towards coaching is really at a higher level than even his obsession towards fighting and he talks about that, that his passion is teaching people. He loves it. He loves being able to mold students and he's found the perfect muse or the perfect willing participant in tj and tj and him have a very unique friendship and very unique student mentorship sort of relationship. It's really, really interesting to watch the two of them together.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       Wild now the super jam with 20 guys and then you've got a, and dwayne has tons of athletes too, but a but a commitment and connection to tj. Then you've got matt hume and demetrius like you've got a few of these guys who are just like, we you, we will funnel all of my experience through everything through this super athlete, but like you talk about those books, the only way that you get to a point of this level of mastery that we're talking about is that you must go down some fucking road for six months that amounts to nothing so that you learned that road isn't the road and the only way and you can't give up too early. And what if by going down at long enough some different concepts about how you switch your feet in a certain moment. You think maybe that ain't it, but you have discovered that by pushing through some of these concepts long enough, you find it so you stick with it long enough and it turns out now dwayne or anybody else reaching that level of mastery has gone down some rabbit hole for months or years and discovered the only value they got out of it was what?

Speaker 1:          00:53:55       No, there's lots of value. That wasn't the rabbit hole and the. The process of searching this rabbit hole has made me better at searching rabbit holes, so those two values, some of the stacks of his books are things that didn't work and he will probably appreciate those just as much as any of the ones that did it was also.

Speaker 4:          00:54:12       Tj is approach is really interesting to me because tj is obsessed with improvement and knowledge and he keeps talking about his fight iq and you know, him and dwayne, I've been around them, I've trained with them, have worked out with him. I've watched him coach tj and I mean they're, they're constantly working on the minutia. That constant working on finite details and improving every single aspect and tightening things up. And it's really interesting. Tj is a fucking open book man. I mean he's uh, he's, he, you can talk to that guy about anything and he's considering it. He's thinking and he's like, oh, okay, I see what you're doing. I see what you're doing. Like he's, he's a guy who's always trying to take in information

Speaker 1:          00:54:56       that's. So these are the things when we do watch this kind of thing, whether it is martial arts or even jazz or football or whatever, there are these lessons that are there like we should do that corresponds to go through life doing that. We're not supposed to look at tj dillashaw and go, wow, isn't that crazy, that guy, if we do that, our lives will get better. Right? Like I, I got to. So I get to work for tsn in Canada, which is like espn in the states and we, I'm myself and erin brought instead or like the two person division that talks about about a ufc and fighting. And uh, we uh, they went and when george was fighting michael, they went and said, you know, could you approach your friends with george and his people? Could you approach them about doing a half hour long documentary on him about his comeback and training and stuff?

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       And I did. And at first george was open to it and is randolph his manager. I was like, oh god, I hear the word documentary and I know what that means. It's going to be months. And is going to be cameras and it's going to be a distraction. I said I'll just travel with george and I have the best producer, simon, the best producer we have and we'll just travel with them. And they saId yes. And so I got to travel with george for a month, six weeks off and on New York, la montreal life eating ice cream training with freddie roach. Yeah. Yeah. That was interesting. When is this going to come out? It did come up before, so mostly in Canada, but I'm going to send a message that I'm going to send a message immediately after we get off here to simon and the rest of them and say where is that right now?

Speaker 1:          00:56:30       And then I'll, I'll tweet it out because he had learned a lot. Oh man, it changed my life because you don't get to be around the greats of the greats and study them. And we're friends so I can talk to him like we hang out here. I got to fucking train karate with his team, like point karate, you know. So it'd be, oh, robin's training with us today. What kind of point karate training do they do and do they do this to practice like blitzing and just think of this like you were big on point karate like 2012, 2013 and I didn't disagree but I didn't really get there. It is. There it is. Yeah, it. Oh fuck. It was so magical to see like. And I wasn't just like, how does he kick? I'm like, how does he think and why does he do the things he does and why?

Speaker 1:          00:57:15       What's his motivation? And it really made me a better human being getting to do that, but so what I didn't really connect to us. Sometimes there's something so simple and we don't see it because we're in deep enough or whatever we're in, but the idea of point karate people right away say, well they're just touching each other so I could. true. So if I'm training to just touch you, I'm not trying to hurt you. Okay. That seems like that's not valuable when you're training to not. Let me even fucking touch you. If you can't get touched by me. How hard. Impossible as it for me to hit you clean, you know what I mean? If your movement and your, your defensive systems and your management of the, of the distance between our weapons and targets are such that I can't fucking touch you. How can I hurt you? Right? If I can't even get touchy with my glove. Well,

Speaker 4:          00:58:02       the thing is, here's what I think about point fighting and what I think was valid about it is if you're just doing point fighting with a point fighter, it is extremely frustrated. I fought and point fighting tournaments when I was competing and we. There was. I came from a full contact taekwondo background and we fought in these tournaments and the object was to knock people unconscious and you would fight, you know, they would have three minute rounds and you would fight and you would try to kick people into another. Very similar in Canada, what we. There was a lot of people that are trained with that openly dismissed point fighting and the reason why they openly dismissed point fighting was because they would stop every time someone would get touched and I would be like, well, in the real world or everybody would say in the real world, you don't just stop when you get touched, you keep fighting.

Speaker 4:          00:58:50       And so with our techniques, a lot of it, you would hit someone once and they would counter and then you'd set up the big shot afterwards. like this is part of the thing and if the referee kept stopping you, then you would never get anything done. But my thinking once I got into mma was okay, yeah, but if you can do that and do the other things, it's like people dismiss taekwondo because they're like, we'll talk one doe. You know, you get taken to the ground, you get your legs kicked out. Absolutely. But if you have

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       takedown defense and you know more thai, you can. We'll kick someone into another fucking dimension. And we saw that with edson barboza versus terry adam. We've seen these taekwondo techniques manifest themselves in mmA and you realize like, oh, these are some of the most powerful things you could do to a person inside a cage, but when you see the point fighting style though, like the Raymond Daniels or the michael venom page, disability ability to blitz if they can do those other things too. This is another another level. There's soMething to it. So as a fighter, I wasn't willing to dismiss point fighting because I had been lied to already. I when I went and took taekwondo and then started kickboxing, first american kickboxing above the waist, first thing I realized was how easy it was for me to get punched in the face. I was like, oh, okay.

Speaker 2:          01:00:13       Now if I'm trapped in this ring and I can't go anywhere and someone's throwing punches and I don't understand how to get away from him, and I'm used to this taekwondo style of having your hands down low. I'm getting fucked up. So I've been lied to. Talk window is not the best martial art. Mma. Yeah, exactly. I'm not that. There is no best push. There's something absolutely legit about that blitz, that karate blitz that some of these guys can do, and I fought some really good guys in those karate style tournaments and I got an ass made out of me. I mean, you, you don't know what to do and you get kicked and then the reference point and the like, you don't have a chance to fire back because they're separating you guys. And I, I really absorb those lessons. And I was like in mma, that ability to close the distance because every in mma there's so many guys and connor talked about this.

Speaker 2:          01:01:04       There's so many guys that have this thai stance and they're presenting this very predictable target. They're standing right in front of each other. And I think this stance, and especially this, the, uh, change, the forward stance is one of the reasons why [inaudible] has been caught, knocked out twice with front kicks because he squares off veto. Explain this to me in like, shit. Nineteen 97. When I was tRaining at carlson gracie's, he was explaining that you know, some kickboxers are going to have a hard time in mma even though they're really good kickboxers because the mma stance, you really have to square off more. You can't stand lIke this. You can't stand in like a boxer and a kickboxer is a little more open than a boxer, but then mma is a little more open than it was like you almost have to be square, but that square leaves you open to front kicks to the face and then turn turning side kicks and side kicks to the body. Think about what [inaudible] has been dropped with jon jones dropped him with a side kick to the body. Um, soccer. Robert dropped him with a turning side kick to the body to fund kick front kick to the face. It's because he presents this square thing, But to him this is sprawl and throw punches and throw that they'll like the blitz had used on vandelay silva. Yeah. And it worked much of his career. He either one with it or lost

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       with respect that thinking, but those types of doctrines like is literally and in martial arts in day to day life in anything. If you think anything is the thing, you're totally wrong because if we all agree it's nothing. Then we all acting like it's the thing that we all start ignoring other things and those things will work. So if you have to, if mma you have to square up. All of a sudden some guys, some connor comes out with a different thing and you were thompson. The guard is the one that is glaRing to me right now because, and I mean I've talked to some of the smartest and the best and they will and we do this over and over again and we do it in everything. You know, you Remember when you, you're, you cannot cross your feet when you do an arm bar.

Speaker 1:          01:03:05       Do you remember that? Are like, what the fuck? What are you talking about? Head kicks. Don't work. And mma like, you know, this has been going on forever. So any absolute decision that this is a fundamental rule is completely. That's where you're gonna get fucked. How about the low calf kick? Yeah, I mean the benson henderson was in my opinion, the first guy to bring him in and he started doing that back in the day, but not at the effectiveness. The level of effectIveness that we're seeing now. That low calf kick his fucking people up. That's really interesting and then they'll adapt and then it won't work, but that adaptation, we'll put something else available. I think the problem with the low calf kyc is that you really can condition the lower part of your leg the same way you can your thighs and I think it's going to keep working, but then we have to not get hit by it, so we'll make a change to not get hit by him.

Speaker 1:          01:03:57       Once we do, that'll force us to do something else that someone will tAke advantage. It's amazing how quiCkly it works. Like if you see a guy get hit with a Brutal leg kick, like it takes one or two and then they start to feel it. There's something about the first low calf kick. You see guys wobbly like that. That muscle is like really done at the insertion at the bottom is so small and it's still taking. It's taking so much work like it's carrying so much. Yeah, it's, it's. These are when things work beautifully and again, like I used to take anything we'd talk about and I'd bring it back to fighting. Now I tend to take anything in fighting and I tried to figure out what it means in life. Like I've kind of slow over time of study. I've started to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       Right? And this is true of this kick and it's true of anything. It's like that it works best when the physiological truth that calf is small and weak and then works with the systemic issue. He's got his foot there and the way he standing is such that you can hit it to those two things together, are making that thing work right now if you can't change the strength of the calf. So the only thing we can change is how available that calf kick is. If we don't want to get hit with it. So we must change that. And if we do, we've changed a lot of different things and now something else is available that dwayne or duke or somebody else has already planning how to, how to take advantage that you've made that adaptation, that, that is for me, what is eternally fascinating, but martial arts, but he can dots, those are the lessons of life that are there. If you can't see that the world around you has changed dramatically and you act as if it's the same, uh, you get fucked up, you will get fucked up,

Speaker 4:          01:05:36       you know, bring this to paul daily versus john fitch because that fight was extremely frustrating to paul daley and frustrated a lot of people that were watching it too because john fits was just able to take him down and kinda do what john does and hit him on the ground and kind of beat him up and control the position. And, and you know, at the end of the fight, paul's yell and boom, it was so strange, you know? And, but this is a guy that if you just stand with him, he's going to fuck you up. Like if you just decide to trade shots with paul daily on your feet, he's got a left hand that is a goddamn nuclear missile, you know, and he basically everybody hits with that thing goes night night. It's scary. Even lorenz larkin, who's a seasoned striker, he got clipped by that left hand is like, yo,

Speaker 1:          01:06:25       the ability to make, generate and create that amount of impact is elegant. It's like, it's like we, we are human bodies and minds don't do all that many things that are, that unbelievably beautiful and rooted in our history as human beings. You know what I mean? This is at the basis of what it was to survive and protect and expand and stuff. And you see it right there. When paul daley hit somebody like it's unreal. The opposite of that scenario is I'm Johnny Hendricks was fighting Stephen Thompson and Johnny Hendricks wanted when stephen would come in, he wanted to drill him with hooks and upper cuts and then get to his body and take him down and do what, what, uh, uh, john fitch did. But steven's like you doing that. And after he kicked him and beat him up at distance and then finish the fight, johnny was being interviewed and he's like, well, that wasn't my neck and johnny is a classy guy. Overall over the length of his career, he sometimes gets heat. But who cares? Right? Like the opinion of the people shouldn't matter to Johnny Hendricks. But johnny said after he said, well, I was kinda hoping he'd come in trade a little more. It's like, why the fuck would he do that? That's not his style. And that's what you want. He wants to do what you don't want. The whole goal is to do something that benefits him in the scenario and does not benefit you, which would be exactly what he did.

Speaker 4:          01:07:46       Which is why what brings me back to the paul daley, john fitch fight like this is the answer to that style. The answer to that styles take you down and not ever let you get up and force john fitches game on you. Which is what makes fighting so interesting. If john fitch had just decided to go cowboy and bite down his mouthpiece and just wing punches. At paul daily, until one of them went to sleep, that would have been a great fight for paul dalian. Great childhood.

Speaker 1:          01:08:13       Um, when nick diaz, paul daley did that

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       mean that was pretty amazing and that only happens again. You're creating a moment and it only happenS because nick was motivated by who he is in that moment. He wasn't motivated by stRategy even necessarily. He's like, fuck you, fuck you. And, and, and that. However, people will look at that. That is again, it is an expression of the individuality, the authentic truth of who nick diaz is. That's why. That's art [inaudible] art and fight. That's a fight. This was great and he got clipped a fight. But this year man, look at this. He just, he just kept the pace. He's just refusing. Yeah. Paul just got too tired too quick. He was, he was whinging big shots. And look at nick just. Oh, he got clipped his left hook you're talking about. Yeah. This is over. Okay. It's over there. We're done. No, nick won't be done.

Speaker 3:          01:09:10       Yeah. Well, I mean who knows? Maybe if paul's in better condition, but this is the end. The end is nick just gathering him. It's crazy that he beat his striking contest, but he did it with will. He was always a great boxer. But I mean, again, we're this, we're this a metaphor for life. Like you got to one of the greatest victories ever that that's the quintessential nick diaz fight to look at them. And there are people who don't like him. Uh, I love that guy too, because that what we're, what we're searching for, I think is we're trying to be authentically who we are. I think that's all we're doing. That's what nick diaz's, whatever the fuck you think he is, he is authentically nick diaz and w. And the metaphor to me is paul daley is a wall and you can, you can dig under it or you can go around it or you can trick somebody, gives you a rope or you can climb it or you can dissemble it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:08       And nick's like, fuck it. I'm going to go through it. I'm going to go through it. And there are many ways to choose to live your life and that's how nick diaz lifts his fucking life. And that's, that's beautiful. What sucks is that he hasn't fought in forever. I mean, he hasn't fought since the anderson silva fight. That's crazy. It's crazy that they suspended him for marijuana. When anderson silva tested positive for steroids in that fight and he got a shorter suspension. The nick. That's a reflection. That's a cultural leftover cultural reflection. That's also that nick refused to pay the fine because that's nick diaz being authentically nicholas. You're not getting that money from me, but you can admire that. Like some, some people will look at that and go do just pay it. It'll go this way. And he's like, no. Fundamentally who I am, I cannot do that. I will get negative consequences in my life, but I will be authentic to who I am. But nick is like 36 now, I think. How old is nick diaz? No. Thirty four. He's 34 now. So yeah. Oh dude. He, his first fight in ufc, I believe he was 20 when he fought Jeremy Jackson like way back in the day. He was 18, you

Speaker 2:          01:11:13       know, I mean he's been around man, you know, he's been a brown so he still like literally in his physical prime. And this is crazy considering the fact that I want to say the anderson silva fight was three years ago, somewhere around there. I would love to see him back in there again, you know, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:11:35       Let me to get what you want to do though. I don't know if he really, truly. That's what he wants to do. He'll, he'll find a way to do it. And if he doesn't know George George coming in, I'm, I asked george so my at work, they're like, hey, can you see what's up with george and this nate diaz? And I'm like, well ask. But. And I'll ask honestly as a friend and ed and he knows that I'm also employed by somebody who have a little conversation but, but I will never ever sacrifice a friendship or like a longterm relationship to like find something out. I don't cAre about, and I don't care about twitter, beef, sin, I don't care about the breaking news and all that, so it's not inteResting. It's not anything to do with my life, but I'll go ask george. so I asked george who we are friends we talked yesterday and uh, we will, he will tell me the truth and then, and something as simple as, oh, you know, not as fucking bullshit and maybe not in exactly those terms, but he would say, but when I asked him about it, he's like, no bro, I haven't signed nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:12:39       And the, I looked at that and like, oh my god, that's george tried to be deceptive. Like george would normally go ads bs, man, that's not happening. I know I haven't signed anything. Well I know they've offered him, but that was george who's shitty at being deceptive, trying to be deceptive. Like he. Yeah. So like you said, they've offered it to. They've offered it to him and by saying I haven't signed it means he's considering it.

Speaker 2:          01:13:00       I think he's considering it, but I think he's also considering khabib [inaudible]. And then there's always the great irish leprechaun, you know, I mean, I think those are the two big fights. The two big fights or could be at 1:55 or even one 70 gsp wants to winter of conor mcgregor versus could be not nate diaz insider drops bombshell and this is a May 19th, saturday. Oh yeah, I'm sure he wants that. But that fight would have to take place first and who the fuck knows when connor or be but fight afteRwards, if it's connor, it might be a decade later. I mean, who the fuck knows who that guy is going to do now when you give a guy like conor $100,000,000, you know what I mean? This is what happens. He's throwing dollars at bus windows and losing his fucking mind and Yeah, they come out of jamie that ufc inside of a shop.

Speaker 2:          01:13:48       Was It? Yeah, it was on his podcast. I did saw that. I just scrolled down. Ufc, brendan, brendan schaub as you fucking idiots. Some of secure inside or some. Well, I'm sure he does want that, but if they offer him a fat paycheck and they really should, if they want. Look, the ufc is in a weird position that they bought the company for $4,000,000,000. I don't know what it's worth, but I would guess it's probably not really worth $4,000,000,000. They have a giant monthly, not it's fucking huge. The monthly nut that they have to make caused them to fIre a hundred employees. I mean there's a lot going on and there's been some great fights and it's obviously still incredibly popular, but you want to make those big pay per view bucks. You need the big name stars. Gsp was always a big name. Star became even bigger when he came back and beat bisping and one by finish. You've got them in a rear naked choke and put them to sleep. I mean he's still a giant star. However, he hasn't fought in a while, vacated the title. It doesn't have the title anymore, so it's not as big of a deal to the public size when his sit though. It is, it is. People are dumb as shit, man.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       the funny thing to me is like I always feel like, and and I always feel like a lot of these mechanisms, title shots, rankings, belts, you know, twitter, beef. They weren't Intended to be there as a short term solution to give people a talking point until they saw how till they got deeply invested and connected. I think that was, but yet somehow these sort of extra outside distractions became the focus. Who the fuck cares? Who is the number eight guy and who cares if these guys are mad at each other on twitter and the belt itself is a mechanism for discussion. What matters is the fight and and I know that. It's like, yeah, but you're obsessed wIth fighting. Most people, if you show them what's really going on there and contextualize the fact that these two human beings who have dedicated their life and taking all of the knowledge in human history to put on the line in this moment of of severe intensity and consequence, you won't care as much about whether somebody has an interim title. You won't know

Speaker 2:          01:16:05       and it won't and you won't, but the average joe blow by a paper view once a year is going to care. Maybe. I mean that's the idea behind stripping tony ferguson. Yeah, I mean, why? Why, why, why takeaways? Interim title, let them keep the interim title. If you want to strip connor, just strip connor, strip connor and then tony's obviously going to go through surgery. tony didn't do anything wrong. He fell and hurt himself,

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       but I think at the root of it is the filicides isn't incorrect. Philosophical belief. So when I, if I talk to people at the ufc and I talked to them periodically and I'll discuss somethinG with them about, you know, and it's generally at different times been like, hey man, you can see the work that i'M doing and you can see people like it. Could I contribute something x or y? And then I'll mention, you know, they will then say, well, you know, you've got like a really unique way of approaching it. We think we got so many casual fans watching on, on fox or on these tv stations. So it's just such a casual audience and I think about it, it's like nobody questions at the. The percentage of people that are a casual fan that is watching anything is very close to zero, very close to zero because the casual, the not actively choosing what to watch is being on a netflix search or is someboDy put something on and I go in and see what the rock is cooking in this kitchen.

Speaker 1:          01:17:31       You Said, what's your dog's name and the gold dog marshall. I go see what fucking joe is feeding marshall. Nobody's watching something. They're not interested in ever in our society. We are all conscious constantly and consciously choosing what we consume at all times and if we're sitting there with our boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife and they're watching it were somewhere else, by feeding this nonexistent casual audience and really believing they exist despite all the evidence that there is no such thing, you are now giving less importance to the your actual audience who is ready to go deeper, ready to see something more meaningful, ready to be brought somewhere different. There was no casual audience of almost anything in our modern world.

Speaker 2:          01:18:15       I like what you're saying, but I disagree because people are watching and they don't know what the fuck they're watching. I've done it with people. I've, I've unfortunately watch fights over friends houses before because they happened to be there and then, you know, there'll be people sitting around watching a why doesn't he just do this? But they still chose to watch it. They still may pay attention. Yeah. But they made that choice barely paying attention and they don't know what the fuck they're watching. So a guy like you comes in talking about artistry and all this. They, I think you are great. I love your approach, but I think your approach in their eyes is a little bit too esoteric and complex and maybe it'd be balanced out better with someone like me. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:18:59       One hundred percent. And as a result, we're not over, especially the last sort of year or so, I've looked at it like, you know, trying to force something like I'm not, I'm not sort of happily saying that I would be, I would be in a relationship with you and accept what you are. I'm saying I think we should be in a relationship only I want to change you. And that's not right. That's right. Yes. I'm, I'm literally saying I'm not saying put a role here. Tell me what that role you need and I'll do it. I'm actually saying I think it should be different and that's why it's not a good fit. And that's why I say a one championship is a more logical fit for me because it's younger and it's in its evolution, but still growing.

Speaker 2:          01:19:42       I think I agree with you, but I think it goes back to the money because I think there's so much money involved in the use that they have to make money every month. I mean it's, they're in a tricky situation. It's like, like if you're a guy and you make 500 bucks a week and you really liked this car, god damn. The core of it is so nice. I really like it. Well, how much is the lease? The lease is a thousand dollars a month, but you only make $2,000 a month. Are you going to do that? Well, if I only pay 500 bucks a month in rent, I can kind of pull it off key. I guess you can, but you got to watch every penny and you got to be cautious and I think you could put yourself in these traps and then you have to like really micromanage everything you do.

Speaker 2:          01:20:20       Like we've got to make money but we've got to make money, but we got to make money instead of we got to do what we like and put together what we like and do the best possible version of what we like. Like a perfect example is like this podcast. I don't have a boss. There's no overhead. I don't have. I mean I have a couple of employees. It's very easy. There's no worries. So I don't give a fuck if I have you on to talk about stuff or a sleep expert or I'm not going to have anybody on that. I don't. I'm not interested in talking to because. And I'll talk about whatever the fuck I want to. I don't. I don't think, god, no. I don't know if people are going to be interest in this. I need that advertising money. I need to say if you.

Speaker 2:          01:21:03       Because of that. I think it's one of the reasons why the show has been successful because it honestly represents my thinking. It's like I'm allowed to pursue my interests and have these conversations and, and let it be pure. I think if the ufc took that exact approach, I think the product would be better. And I think if they had some, like you breaking down the artistry of specific techniques, the air quote casual fan would be more educated and they would learn more about it. I mean, and you get some of that from dominick cruz when he does his breakdowns on fox and some of the other fighters who do breakdowns. And when daniel cormier does wrestling breakdowns, breakdowns, specific techniques of whY they work and why they don't work and what someone's doing right or wrong, you get educated, you know, and I tried to do the best I can to when it comes to the ground and particularly, which is where I think is the most confusing aspect of mma for the casual fan. BuT, um, I think we should approach the, the entire sport in the, the, the most illuminating way possible. And I think a guy like you and your approach is very valuable. And I love your breakdowns. Thanks man. I'm a big fan of them, so I retweet them all the time. I just think that you have a very unique and passionate and it is not just a passionate approach, but it's genuine. My guy. No you, I've talked to you when the cameras are not on and you are just as interested in this.

Speaker 1:          01:22:28       I really am. And I think we're just going through. Thank you. By the way, man. I think we're going through whatever you're doing, if you're trying to seek some kind of mastery and if you realize you're really early in it, you can do it by studying yoga. Some people do, some people do it, they they are in, they go to church twice a week. You're just looking to try to grow and if you do it with something that you're deeply fascinated and eventually you kind of learn about connections and all things, you know, it's the study of martial arts or the study of yoga or the study of jazz or whatever teaches you about connections and all things and my life is so good and these little moments where I'm like, I don't know why these guys, I don't work for them. That doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 1:          01:23:10       It doesn't make any sense for me to think that because I get up in the morning and I sit in my. I make my wife and I coffee and I sit in my kitchen and I fucking analyze fighting. I sit down and I look at it and I look for moments and I look for things. I think people will find fascinating. I look for things that will teach us something about life and I look for these and I make them then what I make and people seem to like them and then that gets me jobs commentating where I fly off and I get to. I mean I got it so fucking good to try to square peg my way into a large corporation because years back I dreamed about working there. Sometimes you change your dream. Sometimes it's okay to change your route and find the world changes. Constantly

Speaker 4:          01:23:53       be afraid to be flexible and you know, the, the idea of holding onto a dream for your entire life despite your interest is pretty ridiculous. Yeah. I mean There's things that I wanted to do when I was young, but I don't want to do anymore. It doesn't, you know, you should follow your interest period. If they change, you're changing as you change and grow. I mean these, like I talked about my waning love or talk one doe when I realized that it wasn't really the right way to go. When I first started doing it, I thought it was the most effective martial art. Once I realized it wasn't. I lost interest. I lost interest in competing in it. I just. It didn't seem like the thing to do anymore and I think that as you grow as a human being, you're in. You should have oTher interests. I mean, and I think the ones that are the most intriguing in the most passionate or you're the, you're the most passionate of theirs, they're going to give you the most reward that if you pursue them, if you're more passionate about music than you are about accounting, but you decide to stick with accounting because it's what's paying your bills and like, man, that's a dark road. That's a soul sucking road. You're going to go,

Speaker 1:          01:25:00       damn. It feels scary in. For somebody in that setting to change. Just in the short run, it will be painful, but in the long run it will be so valuable and less painful. Twenty years have way less. PaIn is such a great trade for two years of pain,

Speaker 4:          01:25:17       but if you're that guy with that corvette that you've got that lease on and you could barely fucking make those payments, you can not take any chances. You have to just work those extra hours. Well, if I just put in two hours of overtime every day, that's still only 10 hours of work a day, but that was two hours at 20 bucks an hour and a little out and start doing those calculations. And that's how you, that's how you get fucked and that's how you get trapped. And next thIng you know, you've got a family and you've got kids and you definitely can't move and you got a mortgage and you definitely ain't pursued any music dreams. Now motherfucker, it's true. and this is, this is the trap that life leads.

Speaker 1:          01:25:50       Yeah. You know, um, I watched. So I do a one man show now. So I belt with a friend. I built a one man show. It's like a theater setting, right? Like, it's like, how do you do that? Do you use video for now? It is for, we put it for punchdrunk ted talks, right? So it's four story driven parts of life that uh, take you on a bit of an in theory and in practice so far people seem to be inspired or find it compelling and people have cried out of before, which was really quite moving. But I people just go to a dog day. They may be shut, especially. Yeah. Um, but, uh, I, I did it with, so I decided I wanted to do that. I decided I want to get up and tell stories and hopefully a fun and entertain people, find them and inspire them or take them somewhere.

Speaker 1:          01:26:41       And I did it partly I watched your show and then I would have never in a million years. So when I saw you in vegas would never in a million years thought I could do that because it's clearly a lifetime of training and development and improvement and trial and error and thousands and thousands of repetitions. And you look at that and you don't look at an olympic gymnast and say, I can do that. And that's kind of. So I didn't think of it at all, but then I saw brendan do his show and it was awesome and I realized he only started working on this two years ago, you know what I mean? And all he represents is hard, hard work, sacrifice and drive to learn. And that's possible.

Speaker 2:          01:27:18       Yeah. Which shop is doing is what I said to him as you are essentially using an athlete's work ethic and applying it to an art form. And that's what's awesome about it. He's a funny guy who realized like, I can do standup, I just need to put the time in and you know, I've seen that guy kill kill and he's been doing comedy for like two years, you know, that

Speaker 1:          01:27:40       is inspiring. That should, you should be aware when you see that, that that means something you work on for only a couple of years as possible if you're driven and smart and, and really committed. And that's what I took out of his shell. Plus he explained to me the process. So I decided I'm doing it right. So I booked about five months ahead in winnipeg because there was a ufc in winnipeg and that's my hometown to do a small theater and I'm like, okay, five months. And I'm like, what the fuck do I do? So I called up a good friend of mine, greg, when you booked a, you have a show. I didn't have the shell. Maybe force yourself. Yeah. So. And I cut but I had one plan that was going to call it my friend graham isadore who is a playwright and I'm a writer for vice and a bunch of other stuff and uh, and very smart and interesting and we're good friends but we have very different perspectives.

Speaker 1:          01:28:26       And I said I booked this show. It's in six months. I need 40 minutes. It's got to be. And he's, he has told some of my stories and vice before getting drunk with sumo wrestlers and different, different stories. And how much do you weigh? About 1:56. And you got drunk with sumo risks was scary. It was really like, it was joyous. It was. You've never seen anything like that became big though. Yeah. Oh, you should see it. So byamba, do you know who byamba is? He's like, okay, so if you ever see us sumal on tv that's beyond. So he's the guy like in the geico commercial dot being a figure skater, tiger woods of sumo wrestling and he is a genius. He's a world champion, but he's also an entertainer. So he lives in hollywood and he was very, very loose here. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:29:13       He Is a sumo wrestler. Yeah, there he is. Yeah, he is from Mongolia. But he spends a great deal of time here working as a television personality and an actor and whatever, but he still just look fat. Oh, he's got it looks jacked. Like go to that one where he's doing that. Muscle pows that are there. Yeah. Yeah. So that's like those shoulder muscles through all that fat. That guy looks like a tank. Well, people don't realize, but underneath there is like you or underneath eris like tj dillashaw. You know what I mean? There is a muscular person underneath all those additional layers of fat and flush and skin. There was, there's a powerful athlete, a real benefit and being that fat, uh, yeah, force, power generation like momentum, the ability, I mean if the other guy is that big and our goal is just to smash into each other until one of us has taken from the platform, you're not that big, it's going to be very difficult.

Speaker 1:          01:30:06       Right. So it's like An arms race of size over generations where they just got bigger and bigger out of necessity because if you're a bigger, I mean, what am I going to do? A, we could, in theory, maybe I could use your size against your. I could use technique and strategy and smarts to, to take you off, but I could be big and also to that. Right? Right. So why not v also big. So it good arms raced to that point and there are little guys but uh, but to watch this guy that's with them, I think he was an impractical jokers. But yeah, beyond that it's like he's the most famous sumo guy in the world and I got wasted with him at the world combat games and st petersburg, Russia. So I got to commentate it, right. So I was in saint petersburg and I absolutely love, I found a niche where I get to commentate like real traditional martial arts, a fair bit of done taekwondo and karate at the pan am games and I did the world so much championships or the world combat games.

Speaker 1:          01:31:07       I do the world championships which is kung fu and sanda. And so I've carved out this niche where I get called for these and, and develop expertise in these different areas and get to experience them and see the little details that change when you change something. And so I got to commentate sumo and then after he seemed to like me and he's kind of like you would drink, it must suck that mad. Like a fizzy drink vodka while you were in Russia to Russia. So I love Russia. I do. I really do. I love the russians. I love that. Our view of combat and of artists martial arts and stuff, they're very straight. Like you know when you negotiate to commentate or to do some work that just straight, this is what we can pay you. This is what we expect of you. If you do that, we're all going to be happy. Like it's very sinister story. Little bullshit.

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       Frank mir does commentary for them over there and he's very good. Frank mir, I would hope that someone would hire him in America.

Speaker 1:          01:32:08       They can't afford them because I was getting paid way too well in Russia in Russia. Really? No kidding. You had for him and he said that's why he couldn't do a deal with bella toi know and, and his deal with acb who he loves and respects and it's become sort of partners in there with, uh, with mr haas, who runs it, where frank is now a part partner of the presentation of it, went for american shows. He'll be part, he'll be part promoter and I think Frank May even get away from some of the commentary as much as he's good at it and loves it. I thiNk he's interested in some of the other aspects of it now, you know. But uh, yeah, they pay very well. They and they pay the athletes very, very well. You can be a guy that had a couple of ufc fIghts or a belt or fighter to. They'll give you 60,000 us cash in your hand in an envelope at the end of it, you know? Interesting. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:32:57       that's great. Well, it's always great that fighters have more options, you know, and I know bella tour has become a viable option to a lot of fighters, you know, like guys like ryan bader making good money over there now and, and you know, Roy Mcdonald obviously who's their champion now. I just think, uh, we need more of those. You know, I, I know that oscar de la hoya is getting into the mix now, but just the approach that he's making seems to me to be ridiculous

Speaker 1:          01:33:23       old school, promote us approach, get some big name and then invest all your time in that big fight. But It's, that's the same thing you were just talking about the ufc. The challenge they face now is that we need another big one. We need another big one. It just seems like that,

Speaker 4:          01:33:39       that approach. Like we just, we know, okay, if this wasn't the upper, would this be the ideal approach? No, it's never the ideal approach. The ideal approach is to do the best fights possible. The ideal approach is not necessarily to make the most money or to have the like the most spectacular. Like, like when they were really promoting ronda rousey and the rematch with or the fight with Amanda Nunez and didn't promote nunez at all. I was, I, you know, I was like, this is a huge ronda rousey fan. Everybody knows that too. Um, I think she's a, she's a legend. I mean what she did for women's mma, she essentially was the reason why the ufc decided to have women's mma was one woman

Speaker 1:          01:34:20       that woman fighting now I was here that day.

Speaker 4:          01:34:23       It just passed her By and it happened so quick. But Amanda Nunez, I was thinking even before holly holm beater, Amanda Nunez was the big threat. I'm like, that girl could knock you fucking dead with one punch. She is such a ruthless striker and she's a brazilian jujitsu black belt. I'm like, this is a terrible matchup for rhonda. I thought, yeah, because rhonda is hands, although good, you know, and getting better and you know, really we're starting to look like a polished striker still doesn't have nearly the kind of power that nunez has and the that I could nunez nunez is, she can take it as well as receive it. We had just seen rhonda sort of have these bullets moments with like betco hey, uh, you know, kind of cerebral manner than bricks just smashed through. But when You see the overall game like versus holly holm, then you got to see all this.

Speaker 4:          01:35:17       There's a lot oF limitations here and trying to smash through the bricks if the bricks aren't there and the bricks head kick, you know what I mean? There's, there's a lot going on there. So we're seeing the laYers upon layers upon layers. So what happens after you get to the first layer? Oh well you don't have a second layer. Your, this is your layer, your layers straightforward. Move ahead. And you know, coaching is to blame as well. There's a lot of things there, but the fact that they weren't even promoting Amanda Nunez, you have the very first ever openly gay women's mma champion. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:35:48       There's Interesting aspects and she's

Speaker 4:          01:35:50       fun girl. She's interesting and she's a fucking killer man. She's a fucking killer, and they showed it in that fight. They had an opportunity to make Another star instead. They didn't make this other star and then you look at her most recent paper view. I heard the numberS were abysmal. Bailey, I heard see if you could find out what the numbers were because someone told me, I think it was shop told me there were 85,000.

Speaker 1:          01:36:15       That's great. You should be, but at this point you have to stop and wonder is there anything we could do strategically different like just because something worked all the way along in any business or in anything you're doing, there might be a time to take a slightly different approach or to change one of the fundamental beliefs of how we do business or something. You know what I mean? what you can't do is just go, well, hopefully the next one will be good. I mean you watch that happen all the time to some massive change in your business or in life and that change at first. People deny that it's there, right? They deny and then they say it's a niche and then they say it's a blip and then by the time that it's actually in the heat of something scary or challenging happening, you've wasted two or three years that you could have used adapting to

Speaker 4:          01:37:02       ready for it. You know what I mean? No, I do know what you mean. Yeah. I mean, I think that what you gotta do when you have a champion that has spectacular results like Amanda Nunez, you've got to hype the shit up or invest, invest, hype the shit out of her and that would have made the ronda rousey fight. I think even bigger if you show her smashing misha tate, you show her, you know, smashing Sarah Mcmahon. You show what she's capable of. She's a fucking gun

Speaker 1:          01:37:28       for sure. For sure. I know you talked to Mike Brown or anyone there who's been around the greats and they talk about it, but this level now where they are the brilliance of where what we've seen, it's another example if you think that all only fighting to stand up when you're in guard is right or only keeping somebody down is the game and the only thing you have to worry about us, they'll stand up. They'll submit you. Like as soon as you don't recognize where you are in the change of the river of life and time, you sometimes get fucked up and and you know it's a. It's a fascinating thing. I know I literally was just in Singapore and I just spent days with this company, but they see the world differently. They're strategy is simply. There are. They're a values based company that believes in the values of these things and tries to to show people and share martial artists reef for the greater good and it's not some business.

Speaker 1:          01:38:24       It's what they truly believe. They truly are going about making choices. And when chattery says, I would not hire conor mcgregor because he represents, he's dead, fucking serious people see represent his ideas, his and what he sees. And I shouldn't speak for him at all. He's a brilliant man, by the way, this guy, he's a, he was a homeless kid with, with a single parent that later became educated and then move to America and went to harvard and then started managing a corporate funds and became a moitai champion. And this is all easily documented. This is who that individual is. And he's lived that life based on honor, respect, you know, um, teamwork excellence, that mind, that is what built that company. And one is a billion dollar company now it's a billion dollar company. It's in one point 7 billion homes in asia. This isn't some mythological idea. This is a guy who's built a massive company based around these values.

Speaker 1:          01:39:23       And that's a different thing. He's. But what does he say about common? Oh, sorry, yeah, I go off on this. No, it's cool. Uh, so he looks at it as the things that he says and the way that, and again, I shouldn't speak for him, this was the, what I've gathered, throwing things and creating conflict and controversy as your currency is not something to be proud of. It's an interesting way of putting it as your currency. Yeah, I get it. You know, and that sounds because, and I'm not quite all that although I've drank the koolaid, I believe in what they're doing and I see it as real, not only because my values line up with it, but I think they are going to grow dramatically as a result of some of these, the way they see the world, but not only that, but I'm still also immersed here and I like connor, I think of connor.

Speaker 1:          01:40:10       I work for tsn because connor fell out of a march to a red carpet to shake my hand while the, my boss was watching. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like the great. Some of the most interesting moments I've had are with that guy and some of the most interesting, you know, many dozens of hours of trying to figure out what's happening in research and growth has happened by studying that guy and I see his games that he is willing to play as part of his strategy for success as a fighter and success trying to be successful for his family and his future. I see it all connected so I don't dislike him. But I respect this, this idea that conflict and controversy are not good for us. I understand that. But I also understand

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       psychological warfare and I think the is a master of that and that has a huge factor in victory. I mean, this is something me and mo musashi use to his advantage. Um, you know, when you read the book of five rings, he, what connor's doing is fucking with people's heads to the point where they, he has space in their head and then conor goes into the cage, like loose as a goose, relaxed and calm. So he's letting you know, I don't give a fuck about you but you give a fuck about me and I'm going to fuck you up right now. And you're like, no, you're not. You better not. You can't. I can't. This is too much. And josie all was the perfect example, although was so out of composure a although charged at him would that just leaping left hook and just got fucking waylaid on the way in.

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       And eddie alvarez, The greatest game day performer, one of the great game day performance we've ever seen. and I talked to eddie. Eddie is one of my favorites and I admire and am inspired by eddie alvarez, Michael Chandler tail, you know, those two are like the same guy on last year almost. But eddie was like, the plan was to wrestle a lot and stay at distance and barely at all. And I stayed at a distance almost the whole time. Barely wrestling. Like he's just like, it was real like, and I am by not accepting it was real coming in and suddenly find yourself in there and it's real. And you feel different in your, you know, your mind is working differently and your hormones are working differently and who you are in that moment is different and you're like, holy fuck, it's real. Had I prepared for it to be real, I could be in a different state right now, but I denied that this was going to be real and now it's fucking real.

Speaker 2:          01:42:27       Santa claus is real. It's real. I also think he got clipped early on. I think that's a factor. You know, you get caught on the chin like that and your legs give out real quick and your just. Your brain doesn't work right. Your body doesn't work right anymore. I think that's a factor, the, the ability that connor has to land those sharp shots that come out of nowhere and blitz you and come at you so fast and just drop those shots on you. I mean his left hand is a fucking laser beam and planning it. That's what that is. The definition of it. He's so good at landing that shot and he's also good at landing a bunch of other shit too, man. I mean, he pick you apart. He's a, he's a real dynamo. I just, I hate to see things like what happened in New York and brooklyn and he threw the dolly at the bus and smashed the window.

Speaker 2:          01:43:15       It's like, so it's so fucking stupid. All that thug is shit running in with a bunch of other guys and everyone's screaming at will was what would, it could be due. He smacked your friend in the face because your friend was talking shit. So you know, I mean, and even the way smacked him was pretty gentle, you know what I mean? And artem called hIm a coward and he said, didn't he doesn't fight. Conor is a real fighter. Is like, listen man, he's a russian. your a russian. You guys got to sort this out on your own. That is how they saw it was a pretty calm sorting out in my opinion. They didn't stomp him, they didn't beat his ass. But once we get to that point, I mean I get

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       it. Yeah, once you're doing something and I'm responding, which he responds. That happens everyday in gangs and wars in northern Ireland and Ireland and all types of religions that's been going on forever. Nobody ever wins. When that happens, it just goes. It just perpetuates it and when you watch it and then there'll be a lot of people you see this scenario and like habib's fans or friends or supporters and condos and they're Like, he did this, he did this. They're both wrong and nobody. Everybody always, when soMebody does something bad to somebody else, they almost always feel like something was done bad to them. Very few people instigate that was perceived. Something happened to perceive a slight and you know, some people you do one thing to them and then they're like, okay, motherfucker, now it's to eternity. Well that doesn't make any sense either.

Speaker 1:          01:44:39       You know, you look like a fool, like, you know, you just can't throw a dolly at a bus. no. You know, filled with other fighters because it's so selfish. I mean, all those people that got caught, you know, I mean ray bore got cuts in his eyes. I mean this is the whole thing is a disaster. So my theory, based on bits of information that that we have, is that connor, on some level, it really, I mean it reinforces constantly. If your kid does something terrible that we know is bad and you gave them candy every time they're going to give her candy, every time she does something that reward conn has been rewarded. He gets richer, more famous, more influential, a belts, and he's been given candy every time he's done this. And it works. And I mean there is parallels in the political system in America.

Speaker 1:          01:45:30       There's parallels all oVer the world that by acting out in these strange ways, it's so bizarre and unsettling that we've rewarded, you know, the name for a Band, candy for bad behavior. Yeah, that'd be fun. But that's what's happening. Right? And so now we take it and he's. And then you add the strategy element you're talking about, right? So he's looking at it and it's like, okay, a b would be a great fight. I'd like to fight in Russia. He likes challenges is just hard, but let's do it now. If I create some viral controversy, which I did with, with mala malignaggi, who is, have you. Do you know polly? I've only talked to him on twitter. Yeah, I don't know. I fucking love polly. I love them. I love math and I liked him as a dude. I really do. Um, uh, but uh, so he created that and it worked and it's like, okay, whether, how on what level he's strategizing this.

Speaker 1:          01:46:23       He's lIke, let's go do some pushing and shoving with habib in his guys. Some given the finger will be caught on cameras. What? Uh, what one thing we know about connor, he's always late, always late. He didn't plan to get there when they're on a bus. He planned to get there when they're in the hall, he planned to get their windows, a bunch of people around and security and it's easy to manage little push and little shove and a couple of cameras and all of a sudden his $5,000,000 payday, so $12,000,000 payday in Russia. And everybody's going crazy. It'll work. It's brilliant, but he's late. So he shows up there on the bus. Now the cameras are out and what's he gonna do? He's got to perform. He came there to perform it, came there to do a thing we showed up and now it. Now it goes sideways and that's the most likely scenario is that it was a, let's do it. It'll be. It'll feel right for us as, as defending our friend, but also it'll have some inherent value in the cameras come out and nobody will get hurt.

Speaker 4:          01:47:12       Well, I think you're probably right there. It's got to get. He's got a good point, but obviously it's a terrible thing to do and stupid. You know, there's, there's a way to manage that, but then people say, well, you know, now becomes like the wwe and you know, there's, there's people that love real fighting, that have a real hard time with these fake wwe style scenarios where you know that whether it's colby, covington, you know, like he did a promo recently. We had a, a girl bY the pool and the girl sat in his lap and she was like obviously had a plan script and it seemed kind of corny people. There's people who think that's great and there's people fucking hate it.

Speaker 1:          01:47:56       I'm the heyday.

Speaker 4:          01:47:57       Yeah. I'm the hated too. I don't know. I mean, I don't have a real problem with pro wrestling. I joke around about it all the time and I get the fact that people like it. I don't like that kind of shit bleeding into mma. I think it's dumb

Speaker 1:          01:48:08       bad. It's also, I mean, again, if you're viewing it as inspiring artistry with which there are lessons to fucking live your life on one hand and on and that's how I truly see it and interface with it and experience it and, and share it and, and want to see people get to feel that and then on the other hand you're putting together these weird scripts to sell pay per views, but wrestling, that stuff that came up in wrestling because it isn't inherently real needed. Those extras. it needed all that stuff. If we understood how brilliant colbY covington was, if we understood how brilliant of a combat sportsman he was, he wouldn't have to do that. But he's doing that and that's what got him a title shot. right? So on the other side, the other side of the coin, we're wrong. You want know if we understood he would get it based on that, but we don't understand.

Speaker 1:          01:49:01       We, we, the royal, we don't get it. It's like I'll see people talk about fighting after and they'll be like there and some people's. This is their idea of covering a fight and our fans or people and everybody's entitled to their own thing, but they'll be like, yeah, the show is kind of a lackluster fair. Not a lot of finishes. Fuck in your head. 20 brilliant athletes have interact in some of your opinion of how it did or didn't excite you is super valid to you. But that's not what we were watching. But what I'm talking about is like what got them a title shot? My title shot is being an asshole because of the reality that we live in. That's what he had to do. Right? Right.

Speaker 4:          01:49:37       I mean like what he did in Brazil after he beat damien, maia said this is a shit hole. That's literally what got in the title shot mean if you really stop and think about it. He's ranked, what is he ranked number three? He's only beaten maya. I mean he's beaten some other people, but it terms of top 10 contenders in terms of like real world class fighters. There's a lot of guys that are out there that have fucked up a lot of other people like wonder wonderboy was like, how is this guy fighting for the title, for an interim title and I'm not. After he's gone through those two big fights with tyron woodley, beaten jorge mas, vidar beaten all these debate and Johnny Hendricks beaten all these different fighters. Colby beat damien maia and that's the really the big name on his resume and. But it's also because he's going to be fighting hartfield oh, who is a brazilian? He said a lot of stupid shit about Brazil. Brazilians. Hayden. Brazil is a giant market. It's an easy sell and this is. This is what he's talked himself into and it's a tough fight. Don't make no mistake about it. The guy that beat damien maia is a tough fucking fighter. Colby.

Speaker 1:          01:50:33       Tough. And again, you talked to dean thomas or Mike Brown and they two years back when they were taught and I would. I'm a jorge mosfet all freak, right? That, that's one of those special artists to me. And so I'll be asking, you know, when I'll see mike or dean or these guys or anybody around that. I'm like, hey, how's, how's jorge doing? What's he working on? What is he changes and they'll talk and he's always traded with colby. He's, he's deadly. He's one of the greats in the gym. He, the two of them are first there last to leave, like you've heard about how good he was under that public surface and I, but I see what you're saying, the based on what we've created, he doesn't have much of a choice if he wants to achieve his goals other than doing it this way and the guys who are good at it, jail, obviously the tail is really good at one of the greatest entertainer.

Speaker 1:          01:51:24       And don'T you love kale? I love to fucking love child. And yet, this is something I find distasteful about this art form, is that game. Yet somehow child is so lovable. I love child, right? But it's because there's a natural love of that kind of performance. And colby and I've, I've played around with it a little bit when I played in a band where you would be rude and arrogant and play that kind of game. It's not. It's hard. it's hard. It's hard to do. It's hard when it's hard to be convincing. It's also hard to behave it all the time. That's real. Like you. You will feel the hatred of all brazilians who truly hate you even though you're playing a game. Getting real about that shit.

Speaker 4:          01:52:08       Zillions are extremely patriotic, very nationalistic. You talk shit about Brazil. You better duck.

Speaker 1:          01:52:15       Yeah. And in fact, even if you were talk to somebody like a stereotypical he passionate person we're talking about here, and you said it's a joke and they'd be like, you can't make that joke. Right? Like at their point isn't that I don't care if he was kidding. The fact that he was willing to do that is so disrespectful to all of us that we must slit his throat and that's what they'll chant when he goes to walk out there and they mean it. They do mean it, but meanwhile

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       he just doubled down. He didn't give a fuck even after get hit in the head with the boomerang still doubling down, swinging for the fences. What other choice? I guess. Well look, it has got him to the dance and if he wins two saturdays from this one or one saturday, how's it going? Next? One is tail and wonderboy. Yeah, that's another one to talk. But if he wins, if he wins, he will have a belt. I mean, it's not the real belt. I mean it's an interim belt, but it guarantees him a shot at the real belt. yeah. No. so it gets very interesting. So like I, I know that I my look at these sort of systems and the areas around it, I have a negative bias. Like, you know, it's not about that and I know that's that's negative to me about the belt or the rankings or the beefs or whatever, but the belt cannot mean what it meant before.

Speaker 3:          01:53:43       By the nature of once upon a time there were only ever 27 of them and now there has been 340 of them. By nature it cannot be as valuable as it once was and when there's two in yours, it inherently cannot have the value because scarcity is where value comes from. Yeah. It's really just a promotional tool. It's a marketing tool and it's a. It's a questionable one. You know, there's, there's a real good argument that it's a bad idea to have these interim title shots because you know, like, okay, well what's the rules? You just decide when to have an interim shot, especially with a guy like tony ferguson, right? He beats Kevin Lee spectacular five triangles and off to nobody after that last one. One the interim title, and then you strip it because he falls down during a promotion. He trips on some wires.

Speaker 3:          01:54:28       I mean, this isn't, I mean, it's not like he went and did something stupid outside of fighting. He was just doing promotion and tripped on some wires, so freak accident and that really, if we move away all other things and just look at the systems at play and how and why it's there. If he was, if he had another 2 million instagram followers, that would not happen. You're right. And that's it. You're right. It's strictly that. That is true, right? Yeah. It was a giant, huge star. There's no way they would strip him. No. Yeah, no. And, but by not being, because he's a character, he's, he's an oddball. He is a unique. He's one of a kind. We should celebrate that. He's one of a kind. He's an individual. He's different than everybody that's a sale. If you're going to strip connor, which they did, and you have khabib fight for the title, the true title and, you know, look, that's arguable whether or not you should do that as you'd probably be two interim fights are transgender, um, titles, which will be cool. He's not beating the champion if he didn't beat the champion, he beat out quinta. How is him beating out? I quinta more valid than tony beating Kevin Lee. That's crazy. It isn't. It's crazy. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, not taking anything away against albert. Al took that fight on unfucking one day's notice. Yeah. So it's even more ridiculous and awesome. yeah, and that was a great fight too. It was

Speaker 1:          01:55:43       really fun. Yeah. Well there's, there's a puncher. Yeah. It was really fun and I like la quinta is another one of these guys. How can you not be inspired seeing a guy like life is traveling along and all of a sudden you have this one shot at something. You're not ready. You're don't have. You haven't prepared in the ways you want, but you know what I'm going to go for. That's a life lesson. And there's also like I. There's a forgiving nature to this machine that is kind of admirable. Like alice created problems. Al has had conflict with that company and then they were still like, you know what? Let's do this.

Speaker 2:          01:56:21       Did it though. They did it because they wouldn't, they wouldn't use paul felder the fucking athletic commission. That's ridiculous. Ridiculous. I mean all their wisdom, they decided that paul felder isn't ranked high enough like who

Speaker 1:          01:56:37       you don't know shit. Don't even know where rankings come from, which is a bunch of people like hanging out who kind of watched, fighting a bunch of, making an arbitrary choice and then combining it like, do you know what, um, what a first class noticer is? Have you ever heard this term? So a first class noticer in business or any number of things. as somebody who over times you start to see the different systems and how they interact with each other and you are one, you clearly are a first class noticer, you see big picture, small picture combined. How the outside right now you're like, well, the, the commission did this, but paul felter did that. Rankings are this way and you're able to pull all these things together and look at it. Right? And if you look at any of these things from that perspectiVe of how the systems all work, the whole thing barely makes sense. You know what I mean? Paul felder is brilliant if it needs a dangerous one, 55, including khabib and committed and mentally strong and a striver

Speaker 2:          01:57:35       world class striker and his striking his fucking deadly and he's not just a striker in terms of punching like al. He's a really nasty kicker. I now can kick. Yeah, no doubt about it. But paul was a bit more achieved in, in his, uh, he's got more weapons, more complex, spinning back fists and elbows and knees and nasty leg kicks and you know, went three hard rounds with barboza. Went toe to toe with them. I mean, he's that good. He's that good on it

Speaker 1:          01:58:02       and smart he is. He's a great analyst for such a young one. But when you look, so you're like, how is that possible? Because that's really hard and it's a different skill set than just being a good fighter. This language and being able to rationalize things and all, all these different things. But you look back and he did it on the small leaks, which he didn't need to do. He pursued because it was of interest to him. He pursued it to get good at it because he loved it, which means he's predisposed to thinking that way. So now you also have a thinker, a fighter, incredibly dangerous striker, a guy who can play complex games in it, and you in your infinite wisdom, don't think he can fight habib because somebody somewhere said that he put a seven next to his name instead of a three

Speaker 2:          01:58:47       real real problems with the athletic commission and we won't go into depth. I don't want to cause any problems. But uh, they, they had some real issues. they're young, they're new. Yeah. there's a lot of nonsense that was going on behind the scenes. But I think that what was interesting about that fight was we got to see al step up. We got to see khabib have some issues with striking and you know, we got to see. I mean, what, what I don't like about it is this whole the whole championship thing. What I don't like about this, he didn't beat the champion to become a champion. They just sort of like set this, fight up our. And preparing for that fight, he was preparing for a three round fight and then tony gets stripped all those things.

Speaker 1:          01:59:30       Yeah. It. because they don't make any sense. Yeah. They don't really make any sense because if we go back to the. if we have some kind of value root of what we're about other than the necessity to to sell things based on the same marketing that we used, we wouldn't have to be in that situation, but we find ourselves there and when you're on, when you're on the bottom of half guard, you just have to work your way on a half guard and that's what that machine has to do. And that's what habib has to do. And that's got an artificial standup. yeah, exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 2:          02:00:02       Got stood up. Exactly. Yeah. I dunno. I dunno. Wonderboy until man, that's a big fire. That's this saturday. That's fucking. That's chaos stuff. Fight is very interesting to me. I am very, very, very interested in that fight. Me too. Yeah. I want to see what happens when till fights. Wonderboy, because I was stunned by how easily till ran through cowboy and cowboy in all fairness is not, in my opinion, a real one 70. He's a tweener. I think cowboy would be a one 65, you know, and I think maybe his struggles to make 1:55 maybe you should be 10 pounds heavier and I think that 10 pound weight class thing is real. I think that's where it should be every 10 pounds. Darren till is a fucking huge guy. So steve, yeah, they're both very tall and strong, but till you know, gregory's well over 100. Well over 200 pounds. He's walking around like um, you know, fucking two. Oh, five and shit. And cutting down to one 70. It's a good one man. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:01:05       it's a really, you know, there's so many little odd ball variables and unknowns, right? Like we literally when we go and we look at these, the more you've studied and analyzed and commutative fighting for 20 years of your life, the more you realize how little we actually know, like we have about two or seven or 18 percent of the actual information. You know what I mean, and we're trying to work with it and the big one. So when, when cody fought tgr, I'm dominic, I was like, I just don't see how he can win. I don't see how cody can win. And then somebody say, well, why'd he say that? He knocked out all these guys. I'm like, well yeah, it's hard to get to dominic and we've never seen evidence of him doing well after those minutes. The evidence isn't there to see it. Of course 100 percent wrong but there.

Speaker 1:          02:01:53       But you have to go by what evidence you have, what have we seen or what information that we gathered that can allow us to make this decision to me. Cody garbrandt did not have. There was no evidence he can be dominant and then boom, he beats up dominic and you're blown away. And that's an exciting feeling. And that is, I think what's at play here. Is there any evidence that that darren till can do what rory macdonald couldn't do and jorge mass fidel couldn't do and get to a guy who has that movement, that blitz thinking that karate's a, those karate instincts we were talking about. We've seen no real evidence of that, but that doesn't mean he can't do it. It doesn't mean he can't do it, but the evidence isn't there. I don't know about that. I was stunned by his ability to close the distance on cowboy, that nasty left elbow that he learned it over the top.

Speaker 1:          02:02:40       The way he put them away. I don't know. I think that's pretty good evidence that he's a fucking monster. I agree. And his fights previous in the ufc as well, although they didn't have a lot of fanfare behind them. Stunning results. And then you talked to people that know him, you know, talk to people that know his striking aquaman and people that have seen him in the gym and understand what he's been through in his life. And he's a young guy. I thInk he's only 25. How old darren till? I'm pretty sure he's 25. Celso, never lost, never so fuckIng pissed man. Yeah, and then you see the pictures. Even that 25 years old. That's wild man and but what I'm saying is I would have, I would not be the slightest bit surprised if he could do it because we've seen enough over time to know that what a 23 year old is capable of, they'll see the whole game differently.

Speaker 1:          02:03:27       They'll see their understanding of where they are in relation to the other guy is so different that it just on one day, all of a sudden all of these 25 year olds are just so fucking good and we don't really have the language to explain why. You know, can we just say, oh, he was able to close the distance on Stephen Thompson. IF he does will say yes, but then the question will be how when nobody else could do it, how and why could he do it? And that's always what obsesses me. If you see him do it, there is now the explanation isn't he was better at closing the distance or his range management was excellent dot. That's true for a bit. But then my next question, the next morning will be like, how the fuck did he do it? What? What changed now? What about the entirety of the game itself? The systems of the relationships have two fighters. What changed in such a way because of his behavior and that's where it gets to me really, really wild because right now nobody gets to Stephen Thompson and I mean nobody really at all. Tyrone is knocked down twice about them really badly. Just 50 minutes, 15 minutes. The fight. Those are the moments in the fight where they engaged. See, the problem with those two tyron woodley fights is what they fought

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       wonderboy the right way. That's how you got to fIght them. You don't engage and when you do engage, you got to be absolutely convinced you're going to land. And tyron did and did land and hurt them. I mean you looked at those two fights. Tyron is the one who's the wrestler, but he's also the one that hurt wonderboy. Wonderboy never heard tyron and those fights. Nope. Tyron had him very close to being out. and I just wonder if wonderboy is starting to slip, you know, you've got to wonder, you gotta wonder if all his years of combat sports, all of his years of kickboxing. I mean you to remember this guy is one of the most spectacular kickboxing records ever. I mean, what is it like $57 or something like that? Kickboxing. And then he gets into mma and you know, he loses to matt brown, he gets kind of beat up on the ground, comes back, has some really good fights and you know, it's been in there with world class fighters and beaten some world class fighters. But he's also, I want to say he's 34, 35

Speaker 1:          02:05:32       and that was a lot of fights. although we didn't get until recently until those three examples, he ever really get hit all that much. But it's still the where Stephen Thompson

Speaker 2:          02:05:41       find out how wonderful is. That might even be thirtY five. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:05:44       The hips and the knees and the shoulders and that whole 5:35. But. And there's also that what he. I mean he developed mastery in what he does. And once you've developed that elite, elite top level of reached your highest potential, it's hard to keep going. And then the masses start to close that distance though the, the general young kid start, you know, a kid at tristar, like some of the young guys, they have that and they've had thompson in there for years and for us has been able to study people like that up close and they all studied leonardo. Now the young guy can do a lot of those things at a much higher level than fighters that came before them. So your level of mastery starts, you plateau to a point that it's hard to go beyond. It's really hard work and sometimes it requires you to get a little shittier for a bit too to go past that plateau to weaken or get worse by having to reexamine what you believe and the way that you train or the way that you fight to break through a plateau.

Speaker 1:          02:06:46       You've got to kind of be willing to go backwards a bit. And when you're fighting tyron woodley's of the world, you cannot go backwards. So it's kind of kind of stalls you there. So, but ultimately the big question also is, is there some other strategy that hasn't yet been done that is a Stephen Thompson beater and that loW leg kick you talked about may so I cannot get to you. So what would I prefer when I'm fighting Stephen Thompson body lock, if I can get to the body lock cover up and down to get to a body. Like I got to touch him, that's really hard. He stops me from doIng that or I got to hit them or kick them. But when I do that he moves away and hits. What if I can just get to the edge of his sort of bubble of, of, of hot, that hot range where he can hurt you and maybe that low leg kick is a part of that. Maybe that low leg kick, just getting on the outside of it where you're still somewhat safe, but you can smash him up a little bit. Maybe those with a weapon that hasn't been used.

Speaker 2:          02:07:40       Well it's. This is also arguably the best striker that wonder boys ever faced in mma. Arguably right, I mean moskva dolls, very talented striker as well, but wonderboy is a master of that front leg in that front leg is a real tricky one because that karate style that he uses, he keeps his hands down low. He stands totally sideways on you and you've got to get past that front leg side kick and johnny couldn't get past it. hendrix got lit up by that front leg, side kick and then front roundhouse kick to the face right afterwards. It's just there's a lot going on with that front leg if you're not used to that, and then if you. If you get too obsessed with it, the backlash comes. Yeah, till is a way better way better. Master of distance. He understands distance and straight and he knows how to close that distance with explosive power. Very interesting.

Speaker 1:          02:08:30       Just before he fought cowboy, his successes were fighting at distance and smashing guys who came in, so he does do that. He does. By doing it, you understand it on a different level. You connect to it.

Speaker 2:          02:08:44       It is tie way, whereas wonderboy doesn't across way and wonderboy is fantastic at moving his waist back and forth like a snake and jumped on it. He's really good at that too. Yes. Tony ferguson's really fucking good at that. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:58       And that. So when I get to go study sunda and kung fu and woo shu, there are some of my friends are like, well, you know, like enjoy it. I'm like, nah, there's going to be some brilliant shit to learn over here. This and some of that long fist stuff like people will often say, well kung fu is not super relevant. Some of that long fist reaching where I move my body through space to reach you, which people would say is dangerous. You get countered while I check the answer is don't get countered. The answer isn't discard a valuable weapons and so you see some of that. Tony does that stuff really, really, really a lot of really cool. He does some work with the. That's cool man. Yeah. He doesn't love roast wing chung too. When I'm sitting in your guard wanting to beat you up, tell me that. Isn't wing chung just were attached. That's what that is. That's what that is, right?

Speaker 2:          02:09:45       I mean there's techniques in every single art that are established. Realistic art that are valuable, you know, and there's, there's gotta be something in wing chung the people are missing for sure. For sure. For sure.

Speaker 1:          02:09:57       Sarah, I mean art like that. People would look at and mike discard because they would think they're limited to only this scenario. Well that scenario happens. I'm in your garden, I want to fight. We are. That's that scenario. So that thing may not be useful to fight, you know, frank mir. But that thing will be useful in a context when you're fighting.

Speaker 2:          02:10:19       Well, how about jon jones is use of you grab his wrist and he comes over the top of the elbow that is hand tramping. Yeah, for sure. I mean it really is what it is. Or when he leveraged his sherif oh yeah, that's limb structure. That's old school structure. How and

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       why that hasn't been rabid hall a lot more. Although you do start to see that that moment where were, you know, I get to all four, I get to four points that I'm going to stand up and you just kind of decide, okay, that's all right. We'll get back to the fence in that process of standing up. A loT of guys throw a fight finishing kick there or just at least take that chance to smash your leg with one. Like if there's free shots that exist in these moments and jon jones is a master of finding them. It really is. Yeah. I hope they figure out what the fuck they're going to do with him soon. I don't know where they stand now in terms of his suspension or what have you, but here's my ultimate goal, my hope, my dream is that cormier fight for the heavyweight title and somewhere around then they announced when jon jones, the suspension is up, they announced John Jones versus brock lesnar.

Speaker 3:          02:11:28       Love it. I love that. I just, I mean, look at their body types and look at what they are and whether they come from. I mean, I love it, but I know you've sat down with john and stuff, but what did you like? What did he feel like? You know what I mean? Like what? What reed did you get from him? Did you feel like he was saying the things that he thought you wanted to hear or did you feel he was being honest and genuine? Definitely both being honest and he's also had some things that he planned out. I like john a lot. I really love that guy, but I think he surrounds himself with a bunch of knuckleheads. I Think he's, he's around too many people that are a bad influence and I think he's, he's a wild man and I think when he's a wild man around other people that are sort of indulging that stuff with them.

Speaker 3:          02:12:15       This is the word that I get, not just from what I know, but from the people that know him very well is that he just around the wrong people. You know, he's got bad influences and I mean if you can identify that then you must change it. Yeah, it's not, it's not to take any personal responsibility away from him either because I'm sure he also makes for a bad influence to them. Know the fucking baddest man on the planet can live like this. I'll live like this to fuck it. Let's do more coke and know let's party harder. Let's drive fast. Let's go drunk. Um, I don't know, you know, I don't know what the answer is. We're a guy like john, you know, I really don't know. I mean it's a, he's got to have that come to jesus moment. Yeah. Or not. You know, maybe he just keeps doing what he's doing and keeps beating everybody's ass and people keep forgiving them and hopefully it doesn't wind up in jail.

Speaker 3:          02:13:04       BuT you should for sure get a driver, you know, for sure. Get someone to fucking driving around. That's a bad. that's a good band aid, but it's not going to be the problem solver. Yeah. The truth is I think, I mean we get to live the life that we want, like we get to choose the things that we do, like we have free to a certain extent to a certain extent. I know free will is something that's been discussed and it's a fascinating concept, but to some degree, you know, we are offering our own lives,

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       you know, and if it isn't going the way that you want it, small tiny changes can push it a different way.

Speaker 4:          02:13:38       Yeah. It's a matter of whether or not he's willing to make those changes. And you know, right now I'm sure he just wants to get his license back, you know, but like when I see him like having these battles back and forth with chuck ladell online, like bark away from that. Like chuck liddell's and old warrior who's clearly taken too many shots like and you know, this calling him an old man and saying all this stuff and it's like just be the better man and this situation. You're, you're the top of the heap right now at the top of your game. You don't want some young guy doIng this to you 15 years from now talking to you that way. I mean this is, these are the dark days,

Speaker 1:          02:14:21       but when we turn the tv on, I don't care if you watch cnn or fox or cnbc or whatever or the nfl or hockey or fighting or whatever. A lot of what we see is a bunch of heads who somebody has said you choose different sides or they know that's what they should do and then they just argue, yeah, we watch it. We're taught it. We see it every single day, all the time.

Speaker 4:          02:14:42       Crazy. It drives me crazy and fighting the sports guy talk I. That drives me nuts when it comes to fighting because they have this sort of robotic predetermined pattern of behavior that they apply to football and baseball and and I just feel like fighting is more personal, more intimate. There's more on the line. There's more at stake. It means more to me and when I see that dopey sports guide jock talk applied to fighting, it makes me angry.

Speaker 1:          02:15:13       It makes me angry too, but it for for different reasons as well. One is this, this doesn't apply exactly as you said, and the other one is the city of and apply to football or anything because it's ritualistic like it act as if the show doesn't exist, if that's the reason it looks. So we were talkIng about how things meanings change once upon a time. That was a professional speaker. Now that is a rehearsed over, strategized, constructed artificial speaker and in a world where someone watches the fucking joe rogan podcast or goes on and sees dwayne training guys or watches a supermodel on instagram or sees what the rock has cooking. Like I said, we see real people everywhere, so now this becomes ritualistic and artificial.

Speaker 4:          02:15:57       It's a strip club dj to hey, come into the top stage. It's like that predetermined sort of pattern of behavior. The they adopt this pattern and you know there's a lot of people that adopt that sports guy pattern and there's a lot of shitty writers that do it too. They apply that insulting style of Writing to combat sports and some of them have never been inside a cage and the fucking life and apparel even trained. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:16:24       no it, it's, if you, if you have not been kicked

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       in the fucking head in front of your mother, you have no right to criticize me. Fight my fucking god. Oh god. I got. I wouldn't want that pressure. So a couple of punches happening and I get caught in a guillotine and I'm thinking I'm okay and I'm driving my shoulder in and then I start to go out and I'm just. And I kind of hit them in the tap and I look up and my mom is right fucking there. She's right there. and my mom, my family is wonderful, right? Like I got the best wife that humans have ever had in my parents and her parents. I'm surrounded by great people and I know that my mother literally was looking at me like, I'm proud of you. You know, don't worry, this happens, but my memory has her going, well, she's probably just sad. Sure.

Speaker 3:          02:17:17       She's gonna shake shaker here. Yes, it was. Yeah. But if you haven't been through that, if you haven't experienced failure, if you haven't been carried out on a stretcher, whereas everybody booze you or felt victory or been terrifying, you cannot logically criticize them because you don't understand the thIng. If you haven't done it, if you have some respect for it, I'll respect you. Just just understand what they're going through. Like I don't think you necessarily have to have gone to war to be a war correspondent, to understand it, to talk about it. You don't have to have shot someone to be able to understand what people are going through or at least try to comprehend it, but have some respect about it. There's a way to criticize technique and movement without being insulting. And I think this is a part of the problem with this.

Speaker 3:          02:18:03       The sports guy attitude isn't insulting attitude. It's a judgmental one that's judgmental and mocking and I think they played johnny lunchbox. I think they play to dumb dumbs and I just. It really hurts my feelings when I see that sort of strategy applied to covering mixed martial arts. Yeah, and like I said, it acts as if as less and less people consume this older but valid interface television, less and less and more and more are consuming other things that are different and new and and stuff. It's bizarre that the old one starts to say, yeah, well we still do it this way. Right? You can't do it that way because people now it looks weird and old now it looks as context has changed because we have seen thousands. We've seen Michael Chandler eight today and how he held his son and this guy is saying, well, you know, well, the striker versus grappler like, and it's just. They haven't evolved. They, yeah, you have to step in and this applies to us all. You have to step in and look at where you are and what it's meaning is and realize, oh, technology changed. The audience changed. The world changed. My life changed. The economy, changed the market. All of these things have changed. I'm still the same. I've met. I'm a dinosaur. That doesn't make sense. I can't do that. I must change, but the reason sports, television, the nfl or

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       many of these things, news doesn't is it starts out that there are innovators, so in fighting it was dana white and the fertittas and you guys and this vital young innovative creators and then as it grows, you need organized thinkers. You need people who can organize and structure something so that can grow. The problem is they get really good at structuring hierarchies to get really good at structuring business in such a way that they are then in charge and then when it changes, you need those creatives again, but the but these structure guys are there and they've built these formulas that they are then bound by where it's like, well, of course we're going starting with the opening shot and then we're gonna go. We're right here in Brazil, shot of christ the redeemer, and then we'll go and here we've got an unbelievable matchup with the winner gets a title shot. Those are rituals was a bizarre formulaic rituals created when they mattered and that we're valuable by highly intelligent people that that, that, that we're required to make this work. But now you meet different people, you need a different thought, you need crude the creatives back in and they usually don't want that.

Speaker 4:          02:20:33       Yeah. I think I like your point about different approaches and I think one of the best ways to maybe perhaps have a different approach is to have more intense coverage of training footage. Great. You know, and I think they're doing that with the embedded series of those online things. I'd like more people to check those out. I think if more people got an understanding of how much is involved in this, like when people get injured and pull out a fight, it's like some people will freak out and complained and write a bunch of stupid shit. Like I don't know what happened to mirko cro cop, but you can't say anything bad about him because he's a superhero. The guy, if that guy pulls out of a fight, you got to go, well, he obviously must be too hurt to fight and this is part of the game, you know, I mean, but I've read some ridiculous shit that people have said about mirko online. Like I went to canelo's page the other day, oh my god, this pictures of canelo alvarez and people are judging his body and st luke's tiny now and there's all these emojis of pills and needles all throughout his entire instagram post is fucking. The comments are ruthless. Just ruthlessly fucking insult

Speaker 1:          02:21:41       thing. I mean this is just the world we live in. It is. It is. I did a breakdown on vito and like you know, he'd go and instagram is, at least in my experience, is the least negative because it's the newest. What's the most negatively youtube. I agree. Yeah. Probably because it's the oldest, right? It's these elements because as things get older, a lot of negativity is a random positive. People leave positive. People leave because they go on there on the early part of the technological adoption lifecycle. Positive people are innovators and early adopters and they go onto the newer thing and then you leave behind the people who are negative and made the whole place go septic and then they argued with each other. I wonder.

Speaker 4:          02:22:23       I wonder if that's the case I want. I've never figured out

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       what is wrong with youtube comments, but there are so ruthless like whenever I have a liberal woman on in particular

Speaker 1:          02:22:35       who you have on with an open mind and are interested in their perspective.

Speaker 2:          02:22:38       Some of them are my friends like abby martin when she's on. I don't even fucking touch those comms or whitney when whitney cummings is on. I don't look at the comments period period. But if I did those would be the last ones that I would because they've looked at them before and like whitney contract with me and she's like, what

Speaker 1:          02:22:54       the fuck? And I was like, don't read that shit. It's like don't taste the poison that wherever the positive people are, if you're going to spend time. And I liked to because if 50,000 people watched me do a break down, that means a lot to me and if 60 of them commented, I'm going to. If I can schedule in the day 45 minutes, I'm going to take the time and think as many of them as I can, but only where the goodwill. I only where the positive ones are, not that I want to be reinforced that what I'm doing, but I'm not going to spend the time on people who are going through life so negative that I can't get through to them anyways. Somebody who's going through life looking for something and trying to to either be inspired or learn something or by positive. Those are the people that you should spend time with and it's also like the reverse of giving candy to your kid when they're bad. Don't go give those people candy when they're negative. You want them to get away from that. You want their lives to get better, which it will if they stop having that behavior. Yeah, maybe of

Speaker 2:          02:23:54       them are just so broken, but it's just like their structure is so poor. The structure of their thinking is so poor and you know, all a lot of them are shut ins and there's a lot of people with mental illness that are just constantly commenting. I mean, and then there's the argument to kill the comments, but then people get furious at you. We had an issue for a while and it was an accidental issue and the issue was during the stream we don't allow the live chat because it was always like con to your mother's a like our shit because people were just trying to get attention. If we read that stream while we were doing the show, the show would be inexorably altered, you know, you would you would. You'd be altered by like what? What? What are you saying? Don't say that like you would read it and then that would be the show.

Speaker 2:          02:24:43       The show would be these people as well. It's just not necessary or valuable because of the fact that we had the comments killed during the live feed. You couldn't. You couldn't chat during the live feed. When we would transfer it over to youtube, the comments would be disabled and people went crazy and I had a tweet about it, but look, I'm not disabling the comments. I don't know what this glitches, but they're going to figure it out. But she decided to disable his comments on purpose and do they fucking went crazy and they were attacking him. But what are the numbers that give a shit like who? Have you ever commented a youtube video? Have

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       you ever watched a youtube video and commented on it? I don't think I ever have. I never have either. I don't know anybody worth a fuck that has that. That's part of the problem is like I know there's some really positive comments and people who are healthy. People were just interested in debate and discussion about particular topics, but when you're dealing with all these negative people, like what are the numbers? If you have a million people watching a youtube video or are we talking about a 100 people? Is it even. I don't even think it's. It might not even be 100. You might be dealing with like 30 cousins and they're the ones that are going to be mad that you disable the comments, but is that really matter? And it is keeping the, that cesspool open, keeping that commode open for them to dump their fucking verbal diarrhea into. Is that really feeding the bay? Is that giving the kid candy for being an asshole? Is it the same

Speaker 1:          02:26:13       that maybe maybe I went, saw you a stand and talk to 600 people who came to a show. You had an in depth conversation, chem trails this and fucking fighting that with each of them in the eye. You spent for sure four hours when you took a bunch of friends out for dinner and invited me, which was really cool by the way. Thank you. I brag about it, all of that. Uh, and then I saw you walk across. That was four hours for sure. Okay. Two to four hours. I don't know the exact number. Then I see a walk across the casino and in that time you do it again for another half hour as you know joey diaz. Oh, you know. And then we sit down and somebody comes over. As soon as you sit down and they say, hey, can I go fuck off man, I'm meeting. That's the guy who will tell the world, joe rogan's an asshole. That guy say, fuck off. Come on man. I'm whenever I can't. You can't just stop your meal. Every time someone comes over 200 inter, like human deep interactions, meaningful interactions, that one can fuck off.

Speaker 4:          02:27:14       Well, I don't want to say fuck off. I just think that people have this distorted idea of space that they should just be able to invade your space while you literally have a mouthful of food. Yeah, and I mean, I've had it happen. I've had. It happened when I was feeding my daughter. Have her in my lap. He'll go get a selfie and you definitely can't get a selfie right now while I'm feeding my daughter. Get the fuck outta here, man.

Speaker 1:          02:27:34       That's a misunderstanding of, of space. Yeah, there it is. A strange thing. I mean, I didn't watch my wife was asking me because I was in Singapore. If I watched the um, the royal wedding, I'm like, nah, fuck to stand out at all. I don't understand the motivation for doing it. I, I don't even want to get it through. But those are still humans. Like those are still people. People don't understand that woman shit. She thought so this way here. You know what I mean? There are people. And can you imagine if the person who asks you why you're feeding your daughter? Somebody did that for maybe the first time. He'd be like, well, I can't believe it's good. Wants to selfie with me. But after that it will be. You're still living your human life. Yeah. I'm the only one you have just can't interrupt

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       people while they're sitting at dinner with their family or with their friends. They're sitting there cutting food up. It's just like they don't owe you that. Like can. You shouldn't ask for that. It's just not the way to do it. It's just not. And you gotta know when people can't stop, they just can't just say hi. Can you just say hi? No one can say hi. Everybody wants to dress up their facebook. Everyone needs that fucking selfie. It's just like we're. We're in a weird space with that stuff that, that whole social media shit. Because people want something from you that they get up. It's not just they're a fan and they want to say hi. They want something from you to make them look cooler. That. And it's like you, you can give them some currency. It's like you're a pokemon and they can pick you up and

Speaker 1:          02:29:03       get a point for. It's weird. Really weird. So I told you, I was saying, oh shit for breezy over doom got flat and he was just going to fight in Russia, I think against all neck. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's not happening. That's a wrap. That's a wrap on that. Well, he's 40 years old. I'm trying to compete in something that's a young man's game. That's the thing. It's like you can get mad, you can get outraged and that's a reasonable result, a reasonable response if you want. But if you rationalize, if you have empathy, it's like this guy still wants to do this thing that his body won't allow them to do. And so he's willing to bend the rules to attempt it. He failed and now he's going to have to pay the.

Speaker 2:          02:29:45       Yeah, it's a month after his knock out last volkov right? Volkov fuck yeah. Dangerous guys. Fucking dangerous. Big, long, tall knockout artists.

Speaker 1:          02:29:56       The heavyweight thing is a whole other thing.

Speaker 2:          02:29:59       The thing man. And when you get these seven footers that can kick ass like volkov, that's a fucking nightmare. What does he like? He's at least six. 11,

Speaker 1:          02:30:07       right? Scary. He sees a big guys bigger than, than redoing by a lot. So call it six, six, six, seven, somewhere in that range. Right? For dumas, let six, four. Somewhere around that. And when we ever met brett rogers, who's brett? Roger, roger, and now brett rogers fought a grim rogers. Yeah. Yeah. That guy. That's the biggest person I've ever. Really. Yeah, like I don't know what it was about his frame, but I was trying to interview and it's only six, nine or six, eight or something. But it was the physical frame of him and I was just like, it was so wild. A triple h and a restaurant one time. And I was like, whoa. Like giant dude. He's, he's big, big athletes like this. Like what? The force that they can generate like in god and that ability to, to create that type of power and impact. This is a crazy

Speaker 2:          02:30:57       picture of in Ghana standing next to a professional basketball player and a god who looks like a tiny person. So weird. It god who looks like I look what I stand next to him. Not quite as much contrast but pretty ridiculous, but there it is. Look at that.

Speaker 1:          02:31:11       it's fucking crazy. We just, there's, there's more always, but I have a chihuahua. Have a chihuahua and you have your dog. Put them beside each other and you're like, that can't be the same species. I know. It's weird. Right? Then humans are just like dogs in that way. You know, we vary. so wildly size. No, he listened to it. Let's wrap this up. Um, tell people where they can get your breakdowns, mma stuff. If you're from dublin, Ireland. I'm there doing my one man show. June 22nd. How often do you do in this? I'm doing this will be the fifth I think. And there was one practice, one sort of friends and family. I learned a lot from it then winnipeg than london, ontario and I did because I knew harmonic and now I've got some good friends there that would be supportive and that was good.

Speaker 1:          02:31:56       Then I sold out a little venue in toronto and went really, really well, and then now Ireland, so the 22nd in I'm in Ireland on my instagram page you can click through, but and john kevin was going to be my guest.
