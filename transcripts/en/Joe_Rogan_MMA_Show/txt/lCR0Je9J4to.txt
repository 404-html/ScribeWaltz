Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       here we go. In five, four, three,

Speaker 1:          00:00:04       two, one, boom.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Schilling and Daniel Straus. Fucking house Joe Shillings. Just fucking up my kick machine out there, man. That thing ain't read and write. I mean, I hope not. I really hurt my ego up. You are lightened up. Fuck her on fire. That thing is not. We got to get that recalibrate. It tells in here complaining about a sciatic pain and this hip and still kicked me in like what is going on? I hear most sweaty. Forget about sciatic pain. Daniel Straus. You've gone through some fucking pain. Dude, you are defying science and doctors and David telling you it was over.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       Tell everybody the whole story. Put this, bring this sucker up here at a story goes. I was out one night, buddy of mine was having trouble and needed somebody to go out. Welcome. So, uh, was around the city that night and um, after taking him home we were leaving the highway. Has it split off? I was coming around was like yeah, I was on a bike. So. And I had a passenger. So what was called eight, 26 is the highway as the splits off to 95. I was going around eight, 26. Now here's the tricky part. I don't really remember what's going on from there. So the men and the passenger, remember we were hit from either the side or from the back. Um, but coming around the bend boom, coming around, got pushed into the wall. I'll wake up under the, a guard rail, can't move, you know, nobody else is there and the car is gone.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       There was not really a witness there until like later pulling up behind us. So it fucked me up for awhile. I mean fuck me up right now. But, you know, uh, getting back to just what it is, the body's healing. And then. So what was the extent of your injuries? All right. So, uh, I had, um, in my c four, five and six, I had contusions on my spinal cord and half a mile on the left side of my spinal quarter was a pressure so bad that it shut down my whole nervous system, like all my body. So a mix up in my neck and then my middle of my back was just compressed a lot of the swelling and that's what, uh, caused a lot of the, you know, not being able to walk, not being able to feel the nervous problems. Never system that I have or the nervous, uh, issues that I had.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       So what did they do to fix it? I've been rehabbing a, they wanted to do surgery right away, but how many months ago was this? This was in December. This was September 17th. So, um, they wanted to do or they wanted to do a surgery immediately. You know what I'm trying to tell them, like, no, I'm, I'm trying to fight again, blah, blah, blah. What kind of surgery? Fusion. That's what they wanted to. They wanted to go in and take the, I think the, I want to say the three to the five or four to six or something, fuse that altogether, which obviously there's no rain that's. And it's a big spot. So a wasn't trying to have that looked up for. We looked for, you know, a couple of rehab places and eventually got hooked up with a place called a neural fit, three 60. So I've been rehabbing there since the accident and I mean it's weird in Europe, pembroke Pines, Florida, close to Miami, a great crew.

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       But yeah, they've been giving me back in the game. I've been a, I was doing that extensively every day for like two days a week, two hour or couple of hours a day, you know, two to three times a day. What kind of shit that they do for your neck? Uh, for more. For me, first we had to start with um, you know, just the um, the fine motor stuff, touching, feeling, you know, I had problems with my sensitivities. So like, you wake up onto the guard rail, you know, you guys don't remember what happened when you wake up in the hospital where they're telling you for. They got all of this stuff. They were like, oh, to walk. Could you feel, could you like how were you when you woke up for me? Um, when I woke up, boom. Yeah. So back to the store when I woke up, when I woke up, so I woke up and uh, you know, I had my helmet on but I couldn't move my legs.

Speaker 1:          00:04:17       My passenger had one over top. She had her hands so she wasn't like extremely, but she had went out to. So I couldn't really feel nothing because nothing. I was just telling him to get my helmet off and get my helmet off. Finally had a truck, had pulled up and seen that we were in an accident and they, what they shouldn't do, but pull me out and uh, yeah, because I was supposed to touch anybody, get me out of there, you know, I was freaking out. They pull me out from under it and uh, you know, going into the hospital, that whole, the scary part was, was knowing nothing was broke but not being able to feel nothing. Trying to wipe my face or trying to grab something and you just couldn't move my head in my head. I'm moving my leg, I move my arm, nothing's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:05:04       You know what I'm saying? So you're thinking you're paralyzed. I'm gone. It's a wrap like Paul Williams. Yeah. I'm just like, fuck. So I get to the hospital finally. Um, you know, they're trying to work on me and seeing the doctors. He's telling me, well, you know, because of my neck, it's unlikely that I'll be walking anytime soon. No, a couple of days, couple of weeks ago after that, you know, just banging. And in the meantime I'm trying to explain to them I'm an athlete. I know you see this. I've been through this type of incident before, you know, I grew up wrestling. I'm from Cincinnati, grew up wrestling, so I've had neck problems for fuck my whole life, you know what I mean? And uh, so I'm trying to explain to him like, you know, chill out. Just give me some time. Let me, let me work something out.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       I don't want to do the surgery right now. I really want to. They want you to do it in the hospital right there. Right. Then there was no other, you know, there's no other choice. You never gonna walk again. Do you want to go back to them right now and go, hey motherfucker, look, look who's walking around know, you know what I mean? And it's been like that majority of times in my career where I've done something, something's happening. Oh, you're not gonna be able to do this. You got me fucked up. Right. He's hitting pads with me at the gym yesterday. The guy sparring this happened in December. That's insane. It's just insane. It just makes me sick that they always want to cut you immediately when it comes to any kind of bulging disc issue. They want to get in there and it's hurtful to us because, you know, I understand they got a job to do, but do your job.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       Right. You know what I mean? Like they have one method, one method of surgery. So, um, but yeah, like I said, I was rehabbing that neural fit three, six d, which is a great physical therapy place down there in pembroke pines. And uh, you know, I've been getting back with me, strengthen my neck, which is small exercises. Like I said, I started with fine motor stuff where I had to work on a lot of balance stuff, you know, um, you ever fuck with that iron neck thing? You ever used that thing yet? No, I have not used out here. I'm trying if you want to mess around with it and he's fantastic. Fantastic. So you are six months out now. Six months out. When did you start walking again? It took me like, even now I'm still like trying to get the form right. But uh, it took me about three months because she was like read, learned how we learned how to tie her shoe in my hand.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       My Motor, like my hand wasn't moving his right. It wasn't working as good. It's just everything slowed down for me because of my spinal cord. So wow, you know, that is the most for me was the scariest part because I was everything so unsure, you know what I mean? The most recent MRI. When did you get, have you gotten a gv one? About a month and a half ago. And whenever you look good, it looks good. All the swelling went down. Um, the left side is clear, the only way I can explain it, there's two, there's two, two months, white lines and it gets blocked. You know what I'm saying? That's where the fluids coming down. My left side of my, on the fluid was being blocked. So now I'm having a clear line of fluid going down my spinal cord. Now it's just about healing, which, you know, I've been working.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       That's the part to get overcome the healing part, the neurological part and the nerves and all that part that goes with it. It's the body that can only. There's not too much that I can do to tell this other than, you know, eating right, all the simple shit, but it's the body that's telling. But it's crazy that you're sparring. Yeah, I do a lot of things. I shouldn't do your spine with friends, so you know, that everything's going to be cool. I mean, good trading partners. I was down at Henry who's h kickboxing was training down there. Um, so you know, I live in Fort Lauderdale, so you, that's, you know, working out with those guys, you know, no one's out there to hurt me or tried to get me hurt or injured. Everyone's had a lot of respect and love seeing me back. So I've never been in a situation where I'm trying to go super hard. Not yet, but I love to.

Speaker 3:          00:09:10       You can get, we can get it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       So when you hitting the bag or hitting pads, you feel like you have full strength?

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       No, no, no. And that's the thing that I'm, that I'm excited about. I'm a broken toward that is dying to be fixed, you know what I mean? Because I'm a brand new, you know, I can be fixed in any way. Like I'm relearning everything. I'm not, you know, it's not like I can't box, it's not like I can't wrestle, but it's now just relearning the, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       the mechanics of making your brain knows how to do it, but your body's got to relearn it. Exactly why?

Speaker 4:          00:09:44       And it's like the nerve, the nerve stuffs is on the right side of your body, right? It's like muscle memory coming back. Even yesterday I was holding pads from like, his job was a little weak and like his is a lifting of his foot or whatever the thing we're trying to do, but once as we are doing it, once he felt the right way to do it, then he could repeat it, you know what I mean? So it was a lot to do with it

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       and is big for me, man. I really want to be back in the cage by the end of this year. Really. You know what I mean? I want, wouldn't be fighting about an issue here and it's not impossible.

Speaker 2:          00:10:16       Well you got a great attitude man. This idea that you love it, that you're a broken toy and you got to rebuild it and fix it and it's exciting for sure. It gives you an opportunity to kinda start again.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       I mean that's been my whole life my whole life. So I'm just there again at this point in my career and unfortunately this had to happen for me to turn the corner and get focused in another way. But you know, it's just what it has to be,

Speaker 2:          00:10:42       but it's so exciting that you have this attitude that's the. That's the cool thing about it. It's like you're not, woe is me. You're like, Hey, I'm on a rebuild, but let me get right back in there. You must be so excited that you could just do everything again.

Speaker 1:          00:10:57       Yeah. You know what I mean? Like first was finding out what we're headed, making sure that Dick work

Speaker 3:          00:11:02       first, live on, always fuck off my back. So just making sure I could do shit, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       No, the first, first couple months was just brutal, you know, not being a. When I asked him to eat,

Speaker 2:          00:11:27       did it slowly start to come back where you got like some motion?

Speaker 1:          00:11:31       Well, I've had a lot of, I think it's stenosis, spinal stenosis for, for years, you know what I mean? Source. Do you do any decompression? I do a little bit here and there. Whenever I can get to the chiropractors I'm doing some or you know, it's like I said it's been bad for years.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       Have you seen that thing that you hook up to your neck and yet came from a doorway

Speaker 5:          00:11:55       stretch it? No,

Speaker 6:          00:11:56       I did that same thing with a rolled up towel or bang from the doorway and it helps mind tremendously, but I got mine I'm sure from fighting, but then also like I'll lay on my back at night for like two weeks. My neck will be all know. Isn't it crazy? You're a professional fighter. You fuck up your back watching youtube videos for sure.

Speaker 5:          00:12:17       But everyone's doing it, man. That's all we do is take the whole working. People's necks are changing. It's terrible

Speaker 1:          00:12:26       if it wasn't for like, you know, being in awareness that I have now for like my neck and neck injuries, just seeing a lot of things. I'm like trying to posture up and just seeing shit because I'm just, I'm always like this. Always, always hurting. So you know, it's been one thing after another four years and that's actually leading into this, you know, this accident with this injury, you know, try to keep this mike closer like this noble to y'all.

Speaker 5:          00:12:54       So are you. How old are you now? Daniel, I am 33, 34. I'm at that age where you forget how old you are. Yeah. So I'll be 34 and nine July. Well your, you're healthy and you know, the ability to recuperate from something that's that devastating that quickly shows what good of shape you're in. That must have a big impact on, on your rehab process. Right. Does, it does mean a regular person that has that kind of injury probably is not going to bounce back like that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       Not as quickly and being like I said, being an athlete has helped me tremendously. I mean, well my neck, Korean obviously as strong as it was, the, you know, the damage would have been worse. But uh, being able to bounce back was been, you know, being young, being able to. I put my body through so much that this is. Yeah. Compared to what has been through. So yeah, being young definitely helped me and trying to keep that, that, that time away, but you know,

Speaker 5:          00:13:54       so how will you know when you get back in there? Are you wrestling yet? Yeah, wrestling, doing everything. You wrestle them, Breslin I've wrestled. Yeah, wow. I'm nervous about getting your neck yanked on. Uh, I was nervous before. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:14:08       But now I'm just getting confident with getting my neck strong, making sure I don't do the stupid moves I've been doing the caused the injury. So, um, my next step is just being clear. BNC by a doctor, a neurologist. Yes. He can fight. Sign off. Let's get back to business. So, and house bound toward treating all this great. Uh, I can't say anything negative about them because they've always done nothing but help me out in situations so, you know, I've been with them

Speaker 5:          00:14:37       or sometime you know, and uh, two times world champion tomorrow too if y'all motherfuckers didn't know. But uh, yeah, they've always, they've always, they've always been fair to me, you know, that's great. Obviously you've always had problems here and there, but I've never really had any major, you know, loved Scott Coker. I do too. He's a good dude. So I always been good to me. So it's been really good. I hear nothing but good things to it and how they treat people like guys who have gone over there said it's a, it's just a huge relief to get treated with respect. You know, like they were a little nervous about going over there. Right, right. You know, a lot of people will always ask them, hey, would you want it? I'm like, Eh, this is home for me. You know what I mean? Like, man, the ideal for everybody would be bell to.

Speaker 5:          00:15:23       It gets to the same state as the UFC. The same level. That would be ideal. That would help. Like if you see Gennady Golovkin fighting Canelo Alvarez, you don't give a fuck if it's golden boy versus Bob Arum. Nobody that they want to see champions go after it. That's, that's what everybody wants to see. Ultimately that's what I would like to see across the board. You know, I mean I don't think it harms anybody. I think it helps everybody. Competition is definitely getting better for everybody. It's better for the athletes for sure. You know, and the more money that gets thrown around and the more promoted. I mean, if, if a superstar emerges from beltour tour that's at the same level that Rhonda was, or connor is or something like that would be amazing. That's great for everybody. For everybody. And you know, there's a possibility there too. I mean, Michael Venom pages, he's getting a lot of mainstream press. People were paying attention to him now because the other crazy shit. He doesn't matter. We need more of that. I thought he actually retired from him in a box for awhile, like retired from the a box to something. Nothing. You know what man, dude like that probably will retire and unretired just for the press, you know, just seems to be the thing that happens a lot. Speaking of retiring and retiring

Speaker 6:          00:16:31       Joe Shell and back to mma, I know you competed in the high rollers event this weekend, which by the way, Eddie Bravo told me he was so high. He thought he was going to jail. He told me, he goes, I was convinced I was going to jail. It was so paranoid. That was such a cool event. The event for people don't know what the fuck we're talking about. So it was an event put on that cell and a big lawn on my buddy's, they called the high rollers and it's cannabis infused Jujitsu tournament is what they call day. What are those two dudes that's slapped each other and then they smoked a joint together? The lapd there something between and then they stepped out with a joint. I mean it was good though. Before every match, everybody smoked. They smoked together. The whole event. There was no alcohol. The Bible Super Chill. They played like hip hop in the background fall. It was like kind of press star studded event. It was really fucking cool as it is by far the coolest martial arts event I've ever been to. It was the

Speaker 5:          00:17:28       shout out to that Dj man. He did like eight hours straight playing the same song, like only twice paid twice a month. Uh, we don't really, I don't think he had bought it. Was it? It's a weird connection. Marijuana with Jujitsu and it's always been there. And people that don't know, like people that don't smoke weed, like I have to tell them that please. Jeff Glover

Speaker 7:          00:17:50       and his opponent smoking weed. It's hilarious. Man is really, really fun and that they're doing that man, but I like it was a real cool event and it was real cool Jujitsu and we'd have always been connected for as long as I've been doing Jujitsu. People smoked pot in the parking lot and then went and enrolled. That's still do kickboxing apparently is the same way you practice focus. But I always found that I'm not good at learning when I'm high or maybe I get too high and I can't learn like, like some Oh, show me something and I'm not sure where to put my legs. I'm like, what do I do? Step over here would have put my right foot. What? Yeah, I find that a bit, but when I'm rolling, if I'm rolling high then it just, you just get into that zone and

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       if you know, like when they say like, uh, if you take it, when you study for a test, you're sucking on peppermint and then the day of the test you take pepper. You suck on pepper. You supposed to help you remember?

Speaker 7:          00:18:51       Oh yeah, yeah. Like that's Kinda how it is

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       with, uh, with martial arts for me anyway, like I'm high as fuck and I'm kinda like just a programming into my deep subconscious or whatever. That's my thought. Maybe you think smoking all the time when you try and then smoking, not smoking when you perform, do you think that has a, like a positive or negative effect? Uh,

Speaker 7:          00:19:15       I don't know. I don't really. Well, well let me ask you this, if that was the first time I said we're not testing for weed, you could fight high as fuck. What would you do that smoke that day? I wouldn't smoke probably 10 minutes before a lot of shit going on in my head. This is cool. This is cool. But like, yeah, it's a lot of money on the line. Well it's also, you know, the consequences are a lot different, you know, zig zagging a lot different when kicks and punches are being thrown. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Well remember when Nate Diaz or nick rather fought Gomi? Nick Fargo me home. Well, I mean, I know nick and I, if you asked him that question, you'd be like, Oh, have you spoken to right there? And like he would for sure 100 percent. I bet he would fight better probably. Yeah, not a fan of it. You're not a fan of fighting. Hi. No, no, no fault. One time.

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       What happened? Well, for once, for once I went through the crowd instead of the, the walkway.

Speaker 7:          00:20:15       That's what I do it

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       like you. You're supposed to come out. I was at Shark Bites and uh, you'd come out and then you go at an l shape and go straight to the cage. Came out the ushers always fuck that shit up though. That's happened like every time he tried to walk out the cage the wrong way. Like, no, no, the other one. Anyway, so I came out just crowd sitting there and just beeline straight to the crowd. Excuse me. Excuse me. Stepping up to the cage, like stepped over the fence. Check me out.

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       Got It. Now I'm like, ah, I don't remember. Shock fights and the, that was a bud brotzmann thing. He's a buddy of mine. Bullshit. Yeah. He was one of the original guys that are on King of the cage. Was it? Yeah. Then didn't get involved in shark fights. Yeah. Somebody. Did they have something to do with like fight as well? I don't know. So maybe there's a few people involved. So it was a good car though. I had a ga podell. They had a show. Could you want to fuck with a bunch of people know? Hmm. So what was it like fighting? Hi.

Speaker 1:          00:21:21       Well for me at the time, that was my biggest event and almost fighting a Karen, Deborah Gideon. So it was the biggest name I had fought to me it was like that. Fuck. You know what I mean? I just was kind of overwhelmed. I wasn't a Jujitsu. I didn't know much about you. Just to actually, the whole fight was weird because on Monday I separated. My arm are separated my shoulder. Wednesday they called me for the fight. Saturday

Speaker 5:          00:21:47       fought for years to like, I guess I'll get high for this. Right. You separated show like what? Like separation, like a separated shoulder. Torn muscle.

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       No, no, no, no. Um, yeah, up in the um, I don't know what the fuck you asked me. Did he love him? Yeah, well we got it like bandaged up, got to work in, fought with it. He didn't fight, would've been bandaged up, but the next few days kind of build on it. I said worked on as much as I can. Went out there. Uh, it was in Texas, fought and uh, yeah, it was just for me. It was weird. Like I said, one decision, uh, like I said at first round he had threw a bunch of like lego blocks.

Speaker 5:          00:22:29       Yeah, he's a serious spookseekers leg lock. That's what I was saying. Like, hi, I don't know, I just want to get out of here. So it was, it was a bad thing for me. So one I'm done fighting, I'm done. I was like, I'm cool. Have you ever fought? Hi?

Speaker 4:          00:22:48       Uh, I mean, I'm sure I've fought at spar high all the time. What's your feeling about that? I think it like a for this Jujitsu tournament, you know, Jujitsu is not my strong suit obviously. And so for me, that was my first Jiu Jitsu tournament and we just put on the gay like about a month ago when Matt told me about the things you should do it and Micky Gall I trained with everyday and uh, him and Bomba and we like, all right, fuck it, we'll do it. So we start putting on the g and the, that was a, I didn't want to make a fool of myself. So being high and having that like pressure, like not being completely comfortable, I think it was different. But like in a kickboxing fight I could probably be drunk and still be pretty comfortable with.

Speaker 5:          00:23:35       Yeah. There's a lot of people that think that I'm one of them to think that marijuana is a performance enhancing drug. I don't think so. Yeah. On a certain. On certain levels, certain levels I think you can fuck you up but. But it's,

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       if you get the dose right, I think you puts you in a zone in a comfortable zone.

Speaker 4:          00:23:51       Right. And I think a lot of them for performance, like how well it's gonna increase your performance is not being super stressed out over bullshit the week. And that's where I find the most benefit. Like when I would quit smoking weed for a couple of days before the fight, that was when it's like now is when I need it the most. That was when the most stressed out when I had the most anxiety that I have the hungriest they can, you know, I was like, this sucks, you know, like in displays and just relax. I think that helps.

Speaker 2:          00:24:14       Hey Man. How you doing? Any cryo therapy or anything to reduce swelling?

Speaker 1:          00:24:17       A little. Like I said, I was doing a little bit with uh, the um, the. I'm drawing a blank, the chiropractor that I was going to, but I haven't done much of it. But that's one thing I really wanted to get into because of the swelling a lot. Like I said, a lot of it, it's went down over the, over the time. But body feels amazing after that crab. Yeah, dude, I'm a big fan. And you do it like super doses of cbd though too. Yeah, a lot of CBD. A lot part of that. Some of that in that bag you gave me. Yeah, check that out. That's some flavor rec stuff that a flat can't stop. Crazy shirt in there. Quite a few. Can I take just wondering, I'm like, is he a medium or large and extra large? No, just broke as fuck. I put large. Isn't there? Perfect. That was perfect. So strength for you joe. What js? It's a company called flavor to CBD Company. I've been working with red pen,

Speaker 4:          00:25:17       so like medicated drops. I get it gives you like a certain dose every time you click it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:22       Oh, I've been using um, you ever heard that company Jambo? They just sent me some cbd. A rub on. Holy Shit. Is that work for you? Fuck yeah. Two thousand milligrams cbd rub on. I told you this sciatic pains but fuck with me or the last week or so and uh, I rub it on my hip like it's like my ass muscle right over like right here. That's where like it travels down and I rubbed that shit on before I go to

Speaker 4:          00:25:47       that has these, a medicated patches you can use to have roll ons that you could use evidence solve stuff. And uh, I just feel like I smoked so much weed with cbd in it all the time that it don't, it doesn't seem to work for me. I don't notice it, you know? And then they have vision droppers. I use that like crazy. Yeah. Maybe you just got too much of a tolerance. Why? I just think of you. If you smoke weed constantly, there's cbd and everything. You're hitting both. So like when, when my coach who's like 65 and never smokes weed and I give him, put that shit on him, he's like, oh my God, my elbow feels crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:26:21       I'll get you some of that Jambo Shit. It's better than anything I've ever used before. They have two versions. They have a thousand milligrams in 2000 milligram and I put that 2000 milligram and it's got like a menthol in it. So you feel it in your skin, like woo heats up.

Speaker 1:          00:26:34       Only time I've really ever filling that is like using it on my neck, like using on my neck and I've used it on my hand to where I liked the achiness does the achiness goes

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       away, but on my neck as well, I felt the most like up in the pain, but I put this of CBD vaporizers in. Then there's cbd bath bomb. We used that before my buddy's fight, the day of the fight. We dropped it in the a and the hot tub CBD bomb. Some fucking monsters out there that are trying to make this illegal and it's pharmaceutical. Those guys. Fuck those guys. So scary that someone would do that. They would try to spend money to try to make this stuff illegal and while they're doing that, they legalized like the fucking gmo synthetic version, which is like actually killing seriously. Fuck those people or fentanyl. That shit's killing. Everybody killed Prince. It killed David. Bowie had killed. Who the fuck else are? They killed it. Killed it. Killed a bunch of people. This year Tom Petty Killed Tom Petty too. Did he killed David Bowie or something?

Speaker 6:          00:27:38       Killed David Bowie. Who knows? What's the ball? That's a. it's a cbd bath bomb. Dang. You just drop that in. That's it. It's fucking not fucking around. Legit. Good time. I really feel like a rub on effect from CBD is soak in. One of those is really never did. The bathroom is good and it's fun to watch you drop it in and I'll got a lot of shit right? Some stuff, Joe. I got some good little, uh, you know, to Chili's and Adam. Woo. Good stuff. Exciting. Live acts. Got It all. And this is also my. Take this on my international flights. Allegedly the key is illegal. It's illegal, but it's when you put the vape pen and do it, it looks like a car key so you can just walk right in security. Oh that's crazy. I'm in the bathroom. Say screw the cap on from, from us.

Speaker 6:          00:28:44       He put it in there. And Man. And these are these candy. So my complaint about the candy thing is if they're going to have like um, those are cbd with thc wants to. And if you're going to have thc, like super potent candy, they shouldn't taste so fucking good because I'll eat the whole bag. You know what I mean? Like who's going to eat? Just one. That's very good. That's watermelon. Watermelon bags. Ambulance. Yeah. This is watermelon. It's like your belt. Super Lucky. Do check your shit. The Shit. Look at this thing. I love it. And then I think it has like A. There's three different settings. Repeat or value burning these kids today. Oh, you got to turn it on five times. Click it. Find on to the other side. One, two, three, four, five. Boom.

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       Nope.

Speaker 7:          00:29:49       That's the heat up to work. A joke. Fucking it up there. Job. You got it. You got it. You got to go on. Maybe it had to heat up. There it goes. There it goes. Burn it. How was the ballot tours? Drug testing policy standard. We don't have like the additional, uh, you saw the random tests. But I get tested before or after every fight.

Speaker 1:          00:30:14       I've been tested most of my fights. I know that. Yeah. So. And I've had people talk shit like, ah, they don't tell us,

Speaker 7:          00:30:21       well I don't know what you're talking about the test after fights, but obviously there's a big difference between that and hey it's four weeks out, wake up, 6:30 in the morning, would even up to Daniel here, Piston Cup, look at that stair or it's crazy. I mean they, they have lost a lot of people off the roster in the UFC. The really crazy thing is the body's changing people. You weren't sure, you know, you know, everybody passed the test when they were doing it on the way in day, but then you're looking at their bodies changed. Like whoa. So many of them just shriveled up and they just looked totally different. And their performances are different mindsets, different guys that were just unstoppable. And so they came in. It's like you're on like a six fight, losing streak. Crazy dropped two weight classes. Anybody who says it's steroids doesn't work as they're crazy fucking mind. They're not taking it for fun. They're not going all the way down to Tijuana and buying this shit because it's fun to get to do something on the weekend. So do you feel like you got a new lease on life?

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       Um, I'd do, man. Right now I'm just grinding, like fully focused on getting back into the cage, like, you know, having, having what happened to me and being in a position that I'm in, I don't really have too many things to go back to them. So you know, having a new lease on life really isn't how I would say it is, it's just what it is. I'm just focused on the next step, you know what I mean? The next step in my career, the next step in the path and what I've been going through, you know, it's always just something for me. So no, I wouldn't say it's a new lease of life, but just a new chapter.

Speaker 7:          00:31:56       But you must feel very fortunate that you can recover from that. I do, I do. It's amazing story. I love hearing that

Speaker 1:          00:32:04       is, it just sucks. You know what I mean? It sucks to be in this position, but I'm, I'm, I'm here, I'm talking to you, talking to this guy, walking around. So I'm blessed more than, than anything, but this is just fired me up to just get sick on, you know what I mean?

Speaker 7:          00:32:21       So you got to feel pretty fucking unstoppable after I go fly into the air slamming champion before this shit. And you come back like, what's going to stop? Yeah, that's the goal.

Speaker 1:          00:32:31       Get another belt, get back, get another belt. Show people. I'm not, you know, I'm not done. Not done at all. You know? So uh, yeah. I'm even still riding.

Speaker 5:          00:32:41       Are you fucking savage? Jesus Christ. Just say one 76 the other day, dude. I'd be an h one. The real one. A real hummer. I'd be in one of those bitches and I'd ride in the middle of it. Figure out a way to. If we put the steering wheel in the middle, I don't want to be on either side and strapped me in with a race harness and put fucking airbags everywhere. I want this thing to be like an inflatable bath toy, but I'm an. I'm an

Speaker 1:          00:33:08       adrenaline junkie, so although to do anything, you know, I shouldn't be riding obviously, but uh, you know, I need something to study my mind. So like I said, training training has been going something I got back into riding, something I got back into and it's pushing me to like move forward with that because. How long was it before you wrote again? I probably started riding again maybe about a month and a half years.

Speaker 5:          00:33:35       What? About a month ago? About a month ago. A month ago. Okay. Not a month end. So five months after the injury? Probably about a month. If you did a month after an injury, like this dude is fucking crazy. Get barely walk. That's some shit I would try to. I mean I would definitely try it. But what do you think makes you such an adrenaline junkie? I don't know. Even right before all my fights.

Speaker 1:          00:33:56       So like it's just been that way. Like I would always ride a lot before my fights because I had to release, you know, all the adrenaline and all the pent up like anxiety, anxiety going on and that's just how I've always been. I've always wanted to see what was it like to kill yourself, you know? What was it like that?

Speaker 5:          00:34:17       No, you know what I mean? Like adrenaline wise, what was it like to do something fun, exciting to push the limit, get on the APP, you know what I mean? Yeah. That sounds very different than I didn't mean it like that. You don't want to. Fighters that are liked. I mean Diego corrals. He died in a motorcycle accident. Paul Williams, you know, he got fucked up. There's so many fighters that have gotten into motorcycles for that very reason,

Speaker 1:          00:34:39       but it's not just motorcycles. I mean I've done until all type of shit. Like what else? I mean, I love diving waters when one of my favorite things. Oceans, one of my favorite things to do. No, I've never been in a situation whereby the diary thing, but you know, I want to do skydiving. I want to do rock climb and I want to do all of these

Speaker 6:          00:35:00       show shillings on my page. He and Joe are on the same page. I don't even like roller coasters to drag me on it the first time. Then I'm like, we're going again. To that point, I'm like, no, fuck that. You ride bikes a little bit, but I want to go the down at the ranch with coldwell riding with them, but they make fun of me because I'll go like 60, like 60. Then it starts getting like, oh no. It must be cool. Cowboy example will be fucking going down the highway 90 with his hat off, like resizing his hat, you know? No hands 90 down the highway or snapping pictures

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       of us while he's riding. Oh Jesus. I don't want. Isn't that

Speaker 2:          00:35:42       for sure. I love that dude. I don't want them to get hurt. I don't want to hear that. Yeah, fuck what? He's good at it. I guess. I'm sure he is good at fighting too, but it's fucking dangerous. Just like you should dot your I's. Cross your t's or 90 on the highway. Fuck that. Yeah. He's a perfect example of a legit adrenaline junkies. One hundred percent. Yeah, 100 percent. One hundred percent. I guess just some people once. I guess fighting is a big part of it. Like once you've experienced the highs of fighting, I guess the, the lows of regular life or just too fucking boring? Is that what it is,

Speaker 4:          00:36:17       man? Imagine. I feel like you would get. I would definitely mammon thought about retiring, but when I stopped fighting I think that's what really bothered me because I'm addicted to like not the adrenaline side of the lake. The challenge like the you can't do this like me versus the world like that. That really gets me going. I think if I didn't have that when I'm older, I'd be pretty pissed off you versus the world. Like how so? Uh, like, or like even me versus a man versus man, like one on one, like no other. It's just, you're the only one that you can, you can count on in that scenario I guess. But like that, that personal challenge is what drives me and fuels me. And that's why I think in my career, the fights that I wasn't supposed to win, we're always the ones that I really showed up for it because that Jen, that, that hit me where it was, if I was supposed, supposed to, when everyone thought I was going to win for some on some level, I would not show up the same way. Very common.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       That's very common. Yeah. A lot of guys, when, when they think it's going to be an easy fight, they can't get up. They don't. They just have this weird. And it's weird

Speaker 4:          00:37:21       because like you don't know, your coaches won't let you not trained that way. Like you train hard for the fight, you know that something about the thing in your head doesn't click or it doesn't,

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       don't go after. Yeah. It's like the thing that everybody hates the most about before a fight that discomfort and anxiety and just fuck, why am I doing this? Fuck. That is what is your friend when you're in there? Yeah. Yeah. It's the fights were guiding extent.

Speaker 4:          00:37:48       Yeah. That's what fucking drowns you at the same time. Because it'd be people like fucking their whole campus, perfect. And as soon as they walk out in front of that crowd, it's like who the coach is, like, who the fuck is this? What the fuck's going on?

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       But don't you think that that's always that kind of person, like a guy like you doesn't have that. There's not, that's not a thing that you experience, you know, I mean there's the type of people that crumble or usually like the guys who are just murderers in the gym and then for whatever reason, under the bright lights they falter, but they rarely rise. Like those guys rarely win the big fights that they're not supposed to win. That's not, they're not the same psychological makeup. So like something about the challenge or the unknown to some people it just overwhelms them. Whereas other people, whatever their psychological is,

Speaker 4:          00:38:35       that challenge is what fires them up and gets them excited. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird, right? Consistency is the hard part. And longevity for fighters in general. The curriculum, that's what makes floyd mayweather so impressive to me is for him to be at the top of the game for so long and can make all the money and continue to be at the top of the game and still do that. I mean versus like, you know, the guys that blow up and then Jon Jones has trouble, they don't know how to deal with the fame for him. Connor throwing shit through bus windows. Like it's hard to stay balanced and consistent through that whole mental thing.

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       The biggest one of my biggest thing has been, you know, the mental part of fighting, you know, getting to the top, being pushed back down, getting to the top, you know, just dealing with that as a fighter has put a lot of stress on them. Like, you know, every time that I got into the cage, like had thought or how I acted. A performance.

Speaker 4:          00:39:30       Yeah. So you, you did some work with vinny shoreman, right? Yep. How did that help? A vinny helped me a lot for a, worked with him for I think three years, two or three years. And I find that I'm tell everybody beneath Germans a hypnotist whose been on the show a couple times. Actually I was the one that had told you about the bottom up on this phone. Shit, someone wants credit. I made you have any. Um, he has me. It was a trip. Right? Wow. This is real. It really worked for me. And then, uh, I find that as I've grown, I think just like any technique you get better at it and has it needs time to lay, kinda resonate inside of you. And I feel, I mean I haven't worked with them in over a year and a, I still am figuring out like, oh that was the fuck he was talking about. Or like this is leanne starts to sink in. So I think it's been, the mental game is a huge, a huge asset. Do you ever work with a sports psychologist or a hypnotist or anything like that?

Speaker 1:          00:40:27       I mean I've worked a little bit with a guy named will back in Florida. This was some years ago, but something I've always wanted to dabble in. Something I've wanted to explore. I haven't really got a chance to do a lot of things, but that's one thing I've always, like I said, the mental part is been key to me, so I've always wanted to do

Speaker 4:          00:40:44       it might be a good thing to help you during your recovery too, you know, to just really concentrate on recovery and really concentrate on the parts of your body that need

Speaker 1:          00:40:53       be fixed and you need to reach out to the right people to get the right, you know, um, help as far as like, you know, people to talk to as far as like that. I don't really know anybody like that.

Speaker 4:          00:41:09       Vinny shoreman to the rescue. You? Yeah, he'll, he's probably listening. He'll do it over skype to you do it over a fucking face time. And the of used to hypnotize me over facetime all the time and then get on fight day. He would call me and like we'd be backstage. He'll be back in the states in October. Yeah. Yeah. So

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       I'll look it up. I'll make the connection. I would definitely look into that would definitely like.

Speaker 4:          00:41:39       But you've been using the, a lion's mane. Mushrooms, two minutes. Yeah. I send them that video and started talking to him about it. When I found out about what happened to him, you know, it was like, I'm sure not as bad as he was going through, but like we were just going to walk again. Oh, if Dan was in a horrible accident and then every time I talked to him he would just be like real like, Nah, fuck them. It's going to happen. Fuck that. I'm like, alright, you need to take this lion's mane. Mushroom. He needs with these core to set mushrooms, take all the flavor of cbd that you can get some other mushrooms is good for your brain. You'll be cool. And uh,

Speaker 5:          00:42:15       I mean, look at it. Look what I did. Look what I did. Oh Joe Joe. Walking around and hearing that you're sparring and hitting the bag and heating pads.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       Yeah, I mean all these things put together. It's just what's given me back. So it's nothing's impossible. I mean, I can prove that nothing's impossible and shit, you know, doing it, like you said, even the lion's mane and the different CBDS I've been taken and just getting my body back to like feeling good mentally feeling good, just everything's working. Like in steps, so little steps at a time. Basically every day by day. So we'd say like 80 percent now I'll give you 75.

Speaker 5:          00:42:57       Seventy five is good, you know, 75 minutes you can get to 100, you know, like I'm running. You know what I'm saying? That wasn't one of my big goals was like buy in six months, I want to be running, set a goal, started running, boom. I'm a guy who couldn't walk.

Speaker 1:          00:43:11       Exactly. So that's awesome. It's, it's, it's, I don't know, it gives me an a. every time I think about it, the reason why I stopped just because every time I have to talk about it, I get into mental thought of it in the process of going, laying in the bed, not be able to feel shit to, you know, dragging your foot after you're walking with a walker to be able to pull up your pants. Now it's crazy. It is fucking crazy. You know what I mean? And it just, it keeps me. It keeps me humble enough to just talk about the situation and love it. Love Life.

Speaker 5:          00:43:52       That's a beautiful story man. I love hearing things like that. People recovering from things because it's just, it makes you appreciate the fact that you are all healthy every time anything goes wrong in your life. It's an opportunity to appreciate what it's like when things go right and if you can get back to where you were and you'll have a new perspective. I do for sure. For sure. Are you fucking with that lion's mane stuff too?

Speaker 4:          00:44:14       Yeah. My how often you take it. I was taking it every day. I made a bunch of capsules with lion's mane and a quarter. So you made the capsules yourself. You can buy it on Amazon little capsule machine. Make 100 capsules a little concoction. They're nice. So when I saw on your, your show, I'm Paul stamets was talking about how the, uh, I think it was cte that you guys were talking about how the, the lion's Mane helps a final note on the for repairs it or if it just helps like the find a way around blockages or whatever with neural tissue. Nerve tissue. And I was like, Daniel, I hit him up with a right.

Speaker 2:          00:44:57       No, that, lion's mane stuff is miraculous. I mean there's, it's amazing that more people don't know about it and that more people aren't talking about it, but anybody that's involved in contact sports and the athletes that are getting hit and they're getting their cage rattled a lot. They should be taking that stuff all the time. Yeah. And CBD as well, right?

Speaker 4:          00:45:15       Yeah, for sure. I mean, I just look at it like the business that we're in is really dangerous and like if you know that there's something that you guys could get punchy, right, or guys lose their chin or have problems like performing on fight night or whatever, like if you can, if you could take cbd to be better for swelling, you can take lines made of repair, the concussions and shit that we're getting constantly. Like I just think you're kind of stupid if you're not actively trying to figure out a solution to all these problems. Have you ever fuck with Kratom? I never. Not really. I know people that have. I've, I was um, I was hanging out with Simon rex yesterday and he was telling me like some awesome stories about people that were addicted to opiates. They got off of it with Kratom, Aka dirt nasty. So good. That's so funny, dude. That's an awesome dude. He's a good dude.

Speaker 2:          00:46:05       I, uh, I took eight, created eight pills yesterday, which most of the time I was taking two and then I took four and then yesterday I took eight. Now I get it. That stuff makes you high as fuck when you take eight. My whole body felt weird. I was like pretending to be sober. I was walking around and pretend to be sober, but not like a drunk. Not, not like reaction time, like almost knocked something off the counter. I caught it real quick. It's like everything's normal. Like your body moves good, but you're like, Woo. You feel weird. You feel like you're under the physically. Mentally. It's very nice. It's like, yeah, it gives you a body buzz, but it's, it's great at alleviating anxiety. Like it makes you really chill. It's weird. It's just like puts you in this nice headspace where you just like, ugh.

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       Like everything's calm. I think the idea is that it fills up these opium receptors and that's what, uh, what people that have had real problems with opiates. That's why they like it. Because even if you're fucked up on it, you're not fucked up. You fucked up like, Woo. I feel something. Something crazy is going on. And I was taking eight and my buddy Chris Bell, he's the guy who directed that a bigger, stronger, faster documentary. He had a real problem with opiates. He got a pretty serious, a hip injury, how to get a hip replacement surgery and was in massive and when he has a serious arthritis, like a genetic arthritis, and when he got his hip replaced and got on pain pills, he got hooked bad in the middle of making a documentary about prescription drugs, which is crazy. In the middle of it, he got hooked himself, just total random, you know, synchronicity. And he takes 10. He takes 10 of those, so he takes two more than I took it yesterday for like four hours. I was walking around like this,

Speaker 4:          00:47:56       but there's no real side effects in comparison to the other stuff. No, no real side effects. After that last man standing tournament, I'm with Laura, had three fights in one night. My, I had like super bad chest contusion of my chest is still there years later, the swelling and swelling of my sternum. And uh, it would pinch off nerves running down my shoulder. And then I think it actually pinched off the nerve root, which is when I started doing the, um, the decompression with the chiropractor and so my left side started like, getting, like, it was noticeably getting smaller, like it was the muscle atrophies because you don't know that I didn't know. You might know what Joe, you know, everything is that the nerve root actually feeds them the muscle and allows it to grow without, once that's fucked up, then your muscle won't grow anymore.

Speaker 4:          00:48:43       It's when you atrophy and shit, it's very difficult to get it to grow back to if you don't catch it quickly. Right. And, uh, did you have a problem and get into grow back or do you catch it quick? Well, I think when we started doing the decompression and all that stuff, it worked. Um, I mean it grew back I think, um, but the, the pain that I was feeling from all the shit I kept, I kept getting Vicodin, prescription Vikatin in Norco and uh, you're literally in pain. So I would take the medicine. But, um, after like two months, like I looked at my kitchen counter and there was just empty pill bottles, like everywhere. And I noticed that I was like really fucking aggressive and like short and like I just stopped right away when I, when I realized that, but I could totally see how that would be.

Speaker 4:          00:49:25       That could become a, an addictive thing for sure. I was there manning, you really need it, you know, it wasn't like I was like trying to get fucked up. I was like, Oh, I'm in pain and take a pill. And then, uh, did you go to a doctor and get it looked at? Yeah, I went to. What did they say about your sternum? Uh, they said that there was nothing wrong with it and went to the hospital twice. I woke up, uh, America woke up screaming and shaking from the pain and went to the doctor, the hospital, and they did an x ray. And so there's nothing wrong with that. And I'm like, look at the swelling. It looked like a tennis ball. And they said that it was in our cartilage or between the ribs or had gotten some sort of confusion, you know, somebody gets a hit and elbow and there had swells up that mine was doing that under the rib or under the sternum plates or some shit. So there's this constant pressure. I just started taking advil, like it was going out of style and then that would make the swelling go down and then I wasn't in pain anymore. And the problem that I was having with the Vicodin was it's not an anti inflammatory, so it did nothing for the, for the actual cause of the pain. And I was just eating fucking vicodin like crazy. So, um,

Speaker 7:          00:50:28       and then, uh, yeah, but not, I pretty much eat. I take advil every day regardless for my knees hurting or my toes are hurting. Or like just years of not supposed to fuck with that stuff every day. It's not good to do the honest gut health. Right. That'll help. I mean, in Kimchi helps to probiotics Kombucha. It just, it ruins your gut health and it causes inflammation. This is what my friend Cameron Hanes who runs ultra marathons, he was taking 800 milligrams a day, sometimes twice a day and a because he was in pain all the time because he runs fucking dude runs a marathon every day on Saturday. This Saturday coming up, he's running for 24 hours and his goal is 120 miles in 24 hours. I mean, he's a fucking maniac. So this dude's always in pain. And uh, I had Dr Rhonda Patrick on. She was explaining about how nonsteroidal antiinflammatories like Ibuprofen actually cause inflammation because they fuck up your gut bacteria and they fuck up your body's ability to process information and it causes pain.

Speaker 7:          00:51:30       So he listened and there's connections to stroke and all sorts of other problems. So he gets off of it and all his pain went away. His pain was caused in part by the fact that he was taking this stuff for his pain, which is a terrible, ridiculous vicious cycle. What's APP for how long? Straight was he taking? He was taking it for years. For years. Yeah, he will because he's been running forever. He's been doing marathons and ultra brand 238 miles last year. The, you know the mole APP to 30, which is just the same. Yeah, we'll have to even possible it takes three days, three fucking days. What's really crazy is you have to. The first day you woke up the next day, another 24 hours of reading. So there's a type of mindset that you have to have to be able to do something like that.

Speaker 7:          00:52:16       That's just super human. You have to be able to just every step, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot and agony and pain. All your toenails are falling off. Everything's in seeing them post pictures of nasty fucking feet. All fucked up. Yeah. What's crazy is a woman beat everybody by more than 10 hours. A woman who I had on her name is courtney doe. Walter, she beat everybody by 22 miles. She was 22 miles ahead of the second place. Dude, it's unbelievable. She's a fucking animal. She slept for one minute and three days. One Minute for a minute. Sorry. Twenty two miles come up. I don't think steroids help in that world. I think in that world those people are just, it's just mental. I really, I really don't think it helps. And then they'll get paid for it a little bit. They get sponsors and shit. Cam doesn't get paid. He had a sponsors under armour sponsors them and you know, but not really. It's just because they're animals. I know every step I'd be like thinking about what am I doing this for? Well it's also your use to psychotic interactions with other people

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       in short amount of time. Like you used to like 20 minutes description. Chaos. I mean dude, that last man standing, it was one of my favorite events I've ever been to. I fucking loved it. I don't want you to ever do it again because I love you fighting fucking four times in a night.

Speaker 4:          00:53:42       Oh Man, I kinda want to do it again. It's crazy. There's something about doing that, you know, you're doing something special and, and uh, you know, epic like that was, that was my man the last man standing the tournament. That was like my main focus after the, after I knocked out Simon Marcus and then I guess after a beat, after the first two fights going into the third one, like I'm pretty sure I wasn't going to beat our two most to beat up, but I was just had this crazy buzz about knowing that I was doing something special like this was really fucking cool, but I would love to do it again.

Speaker 2:          00:54:18       I think that's how those people will feel when they're running those crazy ultra marathon. They know they're about to do something insane. It'd been a regular fight. Is Insane. To regular fights in a night is insane. Three irregular fights in the night against worldclass kickboxers and then the first fight you got to go for rounds because after three rounds it was a draw. What in the fuck man,

Speaker 4:          00:54:40       good notify. Had to do that shit right now if you get excited to hear you talk about it. I liked. I've always loved tournaments. I've always wanted to be in like a day tournament like that should be dope.

Speaker 2:          00:54:59       Now you're making your move back to mma because kickboxing is just not what it should be. I think we both feel that kickboxing is one of my favorite things to watch. I'm a giant fan of it and for whatever reason it is just not caught on in America the same way boxing has or the same way. And my man

Speaker 4:          00:55:19       Smith and I've spent my whole, well I've been doing this since I was 15. I'm 34. So all of that time I've been thinking about this same question and then like I'm just, you know, it is what it is. Yeah. It's like you can't hold onto it anymore, at least not for me. The sport is going to grow, it's going to keep, keep doing good. And I hope that that continues, but for me, I need to do, uh, keep, keep progressing, so to speak. That is a

Speaker 2:          00:55:46       did. Here's what it is. I mean, that's the best way to put it because there's no way we're gonna fix it, but I don't understand, you know, I mean, I really, really don't understand. I fucking love watching kickboxing and when people tell me about how they love boxing, I'm like, that's great. Boxing is great. I love boxing to kickboxing is way better than boxing. That extra level of, you know, thrown in kicks and knees and especially if you go to Moitai elbows and clench. It's just, it's a wilder, crazier striking sport and I just don't understand it. I mean, when I watch you fight or Kevin fied

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       or you know, Kevin Ross or Georgia Petrosian John Wayne part, like, how the fuck would you not want to watch that? But it's so exciting.

Speaker 4:          00:56:33       And then continuously just don't, they just don't tune in, doesn't. It's like fuck, I don't know what it is, I just don't understand this. Just beltour have real problems with their ratings when they air it. Um, I don't know exactly what the ratings are. I know that they're, uh, they're average. They're not super fantastic on any.

Speaker 7:          00:56:53       So it's below what the averages for the MMA fights. Yeah. Yeah, for sure man. It's a bummer to real fucking bummer because for, for anybody who's a fan, anybody who likes watching it like shit, like that event in La, that last man standing. Holy Fuck. Was that fun? That was crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:57:12       Yeah, that was. That was probably one of the best kickbox Siemens was the buscot boxing event I've ever been to. Yeah, me too. The whole energy and the forum just in general, that layout of that was, was bad ass

Speaker 7:          00:57:21       that. Yeah, that form is perfect for that. I mean it, everybody knew it was a special night that it was crazy, you know, that they were doing this, you know, what is it like knowing that like how much time do you have in between your second and third fight and everything is fucked up and sore and you know, you're about to go into another fight.

Speaker 4:          00:57:42       I think it's probably like 30 minutes, 30, 40 minutes. Maybe one more. One other fight between you. So just enough time for everything to start hurting. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. I guess I was just because of the money, like I knew that each time my father was going to get more money and that was like my focus in the 30 minutes, like not wanting to go back out and never crossed my mind, you know? Versus if I think if I wasn't getting paid for it, I'd be like, oh, that's cool. Yeah, that was fine. You know what I mean? So that's why I was asking about those ultra marathons, how they get paid for it or not because I don't think that would be my main focus.

Speaker 7:          00:58:19       You say that, but I think that if you were there, just your competitive spirit would kick in and you would go, let me see what I could fucking do here. Give me another minute hand and a cigarette. Yeah, you're at mile 79 and you're like, shit I'll have to do is 21 more miles. I could do that now. Do you think you'd like to fight in a tournament like old school, Ufc one style?

Speaker 1:          00:58:47       Oh, there's one to, to uh, you know, being part of the, towards tournament, it was dope being a part of like a monthly tournaments. Right. I've always wanted to be like, you know, was, was good. Would again, you know, find some of the best fighters in the world three times a night. Yeah. That's really what's going to test you to me. So the, yeah, there's so many factors involved. So many variables, right? Like your opponent could get up

Speaker 7:          00:59:12       quick first round knockout, and you could go a three round war, you know, and then you face each other in the next round. It's just, I get the commissions not wanting

Speaker 6:          00:59:22       to do it anymore. I get it. The only place that would let you do is probably like one of them, native American casinos. It's like, come on in, come on in. Got The commission is the commission of problem. I think they would do it in California. Do you think? So it did with glory when I did it. Yeah. But that's kickboxing. I don't know if they would do that with mma. Kickboxing. It's wildly widely criticized. A lot of people think that was a bad idea. I think the way they can do it with kickboxing is because of boxing. The boxing rule says up to 12 rounds or whatever. So for kickboxing, that's three fights. Yeah. I don't know how that works with them. I may though that makes sense with kickboxing. That make sense? Because I think they probably would have a hard time saying like, have Daniel can fight 10 rounds of Ima may tonight.

Speaker 6:          01:00:06       That's what's the most rounds of kickboxing you ever fought in the night. But other than that tournament like one single fight, a five, five rounds when I was probably more times. Always, always, always like that. Right. Why is that? Um, I think that the rule set and Thailand is based primarily around gambling. It's like human cock fighting is what tie isn't in Thailand essentially it sounds negative, but it's Kinda that way everybody in the audience is, is gambling and betting and yelling and motioning back and forth. The treatment bedding. So like in Thailand it's a three minute round, but it's two minute rest, which I think is awesome. That is awesome. But yeah, I follow for the WBC world title over there. And Wow, what year was this Jamie? They played the music. Yeah, yeah, for sure. And I find a Roger Dominance Stadium and Thailand, which is like one of the.

Speaker 6:          01:01:02       Wow. I was just dumb. And, and one or the two being one. So I fought over there. Uh, the two minute rest is cool except that you kind of run out of things to talk about like my coach. And I was like, so I'm like looking at ring girls out, fight a tie guy. Uh, no, I'm both times now. First Time I fought a guy from Argentina at Roger Stadium and the second time I've bought a car ped car at Pythian from Golden Glory. Jim, for the WBC world title. Now when you, um, fight over there in Thailand, did they still expect Westerners to take it easy on that first round? Because the idea is during the first round most ties, they go fairly light because they were ready for the bedding to get established. They don't want to go. I think you don't want to come out too strong because then nobody will bet on you are against the other person. I don't think they expect that from the foreigners though. Just as a whole. They think that the foreigners suck. Like they think like foreigners won't block leg kicks. A lot of times you'll see like the ties come out and just wreck the foreigner in the first round and again. So yeah, I don't think they're, they're expecting the foreigners to participate. So I would love to go back in time

Speaker 7:          01:02:20       and watch Ramon decker when he first got there and that was like the golden era of

Speaker 4:          01:02:25       can we tie in like the nineties when, when they didn't have the, you know, like right now it's the first round. They don't really fight the second and third round. They fight in the fourth round that they may or may not fight depending on who I know who's who won the first two. They take it off because they do nothing really. I mean not nothing but almost nothing. They're not really trying to win because they know they're going to fight in a week and then like in the golden era of was like when like those guys would come out and just, it was a prime time and everybody would fight every round and it was supposedly was better.

Speaker 7:          01:03:00       Does Ramon decker fights? Anybody who doesn't know anything about Moitai? Go on Youtube right now and watch Ramon dekkers and watch chaos. That dude, he fought guys who was his size to that was what was interesting about him is like he was a small guy. It wasn't like a big guy who was going over there to fight the ties. He was their size.

Speaker 4:          01:03:21       Yeah. And he felt like the top, top, top guys and like the and like their pro, which is pretty rare now you see like Sanchez, super famous, but like [inaudible] is, is like the celebrity guy who's fighting like the older, heavier ties, like the, the top ties right now in Thailand at 120 pounds, 15 pounds and they're like 16 years old. It was like the top guys. Right? Then you build a name where you're big enough name that the foreigners know about you, the rest of the world and market you and then you fight, you know, you go to America and in American you go to wherever. So He's like a Samurai, blue cow. Those guys,

Speaker 7:          01:04:02       he's fighting constantly and he seems to be fighting on the road a lot. I'll go to these weird places and fight some dude who looks like he's in real trouble almost immediately. Right? Well, they're like, oh, we're going to bring sunshine over for this fight. And like always got to fight somebody. They tarred. Uh, and then a lot of times the ties don't fight each other. Like it's very rare that you'll see outside of like a tie stadium. Um, you know, you never hardly, you're not going to see yahtzee classify boot cow or like a tie versus they, the ties to kill the foreigners and then still be on the same team has got such an interesting style too, because if you looked at him, if you only saw like a silhouette and you saw him move around, you'd go immediately. Oh, that's her. You could tell instantly, yeah, it's constantly moving, shuffling his feet, switching back and forth, real light on his feet. He just moves different than everybody else. He does like the old wiper boron was like the original martial art of the turned into a tie. If you watched like the old Tony John like on bark or whatever and they run up on your leg and like dropping the ball on your head was like the [inaudible] stuff and like a lot of the techniques that st jude does, like the cartwheel kick or like the games that he plays a lot. Silla is another one that's really similar to him on the wash. You just, when they've met laird

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       Zilla fight in lion fight against a do with zero fights. They let him it with zero fights. The dude had zero Moy Thai fights over $400. He got up to the top and he had kicked this dude into another dimension, but it was one of those things where it was inevitable from the first minute of the first round. You like this guy was an mma fighter. Not a bad fighter, but just doesn't belong in there with laird zillow. It was ridiculous. Yeah, and when would I put it online? The please don't ever do that again. They're like glue. Connor Mcgregor's going floyd. Floyd. Merriweather. Yeah, that's $100,000,000, bro. Kind of different. Pretty sure. Like if I didn't pay that guy anywhere close to that, pretty sure that guy got his head knocked off for 10 bucks and it wasn't the same. That guy is not conor mcgregor either.

Speaker 2:          01:06:08       Right? I mean if conor Mcgregor Zilla at an MMA fight or more Thai fight, I go, okay, let's see what happens. You know, I mean, I don't think he's going to win, but that might be interesting. But you know, seeing those guys in the real high level guys and seeing like what they are able to do, seeing the way they move and it's so important for, especially for mma guys that don't understand the levels of striking, that there's. When guys are just striking, there are just, there's some elite upon elite upon elite levels. You know? I mean, it's such a black pillow versus a bluebell. Yeah, it'd be like a really bad ass blue belt. The black belt, you're just completely lost, like it's not even close to just getting dominated. Yeah, you can just get shot down, you know, or like you're a good high school wrestler and you go against the world chair.

Speaker 2:          01:07:04       Yeah. That's been one of the more unique things about combat sports is that there are these deep, deep levels and you don't, you know, sometimes you need to see like a guy like Khabib number got madoff is a perfect example. You got to see him fight against guys who you know are bad ass and see him smush them. Just the real difference. Right? Yeah. They realized where this Guy Zach, because he's not doing anything. It's not like he's doing jumped three 60, we'll kicks in the that nobody else can do. He's doing things that everybody else does. He's just doing. I'm at a level that no one else is doing it now.

Speaker 1:          01:07:35       It's crazy. He's wrestling is like 10 times the level of like a lot of Russell's there could be. Have you ever trained with them? Never tried water. He impresses me with like, you know, watching them fight.

Speaker 2:          01:07:50       Who was the best wrestler at American top team when you were there, what would you think, do you think is the best recipe you

Speaker 1:          01:07:56       train? What did. I mean he wasn't a fighter. Had to be Brown. I mean Brown. He is a dog. Just coach wise. He was just, what's his name? Mike Brown. It was brown. He might wouldn't know. Where's he out of act? No, but where it was he was he dressing her? I'm saying Mike Brownie, not a um, a, a fighter was a coach. Mike Browning was probably the best wrestler at. Oh, the coach was interesting. My brother just had his hands. He was movement and strength. Just a dog and he wasn't a fighter, not just wrestling. Yeah. But he, he had a college career too though. Yeah. Where'd he go? I think it was in Boston maybe. Or what was my brand new from up north somewhere.

Speaker 7:          01:08:46       So he's never had any MMA fights.

Speaker 1:          01:08:48       No Brownie has. Yeah. How many of you have fought for the UFC for four? Fucking. What was that before UFC or that young? Um, be uriah a WC had a good career.

Speaker 7:          01:09:08       Oh, Mike Brown. You're sounding. You're seeing Brownie is Mike Brown? I was like, who's this? Browning talking about it and I fought for the UFC. Was going through my Rolodex. Browning. Browning. Browning. Who's browning? No, Mike Brown's brother right now. He's a, he was a bad motherfucker in his day. Cool motherfucker to do like he's brother. Favorite person I fuck with. Well, he's a great coach now too. He was in Colby Covington, scorn of this weekend and they told me after the fight, he's like, dude, this kid's cardio is insane. He's like, it's insane. He goes, I think it might be like a, just a natural gift that he has. I mean he trains really, really hard, but he said his cardio. It's just off the charts. Hmm. Yeah. Interesting. It's funny how much attention he like if he wasn't that good before, but it is like he got a ton of fucking intention.

Speaker 7:          01:10:02       It's really started talking shit. Oh, for sure. I mean just the temp room. Yeah. Well the talk and shit. Got them to the dance, but beating my other way, he beat my, uh, everybody had to open their eyes up and go home. But a lot of people had doubts. They were like, dos Anjos is a fucking straight up assassin. He's going in there at gun against. They got fucked up. Robbie lawler got merk. Neil Magni like, how's he going to beat this guy? And he beat the shit out of him. He literally beat him every round. It was crazy like he watching. I mean maybe you could give him the first round of Dos Anjos and you know, he was always a threat because he's still got power, but colby just on end it was like Nick Diaz style just pop, pop, constant, constant attack, constant kicking them, constant punching them.

Speaker 7:          01:10:45       I was very impressed, very impressed. Watch it. I didn't see it. So I can't really say anything. Very impressive man. That the most impressive thing was the pace he put on them because they'll. Santos is known for his cardio and he had a real problem with that cardio when he was at 1:55 because he had diminished his body so much and then he moves up to one 70 and you're like, well, now he literally doubled his output. If you look at the strikes per minute in the 155 pound division and then one 70, it was double at one 70 and still

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       colby melted them. Just just stayed. Stayed on and kept that heat on. It was crazy. So impressive. Very impressive. But now he's got tyron so mad. Tyrone wants to fucking kill him. That's a different person like tyron hasn't so much because he hates him. All the shit talking colby has been doing. He did interviews with people. We told them don't bring up colbys name. I don't want you to even bring up his name because he didn't want colby getting any attention, but now it's too late. Now.

Speaker 6:          01:11:43       Anyone's name other than his brother all the time on any show ever. Period. Ever.

Speaker 2:          01:11:51       We're going to fight now. He should be happy. That guy talks a lot of shit now because that's what's gonna make them money, right?

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       I mean fuck you go from. How do you feel about shit talking? I was never shit talker but because I never wanted to be that guy, that shit talk shit coming back it up. So I like when people talk shit because I'm gonna beat your ass anyway, but you know it works for some. It doesn't. Like I said for me it was, I was never one of those guys but it has been one of those things that you see every, every couple of years. It's the one guy that stands out from talking shit and it's like I had worked for him. They just start to see everybody tried to trickle it. Well I think connor did that for a lot of people, but colby saying some hilarious shit. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:12:35       Take this belt and bring it to Donald Trump. Shit. Yeah. Fuck it. It's fucking funny though, man. Thing Sheldon. Chill. It was like, it obviously fun, like just that's obviously bullshit, but it's fucking works. Yeah, exactly. But Charles still the bus might see the manager and make me watch him talk about anything. I really like. What? He's a smart dude. It's really good because little is a instagram videos that he does in his car. We were fucking great. They're excellent. Fucking great. I would take a class from chill on how to like talk shit. Do that shit. I would totally do it. Yeah, man. When he was fighting Anderson Silva, those. Those were the glory days of Shit. Talking in MMA. He opened up the door for everybody. Oh, the feeding the Nogueira brothers a carrot. Carrot got his bus was a donkey. I didn't know that. They had the internet there. I swear. I didn't know. I thought it was on a private forum. The internet

Speaker 2:          01:13:32       and eyes balls. He went over and did the ultimate fighter in Brazil. I mean, went over to Brazil, stayed there for six weeks and did the ultimate fighter and coached alongside vandelay and vandelay got jumped by a Dieta and vandelay got so goofy on the show that vandelay last Brazilian fans because vandelay was coming after him and shale was trying to be calm about it and was like, look, you know, like don't touch me, don't come near me. And you know, vandelay comes near him, he grabs him, takes him down, and he's like, it was so, it was so interesting. Like watching him turn it all around and people mad at Vanderbilt. I mean the Brazilians were mad. Evacuated the like you're making us look bad.

Speaker 1:          01:14:16       A perfect place. A perfect. Perfect.

Speaker 2:          01:14:20       Yeah. I mean there's, there's a time and a place for shit talking and this is the time and this is the place. It just seems like to make money now. It's, it's such a wise move.

Speaker 4:          01:14:29       I mean it's sports entertainment at the end of the day, regardless of what anybody wants to say or think about it. And like I'd rather. I mean I've watched two guys that aren't that good. If I, you know, like the tough man contest, so if it's marketed right and think the bouncers and bartenders are like whatever, like the entertainment,

Speaker 2:          01:14:44       it's entertainment. Some of the best fights have been against guys who aren't some of the best fighters. Splutter being I'd love that guy was the best fights ever. Sure.

Speaker 4:          01:14:54       I'm going to start like a fucking tough man contest. Promotions.

Speaker 2:          01:14:57       Well and even good guys who aren't world champions. Like when a god he fought micky ward. We knew that they were both perfectly matched and they were just going to collide in the middle of the ring and beat the fuck out of each other. But are some of the classic boxing matches

Speaker 4:          01:15:11       for sure. Didn't have to be for the heavyweight championship.

Speaker 2:          01:15:15       No, no, no. I mean there's been some amazing fights in the UFC there. Similar to that, like Gilbert Melendez, verse Diego Sanchez. That wasn't for a title. I was one of the greatest fights of our. See that shit was crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:15:26       So classic. So it makes. I mean I've always like that shit. Two fighters that don't really have too much on the line and talking shit about a fight hype and the hype behind the fight is what makes life. It always does. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:15:41       As long as you can actually still fight. That's what's makes it interesting with the guy with connor or a guy like colby day can fuckin fight it. Talking a lot of shit. But when the, when the, when the bell rings, they're backing it up.

Speaker 4:          01:15:53       I mean we're talking about this earlier, but that's what bugs me the most about cm punk was there. He has the, the ww II background you would think would be like great on the mic. You know what I mean? And they're like maybe you can't back it up or fight or whatever. Like he goes from like cocky and confident I'm the Fuck Jab or whatever that we're going to be like, oh, you know, I just believe in yourself. Kids. It's like really hard to listen. I don't believe he has no physical, like no physique. He doesn't. It's not like it's, it's kind of sad. I just shit on cm punk.

Speaker 2:          01:16:24       No, listen, you didn't shit on him. You were honest about them. You were honest about what you saw. I don't think that shit on him. Right. He's a very nice guy. He's a very nice guy and he's a hard worker, but he does not have athletic talent. He's missing a lot and he's a showman and when he was in the wwe, he was allowed to say I'm not fucking man and throw his arms up there and they had it scripted so that he was the man. But you know, when you're in there with a guy like Mike Jackson who had zero fear of him and just was so casual and just popping them in the face anytime he wanted to and literally could have stopped him anytime. If he just got angry and want to stop him, he could have stopped him at any point in the fight. And even though he beat him decisively, the performance was pissed white off so bad

Speaker 7:          01:17:10       the way he was fighting that. He called him a fucking idiot and he said, I'll never fight in the UFC again. Anyone. So like if Mike Jackson went out there and just start cm punk with a right hand left hook combination and that was the end of it, they would say, well cm punk, you gave it a shot. That's it. It's over. Mike, who would you like to fight next? And now it's like, you know, you're not even fighting in the UFC anymore because you should have, you should have stopped him like what you were doing. He tickled him fucking it. I'll make a joke of the sport, like it's already like a joke because if this guy, everyone thinks punk punks like fucking joke. I guess he is, but like don't make a joke of the sport and like not just like poking fun of the fence.

Speaker 7:          01:17:50       I get rid and it's coming from. I get ridiculous comment as to how to starched stem. Yeah, it's the whole thing was, it was very weird. The whole thing was very weird, was like right away when you see cm punk holding, holding his hands up and moving stiff and throwing kicks. So like, oh Jesus, like I don't like that being on paper view. I understand that they're, they're selling paper view cards, but paper view in the UFC should be the elite fighters. Curtis blades versus Alistair overeem. Should have been on that paper view card. That's what should have been there. Not, not what we got to see. You know, what we got to see was just. Yeah, I don't like when it's like, like you're playing a trick on the fence, you know what I mean? Promoting this guys if you something and then it's like inspiring videos come out and it's like, what the fuck is this?

Speaker 7:          01:18:33       Inspiring? Videos are crazy. Awful. It was like a guy who just showed that as far awful. It's like you took a dude who's no wrestling background, no nothing, or this one I want you to do. This is a jab. It was the right hand is when you throw a kick. I want you to pivot. Your hips go ahead and there as bar. I mean he just. He doesn't have the ability to move his body. Right. There's a lot of guys that you could take out there that are track and field guys or football players and you could get them to fight better than him in a couple of weeks easily because they're athletes, they're athletes. They would understand how to shift their weight, throw a punch, and yet the, the sparring videos that I saw was, I think it was his first fight, but even then he wasn't.

Speaker 7:          01:19:16       He signed for like two years before he had his first fight or something like that. There's no way that you're six years deep in the game and yet he's still at that bad. You know what I mean? He doesn't have any talent. It's all it is. It just doesn't have physical talent or whatever for whatever reason, whether it's a, he, his approach, his intensity, whether it's, it's not as coaching. So at Duke fucking Rufus, you know, I mean, it has to do with cushman that he talks about Duke roufus hit and one of the prefects. He said, uh, how do you see this fight? It's like, oh, I really like a head kick to would love to see a head kick and like, I don't think that's going to happen. Oh, that's so crazy. That is. So, that's such a crazy thing to say. Um, you know, Duke's a beautiful person. He's a great guy in every, every sense of the word. He just says he's a great guy. He did his best. You know, there's only so much you could do. No, I mean, I'm sure

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       you would love working with Duke. I'm sure he would love working with you if you and duke work together. I'm sure you guys would have a great old time because you're Joe fucking chilling. Right? And he's Duke fucking relevance, you know, let them know. But you know what I mean. I mean, you have to have something to work with, you know, I mean if duke just grabbed some dude from a gas station that has been drinking beer and smoking cigarettes his whole life and had him in a fight in six months, how much can you,

Speaker 6:          01:20:35       we expect. But I would rather see that fight against these other ones. Right. Let's find out how that one would go. Well, a guy, you can find it a gas station.

Speaker 2:          01:20:44       What's interesting is they both. Both guys fought micky gall first. Just weird. Did you see his instagram? Mickey's? Yeah, he did like his own pre-fight a analysis of how it was going to go. It was really good. Yeah. Well, um, you know, that was a disaster when I saw Mickey fight and then I saw that it was going to fight cm punk. I was like, who said Yes to this? Why the fuck would you say yes to this? This is a hundred percent guaranteed brain damage. There's no way you're going to beat him. There's not. You don't have a goddamn chance in hell. You have no chance. And I was saying that people get mad at me. The CM punk fans get mad at me. I'm like, look, this is what I do. My job is to analyze shit. I look. I look at fighters, I look at it, I understand what I'm talking about, man. This is like, I've got a pit bull and I'm going to put them in a cage with a puppy. What do you think's gonna Happen? The pit is going to kill the puppy. This is what? This is how it works. This isn't like, this isn't maybe that puppy going to grab him by the face. No, no, no, no, no, no. Listen to me. I'm telling you, this is how bad this matchup is. This is a, this is a Brazilian jujitsu brown belt with a nasty back game. Strong and fast.

Speaker 6:          01:21:53       You look at, uh, the matchup with the cm punk just had Mike Jackson Mckee beat my checks in and I'm like under a minute. So much him took his back, strangle him. He's a bit out here training with me for like the three months now. And the kids getting really good striking is getting really, really good. He's fucking talented men. Really good. And he talks a lot of shit too that he's good. Plus has got hilarious walkout music when it comes down to. Oh Mickey, I to convince him since he got here, I called his phone and it's like, you know, those people have this ring back songs and they're like, fucking horrible. Yeah. Elevator music. And he answers and I'm like, dude, turn that fucking shit off. You change it or at least have it be. Hey Mickey, you're so fine. And what is his music on some trash? It's just elevator. Doesn't like something awful. Fucking change it. Mickey. That's when is he fighting again? Uh, I don't think it has anything booked yet. I think he's, he's calling show Sean Shelby. So he's working with you with this tracking? Yep. No know he's helped me with my ground game. And who was he working with his ground game out here? Uh, uh, Jason Manly and a Bomba Fast Gonzales. Where's that out of a Bama

Speaker 7:          01:23:06       trades of me. And Jason Manly is a, the training that muscle farm. That's cool. So where is he a? Is He staying in Burbank out there as you stay in there? You, he's standing there. Me and I'm a Eagle Rock. Nice. She's actually roommates with Eve Edwards. No, Shit. Yeah. Oh, that's right. Here we got me. I forget this little love eve. Genesis dude thing going. Yeah man, he's great, isn't he? He's a great dude. Crazy great dude. He's a very good. On the desk too, it's interesting to see like a former fighters on the desk, like some dudes are lost and some dudes are smooth. Some humans are very good at it. He's. I think he's as great. Right? It's fairly. I think he's one of my favorite ones to watch. Yeah. I tweeted about it like years ago when he first started doing. I'm like, diet, really appreciate him doing it.

Speaker 7:          01:23:51       You know, I'm Mike Bisping is very good at it too. Although he's been him. Colby got out. It was a little awkward. They went after it after the uh, after the fight. Bisbing can't not talk shit himself, which I kinda, I kinda, I really appreciate that about him actually. Well he's, he's a dog man. His, his competitive drive is pretty intense. You know, bisping is in my opinion, like one of the best, but he's like one of the best poster boys for just hard work, mental toughness and determination and also being that like British due to that, the bar that'll have a beard tell you to go fuck herself and piss off. Well the.

Speaker 7:          01:24:31       Yeah. Yeah, that's good. He's got problems with his other eye now to he. Yeah. You got some sort of a detachment in his other eye is good. I thought they were going to fix fix one. I thought it was going to get better or something. He's got some sort of oil in it that protects it before he retires and then when he retires he's going to get it operated on to fix it, but now he has a new problem with his right eye. He was seeing some flash or something like that, his right eye and he went to the doctor and found out it's kind of detachment there and he's like, fuck this. I'm done. Because he was going to have one more fight and now he's like, I'm done. He did it all, man. He won the ultimate fighter. He won the title, you know, and, and now he's a good analyst to the desk because she thing go on his podcast.

Speaker 7:          01:25:17       I think you're great too. He's doing good. That is a nice thing to write some movies. Yeah. He's always got something going on. Um, it's nice that guys do have those other options too. Like podcasts and different things. Now there's, there's ways out, you know, especially looking at like what jobs done. Sharp has taken it to a whole nother level. I mean, he's as far as guys being able to get out of out of the fight game and then make a living as a podcast. He's fucking doing stand up now and headlining clubs and shit and traveling all over the country. And He's good man. He's fucking funny. He's a funny dude. It's hilarious. You know, it's just nice that fighters have options because, you know, seeing the guy stick around when he shouldn't be doing it anymore. It's one of the hardest things for sure.

Speaker 7:          01:26:00       And then they'll be like all the nfl guys or any pro sport. Most of these guys are broke by the end with him like four years of when they finish. And uh, yeah, there's not a whole lot of other options for a lot of the guys. So I think it's good. It's nice that we have other options for sure. So would you sign it? You showed everybody the way here, Joe. There's a way, you know, there's a way. There's ways now, especially with the Internet man, there's just crazy ways. I mean, how much money think mighty mouse makes on his twitch stream, let's say a decent amount. I don't know how much this is like the video game dudes twitch stream and they're not even like the best gamers in the world and they make thousands and thousands of pages on there all the time. Would you say is planning something right now? Sugar. Sean's in it too bad. Not that we're going to watch it, but he had song rampage does that too? I think so. Yeah. He's a big Gamer. He's always talking about. Is he still active? Is he still gonna fight again?

Speaker 4:          01:26:53       Yeah. I was trying to get a fight with him not too long ago and uh, I'm not sure what.

Speaker 7:          01:26:58       Well he's like 290 pounds right now,

Speaker 4:          01:27:01       but I feel like at half six figure that for that size I could do that. Could do that. That could be read pitch. I don't know if I'd go for like Brock Lesnar.

Speaker 7:          01:27:10       Well, the rates lower cut a heavyweight we're talking about because he doesn't, he doesn't try to take it down, right. Most likely is going to try to stand with you. Do you have a set schedule for you return to mma?

Speaker 4:          01:27:23       Uh, I'm hopefully getting at something around September, August, late August, early September, I think.

Speaker 7:          01:27:29       And you just decided that we're kickboxing is right now. Just doesn't have enough juice.

Speaker 4:          01:27:34       Uh, yeah, I, uh, you know, I want to keep progressing financially and uh, you know, uh, like I said, money motivates me a lot and uh, if I reached the ceiling of the sport so to speak, and there's, Oh, I'm amazed right here, right next door and uh, yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 7:          01:27:54       Yeah. No, yeah, I mean, how many more years you think you're going to do it?

Speaker 4:          01:28:01       A four, five, four, five. I want to make big fights as much money as I can. Um, and set up for life after fighting. I think, you know, you can't just quit, right? You gotta find ways to market yourself to the highest level to get as much attention as possible. So the irrelevant in the space that you pass and I just don't think they kickboxing is going to get me there.

Speaker 7:          01:28:26       Yeah, man, it's a bummer. But I think you're right. I think it's a smart if you're just dealing strictly financially. I think it's a very smart move. It's very unfortunate. I really wish there was a solution. I do not know what it would be though. I mean everybody's tried. Spike TV tried, they tried the paramount network. They tried with glory. No

Speaker 4:          01:28:44       one thing it also with pellets or you know, maybe I'll come back, maybe there's a big fight, you know, maybe Musashi's like you don't want to think I want the bills were kickboxing, title to be

Speaker 7:          01:28:54       right. Yeah, let's do it. So yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:28:57       Um, but I would fight if they let me, I would fight fucking kickboxing first, win

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       that fight and then come back out the same night and fight mma. Leo. I brought it up. I brought it up to coker at a meeting not too long ago where they say they just kinda looked at me like fucking crazy horse the same way they looked at me when I said I wanted to fight rampage of vandelay. Well his deal is he back like, what's going on with vandelay? I don't know. I just saw it as an opportunity when Chell beat him, you know, his complaint was that, you know, he just took her panel, laid on top of them, which has been kind of my complaint for a while. So I figured, but they don't want that fight. Why don't they want their friends when they get barely already had his face surgery. Doesn't want to have it done twice.

Speaker 7:          01:29:47       Rampage is my buddy when he just. He just doesn't want that. He said he wants an easy fight like vandelay so. Well there's a lot of history between those two guys to. Yeah, that makes sense. You'd want to fight for him? Yeah. He was A. Vanderbilt was an interesting story to write when he was fighting over in pride and then he came over to the UFC just completely different human being. Yeah. You know, just in the rampage fights when rampage brought them over in prod and that also a lot of miles on them to get to think of both things. No.

Speaker 1:          01:30:17       Yeah, she's got me thinking about felony, talking about, uh, you know, fighting and whatnot

Speaker 7:          01:30:24       over the felony. The known as the crazy horse. Crazy horse has now changed his name to felony ladies. Gentlemen. No longer refer to him as crazy horse you ever see that fight backstage is nothing like swear swears up and down. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:30:41       Beat them up.

Speaker 7:          01:30:44       So the sleep, he definitely just somebody else will somebody else. But didn't he say he says he killed vandelay city sucker punched him after he got choked out on the video that you see. He fought later on that night and won by knockout I think after being choked unconscious in the back. And he said he knocked out vandelay. Oh yeah. Yes and no. No, no. It happened before. He fought in the locker room and he went out and won and then he, he says he knocked out vandelay, punched him and knocked him out. Vandelay went out and won a decision. So vandelay, if he's telling the truth, he killed vandelay earlier that night.

Speaker 6:          01:31:26       Yes, exactly.

Speaker 7:          01:31:28       Here's the fight. This is vandelay when you know that doesn't even look like the same person I know is the same person. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:31:39       Like the Mario brothers muscles. He tacked this dude and he got caught in a triangle. Very danger. Danger. That's it.

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       I forget who it was that did this to him, but it was one across and Gracie's black belts.

Speaker 3:          01:32:15       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:32:18       How big is. How big is a felon now? You got it? Fifty five pounds maybe. Probably. Yeah. He's out cold here,

Speaker 3:          01:32:32       right?

Speaker 2:          01:32:35       Yeah. Cold.

Speaker 6:          01:32:40       Oh, they're very nice to him. His eyes opened up. He's like, what? I think like, uh, you did A. I saw a clip the other day. The guys asked you, uh, what's the practical use of Jujitsu? And you're like, well, I'm a street. If we got in a fight, I would kill you. That's like, I think people don't realize that like without the ref to like stop the fight or even those guys like they stopped him. Like, okay, I let him go. He's already unconsciously. That would kill you if you would be dead. You were dead dead if that guy doesn't want to let go of you until your brain doesn't work anymore. And that's a wrap and that's that. That's real shit. That's my friend Eric. Trying to come up with some excuse to not work out. That's why I said, what's the practical use? Jujitsu. We had the fight. I wouldn't kill. You know the crazy horse fight. Two guys on the basketball court got a big fight and then he takes him down really, really quick. He attacked a guy. Oh yeah, he fucked up sign. Oh yeah. Oh he's. He thinks he's a bad ass and he doesn't. How a fight. Oh look at this. Oh, I'll punch in the back of the head. Oh Shit.

Speaker 2:          01:33:41       Ooh. Look at this thing. And he's still trying to find him hilarious. He's taking that leg apart though right here.

Speaker 6:          01:34:04       He's got them in the heel hook right here. There's no play basketball again by the that's in that position. He's telling the truth though, right?

Speaker 2:          01:34:10       All he has to do is Yank that fucking thing up clockwise and that's a wrap. Pop, pop, pop.

Speaker 2:          01:34:17       That horrible pain of getting. He'll hooked and not tapping. Not The business, especially that inside. He'll hook that is so nasty when it goes across the body. The amount of Torque on your knee. This is like no way. Unique and hang in there. It just rips apart. I'm good on knee surgery. Is that that Polaris? Well, he does. He does outside in inside, but the inside one is just the outside one. You got a little bit more. There's a little more movement like this. I mean you got to tap, but the problem is when someone's got you in this way across the body and then they go like that, man, you got about an inch or two above it and it's just. It's horrible

Speaker 7:          01:34:58       too. It sounds terrible. You could hear a duck everything pulling apart and snapping off the bone and people screaming. Paul Harris would not let go either. That was his thing. He would just hang on to heal hooks. It sounds so bad. It sounds so bad. I got to go with the fucking Komora. There was, I'm not sure what the differences, but uh, it sounds like at this, in Americana, this is the Camorra I think it was this way, the, it sounded like ripping a towel. Terry cloth towel. If you pull it all apart and the fibers start popping. That's what it sounded like. It's still here to my head. So three tap. I mean, after he's like, oh, it's cool, it's cool. And I'm like, that's fucking cool. I didn't need to break your fucking arm. You could have just tapped dickhead. Yeah, I saw. I got to hear this shit in my head all night. I saw a video of a street fight. There's another video where the dude gets a guy in an Alma Plata and he's, he's, he's pushes arm up. You see the art guys arm. Just give out. Oh, the street fight I saw was like Mexico or Brazil or some good groundwork though. He's nice on Omoplata in a street fight. It's always a plus.

Speaker 7:          01:36:10       I mean there's a street fight. Game is changing, you know, dressed for dangerous super dangerous kid who was like on the playground. It was like flying like karate kid. Now they're going to be like rear naked choke and each other fucking little kids. Little kids grow up watching Bela torn the EFC and kickboxing. They know what a leg kick is. Now they know all that shit. They know how to grab the back of the head. Other kids are yelling, ne need. They know what to do now. Oh, is this it? Yeah, this is. Yeah, this is awful. The dude gets. He brings that Lego, that guy. The guy on the top has no understanding of what to do with is. Oh, here it is. Oh Sir. I'm just gonna. Here comes here. Comes here. Comes, watch this. Get ready and it comes to noise.

Speaker 7:          01:37:02       Awful man sound. Oh, there it is. Look at it. Just laying fucked up backwards on his arm. Oh, don't move it. Jesus Christ. He's just laying there like he must've been drunk too because he's like, he didn't even pull his arm out. He had no idea what he was doing. Listen. Yeah. Do you guys see that? You don't know your smoke, Daniel? Is that what that is? Cigarettes there. These are empty. It was something else in here. Come on man. Do you smoke cigarettes? Yes. Yes I do. How often you smoke? Soon as I get out of here. As soon as you get out of here. How many? How many a day to go? Uh, I don't know. Probably about half a back. Jesus hanging out with this motherfucker is. Okay. This is part of. You just got to get it. Got a ticket. Just go ahead and get a job. Just looking out for your best interests, man. Have you ever tried to switch to vape or anything like that?

Speaker 1:          01:38:03       Uh, I've done man. Listen, I've done it all. Vape. I've chewed, have tried to stop everything. I just, I'm a individual or just

Speaker 7:          01:38:15       you're an individual individually. Were you smoking when you were the. You are the current war. Military Champ holds. I was like, damn, that's so crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:38:27       We've spoken to. I was like chewing in smoking since I was 12. 13

Speaker 7:          01:38:33       does a lot of Thai fighters to smoke, right? Scott Boskey doesn't need Disney. Always smoke.

Speaker 6:          01:38:38       Does that. Makes a lot of metal, a lot of fires. I don't want to put it out there like, but billy Bob last but a lot of fighters that, you know, at high level in the UFC, smoke cigarettes.

Speaker 1:          01:38:47       I used to try to hide it like they used to be one thing. I'm trying to hide it and then you always say, oh I can't believe your athlete. You're smoking until I leave me the fuck alone.

Speaker 7:          01:38:58       I hear you talk and they go, man, you an 80 year old blue center fuck's going on with your voice man cigarettes. They give you that hard living voice.

Speaker 6:          01:39:14       There's definitely a benefit and a level two, like not hiding who you are. And again I was just talking to somebody about that today. Like it is nice to that I could say that I smoke weed and be myself and whatever.

Speaker 7:          01:39:26       Shit. Especially we'd know, you know, I mean there's a lot of people that have some dumb ideas about what we does to you, you know, and it's nice that guys like you were out about it so he could realize like no real smart guys like you were out there to pro athletes, but like I'm a stoner, I'm a comedian. Like makes sense. But pro athletes like seeing like that, a guy like who takes care of his body, smoke Swedes, not, it's not ruined in his car. He was like. The other thing is that people want to think that it's lazy.

Speaker 6:          01:39:51       Yeah. That's what bothers me most about the misconception of it as like that you're not a productive person, that you just sit around the house and that someday, like on Sunday I sit around the house high motherfucker Shit. But every other day I'm working my ass off constantly

Speaker 7:          01:40:05       stays off for sure. For sure. There's a photo in the green room from Ryan Loco. Shout out to Ryan. You a smoking cigarettes. It is that law firm. Last man standing.

Speaker 6:          01:40:18       It's in between fights. Uh, yeah. I think it will. I don't know if it was last man standing or if it was, it was a locker room, one of the glory fights. I don't know if it was between flights or not. Yeah, there it is. That's up in the green room right now. Officers. It was like a Jimmy Hendrix and Elvis. Right? With the same.

Speaker 7:          01:40:40       Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I got a gang of new ones coming now. I got um, Steven Tyler when he was a teenager, got arrested for weed. I got him. I got conor Mcgregor. Conor Mcgregor Mug shot. I got the real Jimi Hendrix Mugshot, not the, not the photo that we had on before, which was like his real mug shot label, but the photo was from one of them, Jimmy Hendrix experience photos. We got the real mugshot photo. Now. Jimi Hendrix hasn't been heroin and I'm trying to go to Toronto with that heroin. Here it is right there. Yeah. When someone's tried to tell me Jimi Hendrix didn't do heroin. Well tell that to the Toronto Police Department when they fuck it. Arrested him for it.

Speaker 4:          01:41:22       There's a picture of me on instagram. I saw was a Bruno Mars, fucking a justin beaver to other Brits celebrities, wherever they were all smiling in their mugshot and it was like when you know you have

Speaker 7:          01:41:37       money, they just got Vince Vaughn. Yeah. Yeah. They just busted him. Dui Sucks.

Speaker 4:          01:41:46       Good chicken and drive is a good. I got both. I got a Dui when I was 20, 22 on shrooms, shrooms and drug tested you patent. They didn't give me for this rooms.

Speaker 7:          01:42:01       They fucking help for the deal. I would think that maybe the shrooms would help balance out the booze problem

Speaker 4:          01:42:07       was. I kept arguing with the guy and he was like trying to get me to blow on the street and I'm like Oh yeah, nothing happening like pretending to blow and then they take me downtown and I was like in and out of like falling asleep and they kept like waking up and they had like the Dui, a breathalyzer machine. It looks like kind of like this or whatever. The actual big machine. And I remember like arguing with him like, what if it was, if I don't blow and he's like, the, you get suspended for six months. And I'm like, what if I blow and it's a d in a bad as a unit. He was suspended for a year and I'm like. And then I asked them that back and forth like 20 times I kept falling asleep.

Speaker 7:          01:42:41       I ended up, I ended up not blowing. It would make you want to not blow like what are you? Fucking stupid. So by the time, yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:42:51       go to jail or you go to court anyway, your suspensions almost up. So I ended up, I ended up getting off on that because it was a uh, they pulled me over for turning the wrong way on a one way street. But I just showed that I wasn't, I didn't do any field stuff

Speaker 7:          01:43:05       already. Tests, I'm not saying you shouldn't drink and drive, I'm not, I'm trying to pick that. But if you do drink, uh, during, uh, yeah, I didn't do the field sobriety tests. So they didn't have any probable cause that it was actually drunk. And when he didn't blow and uh, they said, well, he was driving the wrong way in one way street. And I was like, I've never been to that area before. So side note technique, don't blow. Yeah. Hmm. Never had a dui. Good for you know, driving a fucking motorcycle, man. You better be silver will punch you smoking cigarettes, not paying attention what you're doing with Uber and lyft and all this shit. Now it's Kinda, it's pretty responsible to get a fucking Dui. I bet it's dropped down significantly because of uber and lyft are really bad. It has for sure. I think so. Listen Boys, let's wrap this bitch up. Thanks for bringing me all this stuff, Daniel.
