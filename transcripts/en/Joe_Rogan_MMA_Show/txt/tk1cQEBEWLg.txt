Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Boom, ladies and gentlemen, Josh Barnett, youngest, average UFC heavyweight champion. Now we're retired, retired. Just, um, I'm a free in the wind. I'm like a Bald Eagle. I'm just out there riding on that freedom. Just America.

Speaker 2:          00:00:22       The, uh, I decided to leave the fold of the UFC and a chase, my, my own futures. Um, by my own hands.

Speaker 1:          00:00:32       Are you actively competing or going to be actively competing?

Speaker 2:          00:00:37       There'll be some grappling stuff this year, but, uh, I'm figuring by the start of next year I'll get back into the MMA circuits mainly because it's just going to take some time to set up camps, managers, the structure of everything. I have a proper sparring partners and all that.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       And in the meantime, we were talking about you're doing commentary for new Japan pro wrestling with Jim Ross and you do it on our access TV, right? That's right. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       Every Friday night at eight, uh, you can see me sit down and run my mouth about Raslan. Yeah. We just did a live show up at the cow palace in San Francisco, which they've been having sporadic a wrestling events there, but it was a, it was a big draw in that building in like the sixties and seventies I guess. So it's a bit of a historical,

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       it feels like wrestling pro wrestlers and make it a renaissance. It's like making a return.

Speaker 2:          00:01:27       Yeah. I think that um, there is a certain audience of a certain age gap that our age group that has come into flourishing in, in, into the Internet and other ways to which to go ahead and, and, and bring wrestling back up there and show that wrestling, whether it's the biggest company like the wwe all the way to say, you know, number two, it'd be new Japan. And then there's all these independent companies all over the place that uh, some of them have quite a decent following.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       Billy Corgan from smashing pumpkins, huge wrestling fan. He owns what is the company that Nwa national wrestling alliance. Yeah. So he owns Nwa, Nwa, the rap group. It's that too. You been. That's what I hear when I hear Nwa. I'm sure there's some attitude involved with sure,

Speaker 2:          00:02:14       uh, Nwa, speak about the rest of it, but uh, um, Nwa was his, I guess it was a legendary sanctioning body and so it wasn't any one particular company, but it was a, a sanctioning body that would then oversee certain titles and so if you're going to be on this show at this time, you're going to defend the Nwa Championship. The NWA commission would get involved and, and they had their specifications as to how the title matches would be run and whether or not you could lose by disqualification or not. Or if you go over the top rope would be a dq and little stuff like that. Killer. Kowalski. Russell for a killer. Kowalski. I couldn't tell you. Do you remember him? I know the name, but

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       I don't really. I mean when I was a famous famous trainer after the fact when I was in high school, probably Uwa guy. It was an Nwa at. Yes, that's right. Did we talk about that with billy? I think we did. He was like local cable when I was in high school. It was like three days. Yeah, like a claw. He would like grab his own wrist, grab your hat or like a guy fun eric. Get his head. He's got his hand up the claw. It's like there's some nostalgia to it. That's one of the reasons why I feel like it's, it's coming back. It's like people who liked it as a kid or now as adults going back to it as a nostalgia,

Speaker 2:          00:03:41       the Internet, it's, it's much easier to go out there and put product out. Right? So it makes it more easily disseminated to any audience might want to see it. Especially with like a, um, you know, shows that are abroad, like there's some shows that go on in Germany and Austria that will get streamed and people get ahold of them. They get to watch them. So it's not like the tape trading days of the, of yesteryear.

Speaker 1:          00:04:05       Does Jim Ross Hook you up with this barbecue sauce? You know, he's got some fucking killer barbecue. Scott.

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       He's got sauce, he's got rubs. He uses. He's got all kinds of a minute. A whole Menagerie of all your meat fixings.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       Is he a pitmaster one of those dudes? Does he do the whole thing with the wood and smoke with hickory chips and then he's got his white oak on the side when item guys, maybe maybe he lost in my mind. Yeah. Yeah. There's like two types of people that use like that barbecue. There's people like me that you pellet grills, which is infallible, you know, he's one of those triggers. Sure. It's easy for the pellets in it does all the work for you, but then there's a serious motherfuckers chop wood and dry it out and they've got the Coleman

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       are. Those are the ones that start with a w, uh, the Weber grills that there's just nothing to it other than.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       Oh, those are cattle grills. Yeah. Those are for amateurs. Brow. The real series dudes. They get those side pick those side smokers. Oh sure. You have the main chamber and then you got a little wood box on the side where the woods heating up and then the air goes through and it smokes from this. That's those people that cook and like to 25. They never let anything. I throw stuff over over a gas flames. That's my lead, I, I, I have no

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       business having any, any voice in the realm of barbecuing,

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       but it seems like something you'd be interested in. I love it man. Who into all things manly. This is true and I like setting stuff on fire and then eating it. But do you still drive a manual transmission all around Los Angeles, which just drove one today? Yeah Man, I,

Speaker 2:          00:05:45       I've been driving around. I just got it out of the shop a little while ago. My, I have a 75 formula a firebird, but instead of doing the ls swap, which everybody does and I understand why, uh, it's got a

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       4:55 pontiac in it that we bought. I had a board 60 out. It's got forged Pistons. Uh, I didn't go with forged rods. I didn't need it I think because, well no, actually I did put fours rods and Pistons, but iron heads, dual quads we look at, at uh, you know, I don't know if the goal was to just make maybe one horsepower per cubic inch but have well over 500 pound feet of torque. That was the idea, just and it's an automatic unfortunately. Yeah. Yeah. Senator Force with me and we'll gives me crap about that all the time. She's swapped out because I like just being able to drive it. Cut that third hole, Sun third hole on the floor, but the clutch pedal in there. I'm, I'm more than down. But uh, you know, hell, it needs paint. It needs interior done. So that's the Burt Reynolds car, right?

Speaker 3:          00:06:46       Was that the, you know, that's [inaudible] 77. Okay. You're a 75 slash 75, so it's got big, big circular headlights, a circular headlights still kind of a square round off, rounded off square for the center Jamie. And pull it up. We can pull up 75 firebird. And the formula has the big Ram air scoops on it, right? Right. The, the, the two big snorkels that come in with a tesla. Dope. There it is. Woo. That's a transient and minds the formula. Ooh, look at that car. Like that yellow one on the right or that a gray one formula. Oh. So I've been driving that around quite a bit and hotchkiss did all the suspension on it, will look, did the brakes. It stops in a heartbeat. That's nice. Magnaflow exhaust, that's one of the few cars that I liked from 75, like it feels, I feel like everything after 71, it's real risky in a way.

Speaker 3:          00:07:42       I mean some of the styling lines of these mid seventies cars. I kinda like it in the obnoxiousness of it all. But uh, and you know, when whatever you get with these as far as like. So this car came with a 400, the one that I bought and uh, it was like seven and a half to one compression. So it was just a total dog. People like, Hey, do burnouts. I'm like, I wish that was the year that, I mean the years where the gas crunch was on and they started making these cars gas efficient, right? Well, are they attempted to in some way, and not to mention they would, um, they started trying to incorporate a small dog, uh, elements to try and reduce the amount. A small thing, but they were just highly inefficient the way they were going about it with the air stuff and different processes that were like things connected to the heads and it was bad news.

Speaker 3:          00:08:36       Yeah. It was a rough time for America during the rare. The rare times that that is, right? Yeah. One of the rare times, it was a rough time for cars, like from 71 to the eighties all through the eighties. We just make dog shit. Cars made some real, real, real snoozers. Pontiac was one of the few that was putting together a decent looking car. The firebirds and the Trans Ams and then of course corvette corvette's still had some good looking cars in the seventies. They did and especially because they even with the lower horsepower motors car, so you could still get up there and hustle even into like 77, 78. You had the six point six three or the 400 or the four or three. I guess by that point in the Pontiac's right now, chicks are turning off their fucking radio in mass. I don't know if any chicks wanted to tune in to listen to what I had to say.

Speaker 3:          00:09:28       Anyway, you're Josh Barnett, chicks one here. What you have to say, they want to learn the ways of men, the ways of men they want to learn. They to. There's a lot of fake men surrounding using signals. You know, I have a theory that a, so not that long ago, I maybe just a handful of years ago, I finally got like a leather biker style jacket. And so fonds kind of. Yeah, but. And old ray every time, but every time I smacked something electronic doesn't work better. So they're. Yeah, he had a magic touch pro. Absolutely. The ladies loved him. Yeah. Yeah. Keeps her dildos in shape. But uh, he uh, alright. So I got this jacket and I've always wanted one ever since I was a kid and I went to this store in New York because there was no, there wasn't a location locally where I could just try the jackets on and I didn't want to buy an expensive jacket and have to send it back.

Speaker 3:          00:10:23       All this stuff. So I was in New York, went to the store, found the jacket that fit me, loved it, bought it, been wearing the ever living crap out of it, taking it all kinds of places. It's been nasty. Black metal mosh pits with it on. I've been all around the world with it. Have been in far eastern Russia. A leather jacket is made to tell a story eventually at the end of it, but people will go, oh, you know, do you ride a bike? I'm like, no. The reason why I have this jacket is because of Mad Max road warrior. Because when I saw that as a kid, those jackets looked bad ass and you know, here's the bronze, the, the, the MFP running around in their falcons just tearing ass and blowing shit up wearing these jackets and I want a jacket like that. But I started to notice that this jacket was everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:11:08       Everywhere. Everybody, everybody was making a version of this jacket somehow or some way this biker style jacket guys are wearing it everywhere. Chicks are wearing it everywhere. And then I'm like, oh, that's a weird fashion trend. I didn't really see that comment and then as I started to think about it more and more and more, it seems like there is a attempt within society to try and present the image of toughness, right? So from haircuts to jackets to all these different kinds of things that everyone's trying to appear to be tough and bad ass all the time without, but people aren't going out there and necessarily risking it like they used to. They're not, they're not in generally taking on these jobs that are dangerous or, or even just your people want to have

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       muscle cars but they don't want to work on them. They don't want to. It's like by having the item, it somehow implies some sort of character. Yes. Some sort of toughness, some sort of a rugged element to yourself. Like, you know, I'm a bad ass. Like you've gone through it, right? No one's checking it. You're falling off your bike, going 70 miles an hour and just rolling and dust yourself off and you'll see all the, like, uh, like the 30 year old Hollywood type dudes with the manicured beards and all that on their Harley's that have all been a church turned into choppers and like, okay, it's like a, a, a big show of, of toughness without, because people aren't going out there and living tough lives anymore. Is it toughness or is it coolness and are the same? It's, it's, I think it's a coolness related to the idea of being tough and attempt at authenticity.

Speaker 2:          00:12:46       Correct. And, uh, you know, to use a term masculinity, right? And even though, uh, a woman that's appearing to be tough, I mean, you would call it a masculine trait even though that doesn't mean that they're being a man. She's putting out a signal, right? Uh, a chick that, whereas like a leather jacket and rides a bike, she's putting out a signal like, you better be a bad motherfucker if you want this bitch or I'm going to girls into the previous. Could still apply to the latter. But, uh, it's, it's like, um, you know, I'm a bad motherfucker. All right, whatever, whatever vibe you're trying to put out there. And then you go and you're like, well, okay, what's bad motherfucker about you? I don't take no shit. Yeah, sure you do paper. I don't take any shit. My agent calls me. I tell them to fuck off.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       I walked in, I nailed that audition. I didn't even have any product in my hair. I don't give a fuck. You don't know me, man. I'm different. It's just, it's just a little, it's a casual observation. It's totally anecdotal, but it just seems like people are attempting to try. And it's like things I always tell people about looking at human history, I go the, the, the issues that we deal with, the things that affect us or not new just in a lot of ways are just more magnified there, especially with social media, social media, I believe like picks and praise on certain elements of our way of being, our process, uh, and it. And it heightens our responses to certain things. But it also heightens what we see from these responses because when somebody is, let's say, massively insecure, so social media can really pray, help play hell on that and make you feel more insecure, especially if you're putting, depending on where you're putting value on what you see or what is said about you or how you are necessarily if you're comparing yourself to others. Also, when you respond to that in some way through your own social media, be it by trying to take more grandiose photos or, or, or, I don't know, whatever sort of

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       signaling of, of how to make up for that. It shines even that much more to everybody else. So what you do get seen as much as you see what everybody else does and then you're given an option on how do you react to that? Well, if you're not, I mean these are the sort of. You can go back into old books on philosophy and uh, you know, old historical texts, insecurity is not going anywhere. We're not all that much more different from a thousand years of 2000 years of 3000 years. And the way we react and respond to things than we are now, it's just that all these things are amplified under the, the elements of technology that are around us and how they can affect us and how much easier it is for the, for those things to get to us. Radically amplified. I mean I see people fighting with people on Instagram, you know, see people fighting with commenters.

Speaker 3:          00:15:47       If someone posts something and then other people shit on them and then they, they take their posts and comment on that and, and you've got to go, this is like hours of your day man. And people just sniping at you for the clothes you're wearing or your fake lips or whatever it is, something right? And you, you, you could say, well, you know, you've got the person who's got a WHO's turned their social media to a very self absorbed sort of a platform. Right? A Lot, a lot. That's a lot. And then even in amongst that, it's like, well, I mean to a degree, if it's your social media and you are the prime element within it, of course it would be a bit self absorbed, but yeah, but I think there's more nuance to it than that. And it's not just to pick on say, you know, the gals that are taking all the sexy selfies and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:16:34       There's the dudes that do essentially the same equivalent and it's all in you. Often. It could be in a response to drive attention towards themselves, but what do you, why do you want that attention in the first place? And then of course that's something that you can't know until you know the person. Exactly. Well, a lot of girls make a living off of it. A 100 percent. Yeah. There's a lot of girls that they do like sponsored tweets or sponsored instagram posts at once. They can get foods are making a living off of instagram that way for like that got famous for girls. It's like girls with big asses and there's one girl that I just started following her whole instagram, her ass. That is it, man. I was thinking it was a terrible thing to think, but I was thinking if a dog ever came over and bit her ass, she'd be out of work. That's it. It's fucked up. She's have an arcane spray of of hugging gels. Shooting advert should have Kevlar pants on. Everywhere she goes. That asks Lloyd's of London. I have a. What will you give me per cheek on insurance. I mean she has a tremendous ass, don't get me wrong, but it's just weird when there's this like one here's body part that essentially defines your identity like this does, which, which is weirder that this, this person with this fantastic monumental, epic level ass is out

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       there taking photos of it and putting it out there for people to see or that people not only continuing to look at it but more flock to this. This a religious icon of an ass apparently. Yeah. Well it doesn't get old apparent. It never gets old. No, not for dudes. I mean for girls is there like one, but I guess it's abs isn't abs? Like what is the one body attorney? Jamie. Jamie, yeah. Hey, tell us about what the rules are. But for girls it's a wallet. Look how fat as long as it has an effect of fat watt. But uh, it will also, it wouldn't be surprised that women in terms of that, that kind of shallow aspect of social media in that way could, could make more impact out of it. Because even when you look at, say all the men's Mag, all the women's magazines, all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:18:40       And like women want to look at young women, right? So women are even driven to look at Honda. We're of course obviously driven to look at hot women. Well women know about filters to like, oh this bitch is using filters. Look at her. That is not what she looks like. She looks like a cartoon face look at her face and then they're trying to find out what filter that was. It felt a beauty filter. What Cameron does she use? Yeah. If a girl's found out that there was like one camera that really did it, it would be every girl would use that one phone that has that one camera. Exactly. Like they nailed it. I guess they're all pretty good now, but if there was like one standout phone that took better selfies, like that would be the one that they used. Oh, it would be a marketing avalanche towards that demographic for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       Your, your rear phone, like if you have a phone, the camera on the back. It's always more powerful than the selfie case. But the bigger lens and for chicks that's fucking bullshit. Like they need it. They need to reverse the other way. I need like multiple lenses. You can choose which one you need to. Like I know at my friends look like I see them. I want to see myself selfie sticks. If there was dudes only dudes on the planet, they'd be no selfie sticks. That shit would've never been invented. You don't think so? No. If we found. If it was only men and we found a guy with a selfie stick, that would be the guy who fucked like hold them down. This is this. Did you get injured? Is this a walking stick? It's a portable baton in case you get attacked. Are you using that to take photos inside of a bear cave because you've got to go in.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       Do you want to make sure we know where the Grizzly is? Are you a, you know, putting that thing around corners, the score that rabbit is and get it? Is that what you're doing? Because if not, I've got a problem with that. My arms are short dudes with selfie sticks. That is a dark thing. There's something about it like holding it up. Hey, I'm in front of a blah blah blah. Why is it, why does that bother you? It doesn't even make sense, like why is it okay for me to take a Selfie with a regular Selfie Lens? But it's a problem for dude as a selfie stick. I don't know. It just seems a bit obnoxious perhaps. Well, it seems that way. I can't say that I have a reason why it makes sense. Make me, hey, maybe it's simply because we view it as something that we see women do it more and so we, we think that a man is somehow doing something well.

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       It's like mentally, I don't know if a man gets fillers in his face. You ever see like a older dude gets fillers in his face and like, Bro, I didn't want to pull him aside. I'm sure I have. Yeah, you want to go? No, just don't. You're going to be wrinkled. This is just it. You're 65 years old. You got to let it go. It's letting go on its own anyways. But some, some gals can kind of pull it off and you feel bad for them, but they still are kind of pretty political, you know, personally myself, I'm not really all that into the. Especially manipulating the face like that for anyone. I just think that it's, it's one that the potential for it to go really badly, real. They're into it. Just I think that people. You don't have to look perfect to be a beautiful person.

Speaker 1:          00:21:49       Yeah. Yeah, your personality, your personality is at least as important as the way you look and if your personality is such that you need to shoot plastic in your face in order to feel good about yourself. You know, I've got to go, Ooh, like what? What's happened in their below, below the surface. It could be a indicator of something more serious that that no matter how much filler, how nice it could look. Maybe there's still gonna be an issue per se. It's also one of those things just like anorexia or bodybuilders that can never get big enough where they have body dysmorphia, people don't know what they really look like. Do you? Do you know about the FIBONACCI sequence? The numbers, right? It's the golden ratio. It actually applies to facial features. See if you can find something on that now to see documentary on that. Right, and at the time, and there was something about symmetry and Elizabeth Hurley when they made that thing was considered one of the most beautiful women in the world by the city, by the mathematics of it all. She still wanting them to be. I don't doubt it that chicks like 88 years old, she's still hot as fuck. She's rocking it. But something about the way your face is shaped. Um, you're, you're like, a good example is my friend Ari Shaffir already has a thin face in a long nose and it all works together. Like if he had my nose on his face, it would be like, hey, the fuck's wrong with your face.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       But the ratios of the width of his face and the length of his nose, the size of his eyes, all that stuff somehow or another syncs up. So you're saying it's not that any one thing, it's the sum of your parts. Yes, it's all those things go together. And if one of them is off, like say if your hair is golden ratio on the face. So if you are a, a black woman and you have white lips, like a white woman's lips, people are like, what the fuck is going on? Is she even whistle? Right? She's got a large nose or a wide nose. And you know, why grow this facial hair? No, hide my skinny little skinny lips. I can platelets lips. You got a viking lips, bro. I had been told that this is a. I've had some girls go, man, you're. You're actually in way better kiss for than I expected because you have almost.

Speaker 1:          00:24:04       It seems like you have no lips. I'm like, dad, someone told Kylie Jenner and that's why she got facial stuff. Yeah, I was reading that today. This is what kind of a loser I am. Fifty year old man with children. I fucking pay taxes. I got a lot of shit to do. Meanwhile, I'm reading some article about why Kylie Jenner decided to take all the filler out of her face. It was a fucking article on my google feed and I was like, what is this? Well, they know. They know what you're into. I guess they do. I don't know how they've got your tagged science fiction. How do they know? They know the inner workings of Joe Rogan will. Filler is a fairly recent thing in human history. As long as I've been around earlier with it. I mean I don't claim to know what's in it. What is filler?

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       Well, it's okay. Let's facial filler. Google that. What's in facial filler sand? Jb Weld. Pando gorilla come. Yeah, probably depending on what, how higher grade it is or and there's the freshest levels of the gorilla club. Does it feel like if they touch your face and you got some shit and then it makes your cheeks, some girls would look. They got rocked like their cheeks look injectable fillers with face. Oh Jesus. A hydraulic hyaluronic acid. Now seeing the college in a hyaluronic acid are both going to get absorbed into your system eventually. I think that's the good part about it is that it's temporary and then if you just let your body raising scour depressions, enhancing lips and replacing soft tissue volume lost your facial injections. Hm. Huh? Enhancing Lips. Huh? Get it done. But that's why it looks weird with girls when they have big fake lips because of the golden ratio.

Speaker 1:          00:25:42       Your face doesn't. It just doesn't work. Like go back to that article on the golden ratio of the face please. And you'll, you'll see like they have a. there's a whole mathematical sort of algorithm that they can use to sort of explain what is and is not normal. The, the shape of your face. Like look at um, what the fuck's his name? Angelina Jolie. You remember that song? There was a fucking song. Someone. There was a song, goddammit. This is like 2002 something like it was a song was Angelina Jolie got some big ass titties. The name of the song. It. Was that a big is that was that. Was that top 40 amongst me and my stupid fucking friends? It was, it was. It was a funny song. Like the dude who sang it. Is that, is that funny sober as well or. That's a good question and you'd have to ask somebody else. Those were the years from the. From 2000 when I was doing fear. Fact is that it

Speaker 4:          00:26:51       just stating the obvious is that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       Yes, it's got some big ass too. It's, it's just so stupid. From 2000 to two, somewhere around 2007. I think I was high every day. It's all a blur. It's just driving through a hug. I was so bored when I was doing fear factor that the only way I enjoyed it, it was high as fuck. You're enjoying all eating pig anuses and people screaming about having a centipede on their head and after awhile it got bored, got desensitized to it. It just didn't. I just can't watch general porn anymore. Right. It's like if there's not a robot

Speaker 3:          00:27:33       right in there, you know, having sex with a tiger while a midget films. It was clearly that stuff does happen. Right? Like there's a reason why people like gag porn is that rule 34 if there's not a point of it that uh, it, it, it, if you can think of it, there's a porn out there and 35 is if it doesn't exist, that shall be made. Yeah, that makes sense. It's a fortune thing. Not that I'm unfortunate all the time, but oh,

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       someone's going to an account. There's something about like, people getting desensitized that's fucking absolutely real. And that's one of the reasons why like in times of war, people are capable of doing more and more awful shit. It's like you get desensitized, you get normalized, like people are very malleable, you get accustomed to all sorts of things, send it to some of those things.

Speaker 3:          00:28:21       Don't necessarily stay forever. They're, they're subjective, you know, for that, that time in that moment and plus there is everything that's going around you. And, and if, if we're all in here and we're saying we're drinking coffee when you think that this is the way to be. And then other for everyone else are out and around us and like, well they're all drinking energy drinks, energy drinks are actually the best thing to do. Uh, well. Now there's this other thing that you see that perhaps then that bleeds into what? Oh No, let's do energy drinks instead. If you go from that to, you know, let's drink a grain alcohol, well maybe not.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       Well, yeah, I mean sure, people just imitate their atmosphere show

Speaker 3:          00:28:55       and if someone else is, you know, God and war and if they take one year, your, your teammates and then cut them to pieces and send them back to you, then all of a sudden you're going to do the same. And some, you know, reprisal. Yeah. Yeah. I used to know a dude who, uh, he was a mormon and Mormons aren't allowed to drink coffee. I thought you were going to go somewhere else. So I knew he was a mormon. He used to cut people a piece in the center. I know you didn't do any of that. I don't think. Well, I mean, Mormons, they're just so friendly. There's something got to be going on underneath. If

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       somethings there's a trigger that you got to find it, puts a hole in there. They get a hole in their magic underwear and they're just, that's it. But I would fucking place down. I offered them a cup of coffee and he's like, no, I can't drink coffee. And he had

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       a fucking. One of those huge monster energy drink. Seriously? Yeah. He was drinking them all day long to the point where he was having heart problems. He's kidding. Fucking heart palpitations. He was drinking. Oh No. It wasn't, wasn't monsters. It was rockstars wonder which one has more caffeine? Find out which one. I think Ryan has more caffeine than a monster. Monster's doable. Like I drink, I'll drink a sugar free monster during UFC broadcasts at the times I drink those during the, uh, the new Japan shows there for hours. Yeah. But the problem is you got to piss whatever's in there. Goes right to your system like that. Caffeine ain't helping. Goldberg used to drink those fucking things like they were water and he was always pinging. Both monster and Rockstar have the same amount of caffeine per serving, which is eight 80 milligrams per eight ounces. Yeah. But what?

Speaker 3:          00:30:30       Haiti is not that A. Wow. That's crazy. That's our list as being 2:40 at or, or something around there at the whole can and monster list as being 1:32. This is to 70 g whoa. How these little bad boys or two seven. Goddammit tate. He kind of made me jump out of his chair. Case turned tape. Try to give people heart attacks, shadowed tait fletcher. Shout out to take Fletcher and caveman coffee. Yeah. Um, there's a weird. People are weird with trends, right? Like whatever the fuck happened. The acid wash jeans. I was thinking that the other day, like people used to love acid washed jeans. Remember they'd walk around with genes with all spoiled us all over. They're kind of making a bit of a comeback. Yeah. Like fanny packs. Yep. In the same. You were ahead of the curve way ahead of curve. I never left.

Speaker 3:          00:31:20       You're basically a late eighties pro wrestler. Yeah. Right. Like home cogan. Like hold Bogan. Like, yeah, right here. Ladies and gentlemen. This bitch never left my side. All leather never left my side. This is real. It was made from a big horn sheep that you, uh, you tracked down with an Arrow. I wish I should get one mate. I've got these access deer hides out there. I should get one turn into a fanny pack. That'd be dope. Before on it. Fuck. Yeah. Right. Yeah. I hope you don't get any ticks. No, there's no tax on those. I don't think they have ticks in Hawaii.

Speaker 3:          00:31:54       But uh, it's weird, you know. But that's the thing about paradigms is you don't really realize it's when the paradigm is over until you're out of it. Right. And so we're in a paradigm now of some sort and it's easy to get lost in that and not be able to see outside of it. What do you think is happening now that will be ridiculed in the future? I'm tough. I mean, I didn't think that in a lot of ways we would end up to where we are at this point and so many of the social and cultural elements and that didn't even just specifically stay within the u s but seemed to be bleeding throughout all of western society and civilization at large. I got one word, yeezys yeezys. Yeezys be marked

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       with that says that's a shoe, right? That's just for Jamie. He loves those fucking things. He bought me a pair. I won't wear them. I told them, next time I go running in the creeks, I'm going to wear him. Jamie loves these God damn thing. So I'm not. So I'm trying them on. That's still got the foam thing and there bro. Put them off. Nope, come on. That looks like a sneaker from the eighties, right? I wouldn't even say that. What would you say this, by the way, you're talking to a real man here. That's okay. I understand this. I understand this like the bottom of a. of a fucking cycle of a form home. Coleman coolers. Yeah. That's just the bottom part. The ultra. The ultra. What is this? Like a glorified fucking water sock. This is like the thing. You see some, some doofus with a those, a frog skin things on his glasses to keep from falling.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       Always wandering around in the. You know, I don't want to get too wet. So you wouldn't wear those. No. Weird. Here's what I. where we're at. How manly men were these. That's right. Chuck Taylor. Custom chucks with my logo on the side as was drawn by Dan [inaudible] and look at that. A skulls and shit like this. God damn dirty, stinky chuck. I wear black metal tee shirts. Look at that. See that chuck's Goddamn classics. Jamie, not this. What is this a fuck's going on here? Comfort. Comfortable trucks while I'm wearing. I'm like, damn, I should probably put these on when no one's looking. Goddamn being like you're just wearing Angelina Jolie's titties, right? Big Ass souls. Yeah. They look comfortable. Stop pitcher filters. I could see jp and some disease. What's that? Legacy JP and some yeezys jp? Yeah, Jordan Peterson. Peterson. Oh yeah. I could see him wearing some atrocious sandals and no one's looking man that you'd have to talk to them to, to, to do good. Take those off with a. with some wool socks on. Yeah. Jamie and I were talking about this the other day. You're allowed to wear socks with slides. No slides, so there's no right. There's no toe. You're allowed to. Who says guys wear them all the time. Fuck that noise.

Speaker 1:          00:35:12       The fuck. Is that about? I don't know. It's a thing loud. No, it's not allowed guys wear them all the toe. Keep your socks out of your sandals. We were just in Vegas and there was some basketball thing going on there. There was a bunch of basketball players. Okay. Half of them slides. Here's the deal with that though, and it's. I can at least say as an athlete that maybe they've got the slides on because they're going to take those slides off and

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       put their basketball shoes right on. So for them it's like I'm, I'm, I'm out of uniform at the moment, but I'm ready to go to combat basketball wise at any moment. I don't know. But in general, as far as a fashion trend, fuck that noise. But it looks ridiculous

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       amongst like rappers see rappers wearing those things with socks, it just looks like he just, I don't know, like you've given up. Yeah, kind of just wear sweatpants all day too. Like you're a dude with a wife beater with your gut hanging out of the bottom of it and you just fucking kicking back.

Speaker 3:          00:36:08       Fuck it. I don't only. I can't even bend over and tie my shoes class for the velcro on my yeezys. Yeah. Yeah. Don't velcro. Well, you know, I guess I guess you don't need a real shoe. If you throw on, you walk out with your socks on and you throw on your sliders and get on your hoverboard are fucking what your electric scooter.

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       Would you ever drive a tesla?

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       Uh, I would drive a tesla, uh, but you know, here's, I got one of my beefs, not with Tesla's per se in any way, but I would say we're talking about cars as somebody, uh, out and about, and they'll, we'll have some conversation and uh, I'll bring up some car or talking about something like the dodge now wasn't a demon when the hell cat came out. And so like, Oh yeah, those, those hellcats I've heard amazing things about how, not only is it obviously incredibly powerful and fast, but that they're massively comfortable. You could, it's a gt car. You could grand tour all over the US and become free of the whole time and yeah. And they're like, oh, but what about the Tesla? I'm like, um, that's another 40 to $50,000 more. Oh, it's almost, I heard it's as fast if not faster. I go, if I'm paying over 100 fucking thousand dollars for a car, get better, be fast, it better have all this shit like, and I would talk about certain other in a lot of times it's like my firebird doesn't cost that much.

Speaker 3:          00:37:33       Dude, I don't care if that Tesla winds, you just spent $150,000 on a car. Okay, well what if cost wasn't an option? What if Elon Musk, if I'm elon musk, I'm, well God, I don't think he can not drive a tesla. He's out there and have a goddamn three inch exhaust for 70, you know, big block I, Pontiac people are like, what the fuck? Yeah, he probably can't drive anything but Tesla and Oh, what a trap. Yeah, for real. But wish I would rather I would rather drive a car. I don't feel like electric cars have soul. They don't have any. There's nothing that doesn't

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       the beep. Boop, boop, boop up in the little printer comes out and I just doesn't do it for me. Well, they're really cool, but at the end of the day, the problem, the problem is it feels good to hear the rumble of it. Engine to me in the fucking put that clutch in and pop that gear. What does that Elan's to gas cars. He owns a Jag Jag. That's an old jag. That's a hard top. It's probably a [inaudible] actually. Those are amazing. First love. Wow. Oh, it's a roadster. Okay, so that top pops off. Wow. That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:38:49       That's shaped man. Look edible. What year was that? Oh yeah, that's

Speaker 1:          00:38:56       sixties. Sixty, 70, 67 and it's a gorgeous. So pretty. Let me see that picture again. Scroll down. Oh, look at that. Yeah, but there's something about the sound of combustion engines. Just. It's so magnetic. Teslas are cool. They're silent. The that. I'm sure they're incredibly comfortable. Oh yeah. And that pad that they. Big Ass ipad that you have where your navigation screen is, I mean, is the shit while you're driving and that thing and you just ask it to play songs and it pulls them up on spotify. I'm also a little bit

Speaker 2:          00:39:31       weirded out by the over elect tronic element of modern life. I, I realized the usefulness of it, but I always think about, you know, when some shit goes south, like I can't just fix it and we keep going or if something goes bad it could go bad and a lot of different ways and there's a chain of command of bad that, that it's all linked to that it could go to as well. And so I'm just like, Eh, just doesn't that. Plus when you talk about engines, alright you, you start up your porsche startup event, you start up an ls motor and then you started up next to a big block pontiac. You started up next to a big block. Ford and everything has a different feel, a different different cam that's in it makes it sound different, makes it operate different. The exhaust, it's on everything changes based on all kinds of different elements. And so the, the car even of itself, not just the exterior of it, but the internal is make it seem like a different vehicle. Yeah, for sure. Like have you ever been around Ferrari a? Not a ton, no, but I know they have.

Speaker 1:          00:40:33       They got the salad. They had their own Aston Martin is famous for having. It's a very specific exhaust. There's sounds that they have. It's like a celebration. It's like better not drive it too far because it's probably going to break before the next 12 minutes. This is fantastic. Nothing like it. The way they sound like I used to love top gear with Jeremy Clarkson. Show was the best. Whoever he punched, he said, sorry. The showbread get over it. Fuck is wrong. BBC conscious slap. It's what you were talking about earlier. People are pussified there. Pussified there. They're playing tough. They're doing a Goddamn car show with a bunch of men drinking booze. You guys got in a fight and you got hit. Take a little settlement. Move on. Give them an apology or, or even just say, Hey, let me hit you one back. Fine. I wish I was there.

Speaker 1:          00:41:29       And Jeremy, how much money you got? What you got in the bank? Got $70,000,000. A million people wanting to sort of live at parents' house for the rest of their life, except then it goes from being mom and dad to them being a state of some sort that does all your work for you because you don't want to have to take the responsibility of either winning or losing that confrontation. Maybe. Well, I think he just got punched. Was a drunk asshole. Maybe so. But if it's on Jeremy, he could just go to me like, all right dude, I'm gonna get one on you. Yeah, it's and it's even we're done. Move on with my life. But what if the guy can fucking crack with Paul Dale daily? Shouldn't have fucking hit him. Then he shouldn't have fucking hit him. He hit a barrier. All. Well, that's the realm of people that don't practice martial arts.

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       Like how many people get drunk and get in fistfights that actually know how to fight. It's pretty small. According to the Internet. It's real small. He watches the district videos idea what they're doing. You know, they think it's, I'm always amazed at people's, uh, overestimation of what they can do with their body, especially in pr and went to pertains to animals, like what you would do if an animal's coming at you or like, you know what? My favorite thing to watch is one of my favorite things in the last couple of weeks. I got to stop. I watched fucking running with the bowls. Oh Man. When is that? Actually this week I think I have a bunch of friends over there. They're going to do that. Call them, call them, tell them you love them to get the fuck out there. Don't do it. Hey, let's, let's, uh, let's get this two ton animal.

Speaker 1:          00:43:05       Don't think people understand a how strong those things are. And B, how shitty their body works. People have this idea that, come at me, bro. I'm going to fuck it. Just get it out of the winning. Just sidestep it. Yeah. Meanwhile, you're on these slick beer soaked. What is this, Jamie? This is the end of it right now. The sixth of the 14. What's happening right now? I can't believe it. I've been watching videos. I didn't know it was actually live. This is so fucking insane. This is so insane. People are so insane. What if it gets a beat on you and then all of a sudden like A. Nope. You're the only one out of this entire crowd of 500 people right now that it wants to Gore. Oh yeah. Well, I mean if it finds one that sits still, it's going have tickets, frustrations out.

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       And the crazy thing is, hey, look how many people were there watching this and watching these fools running around in the middle of this bull fight. I want to see someone get fucked up by a bull. Have you ever watched a bullfight? Uh, I have not. I have seen plenty of clips. Footage of it. What? Have you remember watching a bullfight yeah. I'm not interested. Didn't, doesn't really do anything for me. No. I mean I, I can up until the point of, of, of killing it, right? I. Okay. You want to go out there and dodge a bull? A seems like a bad idea, but all right. But then you. All right. You've already proven that you can maneuver yourself out of the way. No need to spirit and kill it. It also seems to me that I know it's tradition. I know it comes from a different era. I know I understand that and so I'm not going to here and then just like

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       go railroading bullfighting necessarily. Position is tradition to know there's a lot of things that are pretty successful. Yeah, it was horrific traditions. It just seems to me to be a a bastardization of our relationship with animals. Like even. I don't think there's anything wrong with domesticated animals, but obviously factory farming is this disgusting. It's nasty shit. Why? Why do it? And there is no I. it's possible to have animals that are able to live a more natural way of life than it is to to jam into a cage and force feed them until. I don't know if it's possible to do it the way we've been doing it, but the real problem is the way we expect to be able to just go to Jack in the box and get a burger. Well, we eat too much meat. Yeah. In general, I think that your average person doesn't need to eat nearly as much fucking varieties of meat as they do.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       They need, they definitely need meat in their diet, I believe on average. Do you know about the carnivore diet? Now? See, here's the thing. I've been uh, uh, I heard you talking to Joel, you've talked a lot about and then Jordan Peterson and his, his daughter. Oh, I talked about it with Chris Bell First who's been on it for, I think he's been on it for at least six months or so, and he's having radical improvements and one of the reasons that he's having improvements and then Jordan's having tremendous results. And Jordan's daughter as well is arthritis. They all have arthritis. Like Chris Bell has two artificial hips. I don't doubt it. Trying to be that market. Smelly markers smelly. Chris Chris's bore Chris Board Bell and Chris is the one who produced bigger, stronger, faster. I met Chris. I've met. I've actually never met mark the person. Chris is a fantastic always guys backward baseball cap on.

Speaker 3:          00:46:22       Yeah. They're both fantastic guys and really, really smart and just Chris has suffered from serious, debilitating arthritis and pain in his joints his whole life. Having a carnivore diet, knocked it out for them and that's the only thing I was familiar with, the ketogenic diet and all that kind of stuff and and having a higher. It works for me as well to be honest, to eat that way. My, my problem is my love affair with fucking breads. You're out there getting a coffee maybe in the morning like, damn, that looks like an amazing croissant right now. How it looks even better in my face. He's like a chocolate croissant. I do like the chocolate croissants. You know who's got the best ones? Coffee Bean though. Starbucks ones can suck my dick. You know what I don't eat. I don't eat. I'm a Seattle Guy, but I don't need starbucks for science.

Speaker 3:          00:47:08       You don't know. They're terrible. They used to be okay. They used to be pretty good. You know when they went south and they started putting them in plastic bags, they give them to you. They're already sealed up in a plastic bag back. No one's at coffee bean. Have way more chocolate in them. They're thick. If you're going to go deep, go deep. That's what I say. I go to the off, you know the non chain coffee shops that that will like a coffee, coffee and food and coffee. Commissary faced down the street here, a Russian bakery. These truck croissants will knock your deck right into the dirt and bet. Ooh, they're thick, rich and delicious. Yeah, I'll go get her number for them. I got good coffee type. I, if I, if I stick to eating in a more ketogenic way, it's, I feel better.

Speaker 3:          00:47:53       My joints hurt less. Uh, I lose fat easier, but I still can, can put on muscle mass. It's, it is a better way for me to eat. And I don't know if there is something about our genetic makeups, say meet you JP. We probably have some crossover similarity there. Yeah. I don't know if there's anything to do with that. I just know that it's been useful to me and I've seen it be, you know, that's the way you eat. I've seen, I've heard Jordan talk about his daughter and how useful it's been for her and as you another one, I mean she's had her ankle replacement or hip replacement. It's like an autoimmune thing as does he. It's the same, same exact issue. And an autoimmune issue is also what this radical arthritis's. There's so many people have these issues and these are isolated incidences, you know, isolated issues that people have, but you know, I know people that thrive.

Speaker 3:          00:48:44       A vegetarian diets. I have no problem with it. Yeah, a vegetarian is a way to go for a lot of people that are thinking about being vegan. Don't be scared of eggs, folks. Just get eggs are good for you. Eggs are great for you. Just every, all this fucking Peta propaganda where they call them chicken periods. Look, if you don't want to kill animals, I get it. I get it. I told her, I love animals. Get free range eggs. You can get them at the fucking farmer's market and they have a dark orange yolk and they're fucking great for amazing. And the chickens don't even notice they're gone. They don't give a fuck. No chicken is going to have eggs no matter what. They just lay them, unless there's a rooster that to, uh, to fertilize it. They just got to fucking lay eggs. It's just free food.

Speaker 3:          00:49:23       It's like a gift that they give you. A keystone chickens. Fuck, I had six eggs this morning for breakfast. They're incredible. They're thicker and heavier and it's actually good for you. And of all things, one of chickens, one of their favorite little snacks. That's something that they just absolutely love. Eggs. Chickens, chickens love scrambled eggs. Yeah. You know what they really love? They love shells. They love the shells. Shells. Yeah. No, they love more than that. Mice, mice, lizard. Tail. Fuck. Vicious little fuckers. Yeah. But you know what they don't fuck with squirrels. Well, they're a little big, but yeah. But they just don't even try like squirrels, like a rat, you know? It's basically a rat. Everybody loves squirrels. Even chickens. Step bushy tail. It's crazy. That bushy tails all. You needed that cute haircut. Like this little snap and awake and uh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:50:15       Well, I had a, I had four chickens and one time, uh, there was a little miniature Chihuahua, a little chihuahua or a little mini docs and maybe are many men. It was a min pin and it got into the yard and ended up in the backyard and the four chickens cornered it and wouldn't let it leave and so it's back there whining and yelping and eventually, uh, my ex at the time went and caught the dog and then try to figure out whose it was and what have you. And it turned out it was chipped, I think in you got given somewhere where someone could then track them down, but it was just hilarious that these chickens were like, fuck you, motherfucker. You're in the wrong place. You know else? Love squirrels. My dog. That's a different animal all together. Yeah. Marshall, they hardly ever catch him though.

Speaker 3:          00:51:03       He got that one. It was like this sweet golden retriever. That's kind dog who loves everybody. Yeah. He likes fucking up squirrels too. Well, the problem is the squirrels go into the chicken coop. They'll find a way into the chicken coop and they steal all the chickens for food and Marshall just decided to wait outside of the chicken coop because he knew where the hole was. I just sit in there and snatched that motherfucker and then just with the biggest shit eating grin on his face. Yeah. Mrs. Rogan does not like the squirrels. She doesn't like the squirrels getting into the chicken food. To me, I feel like we just buy more chicken food, poor little squirrels that they're hustling. It's hard life being a squirrel. It is just trying to get these, you know, trends trying to get by trying to live your life are out there.

Speaker 3:          00:51:44       They all have this peer pressure from all these other squirrels. And then he started smoking young. Yeah. They find this sweet spot where all these fucking nuts and all this grain is like, this is amazing. Yeah. Squirrel gang. I can tell when they fucked up though, they start stealing eggs. They still stealing eggs. These cops were trying to roll eggs out of the chicken coop. That's when she got mad. Yeah. I, I had no idea that squirrels ate eggs and then we started finding videos online. Jamie pulled a bunch of videos of squirrels, role in chicken eggs out of a chamber. Heard of that either. They didn't have the motherfuckers we, they have. We have egg boxes. They're elevated egg boxes. Okay. The egg boxes like two and a half, three feet off the ground. Squirrels got up into the egg box, got the egg, chucked it out of the egg box, lands on the ground.

Speaker 3:          00:52:26       The getting it in their own egg. They're clever. Little fucker's sneaky and they're cute. So they're like, I can get away with anything. They do get away with more. Like rats must be like, what in the fuck man, this shit. We were wasting water and yet people get fucked. Just stab as left and right. Yeah. There's no industry for Squirrel killen like, no, not really. Maybe in the deep south. And that's not an industry out there. They get their mortgage is paid by killing rats. Like they're driving around in a nice car from killing rats. Nolan and nobody cared. Nobody feels bad. Like, Oh, I'm an exterminator. We're all racist when it comes to certain animals and bugs, right? People collect butterflies. Nobody stomp roaches, everybody stomps, roaches, swats, mosquitoes, mosquitoes, those things. They will give you everything. Know all kinds of diseases and shaken gay fever, malaria, and the only, the only part of the mosquitoes life I enjoy or think is interesting is when their larva and they're these fucking vicious little things at these giant hook

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       teeth that will, can even eat little fish and all that kind of stuff. In the ponds too. When I first moved to California, I rented this house in Encino and nobody lived in it for like a year and a half, two years, something like that. And they had a pool in the backyard that was just sitting there with Gerald Gamma Green. There was schools of mosquito larva swimming around like fish. I went out into the yard. I was like, what the fuck is that? And the guy was like, oh, we'll take care of that. I go, what is that? That's you poisoned. She's just pour bleach into it. Yeah. Well the first thing you do is you bleach it. Then you've got to drain it. You gotta you gotTa, take all this Goop, all that shit out. Yeah. You got to drain all that water out. They had to bring it like a machine and then they had a clean all the fucking the bottom of the pool. It was all green and funky. But the crazy thing is they were moving through the water, like, you know, I see those, those big flocks of birds and they all move together. They were doing that in the water. There was fucking thousands of them. It was crazy. But then they didn't grow legs. It would have been a real problem. It would have been a real problem that got out and started flying around. I would have got fucked.

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       Yup. There's a meme out there and it's, I think it's a, it's a picture, um, and it's repeated in, in, on the bottom as well. Have a pita billboard and it's got a, you know, these animals all sitting and standing in a line and it says, where do you draw the line between food and friends or whatever. And then someone else has and they've got the same thing down there and it's like a, you know, this is normal food. There's a catastrophic event apocalypse.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       I've seen that, I've seen that. Yeah. Well, you know, being a vegetarian or Vegan is a very. It's a very first world option. The reason why people got to this point is because we figured out a way to survive eating all the animals around us, just like they figured out a way to survive eating the animals around. Well I need the argument that Oh, well this culture is mostly vegetarian revere this or that. And it's like, okay, well it's also highly developed based on what was available. I didn't just say I don't want to hurt the animals. Well the only people that did is the Hindu. Hindus are fascinating, you know, and there's a lot of speculation as to wash the agriculture civilization. Yeah. At certain points in time in comparison to the rest of the world. Oh yeah. I mean you go back and read the Bhagavad Gita.

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       I mean they had some really complex philosophy and really interesting thoughts about the universe. But a lot of people believe that that was due to psychedelic drugs and one of the, one of the reasons why they believed they had this interesting relationship with cattle but not with lamb was because cattle shit would grow magic mushrooms on it. This is because so much is a big part of the ancient Hindu folklore and their religion and their ancient texts, they talk about Soma and Soma was some sort of a psychedelic mixture and they don't know exactly what it was, but they know that Hindus, the, um, like a lot of the ancient Hindu text, they deal with some sacraments and they know that they were into hash. And like a lot of the Yogis, Assad dues, they're into chillums. They smoke chillums of Hash. So they knew they were in the hash, but they think that their aversion to eating cows may have had something to do with the fact that these cows would shit.

Speaker 1:          00:56:53       And then the mushrooms grow other shit. And then they would eat these mushrooms and have these profound experiences. And so that these, they thought of these cows as conduits to God. Right? But then there's also the probably drank the milk, you know, they probably used them to plow the fields to grow their food. So it's, it's real. It's interesting because when a, when a culture has an aversion to eating a very specific animal and that specific animal also is the main source of psychedelic mushrooms to, to ignore that connection seems a little bit weird. No, I don't think it's arbitrary. I think it's something that would be worth investigating, right? I mean, why not? Worst case scenario come down to you have to figure out if something else. But we'll look at Shiva like, right. You see that picture of Shiva? The Shiva has his arms, six arms and Shiva standing on like a little.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       It looks like a baby. And I always, I am like, I have a giant bronze Shiva in my house. And when I bought it, the lady said, uh, this, uh, Shiva is standing on ignorance. This is what it's supposed to be. I go, I thought ignorance would be way bigger than that. It felt like an ignorance will be like a dragon. That Shiva was like fighting. It was much larger than him, but when you that that thing that she was doing, that's what happens when you trip your balls off. Okay. If you trip balls and you were started moving your arms around, I would think Josh, partner, it's got six on that. I mean there's so much of ancient Hindu artwork that is a. I thought they were just fan in a bad fart. Could be that. Could it be that Jesus. That's what we'll all have a fire around it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:27       Maybe that's what it is. They're lightened matches, but the like ancient Hindu art. There's. There's this a iconography. There's like these iconic imagery, this iconic imagery that you see when you do psychedelics. You see a lot of this stuff, particularly on mushrooms for some reason. You'll see like ancient Hindu and sometimes ancient Egyptian shit too. I know. You know, you can see. You'll see a geometric shapes appear out of and you know, to me I'm just like, well that's just what you see when you're poisoned, but it's a great. It's an interesting way of looking at it, but it's not poison. That's the thing about it. It's the way it's affecting the way your visual processing perturbance of your visual cortex. Yeah, but it's not poisoned. That's the crazy thing. It's like the ld 50 of mushrooms. It's almost impossible to eat yourself to death. Like you'd have to eat your own body weight, like you would get way too stuff. Put them inside those fucking croissants.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       So Catholic the songs, now you're talking, it might be the move. So somebody with monster, that's a term that has continued to go throughout a. yeah, it's like a sleeping pill now. And then it was also a major element within all this Huxley's brave new world, which uh, I am. That was based on that I probably. So I'm firmly of the belief that what we're living in is not a Orwellian, a potential desktop dystopic future. We're living in a Huxley version because Huxley and Orwell was sought from two different ways and in orwell was more of the, there would be force and violence and, and direct suppression of individuals and groups and retrain. Now there is thought policing and, and you know, even though they call them equity, diversity, whatever departments. I mean, there are people that are there to, you know, they have these cabals that, that try to force everybody to be in line, but it's, you know, they're not necessarily gassing folks are beating on them or what have your shock therapy. However, Huxley's version of how this would all go badly was that everybody would be so comfortable that there would be so much luxury and pleasure and that you would just not fight back. Yeah. Anything that they would try to impart upon you though, the way they would get you to do is just make your life even softer and even easier.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       Yeah. Huxley was right in that regard. And also all there's so little danger in the world and so little real drama that we look for drama. Of course, we look forward to all over the place we've made the world's going on most of the world. Very, very safe, especially for, at least for us in Western first world nations. There's something that Dave Rubin tweeted today, see if you could find this. Um, it's real reason that I don't think so. Now the mayor of Durham, uh, apparently said something about Jordan Peterson, that Jordan Peterson is not welcome in Durham, North Carolina because of his transphobic and racist views. What? Yeah. What? Let's see. I can't read. That man can make that a little larger. What a fucking misrepresented person. Jordan Peterson has become just. Well, it's got to be very strange. We believe that Durham is a place for all of us. Black, white, Asian, Latin X. Oh, I like how you went latinex instead of Latino, because if you say a lot to next, it's like Latina, Latino. You get all the other Latino's. Yeah. I'm not taking any chances. Indigenous and mixed race, Trans and CIS sisters in the real word. You're getting crazy. Mayor. Gay and lesbian. Queer and straight scissor thing. Queer to cover all of it anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:02:09       I'm always confused by that. It got very open vague term. I mean, and maybe there is a in there. Maybe there's some sort of accepted standard for what? What defines queer versus

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       getting an asexual. Is that all right? How come you didn't put that in the asexual people? You should march out now. They're attack the asexual activist lobbies coming from those who seek to exclude or deny the humanity of others will find was interesting. That's an interesting statement that people like to make deny the humanity like who said that you who's denying your humanity even even assholes, right? I mean even some of this is just a prick. It's like they can't. You just heard it and responded to it. You're living the life that you want to live. How can they deny your humanity will look at this? We wish to emphasize that a person's right to free speech does not include the right to a platform or an audience. Well, here's the thing. You can't deny that people are listening to him and enjoy his work, but if you're gonna make these broad statements.

Speaker 3:          01:03:09       You have to have some sort of evidence to back up what you're saying. I know Jordan Peterson and he's definitely not a racist. No, he's definitely not transphobic or homophobic or any of those things. He was against compelled speech. Jesse compelled speech, state compelled speech, meaning that there was a bunch of different words that they were forcing people to use that where these new gender pronouns and they were compelling and they have human rights councils in Canada and he is, he's a mean. He's a clinical psychologist and he's very well read and he understands like Marxism and all the Pid postmodernism in neo Marxism and its evolution from classical Marxism and how it's been influenced. The difference between emphasizing the infrastructure over the base. Just virtue signaling in its worst form. I am a, uh, very, very familiar with jps work. He actually sent me a copy of his book through twitter.

Speaker 3:          01:04:04       Oh, that's amazing. Which was fantastic. But the way I came across Jordan Peterson was that as a big fan of nature and his philosophical writings, so I'd go on Youtube to see if I could find lectures on nature and in his maps of meaning lectures. And this was before any of the like, uh, the issues with BLC 16 really. I didn't know about any of that. I was just listening to Jordan Peterson lectures because of him referencing and talking about Nisha, so and then from Nietzsche, Dostoevsky and all this, and then it started talk a lot about Marxism and communism and postmodernism in reference to each other in other ways and then the [inaudible] stuff. And then I was living with a Marxist for awhile. So I started. Are you really? Yes. Oh Jesus. Yeah. It was not fun. So. But at the same time I had to try to understand what the arguments that were being made and why.

Speaker 3:          01:04:55       And so you got to go research them. So if someone says, oh, the wage gap, blah blah blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, okay, well I guess I need to look up the research on what that is. Then you come back and you go, oh well that's actually not an apples for apples comparison and it's not 70 percent on the dollar and you just go into it and then they just look at you and they go, no. It's like I, I read, what's your source? Well, this thing I read that source, it doesn't talk about education level job for job hours work like it does. It doesn't. I mean no one's saying that things couldn't be better. It's just different. Heard this argument before, when you hear about the wage gap, the gender wage gap, it's not the people doing the same job. That's what's this.

Speaker 3:          01:05:38       This is the best way to them. It's not people doing the same job and it's not people working the same hours. The reason why men make more money as they do different jobs now are those jobs more difficult for women to get is a real question. Some of them I imagine they are perhaps. I mean I never doubt that there is a potential sexism or any sort of ism to some degree in some sexism coming from both sides of the tracks. How many women want to be working on a fucking oil rig out in the middle of or doing pipelines up in a frozen south, North Dakota or something, and they did, and how many of them are physically capable of doing the work to which isn't a woman's fault at all and you can't. I wouldn't hold it against anybody or. And if they didn't, if they did, did not want to choose to do that kind of employment.

Speaker 3:          01:06:20       There's nothing wrong with that either. No. You know, if a woman wanted to go off and make artisans soap, right? That motherfucker could make the best soap with essential oils that are the best for like, you know, like how you use the fence soap stuff. Like if that was a woman that came and created all of that, that's a valuable, respectable, fantastic thing that they just didn't require physical strength anyway. Don't, don't diminish the compliments of someone else just because it doesn't fit what you think is. Well, the problem is when we get into teams, man mean toxic tribalism is the real problem. The real problem is people getting teams, whether it's male versus female and this mayor of Durham Guarantee, well it's a lot of this stuff is weaponized. So most of the stuff about the patriarchy, which I'm also in ingredients with Jordan Peterson, you know, that doesn't exist.

Speaker 3:          01:07:07       That's not the way that human history has has rolled out. I don't buy that at all. Not to end or the wage cap. These are weaponized things. They use them in a weaponized way to try and destroy your, your argument or your position or your way of being. It's a weaponized administrator point of view by saying it's what's your white privilege talking? Sometimes I get a lot of white privilege today. I'm so white, a big white, very, very white with a red beard from the Pacific northwest. How much? How much can you get any white? But if I get any wider, I'm going to be wearing a fucking birkenstocks with socks on. You should have a tail and a man bun is a bowl, a ponytail. But, uh, it's, it's, uh, these are, these terms are used in, in, in conflict. Well, and when, why wouldn't they be? Because most of the, the source material, the creation of the, these sort of ideological viewpoints are from postmodernist, neo, Marxism, and it's all based on the concept of conflict theory. So there's always going to be an oppressor and oppressed. So if what you are doing is, uh, is trying to

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       argue with or even just make your case to someone who's an oppressor, well it would be weaponized because as far as you're concerned, everything they do is weaponized against you. Right? So you've already chosen a confrontational position.

Speaker 5:          01:08:30       There's also a problem with people wanting to be. Right. That's human nature. But I also like, whether it's someone who's a postmodernist or someone who is a staunch conservative, people go into any discussion with a presuppose or they have a preordained or are they have a collected group of ideas that they have attached themselves to and they do not want to let those go. No, and you have yours and I have mine. It's very difficult for people to just talk and very difficult for people to just someone to lay out their their position and someone else to lay out their position and to people to like cordially discuss the merits of each position with an open mind. It happens so rarely and it's something I try so hard to do and it's something that it took me years to cultivate the mindset to not, not have these preexisting conditions, preexisting ideas or if I do have them, don't attach myself to them and be ready to abandon them at any moment. Like under the, under new evidence.

Speaker 2:          01:09:32       Sure. And it's, there's no problem in saying, okay, well I believe a new believer B and we both believed them to be correct. Well, tell me why I am, why a is incorrect or better yet. Tell me why you believe what you believe and you know, let me get into some reason. What are the facts and let's find if those facts are real. It's right. And I used to, you know, I'd have these conversations with this person used to that I was living with. I would say like, well, you just always have to be right. I go, no, no, no, I don't have to be right, but if you're going to make a claim, you're going to have to defend your argument and I'll defend mind, but ultimately I don't care if I'm wrong because being wrong only means that I could then perhaps work towards a way of being, the having the most understanding that I can have.

Speaker 2:          01:10:20       We as human beings are wrong so much more than we're ever right, but by being wrong, but by making mistakes, it's like a through martial arts by being on the mats and you know, God, I'm going to get this guy's ankle right now. Oh, fuck that up. I fucked that up. I got caught up. Fuck that up. You can't get to the point to where you're like, oh, this is how you set it up. This is the way that you can. I wasn't securing the knee well enough so it was always sliding out of position and I couldn't, you know, keep the leg framed in such a position where when I applied my hold, the pressure went through the joint that I needed it to. Nothing. None of that happens until you make mistake after mistake, after mistake after mistake, and there's nothing wrong with, with before making a move, moving forward on something to sit back and to study a little bit and to try and understand somewhat of the landscape, but eventually the only thing you could do is you just got to go, right. You know, analysis paralysis through analysis isn't gonna help you either.

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       Well, I lived a good portion of my life wanting to be right always. Sure, and it's a toxic mindset. It's terrible for you. It's terrible for you because you don't grow and then you have to live in denial and then you have to always tell yourself that you were right and they were wrong. Even if you get out debated or even if you're faced with new evidence, you, you try to ignore that new evidence. I know the mindset, I, I lived in it for many, many good to be in. It's an easy place to normal and it's hard to. It's hard to relax yourself. Just realize that you are not facts. You are not your ideas, your not your opinions, your, your you, and if you attach yourself to these opinions, these ideas like you're going to, it's a fucking trap. Like you have to know what, like here's, here's something I know for a fact, this wood is hard, but I've hit this, would meet with my knuckles.

Speaker 5:          01:12:03       That shit's hard. If it dropped on you, it would hurt. These are undeniable facts and the. There's a gang of those that you have in the world. There's a gang of undeniable facts. What I cut down. Objectivity. Yeah. Whether or not Marxism can be successfully implemented in the large scale with a, a sensitive, compassionate group of human beings that all live together. Who Kenneth, I don't know. Doesn't seem to be. Yeah. Well, I don't know though. See what I'm saying? Like this is a, this is a comp. It hasn't been done before. A socialism never really worked, but can it work? Did the argument that it can't work. It seems to me that doesn't make any sense either. Like maybe you could work well the argument that it could work is that but, but see what I'm saying like these are. These are like really to think about Rod. Yeah. Complex nuanced concepts that need to be discussed up and down and back and forth and you also need to look at the weight of human history, the myriad times it's failed,

Speaker 2:          01:13:00       right? And in human history and even in ways that, which is not directly related to say Marxism, but just to look at patterns and trends and ways of people of operating and to see how okay, well given a different circumstance, how would that process work within this one or this one or this one or this one. And then even if you wanted to say, well, if you're like, well I don't think Marxism would work well you can't say that until you actually study what Marxism is and what its principles are. Because if you don't understand the argument, and this is like, you know John, John Stuart Mill, you can't just defend your side without knowledge of the other. Yes. You have really no opposition to. Your position isn't any better than theirs.

Speaker 5:          01:13:41       Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean, I think everybody should do that no matter what you're looking at, like whatever you're trying to defend, look at even even if it's something horrible and it's like a racist position, find out why these people support

Speaker 2:          01:13:53       so they believe it. Right? And so what? Why do they believe this racist position? What is it about them that they think gives it validity and you can look at it and go, I could see where they could take this way too. It's extreme in that that, I mean that's nonsensical, but you see where it started or you can see like that. That's everything about this is, is clearly driven by something else and not the not what they claim so

Speaker 5:          01:14:16       well, it's also the, one of the things about society, so we really have to take into consideration is the momentum of the past. Like there's this country has a unique freedom to it because it was literally created by people who decided to get on a boat and risk traveling across the ocean to some new land. Yes, it's a country filled with savages like crazy people that took wild chances and did wild things because of it. And if you look at the history of this country that's clearly established by look at the art, look at the music, look at the things that have come out, the comedy, all of these things that have been created, the cars, all the different things that have come out of this one place and this one place just happens to be the most recent place with the least amount of historical baggage. Yes. But then you look at the places that have the most amount of historic baggage like Africa or you know, some parts of Russia and these are places where they have the hardest time breaking out of these, the weight of the cultural momentum of the past. You know, it's, it's very difficult for people to, to radically change and established system that has existed for a thousand years.

Speaker 2:          01:15:22       Well that's true, and if you were to say think about communism and the Soviet states in the length of what constitutes human history is has only been gone for. It was only, it was around for a short time and it's only been gone for an even shorter time.

Speaker 5:          01:15:38       Like come on and it's gone, but it's still a dictatorship over there. Yeah, I guess they're trying to that Russia to cheer about that lady in Iran. That's she's going to jail that. Dancing and dancing? Yeah. Oh no, the Egyptian girl. The girl, the Lebanese girls going to jail for she. She made a youtube video about getting sexually harassed in Egypt. So they sentenced her to eight years in prison. She's 22 years old. Holy Fuck it terrifying. She's a young 22, 24, something like that. She's young and they sentenced her to eight fucking years that the people here

Speaker 2:          01:16:15       in America or western the Western civilization at large. Just fucking. They just put on the blinders about stuff like that. It's like there are places, and I'm not going to demonize these places either, but at the same time you as a 22 year old could have a complaint and say, Hey, I am like, you know, this thing happened and I'm, this is fucked up, and all of a sudden they can go, Huh, you think that was fucked up, boom and throw your ass in jail or have you executed or whatever. I mean, it's like, okay, well I guess I don't have the right to express myself. Whereas you know, people will show up and bang on doors and do all kinds of crazy shit. When Jordan Peterson comes and does a talk and the thing is they're allowed to. They're allowed to protest what he has to say, counter protests if they want or to express their unhappiness with things political and things, media way. Anybody can say what they want in terms of what makes them unhappy without fear of the government silencing you. Right. That's a major thing.

Speaker 5:          01:17:19       It's a major thing and this poor girl in Iran, she's just dancing. I know people that are always rail against Islam or Islamophobia. There's so much Islamophobia in this world. Yeah, sure there is. You're right, there is. But you know what else there is, there's also radical Islam and radical Islamic governments that are putting women in jail because they fucking damn religious. And that's happening right now. It's just resist religious zealots

Speaker 2:          01:17:42       training. And while I have, you know, people will often get into a conversation about this and they'll bring up, well what about the Crusades or what about this? Like, go, hold on. These are all relevant things to. And while the Crusades are not nearly as cut and dry as you think they are, in fact, which two it ended in the fourth crusade to two groups went down there, uh, and then end up fighting each other. It's like you're both Christians. Yeah, what the fuck are you thinking? But then you had things like the inquisition you have, you've had all kinds of stuff. And it's like, yeah, no, you, you, you just, that doesn't erase this. And that doesn't, they don't balance each other out. It's just, it's just. And it's because it's one religion and not the other. It doesn't make, it's the, the, the motivations are the same, that kind of comes, it comes from the same concept. Even if it's not technically the same religion.

Speaker 5:          01:18:26       Well, it reinforces it in my opinion. I mean the idea that it's not the idea that Christianity is so amazing and Islam is so bad. It's that ideologies force people into very terrible behavior. They can, they can very, very much. And they often do. Yeah. I mean, most of the time it goes bad when you have a powerful, potent ideology that dominating

Speaker 2:          01:18:46       well imagine, okay, you had a Christian zealotry and let's say Islam and Christianity had swapped and Islam had all kinds of reformations and different sex break off from it and all this and it become more like Christianity is in this modern era. But Christianity stayed in a more, a less developed sense and had a more rigorous fervin zealotry in terms of adherence to doctrines or at least or even a, um, interpretations of doctrines and certain ways to estimate stocks. So, but within this context of the modern era. So now you have the Internet. So any, let's say, you know, you only got like a million people in the world that feel this way, but these million can all connect with each other via social media, very different electronic ways. Um, they can create a weapon where they can weaponize things much easier. They can coordinate, they can.

Speaker 2:          01:19:39       It's not like the Crusades where you had to get money from a king and other Gulf other monarchs get together. All these troops get together, all these supplies, marched them all down into the Middle East to where you've got the Turks waiting for you that they've done the same thing. And then you guys all meet up on these different points of battle. The, you could literally be at war all over the world, all day, every day, all at the same time because of the modern advances of technology. And not to mention you have firearms, you have explosive and chemicals and things that you can use to your disposal. It just, or a truck, right? You didn't have, you know, six ton trucks and drive into a crowd. That's just technology. It's, it, it helps, it makes our lives better. But in other ways it can also create calamity for us and it's really their tools.

Speaker 2:          01:20:36       You know, social media is a tool. I think the social media is, if you were to track mass, the mass shootings that have happened, the rise of social media and the rise of mass shootings would, would be on a parallel. I really think that it's social media that's increasing the amount that you see with the school shooting and things like that. I think that because they get fame from it, they get fame or you're able to antagonize someone and they can't get away from you much more easily. The, the resulting mount using a Nietzschean term in terms of, uh, you know, the resentment, the resentfulness from seeing other people having what you think you deserve or, or doing, thinking that they somehow are having more of what you think you want that as well. Why do they get to have it? And I don't, or any number of reasons why you can be incredibly potently resentful.

Speaker 2:          01:21:28       And now you have this thing that's just in your life pumping all this kind of stuff that you all the time. And I think that it can affect people in some really pathologically bad ways and now you have technology to also enact it. And if it's not in the end, you can also easily make the argument if it's not a firearm, it could be something else. And, and that's doesn't make it any better. But I think that the, the rise of social media has been, is, is a direct, a correlator are directly responsible for the rise in these school shootings and directly responsible or directly correlates to it. I think that there's a correlation there. I think certainly there's a lot going on in society. I think the big factor, well there's a lot of factors. People are alienated, yes, there's terrible child rearing. People have mental health issues, people are medicated.

Speaker 2:          01:22:21       There's the big one is now imagine all that with the, the technology of social media able to heighten some of the effects of some of these things or to create. So someone that feels alienated. Imagine now not only do you feel alienated in the real world, but then when you're on social media you want. It's not a real, you know, it's your body knows it's not the real world, but you could be alienated out there too and that which alienates you there could still penetrate and get to you while you're out, what you're away from it. If people are fucking with you at school or what have you, then you're at home, you're feeling alienated there and then this is continuing to fuck with you through social media or other people are fucking with you on social media. Let's say you're, you're playing your video games and people are talking shit because you keep getting shot and you know, a battlefield five or whatever and then all these things are just compounded compounder and while no one knows, I mean there's, I'm sure you wouldn't necessarily know that if I say, oh, you know, fuck you knew or something on some video game that this person is essentially in real life being told, fuck you everyday all day, feeling like the whole world thinks, fuck you.

Speaker 2:          01:23:31       How would you know that? But it could be. Then that person snaps or that person has a, there. They have a psychological issue that they're not.

Speaker 5:          01:23:40       I'm sure there's a bunch of factors. There's a bunch of facts. First of all, does the ability to kill large groups of people. Yes. Which is unprecedented, right? The ability to use assault rifles and just fucking semiautomatic guns and go in and kill large groups of people. The knowledge that if you do do that, it'll make a huge splash and giant headlines and you'll be. You'll be infamous. The fact that a lot of these people are on disassociative, so a lot of these people are on like serious psych medications that we really have only been studying the effects on human beings for the past couple of decades. There's not a whole lot of data on long term use of these Ssri for 20, 30, 40 years. Right. So you've got varying people's varying mental illnesses, varying psychological pressures and stresses and lives that are just beyond fucked. And then they have access to guns and they want people to hurt the way they're hurting. There's a lot of them. There's a lot of factors going on.

Speaker 2:          01:24:34       Well, and you know, even if they illegally require the guns, I mean they still have it. It doesn't matter what the, in this case, what the tool is per se, but

Speaker 5:          01:24:44       well, you know, I don't think we're meant to, to understand. I don't think we understand, nor are we meant to live in large groups of people where we don't know the people around us. That's another thing. I think that is a really new situation for human beings. Don't they overlook

Speaker 2:          01:25:00       the historical significance of the population growth, the population density that has been gathering as these we didn't, we get into these, these, uh, high density, civilized, civilized areas like cities, these big cities. And it changes everything.

Speaker 5:          01:25:17       Yeah. And people are less likely to know that many. Like if you live in a town of 150 people, you probably know 150 people. If you live in a city of 5 million people, you probably know 10 people you know, you know, people you work with, you might know a couple of friends, you know, unless you're like a really social person, sure. You probably have a way more limited number of people that you actually know. Then people that have a tight knit, small town and small community, but you know those people are obviously in your business. That's one thing. Fucking what? I know. Friends that live in small towns. Fuck man. There's, there's things that come with that too. A lot of busy bodies. A lot of people looking over the fence. I think they had the anal sex last night. Jesus is going to punish them to that next line and storing. Come through. You don't. Fuck fucking speaking of blood fucking let's talk about Usada. Yeah. Without the loop. Yeah. We were, um, we, we started this podcast talking about what we had talked about your, your situation with Brendan Shop. And I had talked about your situation. Were you, uh, were you tested positive from a tainted supplement, like legitimately tested positive from a tainted supplement? It, you were cleared. Uh, but this whole process was a goat rope. Yeah, right. It took a long time to work out and you didn't feel fairly treated.

Speaker 2:          01:26:42       Not In the least it, it started one way. Then took a fucking curve. What happened? Well, so did you take a. I took a supplement that had tribulus in it. That's all. It was. Just a Chinese herb.

Speaker 5:          01:26:55       It's a Chinese herb that stimulates testosterone. And by the way,

Speaker 2:          01:26:58       barely works. Yeah, it's not, it's not, it's not gonna turn you into superman or anything. If you get more sleep, it's better for your testosterone production than Tribulus. So it's just tribulus is all it was. And uh, they in the supplement itself, as it turns out, was contaminated with a sore arm called Asurion. But when I say contaminated, I mean like it had such trace amounts that the people that did the lab testing on it said, well, clearly just contamination because this wouldn't help you. This wouldn't do anything for you

Speaker 5:          01:27:32       and those. Let's explain how that happens. A lot of these places, I know this for a fact because I am one of the owners of on it on it as a third party tested company where we get our stuff tested by an independent party to make sure that there's nothing funky with it, but we've had some issues in the past with stuff being in our. Our earliest formulations of Alpha brain and weren't supposed to be in there and what it comes from is you buy your ingredients from a company. That company has these vats that they mix everything in and they don't properly cleaned the vats and if they don't properly clean the baths, you're buying some stuff from China. Who knows what they're chucking in there. They got steroids in there, they got this, they got a lot of. Creatine is tainted with all sorts of shit. A lot of different supplements or tank. And that's what you saw to thought it could have been at first 10 means yes, it happened to a Yolo Ramiro.

Speaker 2:          01:28:21       Yes. So this stuff is. Is, is contaminated. Right. And so you sorta was was testing me. I had had a fight in September of 2016 against our Lawsky and then after that I was like, Yo, I'm just going to take a break for awhile. I'm not fighting for, I'm going to tour Europe and goof off and whatever. And then when I get back know I don't really, I don't know what I'm going to get back in the ring. And they're like all right, whatever. And we UFC, we told them and. But you saw it, it would still come around and test and it's like okay fine, whatever.

Speaker 5:          01:28:55       So this is post testing positive. This is pre. Pre. Okay. And so you fought our lawsky and you said I'm just going to chill awhile. Yeah. And

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       then one day, well for one when I'm out there in Europe and I let them know like, Hey, I'm going fucking where the wind takes me in Europe and I don't have a whereabouts to fill in because I could be on a train moving here and moving there, whatever. Which is your prerogative as a human being. And they, they know that and yet then they go ahead and sent someone to my fucking house to try and test me while I'm in Europe and I'm just going, Whoa, okay. Isn't there like an app where you fill it as an APP? But if I'm at work, uh, you have, you can fill out where you're supposed to be ahead of time for the most part. So on Tuesday the 16th, I'm going to be at this place from this time to this time and then, and then, but what is your home base?

Speaker 3:          01:29:43       So if we don't go to these places and we'll just meet you at your home at some time or whatever. He just decided to go to Japan. You have to tell them, hey, today I'm going to take a train to Osaka. Today I'm going to go to the mountains. So you have to give them a detailed itinerary every day. Every day. Okay. And so I'm like, Fuck Dude, I'm just trying to be out here living, just doing whatever. I'm not fighting, but you know, when I get home, you test me wherever you want. You just want to enjoy a vacation, just travel. Correct. And uh, they go, they send someone to my house. I was like, fuck. All right. And then there are times where, so what happens when they send someone to your house but you told them you weren't there? Uh, well for one, no one told the, I don't know how, what mechanical elements within their organization, how that works, but they sent someone there anyways.

Speaker 3:          01:30:30       I'm not there. That a head count. Does it count? Because. Did you tell them that you were going to be on the road? I, we did. So they still counted that as you not being there for a test? Yes. Well that doesn't make any fucking sense. Well, it is what it is. So uh, but wait a minute, if they're going to give you a strike, like don't, don't. They have to follow their protocol and their protocols. You have to inform them of where you're going to be. Right. So if you did that, you informed them or you're going to be. Yes. They literally told Lewicki and the UFC, he's not going to be home for almost a month and he's fucking practically backpacking all through Europe, going from place to place to place, so he's going to be real hard to get ahold of. Good time to take steroids.

Speaker 3:          01:31:19       You get just fucking get back to the gills. Yeah, you'll pass if they showed up in Europe, you did give them your location and you told them where you are if they would. But I was gone. I didn't feel in any locations. I just went wherever I went. So when you went, wherever you went and your manager told you, saw that you were in Europe, they still showed up at your house in La. Okay. Well that doesn't seem to make any sense. And. And they give you a strike? Yes. And so I'm like, okay, that's aggravating cowboy strike when he was at UFC. So it's stuff like that, that map and I saw that and I'm like, well you know what I just did. I can't fuck around with any of this stuff. I don't want people to use this as some sort of a kindling to try and start a fire about me and so then I get back home and they're, you know, test me again, like, all right, fine, whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:32:12       And then they test me again and I'm like, okay, now you're, you may just made me late to an audition as you just showed up out of nowhere. Cool. You can do that. Like they can just show up and you, you can't say, Hey, I have an appointment to keep their there. We even, if you're not fighting, like say if you're running out the door and you have a business appointment, how long does it take for them to test you? A. Depends on what they're doing, whether it's blood and urine or just urine. But with me it's always been blood in urine. So you can't say, hey, you guys are going to have to come with me because, uh, I got to go to this fucking audition. You know? I don't know. I didn't try that. I would say that get in the car, bitch, blah blah blah.

Speaker 3:          01:32:52       Well, how you gonna sit there and have someone draw blood. I'm not going to you. You guys are gonna have to do it when I'm done, like if you want to keep an eye on me, come with me the whole way. I always took it as they showed up. It's like, well here it goes. That doesn't seem to make any sense. If you have previous commitments and you have to do something they shouldn't have like ultimate precedent over your life. Like they shouldn't be able to just decide like showing up randomly as they could. They could make an argument in some way on that. But if you have a life. Well in any case. So I take this test and I'm like alright, I'm just going to retire for now. I got too much shit. I gotta do. I'm not fighting anytime soon. I've got my new Japan stuff, I've got auditions, I've got all these things.

Speaker 3:          01:33:34       I'm traveling and I just, I'm not going to fight. Right. So just leave me be. And then I'm in Japan and the fucking, the very last test I took right before retiring. Oh you're flagged. I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. Really, really all these tests over all these years. Me being the first person to do complete out of competition or any competition, random urine and blood testing when I worked with water and the Nevada state athletic commission when I fought Travis Browne, so no one had ever done actual random testing before and there was no usada involved in the UFC yet going through why did you do that? It was something that the NSAC wanted to see done and I'm like, fine, what? I wanted to see that done because you had tested positive in the past and so I tested positive before. In the past you've taken some stuff right?

Speaker 3:          01:34:29       I tested positive for anabolics in the past. Why? But I mean the supplement market used to be way wilder than it used to be. Well, and also we'll end the just fighting was way wild lighting was way while they're. The supplement industry was way wilder back in o two. You could still buy all this shit over the counter. That bio for got reclassified the steroids. I remember I was taking this shit called Mag tent number 10. What was the name of the company that makes that incorporated incorporated? That shit. That shit is all steroids. Steroids. It was steroids. I 100 percent. I remember meg 10. He came like 10 pounds in six weeks on that shit. You just get Jack. But that was all over the counter. Yeah, it used to be able to buy a lot of stuff. And by the way, liver toxicity is probably off the charts problems.

Speaker 3:          01:35:12       A lot of those things that are like super bad for her but so real effective. They fucking work. This stuff worked. But uh, so, you know, there was a whole different era. And then with California, you know, I, I had an issue with, with a contaminant, what I believe ultimately to be a contamination, but I didn't take all the steps that I had this time. And once that whole process was such a motherfuck like this is never gonna happen again. So every supplement lot that I took, I would always keep bits of it behind for, until I knew I could get. I felt there was enough time it expired and get rid of it because no one's going to come back and test me. I passed all my tests. So. So once you pass your test, you would get rid of the old state. I don't need to keep those lots that are supposed to take only third party verified.

Speaker 3:          01:35:58       That's not what they say necessarily. They suggested, I guess a now, but I know that, uh, with this brand of Tribulus I had taken, I had taken three or four different other supplements from the same company and all passed no problem on their tests. Right? So it was just some weird contamination which does happen again. Happened at 10 means yes, it's happened to several folks as far as I can tell. I mean I'm not testing their whole product line, but it just seemed like a fluke and just such a simple supplement in any case over one ingredient deal. So then they come back and they're like, oh, you tested positive for this. And I'm like, well that ain't fucking possible. So then I send in some supplements which I had to pay for, to have them tested. They run them through the testing and then bang, they find it all right.

Speaker 3:          01:36:42       There you go. There's your deal. Then they went out and bought a brand new bottle. Unopened. Same Lot. Tested that one, verify the results. Same thing. Test saying it doesn't happen. Then Tim means as well. So then we're in contact with Usada throughout the entirety of this. So we don't ever break contact with Usada. We have a specific guy and I'm not going to throw his name out there or anything, but we have a guy that we spoke to directly the whole time through my manager, uh, speaking with him and I've seen the emails. And so we're talking about how we know this is a contamination and when, you know, when we get done with all this, why don't we even try to put together something, some promotional stuff, anything that we can do to try and keep athletes from ending up in the same issues.

Speaker 3:          01:37:29       And we'd like to do whatever we could to help you guys out with this. You know, we're not against you, we're a, we don't mind being a part of the system and we understand why you're here and I'm not against them wanting to do drug testing or whatever and try to keep a, a clean and fair playing field. I get the point of it. Uh, so we get the, the supplements tested, they test the secondary batch. They have all their information. It's like, all right, this should be a fucking rock and roll. And then they got real quiet. Oh, okay. Now you're not talking to us anymore. What do you mean? Like you would contact him. They wouldn't respond. They would take him a week, two weeks. And what were they saying when they do respond? Uh, you know, I can't entirely remember myself, but with my manager was in touch with them.

Speaker 3:          01:38:16       And what is the protocol? If someone tests positive for something that's a tainted Solomon and it's a third party supplement and where it's not, it's not third party verified rather. Well, I don't even know if it was third party verified that anything would be any different. Hmm, okay. Well, if it is third party verified and still is tainted, yeah, that would be an issue, right? Yeah. If you tested positive, he tested positive. If they found the supplement, I think the idea about third party verified is it's much less likely to be addicted. It doesn't resolve anything and this is coming from someone who's in the supplement business. There's a certain amount of this stuff. You farm it out. So far as I know what the deal is. There's a period of ineligibility sort of or basically what happens is you're effectively suspended until this thing is all finished out and they tried to say that you're not suspended.

Speaker 3:          01:39:07       There's no suspension, but that's not true. Well, no one's going to book your favorite treats you as you're suspended. I tried to corner Travis Brown because I was training him and they wouldn't let me. It won't let you. The corner mission with. Let me try. Yes. Okay. And so they're like, you're suspended so you can't. You can't corner, but you said you're not suspended. Yeah, exactly. So you're effectively suspended. You can't work. You can't even work as a tertiary individually as a, as a corner man or anything like that. He can't be at the event. And this is after the fact where you brought them the supplements. They independently verified that it was tainted. Yes. And uh, so then we start talking and throughout the process I said, look, I'm not taking a punishment for contamination and I'm not even fighting. I'm not fighting anytime soon.

Speaker 3:          01:39:59       I'm not you. You can't, like what you did with means and these other people, you punish them, you know that there was contamination, but you punish them. Yeah, they gave them many months. Yes. Have a suspension so that they're able to compete or make a living during those months. And I'm like, no, I'm not dealing. I'm not taking that. That's not acceptable because I'm not, that's not what's going on here. Nobody is doping. Nobody's trying to cheat the system. There is no, I'm not even fighting. You don't get by punishing me. You're trying to let guilt on me. You're trying to make me out to be some sort of a, you know, a guilty party as if I'm trying to be, have some soreness like I'm not dealing with, I'm not taking. So how did it ultimately get resolved? Well, ultimately what ended up happening is we had to go to arbitration. That was all, it was really left to us because then they started trying to bring up a

Speaker 2:          01:40:53       stuff from my past and then weigh that against me as well. And it's like, Whoa, dude, you guys weren't even around and now you get to decide to add to the weight of whatever punishment you want to levy against me based on, uh, things that didn't involve you. Great. What were they talking about? They're talking about 2011. No, 2008 they went to. Yeah. They tried and they tried to say, well, oh yeah, well this happened. So then therefore, you know, now they start talking about two years. [inaudible] like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. They started talking about suspending you for two years for a tainted supplement. Yes. Wow. And I'm just going. There's no way. I wouldn't even expect six months. You think I'm going to take two years? And so we go and we inquire on the Arbor and I've done. I did an interview with the guy that we were dealing with through skype.

Speaker 2:          01:41:40       Uh, we've, we've been in touch. It's just like at some point everything turned and changed. Their tone changed there. Even the original penalties, they were looking to levy increased. New Shit gets brought in. It's like they became a completely different animal as soon as you know, there was the evidence of, of contamination and that I wasn't gonna I wasn't willing to take punishment for it. I wasn't. What do you think their motivation is here? I think that they, and this is just my opinion, I think the way you saw to looks at it and it's an easy way to go about it, is that the more people they deem, the more effective they appear. It's their effect. Their efficacy is based on punishment, punishments doled out. Not necessarily not on lack of punishments at all. So do you think this is, you know, also remembered by the people that are working there.

Speaker 2:          01:42:31       So they arbitrarily get to decide how things go about right. There's not like a very strict protocol that they must follow. They're tainted supplements and for this no, there is actually quite a bit of a lever or there, there is leeway in terms of how they can enforce and what they can enforce. So when, so it's subjective, it's up, there is subjectivity that um, they, uh, they have a lot of discretion. There is some outlined elements of protocol, but there is no, it is always this or it is always that. And uh, you know, I didn't begrudge them for a period of ineligibility while you're going through the process of finding out whether this is contamination or what have you, doing any testing. And that makes sense to me. That's fine. I understand that if this guy supposedly has something in the system, well let's figure out what it is.

Speaker 2:          01:43:19       And once we have a better idea, then we can decide about whether you can go back into the pool or do this or do that or if you're going to leverage any punishments makes sense to me. But in addition to that, then tacking on more shit in terms of my case and I was like, that's not acceptable. So we, we go, well, I guess the only thing left to us as to go to arbitration. And so my manager spoke with, um, when I was working through them to arbitration and we said, okay, well we'll, what is that going to take? Well, that's going to cost more money out of my pocket. Um, you know, the arbitration process, these are guys that they're paid by Usada to do their arbitration. Like they work for them in a way or they're not, they don't work under them directly, but they are, they do get paid to be a arbitrator somehow.

Speaker 2:          01:44:05       There's some something. So they get contracted by Usada yes. And so that was like, ah, I don't necessarily feel the most comfortable with that, but I can also understand how it's not, there's probably not an easier way to go about it, but okay, I got it. Then when we, uh, then we get notice back from Usada that we have to limit the scope of our argument. We're like, Whoa, Whoa, what you, you're gonna tell us what we can and can't argue in arbitration. I don't remember what the definitions were exactly, but it was like, you can't, you know, you have to keep it within this boundary and this realm and this. And I'm like, well, you can't fucking try to say the levy this against me and then you stuff from my past and then tell me I can't argue my full case. So they're limiting the amount that you could defend yourself as though you're saying the, they were limiting the, um, the range of argument you could make.

Speaker 2:          01:44:59       What would the argument be that you would bring up that they would want to limit? Uh, that's a good question. I don't know exactly did they define that? They know they had definitions in the emails with, with back and forth with my manager and he goes, we'll fuck we because we could argue about, you know, this is contamination, um, and, and go from there. But it was something really potentially limiting, which was weird about how they put it. You just don't remember what exactly. I don't remember all the details, it's very detail oriented, it's legal ease and uh, and then so we get to the point, it's like, well fuck, well this doesn't even look like a very, you know, this might not even be a, a useful way of trying to approach this thing and it got down to the wire to where, and we kept pushing it back and pushing it back and saying like, you know, we can we get an extension and, and to try and figure out how the hell do we approach this?

Speaker 2:          01:45:54       And, and also like how, how could we approach without having to spend money on having lawyers get involved. I mean that's the last thing you want to do is get to litigation or you know, even arbitration, it's a legal process. It's complex and it is, it's, there's a lot of lawyers love billable hours or they do. And so it gets down to the wire essentially and we, I just sit back and I go, I won't accept any ruling if it's a punishment at all. I don't care what they say, I'll just be like, Nah, not I, I don't. I'm not going to abide by it. You can't force me to do shit and I guess we'll have to cross

Speaker 5:          01:46:30       position is that if you are accidentally taking a tainted supplement and also trace amounts that have absolutely zero effect on performance, there's nothing that you're doing by accidentally taking that that in any way would help you and that's a fact. That's a proven fact. Yes. So your position is you shouldn't be punished. Correct.

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       Then you're out of the year when once you. The time that you've been out. Here's the thing. That's enough. Exactly. It's one of them. You don't need to say, oh, well if you. If it took six, if it took seven months to get the. The, the information that you needed the data, right? To then clarify, okay, well you're not at fault to then say, oh, well we'll suspend you for six months, but since that six months is already past, it's like we didn't suspend you at all. No. Motherfucker. When you look into the haunt a at the data, when you go and look at this case, it says suspended, which means you punished me, which means I was guilty in some way. You said I'm guilty because that's how you got to punish me. Right. It's not under investigation or after this litigation has exonerated after.

Speaker 2:          01:47:37       No, it's just no. You still love to punishment in there to say, look how we caught this guy and we punished them and I'm like, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not down for that. And so Hudley enough. So I was like on aerials or something like that. I said, I, I won't accept. I don't care what they say. I don't care what punishment they try to levy. I don't abide by it. I won't agree to it and I'm done with them. And then someone from the arbitrary, the arbitrators office who we were dealing with calls us out of the blue and goes, so, so you still sure you don't want to do this. I'm like, well. And my manager goes, well they said that we have to limit the scope of argument to this and this and we can talk. And then he goes, no, you don't. You can talk about, you can, you can bring any argument you want. Who is saying this to you? The arbitrators office. And

Speaker 5:          01:48:25       so who would initially come to you and said the elite, the scope of your argument Usada. Okay. So you saw to, was attempting to establish some boundaries for your arguments. But the people who were the actual arbitrators said that that's not true.

Speaker 2:          01:48:40       Right? That's not the case. You don't. It doesn't, they can't force you to argue in a certain.

Speaker 5:          01:48:45       Oh, okay. So is it possible that you sought as lawyers? We're trying to. Here's the thing I've found about, about lawyers, like, yeah, for sure they're necessary and that's all well and good and you need them. But there's a reality, and this is something that I had to deal with recently in doing something with a friend through lawyers where they attached a bunch of shit to this deal that wasn't supposed to be in there and he didn't even know it was in there. And then my lawyer is like, what the fuck is this? And so I contact him, what the fuck is this? And he's like, what the fuck is that? So he contacts his lawyer is what the fuck is this? And it turns out this is a common thing lawyers they want to do with each other. Yeah. We put this in to give you leverage. I don't think you necessarily want that, but we're looking out for your best interests. And so now you have a good negotiation point. If you just go in with what you want, then they're going to ask for more than that. And then you're not in a strong position because you can't ask for more after you've already established your initial position. Makes

Speaker 2:          01:49:42       everything convoluted there. Gross. Yes, I hear you. But that's the world we live. Grandfather was tejas world. Pretty Pretty Fair lawyer. He was assistant attorney general, the state of Washington. He actually wanted me to get into law of all things, but I'm like, Eh, I think I'd rather beat out my brain's yet. Seems like, well, you haven't beaten them out. Very impressive with your memory. So we, uh, we get to. My manager comes back and he goes, hey man, they just contacted me out of nowhere. And they're like, well, if you want to do this, you can. And No, you can't, you, you can make the argument. There's no limiting in the scope of your argument or anything. So then it's like, well, yeah, all right, I'll go for it. Went to our least. Yeah, because at the very least I thought maybe I could have some sort of record down of what we talked about, what was discussed, the arguments made.

Speaker 2:          01:50:29       So in the end, you know, no matter what, how it came out, I can go here, here's what's legit, then you can, you can make your own decision from there. And so we go in, uh, I brought my legal team. They, he, they had a, their lawyer come who was the same guy we were dealing with throughout the entire process and, and they made their argument and we made ours and you know, and there, there are times where I'm sitting back and I go, you know, making, they're making closing arguments, the lawyers and I'm just sitting there listening to the Usada Seigel man, he's just pushing the, he's just moving the goal post. He's a how so? Well, it's just taking a certain element and then trying to, you know, you slippery slope arguments and moving the goal posts on things, but he's just doing anything he can to use rhetoric instead of logos at this point because, you know, they're lawyers and they're trying to make their case and trying to find impassioned responses when you're saying this, you know, consider the people listening at home.

Speaker 2:          01:51:24       Don't really know your case, don't know the scope. Okay. So it's like trying to say that, uh, you know, find ways at which to move the goal posts in terms of. So what, like I said to you earlier, I keep batches of all the supplements that I take, especially when I'm in these, this program and especially after dealing with the cluster fuck that was California and it's like, well I didn't have anything that I could bring to you that I could fuck, you know, so I'm like, this is never happening again. So I keep everything they go and they test stuff and they find it and I kept notes. I kept this and it's like, what more could I have done for you guys? Even if it doesn't matter if there's, let's say what they were all third party tested as well. I would still keep batches of the supplements and one of the stuff I take third party was the issue then.

Speaker 2:          01:52:14       Well it's just simply, it's just they kept trying to say that I didn't do a good enough job that uh, did you use the, uh, did you see this thing on supplement form 11? It's like that came out after the fact and yes, I have seen that. In fact, I use all the resources that you provided your global dro, your other supplement for 11 to check against ingredient lists, supplement names, company names to make sure none of this shit is on the list so that I don't make that mistake. So I use the resources that you give me. I keep batches

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       of my supplements so they can be tested if need be. I do what's available to keep from any issues. And yet they just kept moving the goal post on that and trying to say, well, but you didn't, uh, you didn't hire a psychic, you know, it's just that kind of shit. And I'm like, well, how, how can this have been any better? And not to mention I'm not fighting.

Speaker 5:          01:53:06       Right. So at the end of the day, what were they looking for?

Speaker 3:          01:53:10       Portration? Uh, they wanted to levy a punishment against me and suspend me for years.

Speaker 5:          01:53:17       And this is Usada. Yes. So you saw to ultimately, even though they knew that you took a tainted supplement that had no effect whatsoever on your performance, right? They still wanted to punish you for two years. That seems stupid. That just seemed stupid. Now let me, let me read Jeff Novitsky because Novitsky texted me because I told him this was going to go down and his take is a little bit different than yours.

Speaker 3:          01:53:39       I don't imagine it isn't. All right. I'm not surprised that it is.

Speaker 5:          01:53:43       And I, uh, I told you what it was the. So this is. I'll just read you what it says. He said he'll complain about the amount of time that went by with you saw the process, but he notified us of retirement right after the positive sample was collected before a positive was announced. So he was off in the wind for many months and not communicating with Usada a big reason the case took so long to resolve to his positive was from a tainted supplement, but he didn't do the number one thing we advise to use athletes on UFC athletes on supplements. He didn't choose a supplement that was third party certified as a banned substance free. Like on it, supplements are, there are literally hundreds of certified supplements out there in virtually and virtually ensures no issues to a foreign athlete if they stick with those. Uh, one other point for Barnett when he was unresponsive to case he missed all of his deadlines to file for arbitration. Uh, he came to the table later and said he wanted to go to arbitration. You saw to maiden exclusion and let him, which ultimately led to his favorable ruling by arbitrator. Their reasoning was that they wanted to rule in favor of fairness to athlete rules. Say they didn't have to after time to file expired. Well, but they're saying it ruled favorably towards you ultimately at the end of the day.

Speaker 3:          01:55:06       Yes. They all live in our favor. Gobbly goop that the other. You definitely probably shit. Like he says that, oh well he retired and he was in the wind. You know what my end, the wind was. It wasn't even that long. I was in Japan for rising with my athlete. Alicia Garcia wasn't in the fucking wind. Sounds good though. Even the wind and the wind

Speaker 6:          01:55:25       fucking you and that motorcycle jacket. Yeah, I'm dragging a coffin behind me, like Django through the Nevada

Speaker 5:          01:55:34       desert. Somebody pulls you over, got eight days growth on your face. You get some days where you sought out. We're looking for is broken. I. He pissed this cup for me. I

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       didn't bring a cup. Just. Yeah, I was in Japan at rising. You know I wasn't in the wind. And they in your favor. The arbitrator arbitrator and what did they say? This is the same guy. The arbitrator is the same guy that put together is he's an ICARUS. He produced ICARUS. The movie on, on doping. He is, he's one of the major figures in terms of the world of anti-doping. So it's one of the guys who worked with Bryan Fogel, the arbitrator. Bryan Fogel was the guy who started in ICARUS. This guy is a perpetrator for water. Okay. I'm actually, why am I doing this? Either way you look at Jamie can handle, but it doesn't matter. So this guy has the end of the day. Everything in terms of drug testing, they really favor. Yes. And he said he does it. He couldn't see any way that I could have done hardly a better job than I was meticulous with my record keeping that uh, I may, I did essentially everything I could in the means of a normal person to do.

Speaker 3:          01:56:45       How is it resolved at the end? It was a. The of reprimand reprimand? Yeah. What does that, what do they do? Richard H dot Richard Mclaren. Mclaren chief arbitrator? Yes. Okay. So at the end of the day, after all this, they say they gave you a reprimand. What does that mean? It just means like don't do that. Be careful. Yeah. Okay. That's it. And this took but no punishment. Right. And all that two year shift from Usada was on warranty, right. And heavy handed, heavy handed as hell. And, and junior dos Santos went through the two, started at at six months. And then by the time we have both supplements tested, then all of a sudden it starts getting weird. And you know, this claim by new whiskey that we were out of. No, we were always in touch. Novitsky doesn't work for you. I know. This is. So what's Kinda funny is new whiskey is such a public face on this kind of thing, but when it comes to actually dealing with Usada, he's all, he's hands up.

Speaker 3:          01:57:52       I mean he'll come and he'll, he'll make sure to put something out there in any of the sphere. But in reality he ain't got a fucking thing to do with any of them. Okay. But in his defense, he's a UFC employee and it's inappropriate for him to have any influence whatsoever on the way they rule things that. But that's, that is, that is that, I think that's actually the proper thing for him to do it in a way. But I mean it's just, it's a, it's a, it's it. The presentation is a bit of a misnomer. I think so. Well initially he was responsible for the drug testing. Now he's, what is he, the president of athletes safety and wellness bucket. They're running the performance institute. Yeah. I mean, what they're, what they're concentrating on now, but I'm just saying for Jeff and his shirt off that I think they're concentrating more on encouraging fighters to train and, and, and fortify their body with nutrition directly and giving them education

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       on how to do this and the Jeff is at the forefront of that stuff and showing them how to avoid accidentally taking something and definitely have guess

Speaker 2:          01:58:50       coming with this is that he is not fully in the loop with what happened between me and Usada because he's not involved. Right. So some of, some of what he's saying there is incorrect and it's not. I don't blame him because he's not a part of it.

Speaker 5:          01:59:04       So is he misinformed at the very least think that they, they're not being straightforward with it sounds to me like they wanted to punish you badly. They wanted to punish me badly. Yeah. Two years is fucking crazy punishment. And also when, when people get to remember when I'm Nick Diaz was, uh, was being interviewed by all these people. And then there was that mean lady who works at Nevada State Athletic Commission and she was grilling him and I'm like, you were talking about pot here. You crazy lady. Like, what in the fuck are you doing? You're acting like he robbed a bank. Even if he's not getting in the ring. Hi. And leave him alone. Exactly. And I think he probably did a few times, I think. I think in the Gombe fighting he might've been highest was like, oh, I'm bleeding. Oh my God, maybe I should choke him right now. He didn't give a shit fight. Jon Jones is going through this right now. I don't know where John Jones stands, but it's been pretty well established that at the very least, what the numbers, if you look at the numbers when he was tested, um, and you know, I don't know, a lot of people like to say that he's a cheater. There's a lot of this going on right now. Look real clear. The first test was proven that he took tainted Dick Pills. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:00:20       It was a actually. So that got brought up to my attention as part of all this because you know, you sought a felon, irrelevant. The difference between that first one, let's say, and I'm not, I don't know about the second shift with John, I don't really follow close on this, but this came across my plate because he had, he was taking like a liquid cialis and it was from a company that sells sarms and peptides and all that. So it was a company that also sells banned substances. Right. And so their argument was that dude, you're buying or using shit from a place full of illegal shit. You're not supposed to take.

Speaker 5:          02:00:56       Definitely a dumb move. Definitely. It means God damn prescription for Cialis. Right? You don't need to take this phone. I imagine. Um, the second one, what he took, he had such a minuscule trace amount that he tested negative. Then he tested positive, then he tested negative again. And this is something that's supposed to stay in your system for months. So this is indicative of someone who's not taking something to get into performance, enhance and benefit from it. But rather someone who had something that was tainted,

Speaker 2:          02:01:28       lab technicians are smart on this shit. Like the guy who saw the results from the first little batch of supplements we gave me, he, he had seen everything and then some under

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       the sun and all different levels and this guy knew what, what constituted contamination and it wasn't. He could tell, of course they can tell just by the numbers. Look if you'd taken trace amounts of anything, it's not gonna do a damn thing to your body in terms of performance enhancing, but it is going to show up in these tests because these tests are incredibly thorough. Hey Jamie, Google what's going on with Jon Jones case because particularly after this weekend, it's very, very relevant. You know, I mean with Brock Lesnar get in there with DC DC becoming the first light heavyweight to consecutively hold the light heavyweight championship and the heavyweight championship, you know, and a spectacular fight by DC. But Jon Jones is always going to be sure there you cannot, you can go on and on about the extracurricular woes of John Jones. Sure. His capabilities as an athlete, his talent is undeniable, undeniable.

Speaker 3:          02:02:37       Look, whatever the fuck he took Dick Pills, where as not making them a better fighter. He didn't knock dcl because at dick pills, that's crazy. No, it has to do with great skill and beautiful left high kick. That's what it was. And he recognize that tendency, you know, DC knows he has, you know, uh, but with this whole Usada process, it just became an it drug on because w, you know, we said to them, I'm not going to take a punishment. And they said we won't. We're not giving you any option on this. And so that's negotiation. What happens with. One of the things that I've talked about when it comes to police officers is that when you have police officers and you know, people that are trying to arrest it becomes a game. And I don't mean a game in terms of it's bullshit. I mean it's a game in terms of one person's trying to win and they're trying to get people in a restaurant.

Speaker 3:          02:03:24       And this is why people plant guns and plant drugs trying to win. And that's what killed me was that, to me, in my opinion, you sata was trying to win. It was more important for them to win than it was for us to have a clean sport. This comes back to what we're talking about earlier when it comes to arguments and discussions that people oftentimes are not really searching for the truth. They just want to be right? Yes. And I've had this argument about bureaucracies in general, right? And this goes to, this isn't just about, you know, not Usada and they're bureaucratic elements tie like the government or other things. So you come and you say, Oh, you fucked up. And then the bureaucracies go, shit, we didn't fuck up. And they're going to say we didn't fuck up to the very. They'll take that to the very longest lever until either a they'll scape goat someone or be they can figure out a way that they didn't.

Speaker 3:          02:04:12       Because looking, making a mistake on a bureaucratic level makes it seem like, okay, well fuck if we. And here's the thing. If you saw to says, oh, you know, you're not you, you didn't, you're not going to get punished than two means, and you'll Romero go, uh, why did I get punished? Or if they, if you sat down and say, Oh, well, you know, that was a miss, that, that was a mistake. Well, if that was a mistake, well then, hey, I got fucked on that mistake. You don't take care of me. So no drug testing is bad, but too much oversight is also bad. I think that a clean sport is okay and the idea of the random testing and all is fine, but you can't do it at the expense of the athletes in that we're in the administration of the testing that you're trying to blast them.

Speaker 3:          02:05:03       Like these three Brazilian guys that just got busted over contamination that they traced back to a compounding pharmacy when things. This is just recent. So you got three different guys in the UFC and they were all getting supplements from a compounding pharmacy and everything was traced back to it. It almost seems like you shouldn't take any fucking supplements. Well, that's the other thing is you'll do we, are, we not allowed to take anything, anything at all? Nothing. No on it. What are supplements? What do they do? They help your performance. You know what I mean? Should you take no performance and answers? Should we take nothing? She just eat food. I mean, it's got to be someone out there as well. There's food that will enhance your performance too, right? Like kangaroo meat. The Frank Mir took it, take some bad kangaroo meat and oh man, that kangaroo meat.

Speaker 3:          02:05:46       You get a good pump on that. First of all, ain't nobody giving steroids to Kangaroos. Kangaroos are fucking everywhere. Investigation. Identify as compounding pharmacies. The source of tainted supplements behind three positive Almeda and Antonio and yeah, a minotauro. And here's the weird thing. So it comes all the way down to it and then they're there. Highlight on this is. And you know, they've, we put give him a suspension that, but at the time has already lapsed so they won't actually have to serve any time. It's like, but you just fucking suspended them nonetheless. Yeah. You didn't have to do that. So they took seven or eight months or whatever for this get cleared up and that's unfortunate. Junior tested positive for a diuretic. Is that correct? That's what it was. Which hydrochloric or something? Either diarrhetic, which is crazy because he's a fucking heavy one. Losing any weight junior's not on the high side of heavyweight. He's not like a to 65 God. It's kind of way to make the upper limit. Like he's just trying to keep those wrinkles out of his face. Just trying to look good. Maybe just. Does diarrhetics make you look good? Look, I don't know. I don't think that makes it herself.

Speaker 3:          02:06:50       It just pulls all the polls. All the water on bones. Jones, keep in mind life is a journey. Not a race. God's will for me to be there. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Let's not forget. I'm still the youngest guy in the top five of heavyweight and light everywhere. Yeah, he is young. What does that. What is unique? What does that someone's account. Oh, is he responding to. Somebody tweeted that the couple of hours ago. It's up to a four year old right now. He remains a provisional suspension of wind and the outcome of the situation with Usada after testing positive for steroids last July, following the Naca one of for me, um, was it a steroid? A man? I couldn't tell you. John faces up to four years suspension due to second violation. Universities anti-doping

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       Pov is policy, but obviously young son ever champion. But obviously first of all when it says second violation, the first violation was proven to be something tainted. So he's not. When you say violation, I want, I want to hear this guy took steroids. He took steroids because he was trying to get a performance enhancing a result from it. Suspend that guy. Don't want to hear, oh, he got toothpaste. It's from China and had fucking something in it. You remember that too. Don't. You wouldn't have a fucking crazy story about the toothpaste that had some poison in it or something that they were selling in China. Now what was that? Some wild shit. Who was a toothpaste in China? The poison in it. Vaguely remembering this. I just said it just because it sounds stupid, but it's really just made it up and all of a sudden it's true.

Speaker 1:          02:08:22       It's probably in the back of my memory somewhere that I just. I hear what you're saying. The toothpaste the made in China found us. She'll get her fresh. Sure. Fresh. Sure. For this, like some people that don't really understand English. Sure. What? What does that mean? I don't know how she'll very good. Shira. Shelf fresh. I think it's a Chinese romanization door in Maine. They're trying to kill people in. Oh yeah. It's one of those green up there for. What is it? What was in it? Antifreeze. Okay, cool. Cool. It's main. Look at how cold it gets up there. Why wouldn't you need people that know that they were doing a good job, but I don't want to. Teeth falling out. Freeze and shattering glass. Little propylene glycol. Oh, I'm 100 percent for testing. I'm 100 percent for them stopping people from taking performance enhancing drugs, but this sounds very heavy handed.

Speaker 1:          02:09:14       It was just an ime. I had no problem with the system and then this, the way it unfolded to me, it was just like, this is, I don't, I don't need to be fighting multiple fronts. What I'm just trying to do everything I can to stay as in this as an athlete. Now, when you first started, I mean you want to UFC heavyweight title in 2001 two at 24 years old, young, sever. Um, when you won, that meant everybody was on some shit. It was just, it was the beginning of the cleanup. He was everywhere. And, and even then going into the Nevada state athletic commission, previous to that, before Zuph have bought the UFC, the idea of having giant fights in Vegas was fucking, oh, when it was not a possibility, no, he's not going to happen. So, and even then like, uh, the testing back in 2002, that wasn't official per se, it was like she was like, it was esther over him when he fought Brock Lesnar fucked 2002.

Speaker 1:          02:10:10       How about when we saw the ream when he was, when he was, when he was ubering, when he fought Brock Lesnar, Jesus fucking Christ. Damn Comic Book Hero. If I mean there is not a God damn drug testing agent alive that would have been grabbing. He's clearly over $9,000 onto that guy. Like get the picture of him on the scale. Me. That picture is amazing. Look at both of them. Yeah, they're both boxes, but that one hold them down. Everybody would have been like, hang on, hang on. What a needle even. Could you even get a needle in his vein? Dude, he's just pings Benz. He was so jacked. This part of me just wishes he would leave and go to Japan and go right back to it. You know, just fill them up.

Speaker 1:          02:11:01       I mean, look, everybody knew what the fuck it was back then. I mean, it's interesting. Like brock lesnar being back, brock lesner is not asking for over him. Over him was the last guy to really fuck him up and he wants to fight DC and he over. He was just not the same guy anymore. No, you're not. He does not perform at the same level as he does. Still. Very good. It's still very dangerous. Here's the thing. Even when he was a two, oh, five pounder, right. And he had a tendency to gas up gas out and get, you know, be Chiney to a degree, but he was always super technical, highly skilled, like I don't think you could overeem. Him and his brother both are actually very good fighters. Yeah. And you know, their struggles. I've never been a physical one for the most part.

Speaker 1:          02:11:47       I think, you know, they've had. And that's a difficulty that, that is most common amongst fighters is the mental game of it. Well, we saw that within Ghana this week. We've seen the fight, but I heard it was one for the ages. It was one for the ages. Someone who just let some lions loosen that thing and just like, okay, let's crank this up a bit. It was the worst heavyweight fight I've ever seen. It was the worst one in mind, but it came down to, it came down to the sea. It was the second lowest output fight ever. A demo, they couldn't even make it the lowest output fight to be number one. I didn't even get to number one. Number one, they failed that failing. Jens pulver versus jaw hoke from like a fucking ufc 13 or some shit. You know what day that fight was, but that fight was number one with 23 or 22 strikes landed in three rounds and this fight was number two with 23 strikes landed.

Speaker 1:          02:12:45       That's weird, dude. It was insane. And then overeat. I mean Francis go to Francis and Ganos a instagram. He released a statement today and his statement was essentially that he was over. He carried the fear. He said, I'm not proud of my last performance. I have carried my fear from the last fight to this one. I completely understand the frustration. Anger that has caused my fans, coaches, teammates, and family and friends. Weird that he would have fear from the last time we cut. Fucking owned wrestle, but he didn't know he. He thought he was the man and then he got owned and then won't. But he's letting everyone down again. All I can do now is proved myself and make you proud again. But look at this picture that he puts up his swinging on him, him, him connected, one punch. I mean, that's kind of funny.

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       It should've been him with his head down, Francis in the future. If you're gonna, if you're gonna post a humble shot. Look humble. There's this is like I'm following him.

Speaker 3:          02:13:40       I can't say that, that he doesn't legitimately made. Maybe he is carrying some kind of fear from the last fight in terms of losing the result or is a lot of mind. Fuck. That can go into being a fighter. But uh, I think with

Speaker 5:          02:13:56       bounced back, you've been on both sides and you know, the first fight back after a kale loss or after getting dominated, what is that feeling like?

Speaker 3:          02:14:07       Oh, that's a good. I don't know. I've been at this shit for so long. For me it's just like, all right, that was then. This is now don't make the same mistakes you've experienced

Speaker 5:          02:14:17       everything you've been submitted, you've been knocked out, you've knock guys out, you submitted guys. You've won the title. You beat some of the best guys in the world. You've had fantastic performances. You'd have performances that frustrated you, you've experienced at all you've got in your long career. I mean, from being the youngest ever heavyweight champion of the world ever. To. How old are you now? 40, 42, dude. You fucking seen it all. You've literally seen it all. How long do you think you can do?

Speaker 3:          02:14:45       Uh, I don't know, but I'm planning to run it out. You do also have a lot more in Japan, bro. Keep going. I also have this bad habit that need cash for 55 Pontiac's don't get built and put into a 75 trans ams firebirds for free. Well, sometimes they do. If you have the time, that's anything. How are you going to work on your car when you're off all over the world doing all this shit, right? Doing seminars and doing pro wrestling commentary. All my fighters, I had two guys just fight, uh, last Friday at cxf in Burbank. One of them defended his title, Aga, Brian, the other ones. Show him a photo on his fight. And for people who don't know, that's not lucrative to train fighters. I mean at the very highest level, it's barely lucrative. Barely. Yeah. I'm not. This isn't a money thing.

Speaker 3:          02:15:34       This is a passion project training guys out of with Jim at the UFC gym in La Mirada, let's use it for a fantastic feat. And we get use of all 55,000 square feet. Oh, that's nice. We also work a lot with, uh, Chad George has a gym called Cmma and we'll send them. We'll go down there to. Nice was good comradery between Marotta. Where's that at? Like Northern Orange County. Okay. I would say. Yeah. Is it like, um, what's it like northern orange? It was the border of Orange County where it's like at that border it's either southern, most la county or northern most orange county. It's that kind of thing. Yeah, those UFC gyms are fucking bad ass. They are great job. Super Nice. And plus they've been an opportunity for fighters. I think cub and bisping also have stakes in some. Cj does is.

Speaker 5:          02:16:26       Well I believe Frankie Edgar does. Frankie has one in Tom's.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       Yeah, there's a, there's quite a few of them now. I mean they're all over the place. If you look for a place to hit the heavy bag and workout and lift weights and martial arts classes,

Speaker 2:          02:16:39       cages and maths and all that and so we use those facilities. They've been really great to us and yeah, with these, these kids that I work with and they are pretty much kids. It's just about trying to help people achieve work towards the things that they want as an athlete, but also they're good people that I want to see them make the most out of their life, you know, so I'm trying to be a person that can be a positive influence in terms of bringing philosophy and ethics to their life and helping them be good people and to pass that kind of shit on b, the ripple in the water that the drop in the water that sends ripples out, that makes a positive effect on other folks.

Speaker 1:          02:17:17       Throw you a poet. What the fuck? No Bro. Just sometimes it just comes to me, man. You should put that on an instagram picture and show your butt because that's where a lot of those girls do that, but, and then they have like something about, you know, don't like net negativity into your life because the ripples of that negativity can infect the people around you and you don't want that stay positive. Look on my ass. Fucking pull up on them on these. Look at peach. Yeah. Um, I think that UFC gym is a brilliant thing to brilliant move because if I'm like, if I see 24 hour fitness and it's right next to the UFC gym, like, oh, fucking heavy bags. Everything. What the fights are on TV. Yes. Put that on. They also, uh, at least the one in La Mirada has like a whole little section that has astroturf down and all that.

Speaker 1:          02:18:04       Little with ladders that have been painted into it so he can do foot drills. Oh, nice. They've got a sleds and tires and shit. You mean. So you can do other nonconventional workouts, kettlebells. So they have it really like a real strength and condition. Yes. Yes. I mean, you can do really anything. They have a whole setup of trx is and shit like that shit. Yeah, that's bad ass. Yeah. That's, I mean that's what you want from a gym when you go to a lot of gyms, they just don't have that kind of stuff. You know, they have your standard stuff, you know, machines and shake, you could lift with. It's just not, not quite good enough

Speaker 2:          02:18:37       that I agree. And so this gives you that, that full spectrum to, to work in whatever ways you want to just about.

Speaker 1:          02:18:43       Would you be interested in owning your own gym? Sometimes I think about it. I do. I wouldn't mind having it, having

Speaker 2:          02:18:48       my own gym, but it's just such a, I don't want to, burden isn't the right word, but there's just a lot of responsibility that comes with it, you know, the overhead of having a place and creating a program, uh, and having people manage and run those programs. And with me being as busy as I am, um, I wouldn't want to do anything half ass and I also don't want to commit to something and then not be able to put into it what I think is necessary. You obviously love teaching. I do. I do love to teach. Yeah. I like, for me, it was such a big thing in my life, the people, not just in terms of athletics, but the people mentored

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       me and helped to mold and shape me and help give me the tools and sometimes a kick in the ass as needed to, to move me along in life to get me to where I am today, to give me not just in terms of what, what you would argue for is successful or not, but just to be the person that I am. And while far from perfect, uh, you know, I can't, I can't think about exchanging bad moments for different moments in my life. For the fear of that. I wouldn't be who I am today. You know, a Nietzsche talks about eternal recurrence. And one of the idea of that is that, um, and your loneliest, loneliest, have a demon showed up and it said, well, you're going to live your life in every way as you ever have in every single aspect of it.

Speaker 3:          02:20:13       It's like, well, you have to have to be okay with that. You have to live a life that, that, that's, that's reasonable, that you would be fine with doing it all over again. Doing it all over again. If you're going to become, if you're going to be specific specificity, better like pushing a rock up a hill, right? Whatever mistakes you've made, they have made you who you are right now. Correct. As long as it's not catastrophic to the point where you've caused a loss of life or someone's devastated and destroyed someone else's life, you hope not. I hope not. I mean, I know it's interesting thing like that. There's the concept of reincarnation. There's many concepts with one of them is the, one of the most, a haunting for some people is that you will live your life over again. Exactly the same way until you get it right.

Speaker 3:          02:20:56       I actually heard Leo Gracie talking about this once, that everything in your life, every mistake, every choice you make, if you do not do the correct thing, he believed that you would have to come back again and do it all over again. Exactly the same way. And this is his philosophy, the way he lived his life. That's terrifying for people. This idea that somehow or another you're going almost like you're going to repeat high school. Sure you don't put. But here's how brutal, brutal period of my life and my mind to. But here's my question. I think everybody's and the people who it wasn't brutal for those fucking people turn up,

Speaker 5:          02:21:27       be losers, stories of that. The fucking homecoming king in this. I mean, that's like a fucking billy Joel Song. Yeah, the king and the queen of the Prom, you know, that's a scenes from an Italian restaurant that's, that's literally the,

Speaker 3:          02:21:43       the premise of that song. I think it was, uh, it was, uh, um, a immortal song too.

Speaker 5:          02:21:50       Norway brand new and not with the populist and the king and the queen of the prom running around with the top down and the radio on. Nobody looked any finer who is more of a hit at the parkway diner and we never knew we could walk more than that. I live. Remember that I. I don't know it as well as you do. It's a good song. The idea of living your life over again is terrifying for people though. The dying alone, but the living over and over and over again for a finisher, but, but why is that? When living right now, it's fine for most of us. I mean, unless you're depressed, unless you depressing life to wreck living right now it's like, okay, I'm alive. I'm here, I'm doing it. Sure. Why scared to do it over and over and over. We had forever. It's a strange thing, like there's something like the futility of it all. The idea that this is just a repeating cycle that's going to haunt you forever.

Speaker 2:          02:22:47       Well, that would in the idea that there would be nothing that you could do to make any effect to it. I mean to Mifa even, even still, like I couldn't, me personally, I couldn't think of something that in terms of like a, I want to do something that as a mental idea, as a, as a mind game, that if I lived my life in a way that I could be okay with doing it all over again. Just exactly the same way. And here's the other thing. Would you know that it's gonna happen like that? How could you. Well, there was a, I got, I, I wish I could remember who it was. There was this philosopher who was saying that if you were given the ability to absolutely and utterly control your dreams and all aspects and elements of it. And so at first most people would, would go to sleep and they would turn it into every fucking wonderful thing they've ever wanted.

Speaker 2:          02:23:42       They would just be the ultimate winner at everything all the time, always. And then they would get tired of that and then they would create chaos and catastrophe in, in, in, in, you know, make probably make everything is horrible for themselves and they could possibly do. And as they're going through these cycles, ultimately the one thing that you're going to end up wanting in the end is that you just don't know what's going to happen at all. Find by knowing everything prior to it occurring, it takes the want to experience it away. Cormac McCarthy wrote a, um, how many people, if they knew the path of their lives, which still choose to live it, woo.

Speaker 5:          02:24:24       Well, there isn't that ultimately expressed by fighting, like fighting is the ultimate expression of that. Because when you step into that cage of it's just you and you're looking at another guy who's a, a legitimate top flight mixed martial artists and you really don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:24:40       I have a theory about fighting and that fighting is actually a, not the only, but a great conduit into what I think of as the highest point of, of being as a human being. That you can enter into this state, that it's not a place that you can exist. That all the time, like it's just not possible. But when you breach it, it is. If you are so alive and you were at your, the peak of being at that moment, and even though it is, it is brought on through through being in the the intensity and the stress of combat, it's as every aspect of your being is charged in electric, in and living and being, but it's not a place that you could be at all the time. You would just be a maniac, right? It's not a place that human beings can exist in for more than maybe short periods of time. Hm. Well,

Speaker 5:          02:25:41       your senses have to be insanely heightened. Your, your you. The consequences of your actions are grave. The only thing that really is elevated passed out as war and one of the things that you find about war and Sebastian younger wrote about this in his book, tribe, is that the people that experienced it have an incredibly difficult time adjusting to regular life. Sure, and they really miss it and want to go back to it because they never felt more.

Speaker 2:          02:26:06       I believe that that war is a similar place. I think that when you are faced with death that that is a, a conduit to bringing you towards that highest point of, of being. And uh, yeah, I suppose it's like that once you get past that point of view, there is no fear at that level either. It is just an, it is a way. It's just an existence you don't consider. You don't think, you don't think something isn't this or that. It just is and it's a place that you can't be forever, wouldn't, it doesn't work that way. But when you've been there and here just out here dealing with petty again, Internet trolls and dumb shit and people doing stuff that, that cut their nose to spite their face and undermining this and you know, the fabric of our relationships for no good reason. It's, it's tough to, to sit in, exist in this and go fuck, you know, I how, how do you get back to that other thing, this, this state of purity, this existence of where these, none of those things matter anymore.

Speaker 5:          02:27:14       I don't know if you can, I mean you, you might have. I mean, look, we have a certain amount of time on this, on this planet, in this life, right? You have a 100 years. If everything goes great, you can't really expect to just live in that. That perfect state of both chaos and and

Speaker 5:          02:27:40       chaos and I guess being in the moment there's something about something that's dangerous and intense and overwhelmingly filled with anticipation beforehand and the preparation is all consuming. There's very few things in life that are the like these big moments like a person stepping into a cage for a fight and the consequences are so grave. It just for your emotions, for your physical health, this is. There's really nothing like it is really the, the to expect that you would find something else similar in life and to be able to achieve a similar state. Outside of that it's. I don't. I don't think you ever will because I feel like part of what makes what you do and what all fighters do so intense and so incredibly enjoyable to watch is that we all know how much is on the line.

Speaker 3:          02:28:41       I think. I believe I'm 100 percent in agreement with you there and I think race car drivers and fighter pilots. I think people like that also likely experienced that state of being as well. Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah. Fighter pilots. It has to be fighter pilots. Apparently. I was reading some story about this, about wife swapping. They're like they, they, uh, they're more inclined to have polyamorous relationships. Really. Yeah. And then the wife swap because the idea was that they know that their life easily could be wiped out any day at any time. And the people they care about the most, their wife or their girlfriend, that they want other people to love them because they might not be. They're interesting and that they would want the people they care about the most. I love them because they're thinking in a altruistic fashion of doing what they can, I suppose to help this person that they care so much about continuing to find joy in their life. Yeah. Because of their, their realization that what joy they may be able to derive from them specifically is is always on a thin line of not being there anymore. That's fucking intense. The love someone so much. You want other people to fuck them because how do I get on that list? Well, it's probably already on there. Just got to ask. I suppose

Speaker 5:          02:30:07       the which comes back to the one thing that is I think poison in life, which is to live a dual life. Grieve a boring no risk, 10 or run, no thrills, no challenge, no growth, no knowledge, no learning. Just this stagnant bullshit life that is so prevalent in our society. I think it's one of the main problems with our world is that we have set up these really safe cities and safe societies and cultures, which is wonderful. It's great, but also we. We haven't given people the discipline or the structure or the. The just the framework for living a life that's going to satisfy your needs in terms of your biological needs.

Speaker 3:          02:30:56       Yes. Psychological and people start determining that totally inane things are what their needs are. They're difficult to acquire, right? You think of Ferrari's going to make you happy because a Ferrari is hard to get. Sure. Look at it like how much do you cost? If I just had that man, I'd be bawling. I'd be driving around. So Rad. I'd be bawling. But then you get that Ferrari. You like. This is just a car. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       like unless you just really love cars like you could love, you know your firebird and you appreciate it from a mechanical standpoint. You want to step back and look at it. It's enjoyable, but if you think that the fucking things going to make you happy, you're crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:31:33       B, then me being happy with who I am as a person and the life that I'm living, the firebird can't do, can't do that. There is no item. You know, I have to sit back and all the time and try to think for myself that

Speaker 7:          02:31:48       you, you've,

Speaker 2:          02:31:50       I, I love my library, that I have all the books within it. I love the cars that I have. I love the relationships that I have, but instead of the relationship, but just the things and it's like these are all great things, but if I don't have them, I'm still me. I still have everything that I need in this world. I don't like to think about them being lost, destroyed. I certainly hit the idea of it being destroyed because even if it wasn't in my hands, I'd like them to still exist for others, but without them. I'm no different than who I am now and I guess that's kind of a thinking of like the Stoics,

Speaker 5:          02:32:26       but you've been more defined by your accomplishments in your thinking and your philosophy and there's lots of things that people

Speaker 2:          02:32:32       obviously they couldn't know about me because it's not the kind of thing that is just my who I am. Right? And, and I don't need someone to know whether or not I'm smart or whether or not I know this or whether or not I can do that. It's like I'll do it when I need to do it and I, I have to try and look to see that I have my own inner peace is based on my own self knowledge and knowledge also that I am lacking, that I can be better, that I, if I want to, I can choose to in those days that I don't. It was a choice not to be better. It wasn't that I couldn't because even going and failing like we talked about before is a worthwhile endeavor because it will move you towards either a eventually getting there or be that it's not something that's going to be yours, but you know what it is and you know what it takes to get there and that's a different perspective altogether and that is where I feel like that's where I can be okay in this world and deal in.

Speaker 2:          02:33:31       There's all kinds of things that you can draw your focus and really eat at you and bother you and you're giving weight to these things and allowing them to have an effect on you and that's natural. That's a normal thing and it's easy to fall into, but if you can be okay with. All right, if all I'm left with is just me and what I have, if I no longer have anything, no, no more luxuries, no more this, no more that. Can you be okay with that? Do you know what kind of life would you make of this? And I like to think the same one I have now. You can pick me up here, take all my shit away, throw me some other part of the world, the third world country, and it will be jarring. It will be difficult and there will be some lament of, but I will continue to be who I am. I will see what is necessary to to communicate with others and to continue to propagate this that I'm trying to create in me.

Speaker 5:          02:34:30       Yeah. I think we're all trying to navigate this really incredibly difficult thing, which is your just your life. You're the emotions, the, the, the, the, your goals, your tasks, your relationships, your, your dreams and aspirations. All these things are just so complicated in the whole idea of not knowing what the future holds is stressful, but it's also incredibly rewarding when things work out well and even when they don't work out well. What's rewarding about that? As you get the gift of knowing that you fucked up and you get the gift of the feeling of fucking up and the horrible, just the feeling of failure and to understand that that's fuel for you to regroup, repackage your fucking thoughts and and now move forward with the knowledge of the mistakes that you've made and you're going to be a better person.

Speaker 2:          02:35:20       How can you fuck up if you don't do anything? If you don't ever do it, you don't just sit back and you try to lead the simplest, safest version of a life. It's not a life on the line and it's not a life I can really imagine that anyone can really be truly fulfilled living and you know, things are ultimately incredibly soft on us. I mean, we have pressures in other ways, but ultimately most of us are living quite comfortable lives with no immediate dangers and no, no real impetus to put stress on ourselves where it doesn't exist at times because let's just say you want to learn new language. There's agitation in terms of, of forcing you to have to endure something. There's some suffering in that and you know, I believe in the Nietzschean concept of suffering creates growth. You know, life is suffering. Suffering doesn't have to be catastrophic. It doesn't have to be this sort of thing that is going to debilitate you, but that suffering is needed for you to continue to become better, for sure.

Speaker 5:          02:36:27       Everything with exercise, with learning, with everything, with even relationships, learning in relationships that all those uncomfortable feelings are how you learn.

Speaker 2:          02:36:36       Yes. Learning relationships. I, I've always said to two friends of mine, you know, the first time they have like a big blow out with something called me up and I'll fuck, you know, so and so said this and I don't know how their Dick ended up there and all this stuff. Look ultimately, yeah. No one wants to get into a row with someone, especially someone that you really care about, but if, if this is an important relationship, the only way it becomes a relationship that has that deeper lasting meaning and that really has any real depth to it at all, is what you do when you guys are faced with adversity that shows you what relationship you have. Because when things are fun and easy, anybody can be a part of it, right? We're all just, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       humping and drinking and going out and that's great. Fucking wonderful. But when someone good, once it's pretty, it's not bad as a single guy, I'm constantly looking for that opportunity. But ladies, if you live in a hump and drink and drink and drink and hump mainly whiskey in coffee, but drinking it, hopping and muscle cars, if you're into that, uh, but when you get into these, all of a sudden adversity comes across your doorstep. How you'd handle that. And you know, whether you're the person who brought it or you're the person who's in enduring it from the other side. And if you haven't experienced that in your life and also experience it in a relationship, man, you might not be ready. That's true. Might not have the tools you need. You need to do. That's difficult, right? It gives you the tools to navigate difficult situations and the other aspects of your life.

Speaker 3:          02:38:05       Agreed. Yeah. It is the. The stresses of having to to deal with a problem and how you handle that problem because there will never be any shortage of problems, of difficulties from, from great too small and you, your way of, of mitigating those problems and dealing with them is, is so important.
