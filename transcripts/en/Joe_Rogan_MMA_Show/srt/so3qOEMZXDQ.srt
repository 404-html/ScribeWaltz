1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,230
Three,
two,

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:06,663
one

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,340
cool thing going on here.
Now we'll circle,

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,080
oh jeff,
merry Christmas.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,943
What's up Joe?
Youtube not been the easiest week in my 

6
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:18,564
life or my career is last week,
but hanging in there to make this a 

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,220
standalone so that people don't have to 
go figuring this out on their own.

8
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:29,040
And I'm sure many,
many fans are tuning in already.

9
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,810
Know that.
The gist of the details,

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,020
let's lay this out from the beginning.
John Jones.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,870
Initial failed test.
Yeah.

12
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:41,871
So that was July of 2017 he tested 
positive for approximately 20,

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,020
anywhere from 20 to 60 Pika grams of a 
longterm metabolite known as the m three

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,880
metabolite of a substance called to 
hydro chloral methyl testosterone,

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,390
Dh cmt,
also known as oral to rentable.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,630
And this was over a year ago.
Um,

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,500
what was determined to be the source of 
this stuff,

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,393
never determined what the source was.
So John went through a full arbitration 

19
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:10,620
hearing,
um,

20
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,020
was never able to determine where it 
came from.

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,100
Tested all the supplements he was using,
you know,

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,570
went through many,
uh,

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,940
interviews with Usada,
had a full on arbitration hearing.

24
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,100
Uh,
the source was never determined where it

25
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:23,934
came from.
Why was his suspension so low or so 

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,193
short?
Well,

27
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,123
I mean it wasn't that determined.
So I mean there's many factors that go 

28
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:36,330
into what that suspension was.
I would argue in the toe tap totality of

29
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:39,180
the evidence that was presented in that 
arbitration that it,

30
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,240
that it wasn't a short suspension.
Um,

31
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,570
because really one key thing came out at
arbitration.

32
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,404
So John went to arbitration before an 
individual by the name of Richard 

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,560
Mclaren.
Richard Mclaren has an arbitration group

34
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:53,394
up in Canada and Mclaren is probably 
worldwide known as one of the most 

35
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,044
credible guys in anti-doping.
I know you had the ICARUS producer 

36
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,370
director on the Mclaren report was the 
report that came from all that.

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,710
He basically investigated the Russian 
state being involved in doping and Sochi

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,750
Games and put out,
actually a series of reports on it,

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,780
detailing it up to 1000 Russian 
athletes.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800
Um,
you know,

41
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:20,634
we're breaking the rules and the Russian
laboratory was helping them get around 

42
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:25,200
it.
So he's a very,

43
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:29,220
very respected guy.
He's independent of obviously the UFC.

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,990
He's independent of Usada.
Um,

45
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,850
he acts on his own and his determination
was his determination.

46
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,760
And I'll read you kind of what he said.
He said,

47
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:39,594
I find that all evidence available to me
leads me to conclude that the violation 

48
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:48,660
was not intended,
nor could it have enhanced the athletes'

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,513
performance.
So a non-intentional so not 

50
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,300
unintentional ingestion.
I mean,

51
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:55,134
there's no argument that it was in his 
system that he found the evidence to 

52
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,014
show non-intentional use.
And then he went further saying that 

53
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,224
based on the numbers of what he saw and 
the evidence that was not even a 

54
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,034
performance enhancing benefit afforded 
to John for having this longterm 

55
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,540
metabolite in his system.

56
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,720
And I think that's significant when you 
talk about hey,

57
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,700
15 months is that that's,
you know,

58
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,130
kind of light being that this is the 
second time through.

59
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,964
I would argue that if there was an 
argument that maybe it's on the higher 

60
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,750
end and certainly,
you know,

61
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,750
we'll talk about the California 
commission.

62
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,510
Andy Foster took that position,
uh,

63
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:32,410
in John's recent California hearing,
he was a little bit critical of Usada.

64
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,300
Um,
he thought,

65
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,253
you know,
he's intimately familiar with this 

66
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:39,310
evidence both in the previous case and 
this occurrence that,

67
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,240
and he also saw that there was no 
evidence that an independent arbitrator,

68
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,530
you know,
made this statement and decision of John

69
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,120
Intentionally cheating.
Um,

70
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,380
so if anything,
you know,

71
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,800
I'd say that potentially there could be 
an argument that,

72
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,030
that it was,
you know,

73
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,873
on the higher end versus the lower end 
because of the fact that it was an 

74
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,840
unintentional ingestion.

75
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,540
Exactly.
Now what is John's excuse?

76
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,351
What is,
what is,

77
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,184
John said how he got this into a system.
We'll look and it's detailed in the 

78
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:10,210
arbitration hearing at all.
John John fully admits that,

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,280
you know,
some of the lifestyle,

80
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,810
lifestyle decisions he was making,
you know,

81
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,790
the partying and things,
you know,

82
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,624
probably did not lead to making smart 
decisions and making smart choices in 

83
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,990
terms of what was being ingested in the 
body.

84
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,183
But certainly his testimony was under 
oath that I have never intentionally 

85
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:31,300
cheated and did not intentionally put 
this substance in my body.

86
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,163
And not only this case,
but it as we talk about the subsequent 

87
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,524
case here,
I think you'll see that based on the 

88
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:38,980
numbers,
you know,

89
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:43,330
coming out of his tests and based on 
some studies that have been done on some

90
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:45,580
of these substances,
it would tend to support that.

91
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,140
Okay,
correct me if I'm wrong,

92
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:52,141
but didn't John tests negative then test
positive for extremely low numbers?

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,140
This is the initial test before we get 
into the most recent field test she did.

94
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:56,974
So that's negative then test positive 
very shortly after with a very small 

95
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:03,100
trace amounts.
Correct.

96
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:06,520
So you have two negative tests on July 
7th and July 8th,

97
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:10,090
I believe,
of 2017 and then weigh in day,

98
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,953
I think it was July 28th he was positive
for a very low level of the m three 

99
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:18,130
metabolite and,
and we might as well start here.

100
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:20,740
So again,
going back to ICARUS,

101
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,120
remember,
remember the doctor,

102
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,280
I mean he's the main character in that 
were chink of,

103
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,030
in 2011 he put out a study on oral 
Terenna Ball.

104
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,960
Um,
he actually,

105
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:32,794
my understanding is dosed himself and 
then studied the excretion of his urine 

106
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:38,584
and what was coming out of it over the 
weeks and months after and determined 

107
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,723
that there were multiple maybe up to 50 
metabolites that once this Dh cmt was 

108
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:52,570
ingested into the body,
the body converted into other substances

109
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:54,490
and these metabolites stayed around.

110
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,323
He identified some short term,
some medium term metabolites and some 

111
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,454
longterm metabolites,
specifically the m three that John's 

112
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:04,304
tested positive for it.
So these longterm metabolites would 

113
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,380
indicate that it was taken long time 
ago.

114
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,770
They would stay around for the longest.
Why,

115
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,530
why was he testing negative and then 
testing positive for these extremely,

116
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:16,940
so yeah,
the numbers.

117
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,670
That's a good question and that's,
that's basically the question,

118
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,504
that point.
But what was not occurring and what has 

119
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,114
never occurred in any of John's samples 
is any presence of the short and medium 

120
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,821
term metabolites.
And if you look at a [inaudible] study,

121
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,000
he identifies a couple of these medium 
term metabolites,

122
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:38,834
Roman numeral one and Roman numeral two.
And he says these metabolites based on 

123
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,580
his study will stay in the body at least
22 days.

124
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,453
Well,
let's look back to the July 7th and 

125
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,170
eighth you know,
positive tests.

126
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,840
He's negative on July 7th and eighth for
everything.

127
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:56,600
For the parent compound,
for the short term,

128
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:01,630
medium term term metabolites and the 
longterm metabolites go 2021 days later.

129
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:04,994
So within that 22 day window,
which is study shows the short and 

130
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:08,264
medium term metabolites would still be 
showing up and there's no presence 

131
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:14,510
whatsoever of the short or medium term 
metabolites.

132
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:17,090
Now again,
we'll get into this a little bit more,

133
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:17,924
but I think the science,
what it's showing is a pulsing effect 

134
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,400
for this longterm metabolite.
Meaning once you ingest,

135
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,263
whether intentionally or not 
unintentionally oral Terenna ball into 

136
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,450
the body,
the body breaks it down,

137
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,570
produces short term and medium term,
which is you know,

138
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,360
visible for a short and medium amount of
time.

139
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,440
And then this end three which is 
produced for a long period of time.

140
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,700
I think with the issue appears to be,
and we'll get into this,

141
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,520
the UFC program is not the only program 
had seen this.

142
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,240
There's another professional sports 
league that has seen it very frequently.

143
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,940
You saw it as also seen this on the 
Olympic side,

144
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,980
but we're seeing this strange action 
with the longterm and three metabolite.

145
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,814
And the theory is it may be hiding in 
the fat tissues surrounding organs and 

146
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,943
maybe have a pulsing effect where it's 
released at certain times and other 

147
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:12,314
times you can't detect it.
And this is not the actual substance 

148
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,080
itself,
but it's a metabolite correct.

149
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:20,150
Which indicates a reaction to this 
substance in the body,

150
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:20,984
breaking down the parent compound the,
the oral Terenna ball and turning it 

151
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:26,670
into these other things which are stored
in the body.

152
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,543
Those metabolites are not performance 
enhancing drugs that are the result of 

153
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,380
the breakdown of the parent drug in the 
body.

154
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,120
How much time is it detectable,
the actual drug itself?

155
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,530
So pretty quick,
uh,

156
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,970
it's a pretty quick clearance time.

157
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,010
I think we're Cenk Golf Studies says,
you know,

158
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,260
maybe a week.
Uh,

159
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,133
so it's not around for very long.
And that's why he conducted the study 

160
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,883
ironically enough.
And I was going to go watch bicker is 

161
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:51,794
here last night and I just,
I've had too much going on in the last 

162
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,640
week to kind of refresh mind.
But um,

163
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,503
apparently he,
he knew this was part of his protocol 

164
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:00,894
for Russian athletes.
He knew a coach that was still giving 

165
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,703
the oral Terenna ball to Russian 
athletes and he had a falling out with 

166
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:10,650
the coach.
So he goes off on the side and studies,

167
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,484
Hey,
the parent compound is going to get in 

168
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,034
and out of the body pretty quick.
It's going to be difficult to detect 

169
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:16,704
that.
Let's try to figure out what stays 

170
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,250
around and leaves markers in the body 
for a long time.

171
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,084
And so he developed the short and 
longterm metabolite tests and was able 

172
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:28,320
to catch some of this coaches athletes 
for using the oral terminable.

173
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,930
Interesting.
So the actual drug itself,

174
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:33,480
it's gone from the system,
but the metabolite remains.

175
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,343
Now what is the window that the,
this metabolite is supposed to be 

176
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,870
detectable in the body?
Cause we're talking now,

177
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,970
what are we at like 18 months?
So here,

178
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,863
here's the show.
Here's the problem is that initial 

179
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:47,540
ingestion,
cause my question is these same longterm

180
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,390
metabolites,
these existed a year plus ago.

181
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,210
It was more than a year.
How long ago that that's the thing.

182
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:56,940
So July,
2017 was your initial test.

183
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:57,774
So with all the experts and we'll get 
through this with all the experts are 

184
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:00,594
telling us is there is no evidence of re
ingestion and most likely this is still 

185
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:09,480
remnants from the July,
2017 tests.

186
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:12,260
However it was to enter into a system.
Um,

187
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,263
and we'll go through some of these 
testing numbers that have shown 

188
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:19,700
negatives followed by very low level 
Pika Pika gram quantities.

189
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,533
You know,
was that the ingestion that happened 

190
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,790
that he tested positive for in July of 
2017 indicated a long term effect.

191
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,130
Right?
It was a long term term metabolite.

192
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,033
Correct.
So meaning it had already been an 

193
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:36,360
assistant for a year or so.
It absolutely could have predated,

194
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,353
you know,
the theory the first time through was 

195
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:39,534
something had to have entered a system 
between July 7th and July 8th those 

196
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:47,571
negatives and this low pika gram reading
on July 28th over this last year,

197
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,090
there's been a lot of study into this 
longterm metabolite.

198
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,580
As I mentioned,
this isn't just a UFC issue.

199
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,414
There's another major professional 
sports league that for the time being 

200
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:59,610
wants to keep their,
their testing confidential,

201
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:02,190
but they've shared that information with
scientists,

202
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,020
with Usada,
with myself.

203
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,243
They saw it on multiple occasions.
This pulsing effect over a year where 

204
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:11,310
you'd see this positive tests over a 
year.

205
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,170
We're talking two and a half years now.

206
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,220
Right.
If it's a year,

207
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,241
if they,
if it's a,

208
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,350
if in July he had to ride in the 17th 
and you were talking a year and a half,

209
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:20,460
right?
July,

210
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,293
2000 second half.
July 17 but it could have been an 

211
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,560
assistant a year prior.
I don't know.

212
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,483
Yeah,
it could have been a couple of months a 

213
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:28,081
year.
I don't know.

214
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:28,914
He had never showed up for that end 
three metabolite for he had been tested 

215
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,470
for it.
He had been tested multiple times in the

216
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:38,100
program from wrong isn't the same level,
isn't it?

217
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,083
Approximately the same Pika grams that 
exists today in 2018 that were there in 

218
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:49,110
2017 generally if you look in and we can
go over these numbers,

219
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:50,580
it,
it fluctuates,

220
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,560
you know,
from single digits and never gets into a

221
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:55,090
triple digits to,
to mid double digits.

222
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:58,120
So there's some as low as nine peak of 
grams over that time.

223
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,860
Um,
there was some at 60 peak of grants,

224
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,723
however,
a peak grant to someone because it's a 

225
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,200
preposterously small.
It's insane.

226
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,034
And you know,
the,

227
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,293
the analogy that I heard early on was,
and I think John uses throw a pinch of 

228
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,610
salt and Olympic swimming pool and I'm 
like,

229
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:15,280
okay,
well that's Kinda wrap your head around.

230
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:16,114
Now let's go the other side.
Let's talk about something really small 

231
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,084
that we know of and how many times you 
have to break down that small particle 

232
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,480
to get to a peak of Graham.
So one grain of salt.

233
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,830
I mean,
we all know what that looks like,

234
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:27,664
right?
You put that in front of you and you 

235
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,420
split that,
and I'd mentioned this week,

236
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,910
50 million,
it's actually 58 million.

237
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,910
If you split that 58 million times a 
grain of salt,

238
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,253
each one has a pika gram.
I mean it's incomprehensible the 

239
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:44,560
detection level and how small that is.

240
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,510
It really is.
It's crazy.

241
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,480
And how many peak of grams that they 
find in his system.

242
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,220
So he's gone from,
and I'll,

243
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:53,050
I'll read through it here.
So here's,

244
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,500
here's since the initial appearance of 
the n three metabolite,

245
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,040
here's what John's tests look like and 
those peak gram reading.

246
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,080
So the first one was collection date was
July 28th,

247
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,220
2017 he had a concentration of ADP 
grams.

248
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,473
However,
let me caution and I'll read something 

249
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,023
from an expert.
When you get down to these pika gram 

250
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,660
levels,
um,

251
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,100
the science is somewhat inexact because 
it's such a small amount.

252
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,650
So the variable,
the plus or minus,

253
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,030
you know,
can be anywhere from 2030 I've seen in,

254
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:28,750
in some instances,
50 or 60.

255
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:32,170
So what this scientist name,
his name is Larry Bowers.

256
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,920
Um,
he was formerly the,

257
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,630
the Usada Science director.
He's currently retired and independently

258
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:40,300
consults.
Before that he ran an Olympic,

259
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,390
uh,
Olympic Committee,

260
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,110
a accredited laboratory at the 
University of Indiana.

261
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,530
The guy's got 20 to 25 years of 
anti-doping experience.

262
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,840
Here's what he,
he told me about,

263
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,280
uh,
you know,

264
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,114
when you're,
when you're analyzing small picogram 

265
00:13:57,581 --> 00:14:01,130
levels,
although the two lab,

266
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,080
a respective laboratories report a 
concentration,

267
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:08,230
I would caution against becoming too 
fixated on the numbers.

268
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,064
First,
the numbers are really estimates of 

269
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:10,864
concentration and probably should be 
considered a range of about plus or 

270
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:14,764
minus 20 picograms per ml.
And he said the December 9th result 

271
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:19,114
would be in the range of John's and 
we'll get to that between 60 and a 

272
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,213
hundred second while the adjustment of 
concentration by specific gravity 

273
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:28,570
attempts to deal with the variability of
urinary excretion rates,

274
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,613
it is an exact,
it is inexact and adds variability to 

275
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:34,300
the estimates.
Finally,

276
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,134
and most importantly,
science has no clear understanding of 

277
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:41,350
the variance of urinary excretion of 
drugs at ultra trace concentration.

278
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:43,000
So basically saying,
look,

279
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:43,834
I mean we have a general idea how this 
works in science but and I think this 

280
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,454
instance comes to play,
be real careful if you're to be the guy 

281
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:54,260
with the pseudoscience out there saying,
wait a second,

282
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:55,094
John jumped from 20 to 60 from September
to December and that means he re 

283
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:01,310
ingested it.

284
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,040
What he's saying here is slow your roll 
on that.

285
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:04,874
That that it's such a small 
incomprehensible level that we don't 

286
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,000
really know what those variances are 
going to look like.

287
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,193
Now I think if we saw jumps and John 
from single digit eight or nine peak of 

288
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:18,140
Graham to multiple hundred digit Pika 
grams,

289
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,200
there would be a concern and maybe some 
meat read administration,

290
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:26,201
but the experts I've speaking to when 
you're talking variability of 10 2030 40

291
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,510
it's not that significant at the peak of
gram level.

292
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,490
What is the window where this longterm 
metabolites starts to express itself?

293
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,443
Like what you said,
there's short term and there's medium 

294
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,720
term.
This is the long term.

295
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,020
How long does it take before the law?
That's a good question.

296
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,670
I,
I don't have the answer to that.

297
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:44,504
And maybe in rich hank hubs report here 
and I would encourage those that are at 

298
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:48,441
home,
you know,

299
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:51,860
playing playing scientist at their 
computer a,

300
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:55,280
the journal of steroid biochemistry and 
molecular biology.

301
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,443
A Raw Chekhov writes a report detection 
and mass spec spectrometric 

302
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,963
characterization of novel Longterm 
Dehydro Chloro method testosterone 

303
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,464
metabolites in human urine.
I'm not sure when that longterm 

304
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,060
metabolite,
how long it takes to to show up.

305
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,490
Here's the problem though with this 
substance.

306
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,713
He did a real brief study.
My understanding is administered it to 

307
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,450
himself.
That's the only study that exists.

308
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,423
Oral Terenna Ball,
DH CMT to my understanding is not 

309
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:28,910
approved for use for human consumption 
consumption anywhere,

310
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,373
anywhere in any country.
So you can't have clinical trials 

311
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,784
ethically in the medical world because 
it's just not legal to give this to 

312
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:40,460
human beings.
So,

313
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,450
you know,
we're,

314
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,970
we're already kind of behind the eight 
ball here and that,

315
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,253
you know,
as compared to other substances where 

316
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:49,140
you can do clinical trials because 
they're readily available,

317
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,730
would be a per prescription or whatever.
This substance is not,

318
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:53,564
the substance was created by the East 
Germans in the seventies and eighties 

319
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,183
and was part of their state sponsored 
doping program where they were doping 

320
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,030
their athletes.

321
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,863
Can you correct me if I'm wrong,
but I believe what I've read is that 

322
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,300
this is particularly effective when 
people are cutting weight.

323
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:09,650
Yeah.
I mean,

324
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,770
is that true or is this just more,
I don't know about that.

325
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:16,640
I think some may be confusing to 
rentable with oral Terenna Ball.

326
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:19,100
Two completely different substances,
actually.

327
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:20,230
Very important.
Yeah,

328
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,183
there's,
there's very different effects on the 

329
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,234
body.
There's very different windows in terms 

330
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:27,320
of detection time ex explain that.
Yeah.

331
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:31,130
You gotta be really careful in this 
world of performance enhancing drugs.

332
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:33,920
There's names that are interchangeable.
There's different,

333
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,470
you know,
chemical names where you change a little

334
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:37,304
bit of that chemical name.
It could mean mean a completely 

335
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:40,064
different substance.
There's instances where the chemical 

336
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:44,840
name is different,
but the substance is actually the same.

337
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,690
So when trying to compare two 
substances,

338
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,070
you know,
make sure if you're at home

339
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,260
doing that analysis,
you're comparing the right ones.

340
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:55,830
Straight Terenna ball is different than 
oral to rentable.

341
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,390
What is the difference?
Uh,

342
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:57,791
yeah,
I,

343
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,624
I can't tell you,
I'm not as familiar with Toronto ball 

344
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,970
other than it's not oral to ball.
So,

345
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,700
but there is a difference in terms of 
the detection window.

346
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,990
Yeah,
there would be,

347
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,823
I mean,
different substances create and throw 

348
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:11,430
out different metabolites.
Um,

349
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,440
and different substances have different 
detection windows.

350
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:15,274
So I haven't done my study and research 
on straight Terenna ball other than 

351
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:19,980
knowing it's different than the 
substance here.

352
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,980
So,
uh,

353
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,160
Gregory reaching cough,
that's how you say his last name,

354
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:23,994
right.
He was the only guy to do an actual 

355
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,410
verified study?
Correct.

356
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:31,050
Now is this study been,
is it been peer reviewed?

357
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:31,730
Yeah,
I mean it will,

358
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,610
it's,
it's published in the Journal of steroid

359
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:38,790
biochemistry and molecular biology.
So in order to get something published,

360
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,050
it needs to be peer reviewed.

361
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,170
So it's,
has it been replicated anywhere?

362
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,100
Not that I'm aware of,
no.

363
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,960
So it's just,
so we have one study,

364
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:49,380
which is really fascinating.
So we know that w first of all,

365
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:51,660
we know this is an effect of steroid.
We know it works.

366
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,003
Yeah.
These Germans I think show that they 

367
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:55,650
wouldn't have been using it.
Um,

368
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,910
it,
it's not a difficult,

369
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,790
it's not an easy,
easy substance to get ahold of.

370
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,060
Look when it's not approved for use 
anywhere in the world,

371
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,610
um,
it's only available on the black market.

372
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,890
Um,
so you'd probably have to go to China to

373
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:08,724
get it manufactured or you know,
research chemical supply company that's 

374
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,700
not supposed to be provided to,
to humans.

375
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,563
Now,
I'm certainly not attributing this to 

376
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:19,110
you,
but there were rumors,

377
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:19,944
this was one discussion.
Was that one of the possible ways he 

378
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,410
could have ingested this.

379
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,630
Um,
and let's be very kind.

380
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,190
John Likes to party.
Okay.

381
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,024
One of the things about partying is 
people do cocaine and one of the things 

382
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:35,010
about cocaine is sometimes cocaine is 
cut with creatine.

383
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,790
One of the things about creatine is 
oftentimes you're buying cheap creatine.

384
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,980
I spent a little,
one of the things that we've had with on

385
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,790
it on,
it's our,

386
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,880
our products are all third party 
verified,

387
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,870
but in the initial goings when we tried 
different manufacturers,

388
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:52,680
especially for Alpha brain,
we found there were other trace elements

389
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:54,750
that were in Alpha brain that weren't 
supposed to be in there.

390
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,750
And it's because of the vats that they 
mix these things up with.

391
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,093
And one of the things that we had heard 
was that creatine oftentimes is made in 

392
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:06,600
the same place where they might be 
making oral Terenna Ball,

393
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:07,434
they might be making animal,
they might be making a bunch of 

394
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:09,834
different things and trace amounts of 
this stuff can get into the create team 

395
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,260
and they use creatine to cut cocaine 
with,

396
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,360
is this,
is this possible or am I just,

397
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,170
yeah,
it's,

398
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,730
it's absolutely a theory.
I don't,

399
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:21,151
you know,
I,

400
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:23,010
I,
I can't sit here and said that happened,

401
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,980
but I will have heard similar things.
I have heard similar things.

402
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:29,040
I know for a fact,
based on my previous career,

403
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:32,100
I worked closely with the DEA.
I was with the FDA,

404
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:36,000
I worked cases involving street 
distribution of recreational drugs,

405
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:36,834
including cocaine.
I know for a fact that creatine is one 

406
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:43,940
of the most common substances that 
cocaine is cut with because as a similar

407
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,750
look,
some more color,

408
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,980
some more feel.
So getting back to

409
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,813
Mclaren's arbitration decision,
I mean this is publicly available 

410
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,410
records,
I'm not saying anything new,

411
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:58,060
but Mclaren addresses at least John's 
lifestyle around this time.

412
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:58,894
And he says the athlete openly admitted 
to Usada that prior to and for a period 

413
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:03,544
of time after the reporting of his 
second adverse analytical finding on 

414
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:11,101
July 28 2017 the athlete used illicit so
called street drugs,

415
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,840
including cocaine now,
okay.

416
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,980
For me to sit here and say,
hey,

417
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:16,960
that's where it came from.
I don't know that.

418
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,570
What's the time period?
He's talking about the,

419
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,030
the athlete admitted,
um,

420
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,803
that prior to and for a period of time 
after the reporting of a second adverse 

421
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,670
analytical finding on July 27,
2017 admitted.

422
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:35,050
So before that test and sometime after.
Okay.

423
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,650
So does that make sense though?
If it,

424
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:39,720
it's cut.
If that's what where the,

425
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,593
the source of it is,
does it make sense that that would show 

426
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:45,640
up as a longterm metabolite?

427
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,670
Doesn't it need a long time in the body 
to digest or do we not know enough about

428
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,020
the window of time?
Yeah.

429
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,390
I don't know if we know enough about the
window of time.

430
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,224
You know my,
my theory and looking at it is even if 

431
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:03,121
there's a small amount of the oral 
Terenna ball in that it's going to for a

432
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:05,194
period of time,
show that parent compound at a small 

433
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:08,644
peak of gram amount and the short and 
midterm metabolites in the small peak 

434
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,103
gram amount.
We have never seen those in the history 

435
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:18,640
of Johns testing.
It's only this longterm metabolite.

436
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,090
So that may be indication that it 
occurred.

437
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,460
Maybe even prior to what we're talking 
about here.

438
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,503
Is it something that could be 
accentuated in some way by the weight 

439
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:30,724
cutting process?
I absolutely think that could be a 

440
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,180
factor.
Um,

441
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,820
there are studies not necessarily with 
this,

442
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,730
but another substance clomiphene and 
look,

443
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:40,564
I want,
while I'm cautioning people to be 

444
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:44,740
careful about comparing different 
substances,

445
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,143
the commonality between Clomiphene,
which there are multiple clinical 

446
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,284
studies on cause it is approved for use 
to be distributed to humans and oral 

447
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,110
Terenna ball is or both chlorinated.

448
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,770
So they both contain a chlorine atom on 
the molecule.

449
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,190
And there is a recently published study 
on clomiphene and its excretion rates.

450
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,193
Um,
again for those at home that want to 

451
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,160
look it up.
The study was published in the endocrine

452
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:14,740
society publication.
It's pure reviewed,

453
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,053
the name of it is hpt axis affects and 
urinary detection following clomiphene 

454
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:24,220
administration and males.
So what they did is they basically,

455
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,630
you know,
got a group of males,

456
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,630
um,
gave them a one month,

457
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,000
um,
cycle of clomiphene,

458
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,983
you know,
I think 25 milligrams a day and then 

459
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:35,044
have them get off and then continue to 
look at their year and up to 261 days 

460
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:40,654
after.
And what you saw and what you see in 

461
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:46,040
this study is that pulsing effect.
So,

462
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,903
you know,
I'm looking at some of the studies 

463
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:49,150
subjects here.
Um,

464
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,113
subject one on day one 21 still showed 
147 Pika grams of clomiphene day one 28 

465
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,470
showed 174 pika grams.

466
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,770
Day One 35 shows nothing.
He's below the minimum courting,

467
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,050
uh,
reporting limit.

468
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,950
And then day one 49,
he's back up to two 36.

469
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,350
There are one,
two,

470
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,700
three,
four,

471
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,773
five,
six out of I think 12 subjects in that 

472
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:18,854
study that showed this pulsing effect of
this chlorinated substance coming and 

473
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:25,430
going again.
You know,

474
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,500
it's,
it's different than oral Terenna Ball,

475
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:32,150
but it has that common factor of being 
chlorinated in this study.

476
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,030
They do talk about,
um,

477
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,873
a fat tissue called the,
let me look this up and make sure I got 

478
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:39,590
this right.
Adipose tissue,

479
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,860
this is fat that surrounds the internal 
organs.

480
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:45,710
It's one of the last things that the 
body burns when it's going,

481
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:47,570
you know,
starving itself and going to fat.

482
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,700
It protects those organs.
But yeah,

483
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:51,790
you look at these,
you know,

484
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,400
extreme weight gains and cuts that the 
UFC athlete goes through.

485
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,233
I don't think you're going to find 
possibly another human subject anywhere 

486
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,460
that goes through putting weight on 
other than maybe that,

487
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,910
I don't think Olympic wrestling matches 
with an MMA fighter,

488
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,230
um,
goes through,

489
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,064
at least in my experience over these 
three or four years talking to those in 

490
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:15,640
the Olympic world.
I think we're at the extreme and it's,

491
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:17,630
it's something obviously we've talked 
about before,

492
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:19,940
we're trying to curtail,
but you know,

493
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,863
there's,
there's clearly never been a study for 

494
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:23,444
anybody who dehydrates and readwrite 
hydrates themselves to the extent that 

495
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:29,540
some of our athletes do.
You could never find,

496
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,763
there would never be anybody with any 
ethics that would support a study 

497
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:37,250
because some of that dehydration exceeds
World Health Organization standards.

498
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:39,770
So there's no studies out there,
you know,

499
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,690
on this stuff.
But clearly,

500
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,080
you know,
looking from afar I,

501
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:43,914
I'd say that it likely has some impact 
over what's being released by this 

502
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:47,960
adipose tissue.

503
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,330
We should certainly talk about that in 
the future,

504
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:51,950
about the,
the weight cutting aspect of it.

505
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:52,784
So,
but this adipose tissue loss at extreme 

506
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:56,624
weight cuts could potentially be the 
reason why this stuff is excluding 

507
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,301
itself.
It's,

508
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:04,100
it's definitely a theory out there.
What about micro dosing?

509
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,383
So here's the thing with microdosing 
microdosing has done with indogenous 

510
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,810
substances.
So only test,

511
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,183
well,
I mean someone could try it with 

512
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:14,714
something else,
but the reason you microdose with 

513
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:20,180
endogenous substances is there already 
produced in the body,

514
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,800
right?
So the theory of,

515
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:22,634
okay,
I'm going to microdose oral Terenna 

516
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,033
Ball,
we'll oral Terenna ball still producing 

517
00:26:26,691 --> 00:26:30,950
these short term and longterm 
metabolites in theory,

518
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,813
whether you're taking a hundred 
milligrams or one milligram of oral 

519
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:36,704
Terenna Ball,
those excretion rates of those 

520
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:40,910
metabolites are still going to be 
consistent.

521
00:26:40,911 --> 00:26:44,550
They're going to be in a much smaller 
level or a way to those excretion rates.

522
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,090
Is there a way to mask that in some way?
I'm not aware of any,

523
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,490
um,
I'm sorry.

524
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,160
The only study we have is Gregory,
correct?

525
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,150
That's it.
Correct.

526
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,403
But you know,
just taking it from a common sense 

527
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,830
approach,
it's certainly,

528
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,693
you know,
those that know about micro grossing 

529
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:03,750
know that you microdose with endogenous 
substances,

530
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:04,584
things that are already pouring in the 
body so your body knows what to do with 

531
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:07,890
them.
Those what to do.

532
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:09,300
And you're fooling,
you know,

533
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:13,200
not only are these metabolizing and 
there's no metabolites of them,

534
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,200
but you could also be fooling the 
biological passport.

535
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,260
That's the concern I think and why 
people microdose.

536
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,130
So you saw it as looking not only 
testing for specific substances,

537
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:27,060
but our testosterone epitestosterone 
ratio is going up.

538
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,930
They're looking at at blood values,
how many young red blood cells,

539
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,610
how many mature red blood cells.

540
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,443
So microdosing and those two areas 
wouldn't set off alarms in the 

541
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,820
biological passport world.
Um,

542
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:39,654
I've never heard personally of 
microdosing of exotic his substances 

543
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:43,734
that are not found in the body.
Microdosing and my understanding has 

544
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:47,384
done with things that are endogenous 
body for people that are not familiar 

545
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:51,834
with this terminology,
we were just talking about microdosing 

546
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,443
performance enhancing drugs because a 
micro dosing in today's world is a very 

547
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:01,430
common thing with mushrooms and Lsd.
And a lot of,

548
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,350
I mean I saw a ton of microdosing in 
the,

549
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:06,350
in the cycling world that was test 
towels,

550
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,220
testosterone,
epo,

551
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,233
hgh,
all those natural occurring in the body 

552
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,193
and said,
I don't produce any really a red flag 

553
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,520
metabolites if you do them.
At very,

554
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:18,840
very small levels.
They'll,

555
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,703
the parent will clear quickly not 
produce any metabolites and will not 

556
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:24,780
throw off the biological passport 
analysis.

557
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,093
Um,
is there a what you mean when Victor 

558
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,140
Conte came out with a clear and all that
stuff with ball co,

559
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,470
they were fooling people.

560
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,370
Is it,
is it,

561
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,233
I mean one of the things that we've 
talked about before is that it's a 

562
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,970
constant race to try to keep up with 
more advanced cheaters.

563
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,221
It is.
And,

564
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,000
and you know what's interesting in this,
I mean,

565
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,210
if I were to talk to you and maybe the 
first time we did talk a couple of years

566
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:48,831
ago,
um,

567
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:50,250
it,
it's come a long way from them,

568
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,590
but clearly if I would have talked to 
you 15,

569
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:53,424
16,
17 years ago when I got my start in the 

570
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:56,004
anti-doping world,
I would have told you definitively the 

571
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:00,600
testing is way behind,
you know,

572
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:02,800
what's being used out there.
Um,

573
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,240
they were testing,
able to test to multiple nanogram,

574
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,470
um,
limits.

575
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:08,304
That's as far down as we can go.
Now they can go down to single digit 

576
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:12,384
Pika,
gram.

577
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,260
There's another professional sports 
league out there that recently had a one

578
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,080
pika gram and three metabolite case.

579
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,890
I mean do the math coming down from you 
know,

580
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,933
four or five nanograms,
which used to be the lower limit now to 

581
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:29,940
one Pika Gram ten thousand twenty 
thousand times.

582
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,863
I am almost under the theory that the 
pendulum has swung maybe a little bit 

583
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,234
too far in the other direction and that 
that certainly is part of my job to the 

584
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:40,771
UFC.
Look,

585
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,720
I want catch every intentional cheater 
that's out there.

586
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:46,000
I want to make sure we have a rock solid
program,

587
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,970
use all the latest and greatest,
you know,

588
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,980
um,
techniques to do it.

589
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,843
But I also want to keep an eye on it to 
make sure it's being administrated 

590
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:55,684
fairly.
And when you're getting down to 

591
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,870
detection of one,
you know,

592
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:03,871
single digit Pika Grams,
I have a concern that what kind of level

593
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:07,300
of sensitivity we're talking about.
Are we going to talk about environmental

594
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,134
contamination where you walk through a 
room and somebody has just opened a 

595
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:13,480
container of something and there's,
you know,

596
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:15,550
minuscule powders in the air.

597
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,683
There are documented cases that some of 
the regularly prescribed prescription 

598
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:20,554
drugs,
specifically diuretics are getting in 

599
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,260
water supplies in some areas.
You know,

600
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:30,520
you get a lot of old people on them that
flushed their old pills down the toilet.

601
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:31,683
There's documented cases of it getting 
into the water supply and being 

602
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:39,070
detectable at that peak at ground level.
So you've gotta be really,

603
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,930
really careful about that.
And I think,

604
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,153
you know,
this case exemplifies that you saw it 

605
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,443
and,
and really the world antidoping agency 

606
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:50,830
world and community are aware of that.
Um,

607
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:51,664
you know,
with greater sensitivity and testing in 

608
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:55,300
my opinion,
because you know,

609
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,570
makes greater responsibility to be 
objective and look fairly at what really

610
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,220
we're doing here when we're detecting 
and that small amount.

611
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,443
But this,
this task of John's where he's testing 

612
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:08,734
for the same level of peak of Graham's 
today as he was in July of 2017 is it 

613
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,410
safe to say that this is unprecedented?

614
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,533
Repeat that again,
that John's test for the same levels of 

615
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:24,034
peak of grams of these metabolites in 
2018 that he was testing for in 2017 

616
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,570
this is unprecedented.
No.

617
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:32,404
If the answer's no,
it's so maybe I'm precedent and in the 

618
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:34,984
UFC program,
but what the United States anti-doping 

619
00:31:37,741 --> 00:31:38,574
agency did over these last five or six 
months as they reached out to the 

620
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:45,010
science community outside the scope of 
the UFC,

621
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,040
they reached out to other professional 
sports organizations.

622
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,173
They reached out to otherwise water 
laboratories and what they were seeing 

623
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,223
was multiple instances of this pulsing 
effect where over time you would see a 

624
00:31:58,031 --> 00:31:58,864
reading,
the next test it would go away and the 

625
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:05,440
next time you'd see that reading again,
maybe back up to or even above this much

626
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:07,450
time was correct.
Yes.

627
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:10,690
So you see that in the,
in the clomiphene study here too,

628
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,270
I mean almost 260 they stopped the 
study,

629
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:14,104
what it was still appearing and Pika 
gram levels in some subjects and they 

630
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:19,840
stopped the study at 261 days.

631
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,580
And you see those numbers I was reading 
to you.

632
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,433
See this one subject at one 74,
he's negative the next time and then he 

633
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,770
pops up to two in the two hundreds 
after.

634
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:32,350
So it's actually more than the time 
before.

635
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,790
Again,
apples and oranges,

636
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:34,624
different substances.
But the commonality here is chlorinated 

637
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:39,270
substance.
So is the,

638
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:40,104
is it safe to say that this is an 
emerging science and that we're still 

639
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,480
learning and understanding this as we go
along?

640
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,640
Absolutely.
It's still very young.

641
00:32:49,641 --> 00:32:50,570
Look,
the first,

642
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,433
you know,
the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles were 

643
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,650
established the first drug testing 
laboratory by Doctor Catlin.

644
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,540
Um,
so really,

645
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:00,374
you know,
in the scope of science going back to 

646
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:04,160
the earliest days,
then are talking about,

647
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,023
you know,
what,

648
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,800
30,
30 years,

649
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,210
30,
35 years.

650
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,740
Um,
again,

651
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,260
when I started off in this 16 or 17 
years,

652
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:13,940
the science still wasn't good.

653
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,640
They were unable to detect anything.
And the peak of gram level,

654
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,580
um,
again for reference,

655
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,780
very interesting.
So the,

656
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,260
the Wada,
the world anti-doping agencies accredits

657
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:25,094
laboratories across the world and they 
have certain standards that those 

658
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:29,444
laboratories must meet or to retain that
accreditation and keep that 

659
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:37,520
accreditation.
So they have a technical document called

660
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:40,790
the minimum required performance levels 
of their laboratory.

661
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:45,500
So would they tell the laboratories is 
you must detect these substances down to

662
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:46,334
this amount.
If you can't get them down to this 

663
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:48,704
amount,
then you can't have an accreditation 

664
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:50,924
from water.
So the class of substances that oral 

665
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:56,970
Terenna ball would be in,
um,

666
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,183
which would be other anabolic agents,
the required minimum level that they 

667
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:08,810
must attack two is only two nanograms.
So look,

668
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:09,830
watch,
it even says,

669
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,130
as long as you can get to two nanograms,
you can retain our accreditation.

670
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,920
Well what's happening is an arms race in
these laboratories,

671
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,113
they're saying,
well two's the minimum standard but I 

672
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,410
can get down further.
And you know,

673
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:23,840
these are private entities that you 
know,

674
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,930
are looking for customers.
So to be able to reach out and say,

675
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,320
well even though a lot of tells us too 
is as low as we need to go,

676
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:34,640
we can go down to one pika gram.
I think in a sense,

677
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:36,740
maybe you need to slow the reigns on 
that a little bit.

678
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,574
That we're getting too far and too 
sensitive of a level of detection when 

679
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,164
it comes to implementing a fair program 
because you can't determine where a one 

680
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:49,430
pika gram co came from.
You could be breathing again,

681
00:34:49,431 --> 00:34:52,760
contaminated air,
drinking contaminated water.

682
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,010
It gets real dangerous when you get down
that low.

683
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,850
Now how does this reflect on past 
suspensions?

684
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,760
This is a what when you,
you deal with something like,

685
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:03,770
look,
let's bring up Frank Mir for example.

686
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,220
Didn't frank near also test for oral,
turn the ball.

687
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:08,054
Okay,
I want to get back to Frank Mir but 

688
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:09,794
let's,
let's go back to John and this instance 

689
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:13,580
and why you saw it.
It has come out and said,

690
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:15,830
look,
this is not a violation.

691
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,310
So if you go to the Wada,
the world anti-doping code,

692
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,430
there's a section 10.7
0.4

693
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,160
0.1
are UFC program.

694
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,113
You know,
basically mirrors that and we're 

695
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:29,234
bringing that up on the screen there.
So for purposes of imposing sanctions 

696
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:36,920
under tab 10.7
and anti doping rule violation will only

697
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:38,010
be a second

698
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,843
violation if the anti-doping 
organization can establish the athlete 

699
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:42,714
or other person committed.
The second anti-doping rule violation 

700
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,193
after the athlete or other person 
received notice pursuant to article 

701
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:50,004
seven et Cetera.
This is what's known as a double 

702
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:56,670
jeopardy clause.
The sanction test positive for something

703
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:57,504
and if he's test positive for the exact 
same substance that is still in his 

704
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:03,960
system a year later or whatever the 
amount of time is,

705
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,600
you don't include that as a new positive
tasks.

706
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:07,434
One more thing has to happen.
Science has to determine that there 

707
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:14,670
hasn't been a real administration so 
test positive for the same substance and

708
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:17,310
science says based on all the numbers we
see,

709
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,303
there is no evidence of any readminister
ration and the non evidence of the 

710
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:26,290
readministered nation is the lack of 
short term and medium term singling.

711
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,473
Never ever.
And John's or an issue though that this 

712
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:30,654
is only one test that gregory would 
shank goes test is the only study that 

713
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:39,201
showed at these medium and short term 
metabolites exist.

714
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,763
It's the only study,
but I think then if there's only one 

715
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:45,000
study,
you have to go to anecdotal evidence.

716
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,150
Right?
Why don't we do studies on UFC employees

717
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,170
because we're all Toronto Ball.
He'll do it.

718
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,023
Oral Terenna ball is illegal to 
distribute what's due to Mexico and any 

719
00:36:57,841 --> 00:36:59,540
country throughout the world.
It's really eagle.

720
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,333
Every contracts go,
they just let you do whatever you want 

721
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:03,120
to do.
I don't know,

722
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,180
maybe we can look into that,
but shelby may be out for that.

723
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:08,160
And that's the reason for living there.
Um,

724
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,790
I,
I have a problem with that in that we're

725
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:15,860
relying on one study.
This seems to me to be like a,

726
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:18,630
a critical thing that could affect,
I mean we're,

727
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:19,230
we're,
we're,

728
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,720
we're hoping and we're,
uh,

729
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,583
we're putting faith in this study that 
this is the only way that these 

730
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:28,650
metabolites express themselves.
Is it possible that,

731
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,830
what,
that these be like,

732
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,693
you see what the pulsing effect that you
see positive effects and negative or 

733
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:37,194
positive results and negative results 
that these short term and medium term 

734
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:42,624
metabolites don't always express 
themselves and that what we're 

735
00:37:44,701 --> 00:37:48,750
considering a longterm metabolite could 
in fact just be a metabolite.

736
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,131
Yeah.
I,

737
00:37:50,131 --> 00:37:51,570
I mean,
I guess it's possible,

738
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:52,404
but what are you,
are you going to sanction and athlete 

739
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,820
again because you know,
potentially it's possible.

740
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:59,400
And then the theory of that universe.
You can't do that.

741
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:01,050
Let me read it to you real quick.
What,

742
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,800
what these experts came out at and terms
of readministered ration.

743
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:09,000
So Dr.
Daniel Eichner runs the Salt Lake City.

744
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:12,240
It's called a smart sports medicine 
research testing laboratory,

745
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:13,074
or smurter.
They're one of two water accredited 

746
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:17,670
laboratories in the United States.
The other one being a ucla,

747
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,140
um,
again,

748
00:38:19,141 --> 00:38:23,490
one of the most respected minds in 
anti-doping phd chemist.

749
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,773
Um,
his answer in terms of readminister 

750
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:29,730
ration,
um,

751
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,593
was this,
and you very rarely see scientists at 

752
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:36,190
his level talk in a absolute absolute.
So there you go.

753
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,473
And here he says,
there is no evidence that Dh cmt has 

754
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,690
been readministered that's in writing to
us.

755
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:45,400
So very definitive on that,
right.

756
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,550
Um,
you saw it as science director now,

757
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,090
Dan Daniels independent even of Usada.
So those who criticize,

758
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:54,280
Hey,
you saw it as in bed with the UFC.

759
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,410
Daniel lackner doesn't work for you.
Soda.

760
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,460
He runs an independent laboratory.
You sought to send samples there.

761
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,520
The NFL send samples,
they're major league baseball,

762
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,530
send samples there.
The NCA,

763
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,230
he's independent,
owns his own laboratory.

764
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,990
Um,
you saw to also put out,

765
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,360
um,
a letter to us in,

766
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,010
in writing,
um,

767
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,690
upon careful consideration of the very 
low concentration of the DH cmt longterm

768
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,940
metabolite.
And Mr.

769
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,510
Jones is sample and taking into account 
the Human Pharma kinetic characteristics

770
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:28,150
of this particular longterm anabolic 
steroid metabolites,

771
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
uh,
based on data to which you saw to,

772
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:34,540
has access to and in consult,
in consultation with scientific experts,

773
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,330
some of whose opinions aren't close,
you sought.

774
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,630
It has concluded consistent with prior 
residual amounts detected.

775
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:43,990
And Mr.
Jones sample that the presence of Dh cmt

776
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:44,824
longterm metabolite is consistent with 
residual amounts from exposure prior to 

777
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,630
to that July 28th,
2017.

778
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,610
Um,
look,

779
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:56,050
I'm not,
I'm not an expert.

780
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,920
I don't profess to be,
um,

781
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,863
my,
my background's in finance and 

782
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:02,170
accounting.
I traced the money back in the old days,

783
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:06,970
but I know who those experts are out 
there in the world and these are them.

784
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,193
Um,
they're my putting these things in 

785
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:10,474
writing,
putting their reputations on the line 

786
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:14,380
now and forever going forward.
Um,

787
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,170
they're never going to do something like
that because you know,

788
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:18,004
the UFC pays,
you sought it to administer our program 

789
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:22,110
or because Jon Jones is,
you know,

790
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,760
a popular fighter and they want to see 
him fight this weekend.

791
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:27,460
That's just not the way this world 
works.

792
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,650
Of course in in fact it works the 
opposite way.

793
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,870
There would be a great benefit if they 
could catch him cheating.

794
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,670
Absolutely.
And you know,

795
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:34,504
historically experts like this are very,
very conservative when it comes to 

796
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:42,340
talking in absolutes like this.
They don't normally do it.

797
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,203
In all fairness.
The real question is guys like you and 

798
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:49,770
me because we are UFC employees,
so we got to handle this fairly yet.

799
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,090
That argument,
you know,

800
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:55,150
and I saw that left and right that hey,
jeff and joe are paid by the UFC.

801
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:56,830
Of course they're going to come out and 
this way,

802
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:57,664
but look,
all these things that I'm reciting 

803
00:40:58,841 --> 00:41:00,640
today,
we do that in regards to cheating,

804
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,140
I would either,
I've,

805
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,230
I side with the UFC on a lot of things 
because I support the sport.

806
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,250
I wanted to excel.
I don't side ever with cheating.

807
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,113
If I think that there's some way somehow
that someone has given an unfair 

808
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:16,810
advantage and this is somehow being 
covered up,

809
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,460
I would rather not work for them.

810
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,710
Joe,
my seven,

811
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,970
my last 17 years of my career,
my,

812
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:23,950
my,
my,

813
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,843
you know,
everything that I've worked for is to 

814
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:29,890
protect the rights of clean athletes and
to eradicate cheating from the sport.

815
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:32,860
I can't tell you how strongly I feel 
about that.

816
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,703
Sports given me everything in my life.
My Dad was a high school basketball 

817
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,150
coach.
Um,

818
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,270
it paid for my college and scholarships.
It,

819
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,490
you know,
at least the good characteristics in me.

820
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:48,260
I can all trace directly to sports and 
entering into the equation the issues of

821
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:49,094
breaking the rules,
the issues of the health and safety 

822
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:54,410
aspects when you have young,
and I talked to many parents whose kids,

823
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,463
you know,
use steroids because they saw the 

824
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,824
professional athletes doing,
answering that into the body when your 

825
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:03,410
homeowner levels are already out of 
control is very,

826
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:05,570
very dangerous.
Both short and longterm.

827
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:09,320
Can't tell you how passionate I am about
this issue.

828
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,030
And those out there that are saying that
I'm corrupt and my reputation has is out

829
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:14,864
the window.
I would never ever in a million years 

830
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,330
sales people,
I mean you obviously you have,

831
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,060
but you just,
you can't listen to those people because

832
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,880
they want to find things wrong.
Um,

833
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,543
one of the things that I've said about 
you is you're a guy loves to catch 

834
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:31,730
people cheating.
You like it,

835
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,650
you enjoy it.
That's not true,

836
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:34,370
man.
You do.

837
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,203
I don't mind if someone is cheating and 
you catch them in the UFC program now 

838
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,860
with what we've established here.
Absolutely.

839
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:44,780
Back in the old days,
and we've talked about this,

840
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:47,690
look when you had in baseball or in 
cycling,

841
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,470
no testing going on.
Literally the organizations were looking

842
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,390
in the other direction.
I've often said that,

843
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:55,010
look,
I don't agree with what they did,

844
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:55,844
but there's a portion of me and that's 
why I think a lot of these athletes 

845
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:00,710
respected me and share that information.

846
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,190
But there's a portion of me that said,
I don't agree with what you did.

847
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:06,110
I like to think I wouldn't make the same
decision,

848
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,270
but I damn well understand why you did 
this.

849
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,940
You're fighting for millions of dollars 
in contracts.

850
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,013
You know your teammates are doing it,
you know your competitors are doing it 

851
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:19,100
and your know your professional sports 
organization doesn't give a shit because

852
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:22,070
of the weakness of the testing program 
or total lack thereof.

853
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,200
So in instances like that,
there was,

854
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,560
I never came away saying that guy's an 
idiot or an asshole for choose.

855
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:30,350
And I came away saying,
I kind of get why he did it.

856
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:32,750
If I was 21 or 22 years old and 
immature,

857
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:37,430
I may have made the same decision.
Now come into our program here where you

858
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:39,830
have an organization that cares very 
much,

859
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:40,664
that spends multimillion dollars a year.
This program has done nothing but costs 

860
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:46,190
the UFC money.

861
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,263
It costs us money and how we implement 
the program costs us money on canceling 

862
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:51,554
fights.
Anybody who thinks moving this fight to 

863
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:57,830
California is that a financial benefit 
to the UFC is crazy.

864
00:43:57,831 --> 00:44:01,610
We're taking a bath on this one.
People really do need to understand that

865
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,970
the UFC decided themselves,
they self imposed.

866
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:08,240
You sought as sanctioning of fights.
Correct.

867
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,070
Nobody forced us to do that.
So this is a,

868
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:10,904
this was a big step in the right 
direction of trying to make the sport 

869
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:17,570
cleaner because we recognize that first 
of all,

870
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:18,443
there was some legal stuff with the 
testosterone replacement therapy that 

871
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:22,190
just threw everything out of whack.
Right.

872
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:26,600
Where it was essentially it was 
sanctioned cheating.

873
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,520
I mean,
let's be honest about what that was.

874
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,503
It was,
it was clearly a my understanding being 

875
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,440
manipulated.
Yeah.

876
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,293
I'm the very easy to manipulate when you
get permission to use any prohibited 

877
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:36,180
substance like that.

878
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,160
And we went from that to unbelievably 
strict protocols.

879
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:43,890
And now what you're seeing is you're 
seeing,

880
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:46,860
first of all,
we saw a radical change in the physiques

881
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:47,694
of some fighters where we,
we did have some suspicions and those 

882
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:53,100
suspicions,
at least in my eyes had been confirmed.

883
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,443
And now we're seeing the good side of 
this with what in your estimation might 

884
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:06,711
have been moved over into a position 
where okay now now it's getting a little

885
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,610
bit ridiculous in terms of like what we 
can detect and what is,

886
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,580
what is causing fights to be canceled.
Exactly.

887
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:17,990
So interestingly enough,
the world antidoping agency,

888
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
a lot of their next code revision is 
2021 and so they regularly put out,

889
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:23,934
hey,
what are the issues going forward that 

890
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:26,154
we want to address?
And one of the major issues is 

891
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:29,154
potentially establishing thresholds for 
these low level substances that keep 

892
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:35,484
appearing.

893
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:38,370
Um,
DH cmt being one of them,

894
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,990
Austrian being one of them.
And so the idea that water is looking at

895
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:46,020
and has a working group of worldwide 
experts is,

896
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:46,854
hey,
if if something that gets reported back 

897
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:52,290
and under 50 Pika grams,
all the evidence is showing,

898
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,183
more likely than not,
this is from a very low level 

899
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:56,154
contaminant issue.
We've never seen an issue of a micro 

900
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,960
dosing or an intentional use that's 
reached that level.

901
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,093
Why are the labs even reporting at sub 
at quantities lower than 50 pika grams 

902
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:08,184
or 100 peak grounds?
I think very soon they're going to come 

903
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:10,584
out with a recommendation.
We are going to adopt that before 2021 

904
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:17,820
once that working group and we're in 
communication with them,

905
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,953
comes up with those recommendations.
You'll see it it implement it first in 

906
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:22,890
the UFC program,
again,

907
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:23,963
I've always said fairness.
Due process in a program is just as 

908
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:30,420
important as the strength and 
comprehension,

909
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,280
comprehensiveness of that program.

910
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,113
You'll lose faith in your athletes.
You could have the strongest loophole 

911
00:46:36,571 --> 00:46:37,404
free program in the world,
but you start implement tink things 

912
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,770
unfairly.
You'll lose faith just as much as if you

913
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:46,530
had a bunch of loopholes in the program.
It's got to be fair.

914
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,270
Are you aware of the female skier that 
tested positive because of lip balm?

915
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,070
I think,
yeah,

916
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:53,904
it's vaguely recall about that.
What was someone else use the lip balm 

917
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:57,510
before her?
No,

918
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,081
no,
no,

919
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,070
no.
It was a,

920
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,020
uh,
a lip balm for sunburn.

921
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,620
It was for sunburnt lips and it had some
ridiculously small trace amount.

922
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,540
Was it Austin Green cv?
Give her name?

923
00:47:09,541 --> 00:47:12,260
Is Jo Jo Burg?

924
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,590
Trying to remember her name?
Well,

925
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,510
there was the,
the cocaine kissing defense was actually

926
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:20,640
one an arbitration.
So something similar,

927
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:23,820
somebody tested positive for,
you know,

928
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:26,760
low level metabolites,
a cocaine and basically said,

929
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:27,300
look,
you know,

930
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,590
hey,
whether that was good or not,

931
00:47:28,591 --> 00:47:30,310
but um,
you know,

932
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:32,080
the arbitrator bought it and the science
shows,

933
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:33,640
hey that,
that is a possibility.

934
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:34,474
The detection levels are so low.
If you kiss somebody who had just done 

935
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,363
cocaine,
they're now able to detect at those 

936
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,240
levels in the,
the person that kiss that person.

937
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,123
That makes sense.
Do you find this woman doping label on 

938
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:48,994
the label,
which is why they gave her a penalty 

939
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,431
apparently.
Oh,

940
00:47:51,431 --> 00:47:52,390
I see.
Okay.

941
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,070
What is the,
um,

942
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,430
who fucks reading labels on lip off,
you know what I mean?

943
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,503
See,
that's,

944
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,250
that's how crazy it's gotten.
I mean,

945
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:01,084
all our athletes know when,
when they're using a creatine or a 

946
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:04,444
protein or whatever,
I think most of them are pretty careful 

947
00:48:06,221 --> 00:48:06,670
right now.

948
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,230
But to tell them,
hey,

949
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:11,170
you need to read your lip balm and your 
deodorant.

950
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:11,980
I mean,
where,

951
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,790
what level are we get into here?
And these are the levels of detection.

952
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,833
So she 21,
nine year old starved Norway's 

953
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:19,384
powerhouse squad of a skiing cross 
country skiing tested positive for an 

954
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,110
hour anabolic agent listed in the 
contents of a treatment for sunburn.

955
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,473
Um,
this could be similar in some ways to 

956
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:34,900
what Chad Mendez tested positive for,
for something for psoriasis.

957
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:36,480
Correct.
Sat chatman is,

958
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:38,830
has obvious psoriasis.
You'd see it on his body.

959
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:43,540
He's talked about it pretty openly and 
to use some sort of a cream and accepted

960
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:46,150
his penalty wasn't a word of this cream 
had something,

961
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:48,400
some type of a steroid into it.
Yeah.

962
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:49,234
I had seen him publicly state that now 
he chose not to present a defense or go 

963
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:53,514
to arbitration.
So I haven't seen anything in detail to 

964
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:56,250
you.

965
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,420
He just rode knowledgeable on that.
Yeah,

966
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:00,010
he did.
What?

967
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:00,853
So let's get back to the Frank Mir case.
Frank near tested positive was it also 

968
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:05,854
also same thing,
longterm metabolite of world Terenna 

969
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,460
Ball.
Here's the difference.

970
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Frank Mir as the same as John Jones.
His first time through was sanctioned.

971
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,150
John didn't get off the first time that 
showed up in his system.

972
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:19,901
He got,
you know,

973
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:23,020
he was looking at potential for years,
went to arbitration,

974
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,363
presented evidence and act as some other
clauses in the policy that reduced his 

975
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:29,980
sanction.
What does that mean?

976
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:30,851
Uh,
well,

977
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:32,310
one of them was uh,
um,

978
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:37,120
substantial assistance where he assisted
Usada and some way,

979
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:39,160
shape or form and he got a reduction 
for,

980
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,870
for doing that.
Assisted in what way?

981
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:42,123
So I don't know.
And this is the exact reason why I do 

982
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:45,394
this.
So I insulate myself from that 

983
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:50,200
interaction between you sought it and 
the athlete,

984
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:53,860
they are the soldier to adjudicate or in
this they do not.

985
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,210
You know,
get me on the phone and say,

986
00:49:56,211 --> 00:49:57,610
hey,
we're thinking about going this way.

987
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:00,190
They adjudicate completely in a vacuum 
and you are,

988
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:04,660
you're just so people know.
Your title is safety,

989
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:06,700
health and safety.
Athlete health and performance.

990
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:08,590
Vice President of athlete health and 
performance.

991
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:11,410
Yeah.
So you no longer work for you saw it.

992
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:12,730
It never worked for Usada.
That's,

993
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,593
that's a big misconception a lot of our 
fighters think that I've never worked 

994
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:16,271
for,
you saw it.

995
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:19,120
I was a federal agent for 22 and a half 
years.

996
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:20,363
Um,
the latter part of my career got 

997
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:25,390
involved with all these ped distribution
cases.

998
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,840
2015 Lorenzo Fertitta and Dana white 
through a mutual friend contacted me and

999
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:31,611
said,
hey,

1000
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,680
would you come out and kind of talk to 
us?

1001
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:36,340
We're contemplating maybe putting our 
own program together.

1002
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,050
We've had some recent high profile 
positive.

1003
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:39,884
So I came out to vegas a talk with them 
and a week later I get a phone call 

1004
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:47,000
asking if I want to come work for him 
and kind of implement this new program.

1005
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,760
But I've never been an employee of 
Usada.

1006
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:50,620
Okay.
So that's,

1007
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,453
that's good to know because that's been 
stated by some public figures that you 

1008
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:56,990
used to work for Usada and now you work 
for the UFC.

1009
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,230
Never that on a shale.
That's one of my favorite words.

1010
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,440
Um,
so you never worked for you soda,

1011
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,820
you,
uh,

1012
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,713
brought Usada to the UFC or communicated
with Usada and facilitated this 

1013
00:51:09,711 --> 00:51:11,210
agreement.
Correct.

1014
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:15,710
So I never worked for Usada.
I did work very closely with Usada.

1015
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:16,544
So you saw that when I first started 
these series of investigations back in 

1016
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:20,480
2002,
look,

1017
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:21,314
I knew all about how to work a heroin 
distribution organization and cocaine 

1018
00:51:25,071 --> 00:51:27,290
distribution organization,
methamphetamine.

1019
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,050
But when it came to performance 
enhancing drugs,

1020
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:30,884
there was no class that myself or really
any other federal agent or law 

1021
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:35,204
enforcement agent goes through 
surrounding distribution of performance 

1022
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:42,740
enhancing drugs.
So I was examining the discarded garbage

1023
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:45,560
of Balco every week when they put it out
to the curb,

1024
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,530
began seeing notes,
rappers,

1025
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:49,490
all these substances.

1026
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:50,323
I had no idea what these things were.
I didn't know the difference between 

1027
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:56,540
testosterone epitestosterone,
arithroid tin,

1028
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,920
hgh.
I knew nothing.

1029
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,820
So what I did is I figured out who those
experts were,

1030
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,420
who were the people that could very 
quickly get me up to speed on what I was

1031
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:06,990
looking at.
Um,

1032
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,853
doctor Catlin who ran the UCL Olympic 
loud was one of the first and he 

1033
00:52:10,971 --> 00:52:12,320
started,
um,

1034
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:13,790
you know,
kind of walking me through this.

1035
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:16,200
He put me in touch with Usada and you 
know,

1036
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,620
they began educating me as well.
So,

1037
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,920
um,
over the course of those investigations,

1038
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,983
um,
I got a lot from them in terms of 

1039
00:52:24,291 --> 00:52:25,124
educating on the substances.
They were bringing some of their 

1040
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:27,704
cooperating witnesses to me and then we 
go off and running on criminal 

1041
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:32,500
investigations.
Um,

1042
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,700
but never,
never worked for them.

1043
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,370
So you sought a,
correct me if I'm wrong,

1044
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:40,790
but the way they would work would be 
very compartmentalized.

1045
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,623
Like they would not specifically 
communicate with you on all of the 

1046
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,310
details of this.
Correct.

1047
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:47,410
And they don't now,
I mean,

1048
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,640
you don't,
independence aspect.

1049
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:53,960
I don't as these deliberations are going
on what they're looking at,

1050
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:56,320
I don't know.
It's cooperation.

1051
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,273
Just for me to be Frank Wood in my eyes 
would mean that something was done 

1052
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,170
purposely illegally and this person had 
some knowledge of purpose,

1053
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,630
purposeful,
illegal activity,

1054
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:13,810
and that they would somehow communicate 
this to facilitate some sort of catching

1055
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,900
of someone involved in a criminal act or
an act of cheating.

1056
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,481
Yeah,
that,

1057
00:53:18,481 --> 00:53:19,670
that would make sense to me too.
Yeah.

1058
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,770
That would be what we were talking 
about.

1059
00:53:21,771 --> 00:53:22,604
Usada would allow John a shorter 
suspension if he actively participated 

1060
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:31,050
in helping them catch people that were 
cheating that that's the understanding.

1061
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:33,090
I don't know,
implied that would be implied.

1062
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:34,830
I don't know to what level that was 
done.

1063
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,200
I don't know if it was that or if it 
was,

1064
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:38,034
hey,
here's how this drug works in more 

1065
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:41,150
general.
Here's the,

1066
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:43,250
I don't know what it was.
I purposely,

1067
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:46,080
that would mean that John would have to 
know about cheating.

1068
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,110
If you're saying like this,
this is how this jug drug works.

1069
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:50,610
This is how I used it.
I mean,

1070
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:51,444
this would,
he would,

1071
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,813
that would mean his initial defense 
would have to be thrown out the window 

1072
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:56,070
because it wasn't an accident.
Well,

1073
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:57,420
I mean,
I don't know about that.

1074
00:53:57,421 --> 00:53:59,790
If you knew something separate from,
you know,

1075
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,830
that he wasn't someone else.
Yeah.

1076
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:02,910
And again,
I don't,

1077
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,830
I don't want anybody to reach that 
conclusion.

1078
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:08,820
I have no idea what his substantial 
assistance entailed.

1079
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:10,460
None.
Um,

1080
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,110
and it's a slippery slope.
It is a slippery slope and look,

1081
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,580
transparency's important in any program,
but you know,

1082
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:19,200
only to a certain level,
look,

1083
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:21,960
if you are transparent about what 
everyone's,

1084
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,930
you know,
cooperation or substantial assistant was

1085
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,093
and the whole world knew about it,
you're never going to get anybody after 

1086
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:29,960
that coming in and,
and,

1087
00:54:29,961 --> 00:54:30,990
and,
and cooperating.

1088
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,890
I saw this definitely on the criminal 
side with informants,

1089
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:36,750
you don't,
that's not something that's,

1090
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,390
that you want to be transparent about or
disclose.

1091
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,343
Right.
But there's going to be a bunch of 

1092
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:44,640
people that have a real issue with that.
And the idea that Jon Jones,

1093
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,190
you know,
one of the greatest fighters of all time

1094
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:49,660
is actually working as an informant.
I mean it's,

1095
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,120
it's listed in the,
in the,

1096
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,023
you know,
in the Mclaren's ruling that that was 

1097
00:54:53,071 --> 00:54:56,520
one of the reasons for the mitigating 
factor and the reduction.

1098
00:54:56,521 --> 00:54:57,480
But I don't,
again,

1099
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,500
I know nothing about to leave that alone
and about it.

1100
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:03,030
It's been stated,
we know what it is.

1101
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:04,950
Okay.
Or we know that it's a thing.

1102
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:10,390
Um,
when it comes to the John's initial test

1103
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,633
where he was sanctioned and was 
suspended for a determined period of 

1104
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:16,674
time,
Frank Mir also was sanctioned for a 

1105
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:21,210
determined period of time as well.

1106
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,500
He was two years.
He was,

1107
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,753
John was shorter than that.
John was sean cooperate on a bunch of 

1108
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:28,710
other deal.
[inaudible] not only cooperative,

1109
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:30,840
he went to arbitration and put on a 
defense.

1110
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:32,400
He put on a defense that,
look,

1111
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,880
the evidence here shows no intentional 
ingestion of it.

1112
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:40,110
And in fact the Clara and gave him a 
further reduction based on,

1113
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:42,900
there was no evidence of this was 
intentionally done.

1114
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,123
Frank Mir didn't put on any,
he had every right to go to arbitration 

1115
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,990
put on his own offense.
Didn't do that.

1116
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,900
What about Josh Barnett?
Uh,

1117
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:51,930
Josh Barnett,
you know,

1118
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:56,010
a completely different set of facts.
His came from a contaminated supplement.

1119
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,970
It was a different substance.
He went to an arbitration hearing,

1120
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:02,850
the arbitrator ruled with Josh and said,
Yep,

1121
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:03,803
you know,
based on where we are now based on the 

1122
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:08,550
care and effort that you took your 
right,

1123
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:12,840
you deserve to have time served at the 
time of that arbitration.

1124
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,913
So again,
I think that's a good example of the 

1125
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:19,260
checks and balances in place here.
You've gotten me overseeing the program,

1126
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,360
taking a look at how these things come 
out.

1127
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:26,690
You've got the ability from the athlete 
to go to Mclaren's group and judge,

1128
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,030
you know,
the set of facts.

1129
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:28,864
And in that case,
Mclaren's group said you saw Usada I 

1130
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:35,491
think maybe overreached a little bit 
here and I believe Josh and Josh is,

1131
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,420
you know,
basically time served.

1132
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:39,310
So you know,
you want to see,

1133
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,250
you want to see them get it perfect,
right every time.

1134
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:43,084
But you know,
and the reality in the real world is 

1135
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:45,304
that doesn't necessarily happen and 
that's why you have these checks and 

1136
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,390
balances available.
Um,

1137
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,253
Josh Barnett take on.
The matter is that they tried to paint 

1138
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:55,800
him as guilty even though he was not and
that he,

1139
00:56:55,801 --> 00:56:56,634
he feels like he definitely got a bad 
deal and that he was labeled as someone 

1140
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:02,830
who is taking this substance.

1141
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,873
He was suspended for a long period of 
time when he was going through this and 

1142
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:06,844
although he was found not guilty that he
feels like not enough emphasis was put 

1143
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:16,450
into establishing that he was not guilty
and that you know,

1144
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,313
he,
he feels like they chased him down over 

1145
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:21,010
something that he didn't do.
Yeah,

1146
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:21,844
I mean we'll,
well here's what he did do is he used a 

1147
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:24,874
supplement that if he would have 
listened to anything that we educate on 

1148
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:31,420
that you sought a sends out regular 
reminders are fighters are required on a

1149
00:57:31,421 --> 00:57:35,200
quarterly basis to go through videos and
their whereabouts,

1150
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,034
filing that deals with these issues.
If he would have followed any of that 

1151
00:57:38,951 --> 00:57:41,080
advice when it came to his supplement 
choices,

1152
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:43,900
he would have never chosen the 
supplement he used.

1153
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:44,890
I,
you know,

1154
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:45,724
when,
when I heard about that supplement and 

1155
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:48,850
what was on the label and how it was 
marketed,

1156
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,961
I said,
okay,

1157
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:50,794
well that's,
that's likely the candidate of where it 

1158
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:52,780
came from.

1159
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,770
Yeah.
So I mean,

1160
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,210
the analysis would be,
hey,

1161
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:57,070
you know,
that pool will be careful.

1162
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:59,680
There's sharks swimming in that pool.
It can eat you.

1163
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,230
And the person jumps in the water anyway
saying,

1164
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:03,760
look,
I didn't want to get eaten by a shark,

1165
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:05,980
but a shark comes up and aid them.
It's like,

1166
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,480
Hey,
we told you that this was the case.

1167
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:09,314
She didn't follow that.
Now there also needs to be a 

1168
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:13,960
differentiation between someone who's 
intentional,

1169
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:15,370
cheating,
intentionally cheating,

1170
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,290
and someone that's just,
you know,

1171
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:20,650
makes a naive supplement choice.
There.

1172
00:58:20,651 --> 00:58:22,780
There needs to be a differentiation 
between that.

1173
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:24,940
And there was,
and that case Josh didn't get,

1174
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,520
you know,
the full penalty of what was,

1175
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,380
what that substance,
you know,

1176
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,214
would have rendered,
but he did have to go through a long 

1177
00:58:31,991 --> 00:58:33,850
period of time where he was unable to 
fight.

1178
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:35,570
He did.
But you know,

1179
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,453
again,
he had the prohibited substance in his 

1180
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:38,890
body.

1181
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,130
Um,
as you saw it,

1182
00:58:40,131 --> 00:58:41,230
it has to look at,
Hey,

1183
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,630
even though you did that,
didn't do that on purpose,

1184
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:46,180
did that give you a performance 
enhancing benefit?

1185
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,190
Did it allow you to recover a little bit
better?

1186
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,340
Did it make you a little bit stronger?
And you know,

1187
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:54,190
that's why those strict liability 
provisions are in there.

1188
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,980
Otherwise people would just take these 
prohibited supplements and say,

1189
00:58:56,981 --> 00:58:57,814
Oh,
I didn't know exactly it was an 

1190
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:00,020
accident.
Meanwhile,

1191
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:00,903
they're getting a benefit for exactly.
So they have to have some sort of 

1192
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:05,020
penalty in place.
I think so,

1193
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,490
yeah.
I also think,

1194
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,353
again,
there needs to be a differentiation 

1195
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:13,060
between the intentional non-intentional 
and we do have that in our policy.

1196
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:13,894
There are definitely mitigating factors 
available in our policy that if you 

1197
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:19,120
didn't do thing on purpose,
you're not,

1198
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:19,983
you know,
you're not sanctioned as tim means is a 

1199
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:21,950
great example there.

1200
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:25,310
So Tim means use a relatively benign 
supplement.

1201
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,510
It was a creatine,
creatine,

1202
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:30,360
you know,
generally doesn't have an issue as,

1203
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:31,194
as,
as opposed like testosterone booster 

1204
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:33,524
supplements.
We tell our athletes stay away from 

1205
00:59:35,511 --> 00:59:38,300
anything marketing as a testosterone 
booster.

1206
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:39,134
It's one of the most common with 
contaminants are purposely spiking 

1207
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:45,470
purposeful.
Spikings two means uses a Korea 10.

1208
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,130
It had a asta and in a very small 
amount,

1209
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:50,740
uh,
we founded in there,

1210
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:53,030
you know,
Austrian has to your sanction.

1211
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,610
He got six months,
um,

1212
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,500
you know,
so back relatively quickly.

1213
00:59:57,501 --> 00:59:59,420
So I think that's the thing with Yoel 
Romero.

1214
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,003
So correct.
Yoel Romero used a natural diuretic 

1215
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:05,540
product that had um,
a SAR minute.

1216
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:08,060
Um,
and all of these cases,

1217
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,420
not only does the prohibited substance 
need to show up and with the athlete has

1218
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:14,324
says they've used ready but to protect 
against making sure the athlete isn't 

1219
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,310
purposely spiking it.

1220
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,350
You saw it,
we'll go out on their own,

1221
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,110
on the market,
independently procure,

1222
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:27,950
hopefully the same lot of product.
And in the case of eol and Tim,

1223
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,023
they were able to do that,
test it completely independently of the 

1224
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:31,994
athlete,
determine what level the prohibited 

1225
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:34,514
substances in that based on the 
interview with the athlete of how much 

1226
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:38,264
did you use,
when's the last time you used it 

1227
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:43,760
relative to this test?
Do the science calculations just to make

1228
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:44,594
sure an athlete's not saying,
well I know this Korea tennis spiked 

1229
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,760
with fostering,
so I'm going to go use Austrian.

1230
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:53,810
And then I have a built in excuse when I
test positive for Australian in order to

1231
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:57,740
be able to match contaminant levels with
what's being excreted in the urine,

1232
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:02,480
you would literally have to have phd 
chemistry degree and I'm not aware of of

1233
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:04,220
any our athletes have in that,
it'd be very,

1234
01:01:04,221 --> 01:01:05,450
very difficult to do that.

1235
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,810
And so these detection levels,
again we're talking about nanograms,

1236
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,970
we're not talking about large 
quantities.

1237
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:13,130
That would be a pika grams.
Correct.

1238
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,990
Now what,
why was,

1239
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:24,250
why was this moved from Vegas to 
California and why?

1240
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:27,440
Why did the California State Athletic 
Commission,

1241
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,753
why did they accept this fight taking 
place here and why did Vegas say no to 

1242
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:35,150
it?
So internally,

1243
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:36,770
the UFC wise,
we first,

1244
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:39,620
in fact Donna Mark Illini who you know 
who works with me,

1245
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,880
uh,
we're out to Donna.

1246
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:41,803
Exactly.
We're a two person shop and the woman's 

1247
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:45,800
a hawks and one of the hardest workers I
know.

1248
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:47,450
So she's,
she's awesome.

1249
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:48,403
She's taken a look at something that we 
have access to called the clearing 

1250
01:01:50,721 --> 01:01:51,554
house.
And it's basically a recording of all 

1251
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:56,180
the tests on our athletes.
So we can get on there.

1252
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:57,110
Somebody says,
Hey,

1253
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,510
how many times was John Tested last 
quarter?

1254
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,670
We can get on there and pull that up.

1255
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,850
The public also has access to our 
testing records,

1256
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:07,490
not with a specificity that the 
clearinghouse has,

1257
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:11,420
but the public can get on.
And you saw it on a weekly basis.

1258
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:12,583
Um,
updates how many tests and athletes 

1259
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:15,890
done.
So there's some of these,

1260
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,253
some guys out there on the Internet from
the day one of the program have kept 

1261
01:02:20,011 --> 01:02:22,080
track of what week they're numbers tick 
up.

1262
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:24,030
So you can go find spreadsheets on the 
Internet,

1263
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:27,420
at least from a,
from a weekly basis of when our athletes

1264
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:29,280
were tested and how many times every 
week.

1265
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,870
God bless those dorks.
Crazy.

1266
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:31,704
Huh?
So the clearing house program is very 

1267
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:35,724
specific.
We can get on there and see the actual 

1268
01:02:36,871 --> 01:02:40,740
date of the collection.
And next to that we see negative,

1269
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,270
positive or pending.
So Donna came to me late November,

1270
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:46,410
early December saying,
Hey,

1271
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:47,244
I'm looking at John's tests and I'm 
seeing pending still back from I think 

1272
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:54,060
was maybe August,
September,

1273
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:56,280
thinks something's going on here.

1274
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,480
And of course I'm like,
okay,

1275
01:02:57,481 --> 01:02:59,550
well he's fighting pretty soon.
I hope not,

1276
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:03,310
but let me reach out to you Sada.
So I reached out to them.

1277
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,610
They said,
we're working on something.

1278
01:03:05,611 --> 01:03:06,280
We're,
you know,

1279
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:07,113
conducting a study.
We're talking to other professional 

1280
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,384
sports leagues.
We're talking to the laboratories out 

1281
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:13,490
there and don't have an answer for you 
now that,

1282
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:16,230
but stand by.
So I think it was September,

1283
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:20,430
December six,
they sent a letter to us and they sent a

1284
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:23,640
letter to the Nevada state athletic 
commission saying,

1285
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:27,090
just so you're aware,
over the last six months,

1286
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,070
um,
early in this six months,

1287
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:32,050
we've seen a reemergence of this 
longterm metabolite,

1288
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,350
uh,
in John's samples,

1289
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:37,350
we've always was this.
So this was early December,

1290
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,213
December 6th,
we and the Nevada Athletic Commission 

1291
01:03:40,861 --> 01:03:42,660
were notified.
You were notified,

1292
01:03:42,661 --> 01:03:45,180
but the test was from previous.
So the tests,

1293
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,130
these tests,
um,

1294
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:52,190
covered from August through November.

1295
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,993
Okay.
So there's [inaudible] test several of 

1296
01:03:55,651 --> 01:03:56,310
them.
Oh,

1297
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:59,220
some more than one test show this 
metabolite.

1298
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:04,080
So what they said was August 9th,
negative August 29th,

1299
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:09,110
eight picograms September 18th,
eight eight September 18th.

1300
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:10,950
So I mean there's a,
there's a good,

1301
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,850
so he's negative on the ninth 20 days 
later.

1302
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,970
So inside the 22 checkups,
22 day window,

1303
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:21,900
he shows an eight peak gram,
no short term metabolites,

1304
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,700
no longterm,
no parent,

1305
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,350
no medium term,
no medium.

1306
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:26,184
I'm sorry.
No media.

1307
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,420
Only longterm.
Thank you.

1308
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:31,110
Um,
we then go to the 18th of September,

1309
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:35,820
19 Pika grams and then that's followed 
by four negative tests.

1310
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:39,690
September 21st,
October 2nd,

1311
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:43,860
October 11th and November 14th.
So at this point,

1312
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,960
late November,
early December,

1313
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,640
you saw it and says,
okay,

1314
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:51,690
we've done our studying those two low 
levels in August,

1315
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,273
our residual,
there's no evidence of any readminister 

1316
01:04:55,511 --> 01:04:58,740
ration based on lack of short and medium
term and parent.

1317
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,073
Um,
based on our consultation with other 

1318
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,330
leagues with these labs that are seeing 
this,

1319
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,493
we're calling this,
this is would be double jeopardy if we 

1320
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:07,050
did them again.

1321
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:07,883
Okay,
this is awesome.

1322
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:09,023
This is something that should be really 
emphasized because there's a lot of 

1323
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:14,070
people that don't understand this.
This is not just this one test.

1324
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:15,263
These are many tasks that have been done
over course of John's suspension and 

1325
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:20,434
then ultimately relicensing that are 
showing this exact same metabolite at a 

1326
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:27,910
very similar level that according to 
previous tests,

1327
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:28,744
specifically on Clomiphene,
that this could be this pulsing correct 

1328
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:33,544
result of existing and not existing.
But this is not indicative in any way 

1329
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:41,920
that can be provable of microdosing.
Correct.

1330
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:44,020
And not only that,
but this is over.

1331
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:47,350
We're talking about this being over long
term,

1332
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:49,660
long periods of time.
Many months.

1333
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,140
Okay.
And consistent numbers over many months.

1334
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,730
So,
and again,

1335
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:57,850
going back to what one expert Dr.
Bauer said,

1336
01:05:57,851 --> 01:05:59,710
you've gotta be careful what you're 
talking about.

1337
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:02,110
He's single and double wall number,
grams.

1338
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,130
And you see some bearings.

1339
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:03,963
You gotta be careful about saying,
well it went from nine to 18 that means 

1340
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:08,200
re administration.
No,

1341
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,620
it's inexact science at that level.
The water labs,

1342
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:16,510
this is a non threshold substance.
So all water requires them to say,

1343
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:19,750
to report back to water,
positive or negative.

1344
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:22,300
They're not required to quantify.
However,

1345
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:23,134
these water labs have also realized 
there's an issue when you're getting 

1346
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,314
under Pika grams.
So what they're doing is going back 

1347
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:30,910
after reporting the positive,
hey,

1348
01:06:30,911 --> 01:06:35,020
let's see if we can estimate with this 
level is it's an inexact science at Pika

1349
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:38,410
gram quantities in my understanding,
um,

1350
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,273
to,
you know,

1351
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:41,230
estimate what those levels are.
Okay.

1352
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:42,064
You can see some variations.
So Nevada is unwilling to sanction the 

1353
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:50,470
fight based on all this information.
So they get,

1354
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,230
they get the initial notice that we got.
Also,

1355
01:06:53,231 --> 01:06:55,480
I think it was December six saying,
look,

1356
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:57,790
there was an issue in,
in August,

1357
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:00,070
these longterm metabolites reappeared 
again.

1358
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,720
But we've since had four negative tests.
We don't believe that the August,

1359
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:07,420
you know,
reappearance is a re administration.

1360
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,700
There's no sanction here.
Nevada,

1361
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:12,310
you don't even have jurisdiction over 
the August tests.

1362
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,180
Again,
keep in mind,

1363
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:15,760
these are UFC tests.
Nevada doesn't mandate it,

1364
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,070
but Nevada says,
look closer to a fight.

1365
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:21,340
We do take jurisdiction.
We will adopt these Usada tests.

1366
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:23,410
So you saw it.
It didn't need to,

1367
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:24,430
to,
to notify.

1368
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:26,290
They thought out of an abundance of 
caution,

1369
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:29,260
let's let Nevada know that this issue 
exists.

1370
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:32,170
God Damn saw what the fuck they said,
hey wait,

1371
01:07:32,171 --> 01:07:33,100
that's,
that's all good.

1372
01:07:33,101 --> 01:07:33,761
And you saw it,
good,

1373
01:07:33,761 --> 01:07:34,780
bad.
It gets this.

1374
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:35,890
I talk with them.
They're like,

1375
01:07:35,891 --> 01:07:36,790
Whoa,
this is,

1376
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,013
this is concerning.
But we don't see anything within our 

1377
01:07:39,461 --> 01:07:40,294
jurisdiction here.
So I certainly hope that no subsequent 

1378
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:46,810
tests show up positive because that 
could be an issue.

1379
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:47,643
And sure enough,
you sought it collects a sample from 

1380
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:51,580
John on 12,
nine.

1381
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:52,923
They expedited the results cause they 
knew a fight was coming up and they do 

1382
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:59,380
that now when fights or close or the 
collections are done close to a fight,

1383
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,790
and here,
you know,

1384
01:08:00,791 --> 01:08:03,040
he pulses back up to,
uh,

1385
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,830
you know,
between 60 and 80 pika grams.

1386
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:08,500
So Nevada gets this,
uh,

1387
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:09,520
this was last week,
man,

1388
01:08:09,521 --> 01:08:12,100
the days of run together for me.
So,

1389
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,630
uh,
a week ago,

1390
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,770
Friday we have in,
uh,

1391
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,660
Bob Bennett who's the executive 
director.

1392
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,900
While I'm a big fan of these great guys 
out in Nevada,

1393
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:23,680
but I remember FBI agent,
so we got it done around.

1394
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,613
He is.
He's one of the reasons why it probably 

1395
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:28,064
wasn't sanctioned in Nevada was because 
they're so by the book I get angry 

1396
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,000
because I wanted to fight to be in 
Nevada.

1397
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:34,010
But I understand Bob's position.

1398
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,150
Yep.
Implicitly.

1399
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:37,040
So.
So let me make clear what happened.

1400
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:38,870
Bob came in,
Anthony Martin Marinell,

1401
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:39,733
the chairman of the commission came in 
and a couple representatives from the 

1402
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,423
Nevada attorney general's office.
So they are the ones that prosecute 

1403
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,870
cases involving ped,
you said violates Nevada regs.

1404
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,800
So we share all this with them and lists
like you did with me.

1405
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:56,450
Correct.
Share it all with them.

1406
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,580
And look,
there's some misconception out there.

1407
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:02,330
They did not say this fight.
Absolutely not happening next week.

1408
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,580
In fact,
they,

1409
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,070
I think we're understanding these 
issues,

1410
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,090
but said,
look,

1411
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:12,260
you know,
optically this doesn't look great and we

1412
01:09:12,261 --> 01:09:13,094
feel that out of an abundance of caution
that we need to have a public hearing 

1413
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:20,780
and be very transparent about this cause
this is,

1414
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,690
this is some weird shit.
Um,

1415
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:26,690
this was last Friday.
So we're eight days out from the fight.

1416
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:27,501
So,
you know,

1417
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:28,640
we start talking about,
hey,

1418
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:30,710
when can we potentially have this?

1419
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:33,650
And unfortunately,
Christmas holiday,

1420
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,890
several of the commissioners weren't 
even in town.

1421
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,590
And basically what they said is,
look,

1422
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,290
we will absolutely do this if you want 
us to,

1423
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,100
but likely that hearing would not be 
until today,

1424
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,540
Thursday or maybe tomorrow,
Friday.

1425
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:49,880
And you know,
Marinello is like,

1426
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:50,480
look,
I,

1427
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,790
I,
I'm starting to get my head around this,

1428
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:53,983
but I can't guarantee you that my other 
commissioners or me are going to come 

1429
01:09:57,441 --> 01:09:59,120
out the same way.
So you're taking,

1430
01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:01,220
you know,
you're taking a chance here that,

1431
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,390
that we could say,
well,

1432
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:04,670
we need more information.
So,

1433
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,730
so basically they were willing to listen
to it.

1434
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,310
Um,
I think they were starting to wrap their

1435
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:11,144
heads around it,
but didn't feel that they were up to 

1436
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:13,874
speed enough on it.
They didn't have the luxury that Andy 

1437
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,033
Foster and California have.
Remember when John tested positive in 

1438
01:10:21,741 --> 01:10:22,574
July,
2018 that fight was in California 

1439
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:30,170
because that fight was in California,
California retained jurisdiction.

1440
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,280
They've had two very public hearings on 
John when they suspended his license.

1441
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,473
And most recently,
a week and a half ago when they 

1442
01:10:36,741 --> 01:10:40,250
reinstated his license.
So Andy and the commission,

1443
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,340
we're very familiar with the world 
termina ball.

1444
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:46,730
They were very familiar with the 
longterm metabolite.

1445
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:51,590
And in fact Andy was somewhat critical 
of Usada during the last hearing.

1446
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,400
He thought after looking at all the 
details after reading,

1447
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:56,573
you know,
Mclaren's a position that there was no 

1448
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:01,700
evidence that this was done on purpose.
He thought,

1449
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:02,534
man,
maybe they went a little bit hard on 

1450
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:04,970
him.
And he stated that in that,

1451
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:09,971
in that second hearing.
So with the reemergence of the Pika gram

1452
01:11:10,161 --> 01:11:14,490
quantity of this m three longterm 
metabolite Andy in the commission,

1453
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,760
unlike Nevada,
didn't need to get up to speed on it.

1454
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:20,940
They've already had two public hearings 
on John's issue.

1455
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:23,700
They were intimately familiar with,
you know,

1456
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:27,330
some of these dynamics of this drug and 
the metabolites and,

1457
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:31,770
and that's why he felt comfortable based
on their familiarization with it.

1458
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:36,360
And based on these written absolute 
statements by these experts.

1459
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:37,194
So there was no ray ingestion one.
And then the second thing which we 

1460
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:44,130
haven't covered is these experts said,
based on these low level Pika grams,

1461
01:11:44,131 --> 01:11:46,350
there's no performance enhancing 
benefit.

1462
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:51,420
And that's an important point because if
you would have told you fc look,

1463
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:54,960
this is still remnants from a year and a
half ago,

1464
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:56,183
but we can't rule out that he's not 
getting a performance enhancing benefit 

1465
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:01,320
from it.
Well in that instance,

1466
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:03,040
I'll tell you,
and you know I,

1467
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:03,923
I stand by this,
I w I would leave this company if 

1468
01:12:05,881 --> 01:12:06,714
somebody told me otherwise,
if there was any indication that there 

1469
01:12:09,181 --> 01:12:10,014
would be a benefit from him,
even though it technically wasn't a 

1470
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:12,804
violation,
I'm not going to stand by while anybody 

1471
01:12:15,241 --> 01:12:18,180
licenses that guy to fight.
Could it been,

1472
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:23,240
could this have been somehow or another 
mitigated by communicating these results

1473
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:26,790
to Nevada earlier?

1474
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:29,370
Well,
we didn't announce the fight.

1475
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,570
The John was going to fight and in 
Nevada and tell October,

1476
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,210
but in October,
so you have said,

1477
01:12:36,211 --> 01:12:37,680
hey look,
here's this issue.

1478
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,550
Sure.
Potentially buy.

1479
01:12:39,551 --> 01:12:42,480
But the issue was you saw to hadn't come
to that.

1480
01:12:42,481 --> 01:12:43,314
They were in the middle of that point of
consulting with other professional 

1481
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:49,440
sports leagues with the other water 
labs.

1482
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:53,460
They hadn't reached their conclusion.
Their science expert hadn't determined,

1483
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:55,560
Hey,
this is definitely residual,

1484
01:12:55,561 --> 01:12:56,394
no performance dancing.
They were still going through that data 

1485
01:12:58,261 --> 01:13:00,630
at that point.
So what they've told me is,

1486
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:01,080
look,
we,

1487
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,360
we tried to hurry that along as fast as 
possible.

1488
01:13:03,361 --> 01:13:05,490
We wanted to make sure that,
that,

1489
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,080
you know,
we went through this and very,

1490
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:09,510
very detailed and no stone left 
unturned.

1491
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:10,463
When,
when did they reach this conclusion 

1492
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,410
does,
so this was early December,

1493
01:13:13,411 --> 01:13:14,244
so December six that letter went out 
saying we've had these two low level 

1494
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,660
positives back in August.

1495
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,010
Okay.
But here we are.

1496
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,750
I mean,
this is the end of December.

1497
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:25,380
What could this have been headed off at 
the pass?

1498
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,191
Well,
again,

1499
01:13:26,191 --> 01:13:29,520
when Nevada first got notified,
they thought like,

1500
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:30,600
we were hoping,
well,

1501
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:31,434
he's had four negative tests,
so he's probably going to be negative 

1502
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:35,340
going forward here.
Right?

1503
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,203
I mean,
that's what,

1504
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,650
you know,
the lay person would think,

1505
01:13:37,651 --> 01:13:39,540
okay,
he's probably out of the woods now.

1506
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:41,160
But you know,
again,

1507
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:41,994
getting back to what period of time is 
this and John's preparation and if you 

1508
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:46,584
look at some of these numbers and when 
these metabolites appear and disappear 

1509
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:51,803
in early August,
John was preparing his defense for this 

1510
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:55,464
arbitration.
I think he had an idea based on talking 

1511
01:13:57,631 --> 01:13:58,740
to his attorneys like,
Hey,

1512
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,143
we've got a pretty good shot here of 
some mitigating factors where this is 

1513
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:05,100
potentially going to get reduced.
So I think,

1514
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:07,670
you know,
he starts to get a little bit motivated,

1515
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,513
gets in the gym,
start training again clearly in early 

1516
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:11,920
December.

1517
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:12,753
That's a period of time when our 
fighters that close to a fight are 

1518
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,830
bringing down that body weight right 
there,

1519
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,600
cutting body fat,
they're losing,

1520
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:20,980
you know,
a little bit of water.

1521
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:24,010
So it certainly seems to correlate 
these,

1522
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:25,420
these,
these pulsing,

1523
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:27,790
you know,
affects with when is just theoretical,

1524
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:29,500
right?
That it's released from adipose tissue.

1525
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:30,393
Absolutely.
It is.

1526
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:31,580
So,
uh,

1527
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:36,630
this positive result was announced when,
so a week ago yesterday as you saw it as

1528
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:41,740
announced,
you saw,

1529
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,573
it notifies us the UFC.
That always happens and they notify if 

1530
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:48,250
any commission has jurisdiction.
At this point,

1531
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:50,680
this close to a fight.
Nevada has jurisdiction.

1532
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:56,460
So I get the call and you can imagine 
what's going through my head.

1533
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,590
I mean I,
I've gotten so many of these calls now.

1534
01:14:59,591 --> 01:15:02,080
I literally for the first five or 10 
minutes,

1535
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,513
can bury my head in my hand and think 
through exactly how this thing's going 

1536
01:15:06,641 --> 01:15:09,640
to play out and you know,
it's going to be,

1537
01:15:09,641 --> 01:15:11,110
hey,
Nevada is going to say,

1538
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:12,190
wait a second.

1539
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,260
What's going on here?
We need to root this out.

1540
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:17,560
John's going to say,
Jesus Christ,

1541
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:19,120
like,
what is going on in my life?

1542
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:21,880
I can't get a fucking break.
I'm trying to be careful.

1543
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,350
I even went through with DC.
DC's going to react and he reacts.

1544
01:15:26,351 --> 01:15:29,140
He's going to be,
I fucking told you this was the case.

1545
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:31,090
This guy's a cheater.
You know,

1546
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:33,370
you saw it as bullshit.
Novitsky is bullshit.

1547
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,370
All this stuff goes through my head and 
the first five or 10 minutes,

1548
01:15:36,371 --> 01:15:38,020
what's,
how's Dana gonna React?

1549
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:38,854
How's hundred are going to react when I 
have to go over to his office and 

1550
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,320
explain this out to them?
It played out exactly as I saw it.

1551
01:15:44,321 --> 01:15:45,070
It's,
it's,

1552
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:48,100
it's some of the worst days of my career
when I get these calls.

1553
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,620
Um,
but you know,

1554
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:54,730
every bone was notified in Nevada was in
our office two days later.

1555
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,683
And again,
I mean there's been some criticism of 

1556
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:59,650
them out there.
Um,

1557
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:00,753
I don't fault them.
This is a complicated issue that 

1558
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,453
optically doesn't look great and to do 
anything in a rush manner would be 

1559
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:09,940
difficult.
They did everything they could to afford

1560
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:12,820
us.
Having a hearing problem was,

1561
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:14,550
it was just,
it was too close to,

1562
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:19,551
to a fight essentially to get this out,
this issue with optics,

1563
01:16:19,601 --> 01:16:21,610
right?
Cause if you go on twitter,

1564
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:24,130
everybody's calling him a cheat.
Everybody's saying that you know,

1565
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:24,964
anybody that sanctions this is you're 
sanctioning cheating for someone to get 

1566
01:16:30,251 --> 01:16:31,084
an understanding of what this is like.
It actually requires probably more than 

1567
01:16:34,151 --> 01:16:36,880
we've done now over the last hour and 15
minutes.

1568
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,650
Yeah.
And I appreciate this forum.

1569
01:16:38,651 --> 01:16:39,484
I mean,
Dana and I went on sports center and 

1570
01:16:40,631 --> 01:16:42,870
announced it in three minute hit and I 
came out of there going,

1571
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:45,760
absolutely everyone in the world is 
going to say this is bullshit.

1572
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,390
You can't,
this is what,

1573
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:50,110
we're going to have a hard time doing 
this in two hours here,

1574
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,640
Mrs Things.
Yeah,

1575
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:52,474
you've got,
you've got to delve into it and you've 

1576
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:57,040
also have to put your trust and reliance
on these experts.

1577
01:16:57,041 --> 01:17:02,041
They have a education professional 
career of 20 to 25 years to come up with

1578
01:17:03,131 --> 01:17:06,040
these absolutes.
There's no one else in the world,

1579
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:09,860
but maybe a dozen people that can come 
up with these conclusions.

1580
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,660
You do have to put your,
you know,

1581
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:12,494
your faith and in their background and 
their careers and their knowledge and 

1582
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:19,070
education and you know,
a red which those absolutes were,

1583
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:21,560
that there was no evidence of any read 
ingestion.

1584
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:23,790
This is by multiple,
um,

1585
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:24,643
experts and that John would not have 
retained any performance benefit based 

1586
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:30,950
on these low level Pika gram amounts.
Well,

1587
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:33,200
I'm happy that we were going to have 
this out there.

1588
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,060
So people,
if they have the time,

1589
01:17:35,061 --> 01:17:35,894
if they're really that interested in it,
this is probably a more in depth 

1590
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:41,000
discussion of this,
then you're going to get anywhere else.

1591
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,230
But I really wish we could have gotten 
something like this to Nevada and Nevada

1592
01:17:45,231 --> 01:17:47,360
could have gone over this and looked at 
what,

1593
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:49,190
what I'm saying,
what you're saying.

1594
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:54,050
It seems to me that we could have just 
had some sort of a meeting and kept this

1595
01:17:54,051 --> 01:17:57,020
fight in Nevada and it would have saved 
everybody a lot of heartache.

1596
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:58,573
Yeah,
I mean I think things were pointing in 

1597
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:02,700
that,
but there was no guarantees on that nice

1598
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,330
baby.
It's still come on.

1599
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,690
It's Vegas.
You know,

1600
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:07,370
the other thing that was being looked at
was,

1601
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:10,670
was fairness to these athletes.
Really you're going to put,

1602
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:11,893
you're going to put John and gus,
maybe more importantly in a position 

1603
01:18:14,391 --> 01:18:15,224
where he doesn't know until two days or 
a day before whether this fight is 

1604
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:19,460
happening or not.

1605
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,810
I mean these and not even mentioning the
other fighters on the card.

1606
01:18:23,811 --> 01:18:25,490
And Look,
you can talk to,

1607
01:18:25,491 --> 01:18:28,310
and I have to Sean and Mick and Dana and
hunter.

1608
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:31,310
All these fighters want to be on the big
paper views.

1609
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,700
They know the bigger the fight at the 
top of the card,

1610
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:38,480
the more eyes are on that fight.
And when you have a spectacular fight in

1611
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:43,481
the first second fight on the card,
if it's on a big paper view with a giant

1612
01:18:43,551 --> 01:18:45,710
fight at the top of it that can propel 
your career,

1613
01:18:45,711 --> 01:18:46,544
your next fight,
you could be fighting the main event on 

1614
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,890
fight pass and progressed from there.
So I think,

1615
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:52,753
you know,
I think it's accurate to say that 

1616
01:18:54,141 --> 01:18:58,070
generally everybody wants these,
these cards to be as big as possible.

1617
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:03,071
And when all the experts are telling us 
100% this isn't a sanction b,

1618
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,410
he's not retaining any performance 
enhancing benefits.

1619
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:07,243
I think,
and clearly Dane and hunter thought 

1620
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:09,734
this,
we have an obligation to do what we can 

1621
01:19:11,271 --> 01:19:12,104
do for fairness for John.
Definitely for gus for the rest of the 

1622
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:19,100
card to try to make this fight happen 
going forward.

1623
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:22,280
Is there any way we could ever prevent 
something like this from happening again

1624
01:19:22,281 --> 01:19:25,280
with the similar situation in place like
Nevada?

1625
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,143
So here's,
I think we have a couple solutions to 

1626
01:19:27,921 --> 01:19:30,470
that and it's not necessarily relative 
to the commission,

1627
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:33,860
but one thing that obviously protected 
John a lot,

1628
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:36,330
and this was the frequency of testing,
you know,

1629
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,720
if you look at his numbers and these 
were,

1630
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:41,330
these were instances where they 
collected samples,

1631
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:44,060
but in many of these cases they did 
multiple tests on him.

1632
01:19:44,061 --> 01:19:45,440
And that means,
you know,

1633
01:19:45,441 --> 01:19:48,500
the tests I'm reading were for the 
anabolic steroid panel.

1634
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,950
But in addition to that,
they may have done a biological passport

1635
01:19:51,951 --> 01:19:56,090
test on that same collection the May 
have done in hgh test and epo test.

1636
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,890
And this is all confidential that you 
sought.

1637
01:19:57,891 --> 01:19:58,724
It doesn't release all this information 
to these numbers on the publicly 

1638
01:20:00,651 --> 01:20:03,890
available website that you don't see 
what those tests are done.

1639
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:04,724
So the reality,
and they just told me this is John was 

1640
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:07,484
one of the most,
if not the most tested athlete over 

1641
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:10,284
these last six months.
When you look at total amount of tests 

1642
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:14,700
on his samples,
excuse me,

1643
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:16,703
one thing that obviously protecting them
here was that volume of testing and so 

1644
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:21,780
you saw it,
it came to us and said,

1645
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:24,750
hey,
we think that you probably should,

1646
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,673
you know,
up the amount of tests that you're 

1647
01:20:27,181 --> 01:20:28,050
doing.
So,

1648
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,423
um,
we just renewed a contract with Usada 

1649
01:20:31,771 --> 01:20:32,604
and were reduce.
We're increasing our testing numbers by 

1650
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:36,690
30 to 40%.
We currently,

1651
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:37,963
uh,
the first three years of the program 

1652
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:41,460
went under contract for approximately 
2,700

1653
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:46,461
tests and starting this next year we're 
going to up that to around 43 4,400

1654
01:20:46,861 --> 01:20:47,160
tests.

1655
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:50,700
So I think there is going to be more of 
a burden they're going to be,

1656
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:51,653
you know,
you saw to showing up in more doorsteps 

1657
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:55,200
early in the morning of more of our 
athletes.

1658
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:56,034
But I think this is a perfect example 
that that increased volume of testing 

1659
01:20:58,831 --> 01:21:01,590
actually can be a protectant to the 
athlete,

1660
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:02,424
especially when you're talking in these 
low level Pika gram quantities and 

1661
01:21:05,221 --> 01:21:06,054
contaminated cases and things like that.
We just got to get athletes to stop 

1662
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:10,254
taking any supplement.
That's not third party tested great 

1663
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:14,610
points.
So here's what we've done in that area.

1664
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,473
So about three months ago you sought a 
hosted a working group and included the 

1665
01:21:19,801 --> 01:21:22,740
UFC.
Myself and our worst nutritionist,

1666
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:27,090
Clinton Wattenberg who you've met were 
there majorly baseball was there,

1667
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:28,643
the Department of Defense was there.
There's been war fighters who have 

1668
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:32,543
purchased supplements at bases over in 
Iraq and Afghanistan that contain a 

1669
01:21:36,781 --> 01:21:38,550
federal and another bad products.

1670
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:42,030
Some of them potentially have died as a 
result of ingesting them.

1671
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:45,330
So they definitely have an interest in 
safety and dietary supplements.

1672
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:46,643
And you saw it as experts were there.
What we did is we invited in the major 

1673
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:55,140
third party certification companies and 
each one took a half day presenting what

1674
01:21:55,141 --> 01:21:55,974
their programs look like.
We went back and huddled after each one 

1675
01:21:59,071 --> 01:21:59,904
and huddled at the conclusion and said,
what is a platinum standard third party 

1676
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:06,780
certification look like?
Let's all these presentations we got,

1677
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,003
what was strengths and one's weaknesses 
and the others and we have to put a 

1678
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:12,090
perfect one together.
What was it?

1679
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:15,810
What does it look like over the last 
month we've been offering,

1680
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:16,763
um,
a paper that's going to be published in 

1681
01:22:18,031 --> 01:22:18,864
a scientific journal going over with 
that gold standard platinum standard 

1682
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:24,370
looks like,
um,

1683
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:28,920
going forward any third party 
certification company that can meet that

1684
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:30,300
and there's some that are very close.

1685
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,070
I think we'll be able to do it very 
quickly.

1686
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:33,413
We are going to say,
you saw it is going to say this is an 

1687
01:22:36,191 --> 01:22:37,024
approved line of supplements.
We approve you to take this and this 

1688
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:41,523
something that we've been unable to do 
in the first three and a half years of 

1689
01:22:43,411 --> 01:22:44,730
the program.
And I'll tell you joe,

1690
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:47,640
it's the most common question I get from
our athletes.

1691
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:51,460
What's you sought approved?
And as soon as I say you saw,

1692
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,920
doesn't approve any supplements,
but here's how you ensure your safety.

1693
01:22:56,460 --> 01:22:59,190
They stop listening,
goes in one ear out the other.

1694
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:04,080
This is a silly suggestion,
but why doesn't the UFC come up with its

1695
01:23:04,081 --> 01:23:08,080
own supplement and provide them to the 
fighters and say,

1696
01:23:08,081 --> 01:23:09,730
you can't take anything else.
Yeah,

1697
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,593
I mean it's definitely been talking 
through sponsorships with other 

1698
01:23:13,601 --> 01:23:14,860
supplement line.
Exactly.

1699
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:16,270
There's a lot of dynamics to it.

1700
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:20,500
It's not as easy as doing it overnight 
and it's distribution method.

1701
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,270
Just see if he could say,
hey,

1702
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,160
you can take creatine,
you could take,

1703
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:26,140
you know,
all the multivitamins,

1704
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:27,310
you could take,
you know,

1705
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:28,144
a branch chain amino acids and all these
things that have been proven to be 

1706
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:32,130
effective.
But that's,

1707
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,070
that's weird too.
Right?

1708
01:23:33,071 --> 01:23:33,904
It's like they're effective.
Meaning they enhance performance and 

1709
01:23:35,831 --> 01:23:36,664
recovery,
but they don't do enough to be 

1710
01:23:37,991 --> 01:23:40,240
considered a performance enhancing drug.
Yeah.

1711
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:44,350
And they're present in the food supply.
So like basically out of community,

1712
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:46,550
you can go eat 10 chicken breasts or you
know,

1713
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,433
have us a couple scoops of protein if 
you're on the go and don't have time to 

1714
01:23:50,261 --> 01:23:51,190
do it.
So I think,

1715
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:52,024
again,
apples and oranges in terms of 

1716
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:56,260
performance enhancing or not.
Um,

1717
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:58,720
so the theory would be we have an 
approved when,

1718
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,660
when I'm or dawn or ask that question,
what's approved,

1719
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:03,880
I can say,
here's,

1720
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:07,080
let's say NSF NSF has 1200 supplements 
that are approved.

1721
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:10,570
I'd say all 1200 of these are approved.
You should only use these.

1722
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,340
If something were to happen to an 
athlete,

1723
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:13,593
they'd used and approved line of 
supplements to get out of jail free 

1724
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:17,284
card.
If they can prove it and you saw it 

1725
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:20,350
independently prove it,
there's no sanction.

1726
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:23,920
I think that is going to go a long way 
and I'll give you a reason for that.

1727
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:24,783
Majorly baseball does that.
They have for the last couple of years 

1728
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:31,990
now they have some advantage and that 
all their athletes are employees and are

1729
01:24:31,991 --> 01:24:35,230
coming in to the same facility for 
during the season,

1730
01:24:35,231 --> 01:24:37,070
so they have some control over there as 
well.

1731
01:24:37,071 --> 01:24:39,520
We don't,
our athletes are spread amongst,

1732
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:41,620
I think 46 countries throughout the 
world,

1733
01:24:41,621 --> 01:24:42,454
so it's more of a challenge.
But baseball said the only supplements 

1734
01:24:45,671 --> 01:24:49,510
we're allowing in the clubhouse or in a 
facility are,

1735
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,160
and they use NSF supplements.

1736
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:54,460
They had zero contaminated supplement 
cases last year.

1737
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,353
They had,
I think they're testing numbers were 

1738
01:24:57,191 --> 01:24:58,024
four times the amount of our testing 
numbers and zero contaminated 

1739
01:25:00,911 --> 01:25:01,744
supplements.
I mean the proof's in the pudding right 

1740
01:25:03,011 --> 01:25:05,380
there,
so they have to deal with NSF.

1741
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:09,910
I don't know if it's a deal other than 
they've examined who those certification

1742
01:25:09,911 --> 01:25:11,690
companies are and they feel that 
they're,

1743
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:12,940
you know,
at the top of the line,

1744
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:15,573
we don't want to exclude any and that's 
why we're contributing to this paper to 

1745
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:19,001
say,
look,

1746
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:21,160
anyone could be one of these approved 
lines,

1747
01:25:21,161 --> 01:25:24,400
but you must meet this criteria for 
platinum standard program,

1748
01:25:24,401 --> 01:25:26,980
but it's coming from someone who was in 
his supplement business.

1749
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,350
Me,
that's the wild west out there.

1750
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,780
Boy Is,
I mean there's a,

1751
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:34,870
there's a lot of shit out there that's 
just,

1752
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:35,943
they purposely add performance enhancing
drugs to their stuff because it's cheap 

1753
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:42,093
and people take it and they experience 
these gains and then they sell a lot of 

1754
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:46,600
it and then you get a following.
Exactly.

1755
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,260
I saw that when I was with the FDA there
is,

1756
01:25:49,261 --> 01:25:52,780
and what they normally will do for maybe
the first six months of the product,

1757
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:53,793
they'll spike it with something if 
they're going that route and then to 

1758
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:59,110
decrease liability thereafter.
They've already got the following.

1759
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:01,420
The bad stuff's working like,
like hell.

1760
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:05,120
And then they back off just in the 
government and people go,

1761
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:06,470
oh,
my body must have adapted.

1762
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:08,550
Exactly.
Choose Sun.

1763
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:13,220
This.
It's really such a shame because this is

1764
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:15,860
such a fantastic fight.
I mean,

1765
01:26:15,861 --> 01:26:20,780
there's so much drama involved already.
Just having John Jones returning,

1766
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:24,680
having Alexander Gustafson looking 
absolutely sensational in his last fight

1767
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:25,514
with glover to sharer all the trash talk
and hype and intensity in the fact that 

1768
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,210
this is really other than DC versus 
John.

1769
01:26:32,211 --> 01:26:34,760
This is the fight that people want to 
see in the light heavyweight division.

1770
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:36,350
And look,
nobody is saying,

1771
01:26:36,351 --> 01:26:39,740
and I'm certainly not saying that John 
didn't do anything wrong,

1772
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:40,574
he obviously did.
John has two times now tested positive 

1773
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:47,960
for prohibited substance says.
However,

1774
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:49,423
in both occasions,
arbitrators have determine that it was 

1775
01:26:52,101 --> 01:26:55,460
not done intentionally.
So anyone who says it all,

1776
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,610
John's getting off light on this,
he's been suspended for almost two and a

1777
01:26:58,611 --> 01:26:59,444
half years,
for lack with a lack of evidence of any 

1778
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:04,423
intentional use are cheating.
You know how much money he's probably 

1779
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:09,170
lost in those two and a half years?

1780
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:13,730
How many tens of millions of dollars 
doesn't reputation anybody who says that

1781
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:14,564
he got off Scot free on this.
I would argue the otherwise he was 

1782
01:27:18,011 --> 01:27:21,260
felled to the strictest of liability 
standards out there.

1783
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:24,320
Some of the top of their game money 
earning potential like him.

1784
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:27,550
This is also an incredible amount of 
stress and,

1785
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:28,423
and absolutely it's on him.
He feels and he hears what people are 

1786
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,713
saying about them and that's,
that's got to be very difficult also 

1787
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:36,980
again coming off of this massive 
suspension.

1788
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:39,650
So he's coming off of the suspension,
which was huge bay,

1789
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,210
very public,
very worldwide,

1790
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,270
right after the cocaine,
the car accident,

1791
01:27:44,271 --> 01:27:45,290
the,
the previous,

1792
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:46,810
the,
the Dick Pills that had the,

1793
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,610
the stuff.
And I mean this is so many things.

1794
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:50,653
And then to have this happen literally 
the week of and have the fight moved to 

1795
01:27:53,721 --> 01:27:55,700
California.
I mean,

1796
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,250
and I get the skepticism that's out 
there again,

1797
01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:59,383
without delving into this,
I've spent hours and hours and these 

1798
01:28:02,331 --> 01:28:04,970
experts have spent their careers looking
into that.

1799
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:08,720
That's really what's required to get a 
comprehension and understanding of it.

1800
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:11,180
Um,
another thing,

1801
01:28:11,181 --> 01:28:12,014
another argument,
John's being treated specially because 

1802
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:15,043
he's John,
but we had another athlete that this 

1803
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:21,710
somewhat identical thing happened too,
but nowhere near at the level of John.

1804
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:22,544
So a kid by the name of grant Dawson.
So Grant Dawson last summer was in the 

1805
01:28:26,871 --> 01:28:30,260
date and white contender series had an 
awesome fight.

1806
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:33,350
Dana's like you got a contract kid,
uh,

1807
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:35,470
we get them into the Usada program 
there.

1808
01:28:35,471 --> 01:28:36,304
Would you solder quote program requires 
you to disclose everything you've used 

1809
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:43,370
going back 12 months or one year.
The idea being,

1810
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:44,204
look,
even though you weren't under the 

1811
01:28:45,441 --> 01:28:47,240
program,
if you used,

1812
01:28:47,390 --> 01:28:48,223
you know,
oral Terenna ball eight or nine months 

1813
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:50,654
ago,
there could still be an advantage that 

1814
01:28:52,521 --> 01:28:53,750
you beginning,
you know,

1815
01:28:53,751 --> 01:28:54,584
we're not going to necessarily suspend 
you because you weren't subject to the 

1816
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:57,584
program then,
but we're not going to let you fight or 

1817
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,473
right away you can have to be in the 
program for a certain amount of time 

1818
01:29:01,381 --> 01:29:02,214
testing clean.

1819
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:05,010
So he didn't,
he didn't disclose it.

1820
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:06,960
He was using anything.
His first test,

1821
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:10,770
he tests positive for m three metabolite
low levels.

1822
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,220
He goes to arbitration,
argues,

1823
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:16,830
testifies under oath.
I've never heard of this substance.

1824
01:29:16,831 --> 01:29:19,500
I've never taken it.
I would never cheat.

1825
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:21,990
Here are all the Suttons I was using.
I can't find it.

1826
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:23,633
The arbitrator,
heres the hearing you saw to goes to 

1827
01:29:25,471 --> 01:29:26,940
them and says,
hold on a second,

1828
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:29,550
we're looking into this matter.
Talking to baseball,

1829
01:29:29,551 --> 01:29:32,400
whatever you saw it,
it comes out that hey,

1830
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:33,443
we can't prove that this didn't enter 
his substance a year before that 

1831
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:39,960
disclosure required him to disclose what
he was using.

1832
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:42,930
So he was basically led off and an 
eligible,

1833
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:47,931
so John's not the only person in the UFC
that this has happened to,

1834
01:29:47,941 --> 01:29:48,774
not,
not withstanding other professional 

1835
01:29:50,311 --> 01:29:51,900
sports leagues,
other Olympics,

1836
01:29:51,901 --> 01:29:55,320
it's happened to other athletes.
He's not the only one.

1837
01:29:56,630 --> 01:30:01,400
So I think what's important for people,
I get the skepticism,

1838
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:06,260
but I think it's very important that 
people don't accuse someone of something

1839
01:30:06,261 --> 01:30:08,690
that they didn't do.
And I want you,

1840
01:30:08,691 --> 01:30:09,524
if you're listening to this,
I want you to imagine if you're John 

1841
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:16,520
Jones and you trying to get your shit 
together and you didn't do anything new,

1842
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:17,563
he didn't do anything different.
We've got to have a path of redemption 

1843
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:22,750
for people.
You got,

1844
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,190
you have to,
and if John,

1845
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,580
as you're saying,
and all these tests conclude,

1846
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,250
if he didn't do anything,
folks,

1847
01:30:31,251 --> 01:30:33,620
you got to stop saying he's cheating.
You get you got,

1848
01:30:33,621 --> 01:30:37,340
he's not cheating if he's not cheating.
And if it's showing that these are these

1849
01:30:37,341 --> 01:30:41,030
longterm residual metabolites that are 
an incredibly small dosage,

1850
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:42,463
it's,
there's a real cheaters out there and 

1851
01:30:44,181 --> 01:30:45,014
John's fucked up.
He has fucked up and you were all right 

1852
01:30:47,421 --> 01:30:48,950
to be upset at him when he fucked up.

1853
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:53,030
This is not as Lisa's my conclusion 
after talking to you and,

1854
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:54,261
and,
and I've,

1855
01:30:54,261 --> 01:30:55,094
I've talked to some independent 
scientists that were skeptical about 

1856
01:30:56,811 --> 01:30:59,060
some of the aspects of it,
but they're also,

1857
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:00,763
they're skeptical because they're not up
to date perhaps on the differences in 

1858
01:31:05,391 --> 01:31:06,224
this,
this pulsing effect or the fact that 

1859
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:13,310
this is something that is relatively,
there's not a lot of,

1860
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:16,850
a lot of documentation on this mean this
is,

1861
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,713
this is something that's relatively new 
in terms of our ability to understand 

1862
01:31:20,721 --> 01:31:21,554
Pika grams.
Our ability to understand this pulsing 

1863
01:31:23,331 --> 01:31:24,164
affect all these different v these 
variables that you have to take into 

1864
01:31:26,661 --> 01:31:29,240
account when it comes to this.
People love to call cheat,

1865
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:32,090
they love to and it's good.
It's good that the people were out there

1866
01:31:32,091 --> 01:31:34,690
keeping people honest.
But I think you got to,

1867
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:38,750
we got to look at this the right way and
I think the right way is what you're,

1868
01:31:38,751 --> 01:31:40,650
the way you're laying it out here.
I don't see any holes.

1869
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,083
So you know,
a couple things in the future that 

1870
01:31:43,891 --> 01:31:45,270
people can look forward to.
Look,

1871
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:46,853
we want,
and John was to fight in Nevada again 

1872
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:50,100
and Nevada has basically said,
look,

1873
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:52,440
I think we understand this his shoe,
but we need to have this hearing.

1874
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,460
There will be a public hearing on this.
My understanding is early quarter one,

1875
01:31:56,461 --> 01:31:58,290
so look,
you know,

1876
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,190
don't take word for it.
Wait until

1877
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,023
January.
I'm sure they'll call some of these 

1878
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:02,884
experts to testify,
introduced some of these documents to 

1879
01:32:05,891 --> 01:32:08,500
the public record longer even than this 
conversation.

1880
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:09,130
Yes.
My,

1881
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,270
that would be my guess.
Yeah.

1882
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,430
Um,
so yeah,

1883
01:32:12,431 --> 01:32:13,870
I mean that's,
that's to come,

1884
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:15,543
the whole thing is such a disaster for 
everybody else on the card for Amanda 

1885
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:21,130
Nunez and Cris Cyborg and for all the 
people on the undercard.

1886
01:32:21,131 --> 01:32:25,960
I mean it's just to have them to move 
all the way to California when I'm happy

1887
01:32:25,961 --> 01:32:28,000
about though is that the fight is still 
happening.

1888
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:30,160
I'm very happy the fight is still 
happening.

1889
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:31,450
I am,
and again,

1890
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:32,284
I have to take an objective look about 
is this fair as it relates to how our 

1891
01:32:36,131 --> 01:32:39,010
policy and what the rules are.
And you know,

1892
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:40,810
when you have,
you know,

1893
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:44,150
one of the experts in the world,
Dr.

1894
01:32:44,150 --> 01:32:46,270
Daniel Wagner of this myrtle laboratory 
issue,

1895
01:32:46,271 --> 01:32:47,104
an absolute statement like there is no 
evidence the Dh cmt has been 

1896
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:55,120
readministered and that based on these 
low levels,

1897
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:58,210
he does not retaining a performance 
enhancing benefit.

1898
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,433
How out of fairness and implementing the
program do you prevent this fight from 

1899
01:33:02,261 --> 01:33:03,820
happening?
You can't do that.

1900
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:08,010
It would be categorically unfair.
Um,

1901
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:08,943
moving forward from here,
what changes and what do we do to stop 

1902
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:14,000
something like this from happening?
Well,

1903
01:33:14,010 --> 01:33:14,843
again,
I think the increased volume of testing 

1904
01:33:16,121 --> 01:33:16,954
is going to help.
I think being able to specifically 

1905
01:33:19,811 --> 01:33:23,680
direct our athletes to approve line of 
supplements will help.

1906
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,840
Um,
but you know,

1907
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:26,674
hey,
we can dawn and I can message the hell 

1908
01:33:28,961 --> 01:33:30,670
out of these things.
But you know,

1909
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:31,670
it,
it,

1910
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:33,730
it,
it takes the athletes and their camps to

1911
01:33:33,731 --> 01:33:34,564
listen to what we're saying.
So I mean if anything good comes out of 

1912
01:33:36,551 --> 01:33:37,384
this,
hopefully it's a warning to those other 

1913
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:40,880
hours,
others out there about hair,

1914
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:43,480
how careful you need to be.
So to,

1915
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:46,310
just to wrap this up so people 
understand if you,

1916
01:33:46,311 --> 01:33:47,144
if you want to put a button on this,
there's no evidence whatsoever of any 

1917
01:33:50,381 --> 01:33:51,160
microdosing.

1918
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:51,993
So this is one of the concerns people 
were worried about microdosing no 

1919
01:33:54,491 --> 01:33:57,370
evidence whatsoever of microdosing 
wouldn't be a substance.

1920
01:33:57,371 --> 01:34:00,580
You were generally microdose you do the 
endogenous substances,

1921
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:05,410
not exotic genus is also no evidence of 
the short term and medium term.

1922
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,990
Medium.
A medium term.

1923
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:08,853
Yup.
Metabolites that were recognized by her 

1924
01:34:11,741 --> 01:34:13,630
chank off.
Does that any say his name again?

1925
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:17,680
I think it is.
Why don't I Gregory Gregory.

1926
01:34:17,681 --> 01:34:22,681
It's not even Gregory [inaudible] that's
the only test we have no parent compound

1927
01:34:23,441 --> 01:34:24,274
ever found as well.
These are these the only tests we have 

1928
01:34:26,171 --> 01:34:30,400
that show these longterm short term and 
medium term metabolites.

1929
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:31,263
These,
the short term in the medium term ones 

1930
01:34:33,011 --> 01:34:33,844
that would be indicative of him taking 
it recently don't exist at any point in 

1931
01:34:38,081 --> 01:34:39,610
time during these tests.
Correct.

1932
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:44,940
So this is most likely something that is
inside of his body that is an incredibly

1933
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:50,470
small levels.
And is it safe to say that the detection

1934
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:51,603
levels,
that the detection methods are far 

1935
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:56,620
superior today than they were a year 
ago,

1936
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:58,280
two years ago,
three years ago,

1937
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,390
increase by thousands of percentage 
points in sensitivity?

1938
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:03,343
I mean again,
and how recently over the last five 

1939
01:35:05,631 --> 01:35:10,631
years and how recently have they,
if they improve from today versus a year

1940
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:11,991
ago?
Yeah,

1941
01:35:11,991 --> 01:35:13,550
I believe so.
Again,

1942
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:14,384
you know,
when I heard about the one pika gram 

1943
01:35:15,531 --> 01:35:17,870
detection of the m three metabolite,
you know,

1944
01:35:17,871 --> 01:35:19,370
that was something that happened this 
year.

1945
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:23,990
I'm not aware of that ever being that 
low of a number in any time in the past.

1946
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:25,490
So I think,
you know,

1947
01:35:25,491 --> 01:35:28,970
literally week by week,
month by one month as we're going here,

1948
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:30,103
that level of sensitivity is increasing 
and off essentially no possible 

1949
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:38,060
performance enhancing benefits from 
these incredibly low levels.

1950
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:40,310
That's what the experts are telling me.
Look,

1951
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:41,021
and again,
I'm,

1952
01:35:41,021 --> 01:35:43,790
I'm not the expert.
I don't want to profess that I am,

1953
01:35:43,791 --> 01:35:46,100
but what,
what do I have to go to?

1954
01:35:46,101 --> 01:35:46,934
I need to go to those experts that have 
made careers out of studying these 

1955
01:35:49,691 --> 01:35:51,080
substances and the benefits.

1956
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:51,913
And they were all universally telling me
that there's no performance enhancing 

1957
01:35:54,951 --> 01:35:58,460
benefit,
full compliance by Jon Jones in terms of

1958
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:01,340
being there for Usada at every single 
task.

1959
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:03,590
Uh,
notifying his whereabouts,

1960
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:04,424
doing everything by the book.
In terms of what the UFC requires and 

1961
01:36:06,741 --> 01:36:07,760
what you saw to require.
Yeah,

1962
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:10,550
so our program has a three strike 
policy.

1963
01:36:10,551 --> 01:36:11,990
So basically,
you know,

1964
01:36:11,991 --> 01:36:15,350
if you miss a test for an unexplained 
reason three times,

1965
01:36:15,351 --> 01:36:19,370
then it could be a violation.
John's never had one whereabouts strike.

1966
01:36:19,371 --> 01:36:22,460
He's always been available when you saw 
it as tried to test them.

1967
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:24,350
And again,
especially recency.

1968
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:27,440
Recently one of the most tested athletes
in the UFC.

1969
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:28,483
Wasn't there one test in the past where 
you sought a showed up at the gym and 

1970
01:36:32,301 --> 01:36:35,570
there was some sort of speculation that 
John was hiding under the ring pre Usada

1971
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,150
that that was pre Usada before I got 
here.

1972
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,710
I've,
I've heard about that at all.

1973
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:42,110
The details.
I don't know whether it's true or not.

1974
01:36:42,111 --> 01:36:44,390
I think it was a Nevada state athletic 
commission test.

1975
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,650
My recollection's.
Right.

1976
01:36:45,651 --> 01:36:46,790
But it wasn't,
he sought a test.

1977
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:47,713
Okay.
So there's no reason in terms of how 

1978
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:55,640
you're looking at this particular case 
that this fight should not take place or

1979
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:57,410
that John should be sanctioned to any 
further.

1980
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:58,650
There isn't and look,
it's,

1981
01:36:58,651 --> 01:37:02,030
it's the least compelling argument,
but I think you know,

1982
01:37:02,031 --> 01:37:02,864
you have to look at it.
You have to look at the common sense 

1983
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:09,530
approach to this.
A guy who went through a year and a half

1984
01:37:09,531 --> 01:37:10,364
almost suspension to vary,
I would categorize as embarrassing 

1985
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:19,301
public hearings in California along 
arbitration hearing before Mclaren.

1986
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:24,080
All this science is rooted out about how
long this stuff stays in your system.

1987
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:24,914
Longterm metabolites for months,
maybe years you're going to choose to 

1988
01:37:28,641 --> 01:37:29,474
use oral Terenna ball still after going 
through all of that leading up to a 

1989
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:35,720
fight.
I don't buy that.

1990
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:37,100
See,
I don't think,

1991
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:41,870
I think I agree with what you're saying,
but in terms of people fucking up,

1992
01:37:42,170 --> 01:37:43,003
there are no bounds on human stupidity 
and in terms of people's ability to do 

1993
01:37:47,721 --> 01:37:48,554
impulsive things that are irrational,
that wind up sabotaging their career is 

1994
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:55,920
almost more of an indication that people
are willing to do than not.

1995
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:56,190
There's,

1996
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,670
it's very,
it's low,

1997
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:00,120
you're less likely.
And this is in terms of,

1998
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:02,100
especially in particular [inaudible] 
fighters,

1999
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,113
fighters are ridiculously impulsive.
It's one of the things that categorizes 

2000
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:07,053
and it's a characteristic of the,
the type of human being that gets 

2001
01:38:09,271 --> 01:38:12,240
involved in that line of work in the 
first place.

2002
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:14,340
They're wild motherfuckers.
They're crazy.

2003
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:17,070
They do crazy shit.
And I just,

2004
01:38:17,071 --> 01:38:18,360
I don't,
I don't buy that.

2005
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:20,400
That would be new level crazy.
And look again,

2006
01:38:20,401 --> 01:38:23,010
I categorize as a new level,
crazy guy,

2007
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:24,900
least compelling argument.
I agree.

2008
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:25,763
At least compelling,
but I think we'd be remiss if we didn't 

2009
01:38:27,271 --> 01:38:28,650
at least consider that.
Uh,

2010
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:29,670
I,
okay,

2011
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:32,030
I see your point.
I don't buy it that,

2012
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,360
that,
that part I don't buy.

2013
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:36,060
I buy all the science and I'm a big John
Jones Fan.

2014
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:39,720
I mean,
you can call me a John Jones suck up all

2015
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:40,553
day long.
I think he's one of the greatest of all 

2016
01:38:40,861 --> 01:38:42,420
time and I think it's not over for him.

2017
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:46,230
I think he still could reach,
I don't even think he's at his peak.

2018
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:49,650
I think he's still got time to be the 
greatest of all time.

2019
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:53,190
If he hasn't already achieved that.
But I think that he's also,

2020
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,760
he's a wild man.
You know,

2021
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:56,370
it's one of the reasons why he's so 
great.

2022
01:38:56,371 --> 01:38:59,490
It's one of the reasons why you opened 
up the fight with Shogun at 22 years old

2023
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,960
with a flying knee.
And he's a wild motherfucker.

2024
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:07,800
That's who he is.
And it's one of many reasons besides his

2025
01:39:07,801 --> 01:39:12,150
talent that he's so God damn good.
I know the lows of the lows.

2026
01:39:12,151 --> 01:39:12,984
He's gone through these last two years.
You really can't leave how low those 

2027
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:18,000
lines.
And so again,

2028
01:39:18,001 --> 01:39:18,834
look,
I don't disagree with you that that's 

2029
01:39:19,711 --> 01:39:22,830
not out of the area of consideration,
but man,

2030
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:24,240
I,
I just don't,

2031
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:26,610
I don't get anybody.
It could be by reckless.

2032
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:28,620
I hope you're right.
Um,

2033
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:33,060
I also worry that fighters often in 
times,

2034
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:33,894
and I'm not accusing John of doing this,
but oftentimes surround themselves with 

2035
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:39,990
morons and these morons give them poor 
advice.

2036
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:45,140
And these morons think that they have 
ways to skirt systems and get around the

2037
01:39:46,111 --> 01:39:48,600
rules and they have people that,
you know,

2038
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,810
throw a bunch of fancy words their way 
and they want to believe.

2039
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:52,883
And this happens all the time.
This happens all the time with fighters 

2040
01:39:55,051 --> 01:39:58,740
in regards to financial management and 
advice that they get with that.

2041
01:39:58,890 --> 01:39:59,723
Uh,
I mean I've seen like world class 

2042
01:40:01,801 --> 01:40:02,634
fighters do ridiculous shit in terms of 
strength and conditioning because some 

2043
01:40:05,551 --> 01:40:08,760
asshole with a good vocabulary talks him
into some nonsense.

2044
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:10,373
This is just one of the things that 
happens with fighters and oftentimes 

2045
01:40:13,561 --> 01:40:14,394
they can be around someone who gives him
poor advice in terms of what they can 

2046
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:17,873
and cannot get away with when it comes 
to supplementation and when it comes to 

2047
01:40:21,241 --> 01:40:21,990
steroid use.

2048
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:22,830
Yeah,
absolutely.

2049
01:40:22,831 --> 01:40:25,890
And I see that that all over the place.
In John's case,

2050
01:40:25,891 --> 01:40:27,960
however,
to give credit where credit's due,

2051
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:30,890
you know,
his team after the initial positive with

2052
01:40:30,891 --> 01:40:34,980
a dick pills was very interactive with 
me and Donna and you know,

2053
01:40:34,981 --> 01:40:36,330
checking supplements,
Hey,

2054
01:40:36,331 --> 01:40:39,300
what line should we go to show they,
you know,

2055
01:40:39,301 --> 01:40:40,134
to give them credit.
They definitely showed a increase 

2056
01:40:41,851 --> 01:40:44,790
exercise of care when it came to 
supplementation with John.

2057
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:45,780
Well,
that's great to hear.

2058
01:40:45,781 --> 01:40:47,790
And I really hope this is a thing of the
past,

2059
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:51,510
and I hope this is the last time we ever
have to talk about John in this term and

2060
01:40:51,511 --> 01:40:52,344
that moving forward,
we just talk about in terms of his 

2061
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:54,580
performances

2062
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:55,900
and his,
his fights,

2063
01:40:55,901 --> 01:40:57,460
and you know,
what he's already achieved.

2064
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,190
So any youngest UFC champion of all 
time,

2065
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:01,750
uh,
anything else?

2066
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:02,763
Yeah,
so I was going to bring this up at the 

2067
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:06,730
beginning,
but the golden snitch,

2068
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,810
that's Presevo,
that's Brendan Shop's name.

2069
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,170
He gave it to you.
So taking on a life of its own,

2070
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:16,990
and I think,
I think you know the last time we talked

2071
01:41:16,991 --> 01:41:19,360
about Donna asking Alexa,
who,

2072
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:23,230
let me see,
we'll see what Siri says.

2073
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:24,790
Hold on a sec.
Let's see what Siri says.

2074
01:41:24,791 --> 01:41:25,624
Well,
I've never tried this.

2075
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:30,870
Hold on a second.
Who is the Golden Snitch?

2076
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,270
He's some inflammation.
Wow.

2077
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,650
Oh yeah.
Quite niche.

2078
01:41:37,730 --> 01:41:42,000
It's something in Harry Potter,
which I did last time on.

2079
01:41:42,001 --> 01:41:43,650
And I mentioned it was in,
I think,

2080
01:41:43,651 --> 01:41:47,280
my wikipedia profile.
It had me as Aka the golden snitch.

2081
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:52,950
Hey Siri,
who is the golden snitch?

2082
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:56,320
Wow.
Siri.

2083
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:01,220
Siri keeps going with quad itch.
So someone took it down from yeah,

2084
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:01,980
yeah,
yeah.

2085
01:42:01,980 --> 01:42:03,580
I do that.
Well I think we talked about,

2086
01:42:03,581 --> 01:42:04,180
you're like,
Eh,

2087
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:05,770
I dunno.
They just did it.

2088
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:07,943
Um,
so I think I told you about us backup 

2089
01:42:10,151 --> 01:42:11,740
already.
Coworkers call me.

2090
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,410
Yes.
My family calls me.

2091
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:15,130
They call you.
The goldens friends called me.

2092
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:16,863
I was at the MMA awards last year and 
some Yahoo had a few pops back in me is 

2093
01:42:20,441 --> 01:42:23,890
screaming in between presentations,
the golden snitches.

2094
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:28,350
I'm slinking down in my chair,
my girlfriend and I,

2095
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:32,590
we got damn the golden stitch.
It's backup already popped up.

2096
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:35,230
Beautiful.
Just fucking when they do that,

2097
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:37,660
just put your hands up in the air shake 
q one.

2098
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:38,583
So you know,
definitely should make a shirt during 

2099
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:41,830
shows.
All sit pretty close to the cage.

2100
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:42,903
Go out in between a fight into the 
bathroom and it's not Joe Rogan level 

2101
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,350
half the damn arena standing up.

2102
01:42:47,350 --> 01:42:49,930
Excited to see you walking in and out of
the fight or walk.

2103
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:50,764
But two or three people in that walk 
when I go backstage to check on each 

2104
01:42:53,531 --> 01:42:57,330
side of the golden snitch.
And so give them wreck.

2105
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:59,050
You know Steve Reed,
you know,

2106
01:42:59,051 --> 01:43:01,960
so you've read our bald security,
that bad ass looking guy on stage.

2107
01:43:01,961 --> 01:43:04,450
He'll come back stage just mate,
they're calling me the snitch out there,

2108
01:43:04,451 --> 01:43:05,350
man.
I think I'm you.

2109
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,980
That poor God pays for it.
Um,

2110
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:10,750
we were in a scary guy,
dude.

2111
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:14,140
He's a great dude.
That guy is at the top of his game.

2112
01:43:14,210 --> 01:43:17,380
Insecurity.
Just background is unbelievable.

2113
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:20,260
I saw him one time in Las Vegas during a
fight.

2114
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:24,250
He was sitting on the floor.
Something's happened in the fight.

2115
01:43:24,251 --> 01:43:28,810
The crowd goes fucking bananas and 
everybody stands up on the floor.

2116
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:30,153
Steve stands up and just motions sit 
down and the entire fucking section sat 

2117
01:43:34,751 --> 01:43:35,290
down.

2118
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:37,750
200 plus people.
I'm like,

2119
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,340
dude,
if you can,

2120
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:43,120
without even having to touch somebody,
just stand up by your presence alone and

2121
01:43:43,121 --> 01:43:44,560
control something like that.
I mean,

2122
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:46,900
the best I've ever seen,
he's legit as it gets.

2123
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,480
So are you going to do anything to 
market this?

2124
01:43:49,481 --> 01:43:51,070
Well,
that's getting to my story.

2125
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:53,180
It's not marketing,
but let me finish the story here.

2126
01:43:53,181 --> 01:43:56,520
So I'm in Chicago this year.
I think there was a paper review.

2127
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:57,200
You were there,
right?

2128
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,033
Yes.
So something happened and I was late 

2129
01:43:59,751 --> 01:44:02,390
getting to the arena and they had cut 
off kind of the loading dock.

2130
01:44:02,391 --> 01:44:05,300
I couldn't get to it.
So I had my oldest daughter with me.

2131
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:06,613
And so we're having to walk through 
where all the crowds walking in and you 

2132
01:44:10,521 --> 01:44:11,510
know,
dudes,

2133
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:12,920
all of Golden Snitch,
hey,

2134
01:44:12,921 --> 01:44:15,350
can we get a picture golden snitch?
My daughter's like,

2135
01:44:15,351 --> 01:44:17,630
what the fuck is going on?

2136
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:22,670
How old is your daughter?
So she's 22 so two days ago,

2137
01:44:22,671 --> 01:44:24,820
Christmas morning,
I'm opening up presence.

2138
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:28,010
So I get the presidents from my 
daughters,

2139
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:30,470
the three of them,
and my middle daughter's very artistic.

2140
01:44:30,471 --> 01:44:34,670
And so they create these cool sculpted 
beer mugs and there's four of them.

2141
01:44:34,671 --> 01:44:35,504
One of them's like Bald Guy Brewing 
Novitsky something and one of them says 

2142
01:44:39,201 --> 01:44:42,320
golden snitch brewing company.
So it's cool looking thing.

2143
01:44:42,321 --> 01:44:43,154
And she,
she drew me a black and white kind of 

2144
01:44:44,691 --> 01:44:47,030
rendition of all four,
which I'm gonna hang up really cool.

2145
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:48,163
So then my girlfriend's there.
So she hands me the box and she's been 

2146
01:44:49,911 --> 01:44:50,930
telling me all along,
she goes,

2147
01:44:50,931 --> 01:44:53,930
I got you the best fucking present ever 
in the history of presence.

2148
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:55,340
I'm like,
the hell is this?

2149
01:44:55,910 --> 01:45:00,300
So I open up the box.
Oh my gosh,

2150
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:04,380
she's got this series of tee shirts and 
I think,

2151
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:06,600
what size are you?
Large.

2152
01:45:06,601 --> 01:45:08,490
Large.
There we go.

2153
01:45:08,491 --> 01:45:09,324
Nancy,
you,

2154
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:10,313
since you created it,
you literally and figuratively have to 

2155
01:45:12,931 --> 01:45:17,580
wear it.
Now this is outrageous.

2156
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:19,950
So that picture,
there's some,

2157
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:23,143
oh,

2158
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,820
say who you go baby ladies and 
gentlemen,

2159
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:33,460
circle close.
Look at that.

2160
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:37,103
So I posted a boot on this or something.
Man That's pretty sure can came from 

2161
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:45,470
Moscow.
I think I can say this.

2162
01:45:45,471 --> 01:45:46,304
Hopefully they'll let me back in,
but it's out in front of KGB or FSP 

2163
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:54,470
headquarters to that building in the 
background is kgb.

2164
01:45:54,471 --> 01:45:56,960
F has now known as FSB.
Oh Wow.

2165
01:45:56,961 --> 01:45:59,900
So yeah.
So I posted a picture of,

2166
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,790
she got me like 20 shirts.
I put them on,

2167
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:03,440
not private instagram,
facebook,

2168
01:46:03,470 --> 01:46:05,480
everybody in the world's like,
take my money man.

2169
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:08,150
Where can I get one wearing wearing the 
weigh ins tomorrow.

2170
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:13,200
Alright,
you guys created it.

2171
01:46:13,521 --> 01:46:15,900
You've got to own it now.
I got one for shop too that you can feel

2172
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:17,630
that on the shops mad at you.
Is He?

2173
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:18,300
Yeah,
he's,

2174
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:20,270
he called you the golden wrap now I'll 
change.

2175
01:46:20,780 --> 01:46:23,060
I thought maybe you got him in here.
He's informed.

2176
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:23,913
Misinformed.
He thinks first of all that you were an 

2177
01:46:25,581 --> 01:46:26,630
employee of you saw it.
Oh,

2178
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:27,464
there you go.
And that now you're an employee of the 

2179
01:46:28,731 --> 01:46:29,840
UFC.
Uh,

2180
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:32,830
he's misinformed about that and I think 
he,

2181
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:35,540
he likes to call skeptical.
He skeptical hippo.

2182
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:38,510
I am skeptical as well,
but I,

2183
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:40,303
one thing that I've learned from doing 
this podcast over the years is that 

2184
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,940
there's no fucking way there's,
it's an,

2185
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:50,490
it's impossible to know everything.
It is impossible

2186
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:51,893
and you have to rely on the expertise of
the people who have spent a lifetime 

2187
01:46:56,731 --> 01:46:58,650
studying these things.
It's very important.

2188
01:46:58,920 --> 01:46:59,753
Here's another thing.
There's no way these people could be 

2189
01:47:03,631 --> 01:47:05,610
lying about this and it wouldn't

2190
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:08,340
massively damaged their career going 
forward.

2191
01:47:08,341 --> 01:47:11,060
It'd be done.
Someone would find out,

2192
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:14,210
someone would get to them,
the other scientists without them.

2193
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:16,670
There would be studies done,
there would be papers done,

2194
01:47:16,671 --> 01:47:18,890
the Internet would find out about it.
Everybody would know.

2195
01:47:19,190 --> 01:47:20,023
There's no way it's,
it's pretty unprecedented in writing 

2196
01:47:22,491 --> 01:47:23,324
with the lack of these studies.
They were Chenko one being the my 

2197
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:27,620
sanding even right.
How'd he say it?

2198
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:28,893
The check.
Yeah.

2199
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:32,930
It's pretty unprecedented that they 
would put these absolutes in writing.

2200
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,040
Um,
you know,

2201
01:47:34,041 --> 01:47:35,040
with his law,
you know,

2202
01:47:35,060 --> 01:47:35,893
I think they looked at it very hard and 
detailed and obviously they weren't 

2203
01:47:38,301 --> 01:47:41,090
quick and turning it around.
And we would have loved this decision to

2204
01:47:41,091 --> 01:47:45,410
be made a lot earlier so we could have 
rooted and vetted it out with Nevada.

2205
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:46,693
But they did indeed sign their names to 
these pretty absolute statements and 

2206
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:53,120
what,
what else can the UFC and I do,

2207
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,433
um,
when these experts are putting those 

2208
01:47:55,491 --> 01:47:57,500
absolutes out there and I get the people
go,

2209
01:47:57,501 --> 01:47:58,230
oh,
whoops,

2210
01:47:58,230 --> 01:47:59,150
could you actually do,

2211
01:47:59,350 --> 01:48:02,440
you got to understand folks,
this would be career suicide.

2212
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:03,950
This is,
this is the,

2213
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:08,200
this is cutting edge science we're 
talking about.

2214
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:11,770
There's too many people that would have 
a vested interest in calling bullshit.

2215
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:12,873
It's,
it's not something they don't fuck 

2216
01:48:14,951 --> 01:48:18,110
around when it comes to these things 
that people that are at the,

2217
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:19,263
the front of the line,
when it comes to catching people on 

2218
01:48:20,921 --> 01:48:22,710
these things and the science that 
they're important,

2219
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:23,380
they're,
they're,

2220
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:25,270
they're,
they're involved with.

2221
01:48:25,271 --> 01:48:26,290
It's,
this is not,

2222
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,673
you get,
you can't like gas on the outside with 

2223
01:48:29,711 --> 01:48:32,140
no education.
It's just not wise.

2224
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:33,753
And this is what I keep seeing over and 
over again is people that have some 

2225
01:48:36,251 --> 01:48:39,250
knowledge,
a little bit of knowledge,

2226
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,650
and they're,
they're pretending that they are,

2227
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,180
they have a phd in this shit

2228
01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:45,190
go.
I mean,

2229
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:46,510
for those that want to,
you know,

2230
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:47,443
do more detective work,
go read Mclaren's written decision on 

2231
01:48:50,651 --> 01:48:54,670
John's July,
2018 July,

2232
01:48:54,671 --> 01:48:55,504
2018 tests.
Go read the rich hank off study on the 

2233
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,920
DH CMT and the metabolites and go read 
the recent clomiphene.

2234
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:04,073
Um,
study where it shows is chlorinated 

2235
01:49:05,201 --> 01:49:06,340
substance.
It's pulsing,

2236
01:49:06,341 --> 01:49:08,470
it goes away,
comes back higher than before.

2237
01:49:08,471 --> 01:49:09,760
It goes away,
comes back,

2238
01:49:09,761 --> 01:49:10,750
lower,
goes away,

2239
01:49:10,751 --> 01:49:12,190
comes back higher.
Crazy stuff.

2240
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:13,990
Okay.
Um,

2241
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:17,050
we good when,
when can someone get one of these?

2242
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:20,960
She only made about 15 of them for me,
man.

2243
01:49:20,970 --> 01:49:24,040
You got to sell these.
You have to sell these.

2244
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:25,083
Maybe do something for,
maybe do something for charity or 

2245
01:49:26,751 --> 01:49:27,360
something.
Jamie.

2246
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,540
Dot.
Yeah.

2247
01:49:28,541 --> 01:49:30,370
Someone needs to stop.
We can talk,

2248
01:49:30,371 --> 01:49:31,204
but then it's not exclusive.
You want to have the exclusive shirt 

2249
01:49:32,681 --> 01:49:36,310
when nobody else can get on line and not
into that man.

2250
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:37,660
All right,
Jeff.

2251
01:49:37,930 --> 01:49:41,710
Thank you very much.
The clarifying please folks,

2252
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:43,750
please have an open mind.
Please.

2253
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:44,643
I know you want to call it bullshit.
There's times there's times call 

2254
01:49:47,351 --> 01:49:48,430
bullshit,
but there's times

2255
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:53,430
to recognize that this is a complicated 
issue and that we've laid it out as I'm,

2256
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:56,470
I'm pretty convinced.
Appreciate it Joe.

2257
01:49:56,530 --> 01:49:59,500
And I'm dumb,
so you might be smarter than me.

2258
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:00,453
All.
Bye everybody.

2259
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:10,903
Yeah.
