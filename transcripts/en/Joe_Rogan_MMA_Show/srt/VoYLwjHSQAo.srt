1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,660
Four,
three,

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,100
two,
one.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,880
Robin Black Gentlemen.
What's up buddy?

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,110
Hey man,
it's great to see you.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,180
Are you fresh back from Singapore?
I am,

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,340
yeah.
I was in Singapore like 48 hours ago.

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,520
Did they make that special shiny silver 
one for you?

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,700
Because that looks like this design for 
you know,

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,790
it's,
I mean,

10
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:22,624
yeah,
it does Kinda look like it's designed 

11
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:24,870
for me,
which is why I wanted it,

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,410
you know,
it's a rock and roll.

13
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:30,200
One Championship afc championship.
So what's it like over there man?

14
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,083
So let me explain to everybody.
One FC is like the Asian version of the 

15
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:38,270
UFC is a gigantic organization that has 
been going on for how long now?

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,393
Two thousand 11.
So solid seven years and really high 

17
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:44,710
level fights over there.
Amazing,

18
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,500
amazing fight.
Singapore itself is wild.

19
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:51,010
So I went over there to chat with them.
So chapter three,

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,080
a city of tongue runs it and he and I 
had been chatting and I love kind of how

21
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:58,540
they see martial arts.

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,420
So they don't call it even fc anymore.
It's just one championship.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,840
They don't even use the word fighting.
Really it's martial arts.

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,883
And the way I see it and the way I 
studied martial arts and share it is an 

25
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:12,820
art form like painting or yoga or you 
know,

26
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,530
things,
things of that nature,

27
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:16,380
less spectacle.
That's always how I've seen it.

28
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,214
Oh,
is how I love it.

29
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,900
And that's how they see it and that's 
how they present it.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,033
And that's,
it's presented from this sort of 

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,830
inspirational own your history kind of 
way in Asia.

32
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,410
And that was what attracted me to them 
right away.

33
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,200
I mean it's,
it's definitely an art form.

34
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,034
It's values based,
like they're kind of seeking to inspire 

35
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:38,290
people through these athletes and 
artists.

36
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,124
It's pretty fucking cool.
Really what's motivating them to take 

37
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:43,174
this sort of radical approach.
So it's wild that you say that because 

38
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,980
to me this is the approach.

39
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,233
So I think what we do,
or the way that we presented in North 

40
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,800
America is radical.
I think martial arts is an art form.

41
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,350
Martial arts is this inspiring thing.
I mean,

42
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,820
you take,
say for example,

43
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,713
on loud song,
he is there 185 pound and 205 pound 

44
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,330
champion.
He's from me and Mar.

45
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,890
They have never had a world champion in 
any sport ever in their history.

46
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:17,080
I don'T think they've had a gold 
medalist in the olympics.

47
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:17,914
They've never had that.
This guy's a two division champion that 

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,873
will and when I talked to [inaudible] 
about it and he was talking sort of 

49
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:28,450
about why he sees it this way and why 
he's proud to present it this way.

50
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:31,480
He's like,
he knows without question that there are

51
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:32,314
kids and he won his 205 pound title in 
me and mark in a stadium in me and mark 

52
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,230
and he said he knows without question 
there's a kid in,

53
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:42,490
they're going to become a lawyer one day
because of that and they can feel it and

54
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:42,940
it's real.

55
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,773
It's not like.
It's not like a marketing strategy like 

56
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,490
this is how they see martial arts and 
it's how martial arts is viewed in asia.

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,593
Martial arts.
I get to travel so much now it's view 

58
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,093
different in Russia.
It's view different in Brazil also 

59
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,500
viewed in Russia.
Russia is wild,

60
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,900
man.
I've got to work for a acb,

61
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,010
you know,
acb,

62
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,890
some other organization,
big organizations.

63
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:06,724
So in Russia it's very masculine and 
it's about about victory and about 

64
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,290
showing your power and your strength and
it really.

65
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,820
And,
and Russia is like that,

66
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,460
you know,
it's a reflection kind of of Russia.

67
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,430
Yeah.
I'm the martial art thing.

68
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:24,970
I absolutely agree with you on that.
It is an art form,

69
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,920
but I also think it's a fight like 
gilbert melendez versus diego sanchez.

70
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,840
Yep.
That's an art form,

71
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,883
but it's a fight that was,
that was a fucking wild fight and 

72
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,940
there's no way.
That's just art.

73
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,810
That's an art and a fight.
It's both things.

74
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,720
Is that a fight is art.
It is in a way.

75
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,290
It's an expression of your personality,
your individuality.

76
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,890
It's heart,
your fearlessness.

77
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,210
A hundred percent,
but it's a fight.

78
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,950
I'm not scared of the word fight.
No,

79
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm not.

80
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,090
I like it.
I liked that word,

81
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,120
like it's.
But it is an art form.

82
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,530
Yes.
Fights are art.

83
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,371
Yes,
definitely.

84
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:07,070
I mean like anderson silva's second 
fight with shale son,

85
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,670
the way he landed that need of the body 
on the ground,

86
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:11,440
but that is just art.
That's art,

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,513
you know?
I mean if you go back to leo machida 

88
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,990
just landing that front kick on vitor 
belfort,

89
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,853
that's art is.
It's especially for someone who 

90
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,090
practices.
Yeah,

91
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,220
martial arts,
you see the beauty in that.

92
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,120
You're like,
ah,

93
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:28,980
it's like a flower blossoming or sunrise
or just something perfect.

94
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,950
The impossibility of it is what's so 
beautiful,

95
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:32,784
like these guys are so unwilling 
partners and they have such like a 

96
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,324
desire to accomplish what they want to 
accomplish to kick that guy in the face 

97
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,920
from that position with vito has a 
lifetime of this,

98
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,263
a lifetime of being able to not let you 
do that and for you to first be willing 

99
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,710
to be free enough to try it,
you know,

100
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:56,580
and,
and to,

101
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,760
to express it in that moment.
It is definitely hard,

102
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:00,630
but I,
I'm with you.

103
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:03,560
Fight doesn't intimidate me at all.
It,

104
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,610
you know,
a fight is a beautiful thing.

105
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,370
A fight is we fight for things all the 
time.

106
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:10,470
You know,
it's a metaphor for life itself.

107
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:11,490
When they fight,
I think

108
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,583
people rightly so are concerned with the
idea of violence against someone who's 

109
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,960
an unwilling participant and that's how 
they think of fighting.

110
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:26,080
They think of it as this thing that they
want nothing to do with.

111
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,730
They don't want any violence in their 
life.

112
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,550
They don't want anybody to hurt them and
I completely understand that.

113
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,360
I understand that position,
but that's not what it is.

114
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:35,194
When it's a competition.
I mean it's a tired expression because 

115
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:41,740
I've said it too many times,
but my perception of what fighting is is

116
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,450
high level problem solving with dire 
physical consequences

117
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,560
time and then the physical consequences 
are what make it so special.

118
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,100
Yes,
no question.

119
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,203
No question.
Yeah,

120
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,800
[inaudible].
Make the gOod times better.

121
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,113
The the possibility that bad things can 
happen to you and do sometimes happen 

122
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,314
even to the great ones.
You see great fighters had been kod and 

123
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,470
come back and you know,
there's,

124
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,533
that's,
there's something about that where you 

125
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,660
realize like,
hey,

126
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:14,270
even fade or can get knocked out.
You know whaT I mean?

127
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,173
hey,
even anderson silva can play cocky and 

128
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:20,210
get caught by that.
Chris weidman left hook.

129
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,130
I mean this is just,
this is just the game

130
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,910
and you know,
I think in asia in particular,

131
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:26,744
but there's different pockets of of how 
these this is viewed and how the 

132
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:31,004
philosophy of of connecting to martial 
arts and fighting is viewed and in asia 

133
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,740
you would see a certain amount of the 
fighters would see being losing badly is

134
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,793
an opportunity,
a chance because to come back and win 

135
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:49,190
again or to come back and show that 
you're able,

136
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,223
you,
you were given the gift of trying and 

137
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:53,780
failing.
You know whaT I mean?

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
Do know what you mean?
Yeah.

139
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,990
That's a great way to approach it.
It's a great way to look at it.

140
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,101
You know,
I mean that,

141
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:04,101
that there really is a lesson that the 
average person can take in their life.

142
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:08,820
Like every time a person does have a bad
thing happened to them.

143
00:07:08,821 --> 00:07:12,270
It's that terrible feelings and 
opportunity to rise from the ashes.

144
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,780
Yeah.
And winning when it's,

145
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,093
when you're winning at everything and 
things come easily to you that I'm sure 

146
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,910
if it still feels good,
but when you've gone through really hard

147
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,180
times when you've been challenged by 
something or do you drop lower,

148
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,170
the high of the success is so much 
higher at so much of a longer journey.

149
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,273
Personally,
when we've spoke before and when we 

150
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:35,544
talked about a cm punk,
when he was fighting the first time I 

151
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:39,200
was like,
this is stupid,

152
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,770
you know,
and this guy is,

153
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,663
is pushing,
stacking himself into a position to try 

154
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:48,000
to not fail by making the challenge so 
difficult that even if he fails,

155
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,240
he don't really.
But this is fully different now.

156
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,333
Like now I'm,
I'm cheering for him because he was 

157
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,950
humiliated like he was.
He didn't just fail.

158
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,840
He was humiliated.
He,

159
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,780
he in front of everybody was shown to 
be.

160
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,913
People would judge them as weak or 
people the judgment that he would feel 

161
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,340
hIs bad and he sat.
I'll go do it again.

162
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,413
He,
we are now in a completely different 

163
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:15,444
context because that's a guy who 
epically failed in front of everybody 

164
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,493
and then dealt with that and now says,
I will try the journey again and this 

165
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:27,030
will make me a better person and I now I
fully endorse this.

166
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:27,864
I'm cheering for him.

167
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,853
Well,
he's now fighting a fighter who's 

168
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,703
commensurate in talent and there's 
nothing wrong with being a beginner in 

169
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:34,914
martial arts,
but there's something wrong with 

170
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,820
thinking that you can be a beginner in 
fight.

171
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:43,821
Mickey go big time.
So it was a foolish venture and I wet my

172
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:45,384
approach to it was this is going to be a
very good lesson for people that are 

173
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,090
fans of positive thinking and they think
that's enough.

174
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,100
That shit is not enough.
If you weigh 110 pounds,

175
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,650
you get positive.
Think your way to the bank.

176
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,470
For instance in Ghana,
still gonna punch your brains out.

177
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,333
There's just no way around it.
And a guy who has really very little 

178
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:11,100
experience in martial arts and has 
rudimentary control of his body.

179
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,100
I mean,
that's what I saw when I saw,

180
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,200
when I saw him training and was like,
oh my god,

181
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,790
he's killed.
He's not blind in that context and I,

182
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,200
but he belongs here and that's 
everything's contextual.

183
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,660
Like,
just because I thought that was stupid.

184
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,790
It was stupid.
It was stupid.

185
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,550
But that doesn't mean in this context I 
can't look and go.

186
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,870
There's a guy who didn't need it.
He doesn't need to come back.

187
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:37,704
He doesn't need to try again.
He doesn't need to go into the gym and 

188
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:39,954
I've been there.
You're in the jam and everyone's going 

189
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:41,911
on,
man,

190
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:42,270
you did.

191
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,870
You did good.
I didn't do guy fucking failed miserably

192
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:48,690
in front of everybody.
And then show up there cleaning the mats

193
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,850
and work really hard and said I'm going 
to try it again.

194
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,410
Uh,
and yes,

195
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,130
that fight still him and this guy still 
should take place somewhere else.

196
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
One hundred percent.
I mean,

197
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,850
it shouldn't even be on the tuesday 
night contender show.

198
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,571
No,
no.

199
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:01,404
It shouldn't.
Should be in some amateur event 

200
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:05,310
somewhere.
That's really what they are.

201
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,130
They're,
they're guys learning how to compete.

202
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,100
Yeah.
Um,

203
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,100
during the first fight in the paper 
view,

204
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,760
yeah,
that's fucking crazy,

205
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:16,020
but that has nothing to do with them.
That is a reflection on the company.

206
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:19,740
That's one of the choices that the 
machine makes.

207
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,863
Um,
and then we also gave him a juicy 

208
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,010
contract.
Yes,

209
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,420
in order to make that valid or viable to
make money off it.

210
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,490
But that again,
I think it makes it,

211
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:36,780
makes it deeper and harder and more 
chances to fail epically and,

212
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,520
and I lost twice in a row and then still
want it to fight again and still because

213
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:42,900
it,
I really want it to.

214
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,913
And,
and it was important to me and it meant 

215
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:45,984
something to me and I was going to 
change as a human being by doing it and 

216
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:51,660
I was ridiculed.
I can relate to what he's going through.

217
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,510
But I,
they ended on a little show in,

218
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,990
in winnipeg,
manitoba.

219
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,973
We know what I mean.
I would never have put myself in that 

220
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,023
place to look bad.
But here he is and here it is and I'm 

221
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:03,684
cheering for him as a store,
as a human being in a weird situation 

222
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,390
that has been put himself into a deep,
dark,

223
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,050
hard spot and saying,
my way out of this is to try really hard

224
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:16,884
and really go in and and the chance all 
of that I would want for him if I knew 

225
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:25,290
him and he was my friend is to fight 
your way through some adverse situations

226
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,260
to be able to be in it and find when 
it's hard,

227
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,930
you discover I can handle the.
When it's hard,

228
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,240
I can,
I can get up when I've been dropped or I

229
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:35,130
can fight through not being able to 
breathe.

230
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,160
If he loses and does that,
it will have been worth it for him.

231
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:41,250
No matter how much ridicule he'll take,
it will have been worth it for him.

232
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,373
What was really weird watching them walk
to the cage was that he was approaching 

233
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:45,984
it liga pro wrestling fight because he 
had done so many of these pro wrestling 

234
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:52,230
matches that he was walking to the cage 
with like pro wrestling,

235
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,160
mannerisms,
everything and

236
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,490
all.
I was watching this and I,

237
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,660
you know,
I did like an internal head shake,

238
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,840
like fuck,
like this,

239
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,540
you can't.
It was a terrible idea.

240
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,890
Like whoever on everybody's side said 
that he could fight micky gall,

241
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:09,724
you're out of your fucking mind.
Watch that kid fight once a kid is very 

242
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,204
good on the ground,
very good at big and strong young 

243
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,200
standups.
Not bad either,

244
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,360
you know,
and he's tough as shit and he's smart,

245
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
he's clever and he's mean.
He's mean fucker.

246
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,560
And that is at that stage he was maybe 
one to know,

247
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:27,730
I think uh,
maybe two,

248
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,683
but it's still the lowest level that 
there is in the entire elite world of 

249
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,470
fighting.
Not that it didn't matter the way.

250
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,220
One,
like you saw it,

251
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,350
you saw the wait took that guy's back 
and the way sinks hooks in when,

252
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,080
when he was on top and just delivered 
that type.

253
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,360
Yeah.
That's.

254
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,580
And you're a hundred percent right.
What if somebody is watching that?

255
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,830
That is the reality of thinking.
I won't really worry.

256
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll put myself in a situation that I 
can't win,

257
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,850
but I've got guts and heart and I 
believe I'm going to do it.

258
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,120
You get the metaphorical version of that
punch in the face.

259
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,950
If you go through life like that,
yes you do,

260
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,873
and you know what?
You shouldn't do it in fighting because 

261
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:07,210
you don't want those punches in the 
face.

262
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,460
If you can avoid them,
like if,

263
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,930
if you're in a situation where you're,
you want to prove your toughness and you

264
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:14,764
want to be battled against someone who's
of your skill level and try to figure 

265
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:20,740
your way through the maze of this 
contest.

266
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,813
That makes sense.
What doesn't make sense is getting 

267
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,980
punched in the face unnecessarily and 
when you fight,

268
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
in my opinion,
when I looked at that fight,

269
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,330
I was like,
micky gall is gonna smash him.

270
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,570
This is just how it's going to go.
There's very few fights where I can tell

271
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:35,970
you,
this is absolutely gonna happen.

272
00:13:35,971 --> 00:13:37,270
Like,
here's a perfect example,

273
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,790
rob hoffeld dose on joe's,
uh,

274
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,663
against a colby covington.
I don't know what the fuck's gonna 

275
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,031
happen.
No idea.

276
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:43,780
I don't know.
No,

277
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,670
we're going to get in there.
They're gonna.

278
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,670
Throw down.
Let's see.

279
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,130
Let's see.
Micky gall versus,

280
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,650
you know.
Um,

281
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,000
so I forgot to cm punk.
What's his real name?

282
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:54,340
Phil jackson.
No,

283
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,180
hardman fucking fill.
Whatever.

284
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,690
Yeah.
Cm punk.

285
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,583
Yeah.
What is it?

286
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,550
Jamie brooks.
Brooks brooks.

287
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,290
Phil brooks.
Sorry phil.

288
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,540
I was like,
well he's.

289
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,940
This is a terrible idea because he's 
just going to get pr.

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,833
You can only get punched in the face so 
many times in your life and you have a 

291
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,350
number.
Whatever the number is,

292
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,184
everybody's different.
Mark hunt's number seems to be 

293
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:17,560
extraordinarily high.

294
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,490
There's some people that could just take
it and this is true,

295
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,533
but you know,
you don't want it when you can avoid it 

296
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,863
and he could.
He's not going to avoid it in that 

297
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:27,484
fight.
I'm just going to get smashed and less 

298
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,663
make it caught a crazy arm bar early in 
the fight and that was what he gave him 

299
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,000
the.
Yeah.

300
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,280
Other than that,
he's getting his face smashed in and you

301
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,440
should not do that if you don't have to 
lead that.

302
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,643
As I remember when we spoke about it,
it's unconscious incompetence and that 

303
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,973
if you don't know what you don't know,
like it's a really fucking weird place 

304
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:51,990
to be and we go through life that a lot 
of times

305
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,710
in a lot of different contexts until you
find out,

306
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,410
you know,
conscious incompetence where like,

307
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,510
oh fuck,
I don't know anything about this.

308
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,373
He wasn't even at that point.
Now he's at that point and he has a 

309
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:03,890
lower level thing.
So,

310
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,630
and you know,
he didn't,

311
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,820
it was a mistake to start down this 
road.

312
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,280
But you're down at now.
You're on it now.

313
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,760
So I guess,
you know,

314
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,910
it seems to me that,
I mean he's taken what,

315
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:16,744
two years since I've been about two 
years getting there and we've 

316
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,663
subsequently got to see micky gall and 
some contests against some really tough 

317
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:27,180
guys and yeah.
Yeah,

318
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,380
beat some good guys.
And we got to see like,

319
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:31,060
okay,
this kid is fucking for real,

320
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:36,040
which is what we suspected all along,
but we don't know anything about phil.

321
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,390
We haven't seen him spar,
we haven't seen retrained.

322
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:43,030
But from what I saw when I first saw him
training the first,

323
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,310
you know,
when I first saw him sparring and moving

324
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,144
around,
I was like,

325
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,220
got damaged a lot of work to be done,
like,

326
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:49,054
you know,
like first steps of everest work to be 

327
00:15:50,891 --> 00:15:51,820
done.
It's like,

328
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,720
this is,
um,

329
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,340
we're not talking about a guy who has a 
deep background in martial arts.

330
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,293
Like brock lesnar,
no wrestling is absolutely a martial 

331
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:01,204
art.
He was a legit top of the food chain 

332
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:06,130
amateur wrestler.
He was a fucking monster

333
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,220
and a physical monster.
I mean that.

334
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,640
And a psychological monster like 
fighting his skills for sure.

335
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:17,641
But it's your body and the mind and when
you are a heavy competitor,

336
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:18,814
when you focus,
when you're able to focus in the 

337
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:23,980
deepest,
most fearful conditions,

338
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,890
a brock lesnar did that,
you know,

339
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,600
and uh,
physically when you're aware,

340
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,434
like you said,
we're aware of where your body is in 

341
00:16:30,731 --> 00:16:33,790
space and how to control.
And that can take a lifetime.

342
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,430
And uh,
so it's a weird one,

343
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:36,860
but I think,
yeah,

344
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,950
something you also develop as a child,
as a young kid.

345
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,130
Like when you're in your developmental 
years,

346
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,150
13,
14,

347
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:44,984
15,
you're body's growing and it's growing 

348
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:50,450
into whipping kicks and punches and 
shooting takedowns and landing chokes.

349
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,403
Your body develops that way.
When you're a full grown man in your 

350
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:55,604
thirties and then you're starting to 
throw roundhouse kicks and front kicks 

351
00:16:58,221 --> 00:16:58,530
in.
You're,

352
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,070
your body's all goofy and shit and 
doesn't,

353
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,510
doesn't want to listen.
Right?

354
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:04,820
It's not pliable.
It's not elastic.

355
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,040
It says that you're a different animal.

356
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,790
You can still learn anything.
You at 50 years old,

357
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,420
you can take up anything in the world.
You can take anything and you should.

358
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,530
Yeah,
you shouldn't be shitting,

359
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,190
you know,
go into the nfl where they.

360
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,640
Or if you start to play a piano when 
you're 50,

361
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,890
you should learn to play piano and show 
all your friends,

362
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,880
you know,
the song or.

363
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,950
But you can't go like,
you know,

364
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,933
be in a concert,
piano scenario where you're going to 

365
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:31,020
fail and,
and doing it and saying,

366
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:34,560
you know,
I believe doesn't make a difference when

367
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:37,740
he doesn't physically or mentally or 
psychologically do these things.

368
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:38,574
But I still think learning and growing 
and chasing things and self improvement 

369
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:43,620
is the root of who we are.

370
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,760
I agree.
Yeah.

371
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:48,180
I think it is too.
But you can't be a 34 year old man who's

372
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:50,190
never box a day your life and have a 
goal

373
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,510
to in 12 months,
fight loma chanko no.

374
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,450
It's never going to happen.
If it does happen,

375
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,284
it's gonna be a disaster and that there 
are giant exceptions like one in a 

376
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:05,250
million of things where people do 
things,

377
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,830
but there's always some other 
explanation.

378
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:08,664
And often it is as a youth,
they created the neuro pathways in the 

379
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:14,580
physicality and the connection to their 
body.

380
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,210
You know,
I was uh,

381
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,780
I did gymnastics when I was a kid and I 
love it.

382
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,880
It's great big.
Yeah.

383
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,730
I loved it.
And,

384
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,570
and,
and you know,

385
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,010
it helps you physically understand where
your body is.

386
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,233
And so later on in life,
I was always at least okay at sports 

387
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,223
because I understood how to move my body
in space and I understood where my hand 

388
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,670
was compared to my foot and how I 
balanced.

389
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,573
And to learn that as a child,
somebody who was a master of something 

390
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:42,510
as a kid who had 30 picks up.

391
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,343
Another thing,
it has some really advanced learning 

392
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:45,774
abilities.
There are exceptions that we see rare 

393
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:49,110
exceptions,
but,

394
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,930
but you're right,
I mean reality still reality.

395
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,480
I wonder too,
if those exceptions are genetic,

396
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,860
I wonder if like maybe perhaps someone 
in their family.

397
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:59,610
It was a great athlete and it's 
transferred through their genes,

398
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,940
which I am as I get older,
a firm believer in,

399
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,013
um,
I just don't think we know enough about 

400
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,750
what transfers through genes.
But there's some freaky shit I see in my

401
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:12,540
kids in particular where I go,
okay,

402
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,350
that is my fucking personality.
That's something.

403
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,393
And I'm not teaching her to do this.
This is something that's in her like 

404
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:23,430
this.
The repetitive like exercise,

405
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,970
like doing things over and over again.
Obsessive lee,

406
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,113
like there's some weird shit that like,
am I wonder if that's a neuropathway 

407
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,000
that's passed down through the dna.

408
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,143
I mean,
it just seems like there could be a 

409
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,224
person who's never engaged in athletics,
but maybe their grandfather was like a 

410
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,554
world champion boxer.
And then one day they put on the gloves 

411
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,560
and then they just sorta like start 
moving around and the coach was like,

412
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,480
hey,
what the fuck's going on here?

413
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:50,070
Where did you learn?
Or three job like that.

414
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,320
I'm forgetting.
Francis and ghana's coach's name,

415
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,360
I forget his name is fernando lopez.
Yes.

416
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,240
He's a wonderful guy,
a smart guy.

417
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,473
Really?
He's been around like the best of the 

418
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:07,650
best through europe.
So in Cameroon to France and these areas

419
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:08,484
and he's seen the best of the best that 
that genetic crop of humans has to 

420
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:12,774
offer.
And then francis and got it walks into 

421
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,264
his gym and you've talked to yo next 
time you see fernand to ask him about 

422
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:21,054
this because you see his eyes light up 
like that thing where this like a color 

423
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:24,654
in the eye.
And he's like,

424
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,980
you know,
I just knew,

425
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:29,370
like he said,
I watched him do things in his awareness

426
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:31,980
of his body and how he could physically 
express himself.

427
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,750
He said he'd just never seen anything 
like it.

428
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:34,860
And this is,
you know,

429
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:36,360
week one in the gym.
He said,

430
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,180
first sparring session,
he didn't really know how to fight yet,

431
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,253
but he said he saw him adapting and 
learning within the round against 

432
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:45,990
somebody who knew how to fight and you 
see it in his eyes.

433
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,100
He.
He literally found fucking unicorn

434
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,120
that just strolled in off the street and
came in and then he was like,

435
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,890
man,
if he's had some work ethic,

436
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,240
if he is,
you know,

437
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,370
if,
if he's passionate about this,

438
00:20:57,371 --> 00:21:00,430
if he can commit and learn and all that,
it goes physically,

439
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,770
genetically speaking,
this human being,

440
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:06,160
the length of his bones,
the speed of his neurology,

441
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:06,994
all of these things.
He said you just knew and you see it in 

442
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:10,564
his face.
You're like,

443
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,250
oh fuck.
That must have been wild.

444
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,383
It must have been wild to,
to experience that when you have a 

445
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:17,830
lifetime of seeing.

446
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,043
Yeah.
It's like that scene in the color of 

447
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:22,174
money.
I don't know if you ever saw that movie 

448
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,680
was with paul move Paul Newman and tom 
cruise.

449
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,710
When Paul Newman,
here's tom cruise,

450
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,890
break the balls for the first time.
It turns a rose.

451
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:35,410
What the fuck is going on over here?
And he looks over and he sees his kid.

452
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,573
There's,
there's certain people that just have 

453
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:38,764
this crazy talent and when someone has 
been around for a long time as a coach 

454
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:43,294
and had a bunch of untalented or 
reasonably talented are very talented 

455
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:47,891
people.
This,

456
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:48,724
this big stew of humans come into the 
gym and you see that one unicorn that 

457
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:55,600
steps in and he's also a case where his 
father,

458
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,643
I mean he doesn't have a backer,
he didn't have a background in martial 

459
00:21:58,241 --> 00:21:59,074
arts before you started training,
but his father was a great street 

460
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:06,301
fighter and it's entirely possible that 
something was carried on through him or

461
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,763
something was present in both.
That allowed them both to be capable of 

462
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:11,584
doing that rather than the learn to pass
because we don't know how that passes 

463
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,413
genetically from behavior.
We know that genetically we may behave 

464
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:22,030
similar to our parents,
our kids.

465
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,090
We don't know if that came from that.
But,

466
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:26,410
uh,
I,

467
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,453
I just,
I'm the oldest weirdly uncomfortable 

468
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,653
thinking about genetics because I don't 
like the idea that we're limited by 

469
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:39,100
them.
And I know that we're not on some level,

470
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,420
but we are,
we are,

471
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,820
but we're not going to play basketball.
He,

472
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,190
yes,
since lebron james.

473
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,750
But if we identified.
No,

474
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,920
no,
we're not where we do,

475
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,700
it's not going to go well.
Okay.

476
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:51,643
No,
there's some,

477
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,720
there's definitely some truths.
I mean I'm five foot six on a tall day.

478
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,060
Like that is a genetic limitation that 
is undeniable.

479
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,273
Right?
But if we're looking at things and we 

480
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:05,974
decide that our genes,
if you've seen the movie gattica I've 

481
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,050
ever seen them and I did see them moving
a long time ago.

482
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,220
That's one of my favorite movies ever.
Matt.

483
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,590
So ethan hawke,
ethan hawke.

484
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,730
Yeah.
I always think of him as uma thurman.

485
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,380
Yeah,
she's in it.

486
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,650
But I know,
but I think of him because he used to be

487
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:24,490
married to her.
I'm like,

488
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:25,324
oh,
that's houma thurman thurman in that 

489
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:31,384
movie,
his brother is genetically superior to 

490
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:35,650
him,
but he beats his brother in the swimming

491
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:37,870
contests all the time.
And at the end his brothers like,

492
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:39,670
how are you doing this?
And he said,

493
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:41,710
I never saved anything for the swim 
back.

494
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,240
I was just going to swim to the other 
side,

495
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:44,980
and his brothers like there is no 
fucking other side,

496
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,700
but it was.
I know it's a movie,

497
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,050
but it was a mindset,
right,

498
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,260
and the truth is that like talent.
Okay,

499
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:54,050
so you're talented at certain things.
Jamie's talents,

500
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:55,370
a certain things.
Francis and Ghana,

501
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,773
talented talent multiplied by effort 
equals skill and skill multiplied by 

502
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:08,060
effort equals accomplishment.
So effort counts twice,

503
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,190
right?
Effort counts fucking twice,

504
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,063
but then you get effort with a talented 
guy with freak genetics like a lebron 

505
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:17,700
james or a Michael Jordan or brock 
lesnar,

506
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,450
and then you get some crazy

507
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,360
results.
Yes.

508
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,253
Oh,
big time.

509
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:26,260
And the guy who doesn't have the the 
talent but had effort twice.

510
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:31,460
Effort was applied twice.
We'll go as far as the man or woman will

511
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:32,294
go as far as they possibly could to 
actualize their true potential by 

512
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,250
committing themselves to,
to effort and not going well.

513
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,390
I can't do it.
So forget it.

514
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,030
By applying effort over and over and 
over again.

515
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,043
And then once you've developed talent,
more effort to take that talent and do 

516
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,194
something that twice used effort,
we'll get you as far as you possibly 

517
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:52,760
can.
If you say,

518
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:53,990
well,
I'm not gifted,

519
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:56,300
I'm not talented so I won't put any 
effort.

520
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:57,134
You have no idea how far you can go.
So I absolutely cannot beat francis and 

521
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,890
new,
but by not thinking that I'm too limited

522
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:06,320
by my jeans and continuing to apply 
effort,

523
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,154
regardless of my jeans,
I can get to the best possible place I 

524
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:11,900
can as an individual.
Do you know what I mean?

525
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,853
So I think that that on some you don't 
want to go down some road that you 

526
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,373
cannot be accomplished,
but you also don't want to not go down 

527
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,570
roads because you're not genetically 
predisposed to them.

528
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:24,800
I think effort can get you somewhere.

529
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,943
It definitely can get you somewhere.
But I think what we're talking about 

530
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:30,150
here is what I love about life is that 
it's messy.

531
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,560
Yeah.
That there's not,

532
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:35,130
it's not one plus one is two zeros and 
ones.

533
00:25:35,131 --> 00:25:38,610
It's just there's a bunch of factors.
Does a lot of shit going on man.

534
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,430
And that's why when something magical 
takes place,

535
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,530
when you get a,
you know,

536
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,210
uh,
george st pierre,

537
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,340
or when you,
you get a mighty mouse,

538
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:49,140
when you get someone who's like,
whoa,

539
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,430
look at that,
like this,

540
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:54,990
there's so many factors that lead you to
be gennady golovkin.

541
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,350
Now there's so many different things 
have to fall into place.

542
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,590
Or here's a guy,
like,

543
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,523
how about michael bisping?
Michael bisping is just one of the 

544
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:08,720
toughest motherfuckers ever example.
Yeah.

545
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,623
But you found the perfect.
Michael bisbing is one of the toughest 

546
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,560
motherfuckers ever.
He's not extraordinarily talented in any

547
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:20,100
one form of mma.
He's not like the fastest guy.

548
00:26:20,101 --> 00:26:23,580
He's not the strongest guy.
He doesn't have this great background in

549
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,670
brazilian jujitsu where he's just a 
worldclass strangler.

550
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:28,320
And if he gets your back,
you're fucked.

551
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,830
There's none of those things.
He's just tough as fuck.

552
00:26:31,831 --> 00:26:34,410
And he's one of the most mentally strong
guys.

553
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,810
Like even tim kennedy who was here the 
other day,

554
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,010
tim kennedy's like,
god,

555
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:40,290
I hate to give them a compliment,
but he's so fucking tough.

556
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,940
Can't.
You can't deny them.

557
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,160
You

558
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,000
can't.
So,

559
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,940
and,
and that goes right back to this,

560
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:48,120
and I think this is at the root of 
questions about life,

561
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,903
was michael bisbing genetically tough?
Is he genetically mentally tough or did 

562
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,323
work really hard and just push himself 
through things and that one day when it 

563
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:59,280
got really fucking tough,
he didn't give up,

564
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,110
which taught him that he shouldn't give 
up,

565
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:04,210
which taught him to go even further,
which made him push himself like,

566
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,750
or was it in all likelihood?
It's both.

567
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,960
But michael bisping free of that effort 
to continue to because what's his name?

568
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,400
Think of the mentally toughest guy that 
I'm just,

569
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,440
I have a thing with names sometimes.
Even names I know I'll describe.

570
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,830
You guys got a chain and he's howling 
and he does power slam,

571
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:25,170
but I can't think of ramp.
I can't think of rampage,

572
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,780
but I'm a big elbows.

573
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,510
You've had.
I'm probably on the podcast,

574
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,870
a tough hairy chest.
Um,

575
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,073
uh,
who am I thinking of 170 pounds fought 

576
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:39,080
demian maia.
I'm matt brown.

577
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,943
Matt brown.
Oh,

578
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,163
south.
Yeah.

579
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,280
But that's exactly what I can literally 
literally say all these things,

580
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:48,660
but the name will escape me.
It's a strange thing.

581
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,890
Happens to me too.
I will.

582
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,500
I worked with john.
We're early in the morning,

583
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,613
right?
I worked with john ramm dean for years 

584
00:27:57,691 --> 00:28:00,600
is one of my best friends and he would 
literally just see it in my eyes,

585
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,280
just like I won't have the name and I'll
throw out one or two of those factoids.

586
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,810
And you always had it.
It'd be like matt brown.

587
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,800
So that's why having good friends to 
work with is great.

588
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,140
Will know your.
Yeah.

589
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,990
But talking to him about brandon on the 
phone,

590
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,430
I,
I'm doing an interview with them.

591
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:16,530
I said,
you're one of the mentally toughest guys

592
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:17,410
there is.
And he said that,

593
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,110
I don't think I am.
He said,

594
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,243
if I think I'm mentally tough for one 
moment I will not do all of the things 

595
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:26,910
necessary to walk in mentally tough.
He said,

596
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,880
he's like,
man,

597
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,763
I am not mentally tough.
The mental toughness is a result of all 

598
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:32,844
of the hard work and preparation that I 
have done to be able to do it in that 

599
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:38,400
moment.
And you heard it in his voice.

600
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:42,090
He had no doubt that this was so and I 
think he's right.

601
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,530
He's right.
He's right.

602
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,523
I think he's ready to,
but he's also mentally tough because he 

603
00:28:46,371 --> 00:28:47,204
also does those things,
but one of the things that about matt 

604
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:53,480
brown that separates him is that empties
out in the cage.

605
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,670
He separates himself from the pack 
because he.

606
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,350
He's so ferocious like that guys for 
roche's.

607
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,180
Remember when,
when he stepped into the cage,

608
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:04,280
we were watching.
I think we're doing a fight companion,

609
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:08,180
but we're maybe we were wearing anyway 
when,

610
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:11,720
when he stepped into the cage and fought
diego sanchez,

611
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,873
when,
when he stepped into the octagon and 

612
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,630
screamed and roared,
it was literally like an animal.

613
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,703
I mean it was,
it was for veracity defined and that's 

614
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,030
just how we fight,
man.

615
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:26,480
That guy just empties out like whatever 
the fuck he's got.

616
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:27,920
He's not holding anything back,
man.

617
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:29,090
He,
he goes for it.

618
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,240
And that's why I think when we were 
talking about fight and art,

619
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,420
to me that's an art of human expression.
Like I think that is to be a capable.

620
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:43,030
I mean whether you're you're doing jazz 
or punk rock,

621
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,893
it's human expression.
Whether your matt brown or your some 

622
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:49,660
elegant mover,
it's still the same art at its root.

623
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,560
But you remember that elbow,
he fired on diego sanchez fight.

624
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,560
It was there.
And there are these moments.

625
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,394
Are there a lot when you're analyzing,
fighting and looking at it from that 

626
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,180
other perspective,
these fight ending moments are there.

627
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,400
They're there are way more often than 
these guys realize.

628
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,430
But when they spot them like matt did in
that moment,

629
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,280
this is.
I have a free shot from an angle.

630
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,350
Time has slowed down enough that I see 
it.

631
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,770
I can see the little red arc of where 
it's going and I'm going to put this,

632
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,550
I'm going to end this fight it.
There's a visceral like,

633
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,190
like it's.
Here it is.

634
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:28,620
When people look at you see it,
see just like that.

635
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,340
That is fucking art to me.
But watch the lefthand,

636
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,680
the reach and the hold and it's like 
there is no doubt what,

637
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,980
what's happening here.
There is no doubt

638
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,023
going to happen.
Go cinches is another curious example 

639
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:45,010
because he's also a guy who is 
ferocious,

640
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,073
like a ferociously tough guy,
but there's always been something about 

641
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:55,210
his movements that makes him come up 
short against the best of the best.

642
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,470
And I mean you're talking about a guy 
who's so fucking mentally tough as well.

643
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:00,304
Like I always bring his fight against 
jake ellenberger who is a brutal 

644
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,220
knockout artists at one 70 and diego 
really.

645
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:08,230
I mean diego fought at 1:45,
remember?

646
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,270
And diego really is a tweener.
He's a little too small for 55.

647
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,430
I don't know how the fuck he made it to 
1:45.

648
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:20,431
He basically starved as body away and 
probably did some irreversible damage.

649
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,950
But he feels like his movements are 
always just shy of elite.

650
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,230
And I've always wondered what is that 
like?

651
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,320
It's almost like even if you see that,
go back to that clip again,

652
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,660
but you don't have to.
It's okay.

653
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,330
But there's something about even the way
he steps in,

654
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,340
he's not stepping the way a tj dillashaw
steps,

655
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,820
you know what I'm saying?
He's so,

656
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,410
I,
I see it as his sort of intention.

657
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:51,850
It's his over into god that is so nasty,
nasty and so perfect.

658
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,670
But I see he wants it badly.
Like he is.

659
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,653
He's over engaged.
I think it's psychological as much as 

660
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:00,940
anything I would say in,
in albuquerque.

661
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,090
Look at that.
The placement of the lefthand there.

662
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,260
There's just no doubt where this is 
going.

663
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,303
It's perfect.
It's.

664
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,160
And it is the moment that matt brown 
created,

665
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:14,100
like he created that moment,
see hairy chest until jerry.

666
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,890
That's fun.
That's one of my reminder cues,

667
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:18,750
right?
Uh,

668
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,140
but,
uh,

669
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,370
I think so I watched diego train in 
albuquerque and I love that guy.

670
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:29,730
I was there doing interviewing cub who 
is my favorite artists probably to watch

671
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:31,054
for many reasons.
I'm not really sure exactly why people 

672
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,590
can't tell you why their favorite band 
is their favorite band.

673
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:37,630
But I can tell there aren't many things 
that you can describe,

674
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,580
but I was there to interview him for 
monster zim.

675
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,670
It's a website in South Korea that when 
I became a freelancer,

676
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,790
they were like,
we'd like to give you some work.

677
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,191
I'm like,
well,

678
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:50,870
that'd be amazing.
We'd like you to go.

679
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,370
He just fought.
Do whoa choice.

680
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,200
We'd like you to go interview mr.
Cub swanson.

681
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:55,250
I'm like,
this is bad ass.

682
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:57,350
It's like my favorite fighter.
I'm going to send me to albuquerque,

683
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,203
and then I hung out in the gym and 
analyze them and watched and made notes 

684
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:01,574
about what I could and diego and super 
intense and he does everything super 

685
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:06,814
intense and and as much as he loves yoga
and the different types of yoga and 

686
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:12,650
meditation has allowed him to do it 
differently.

687
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:17,910
That hyper intensity I think doesn't 
allow the sort of soft relaxation that's

688
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:20,870
necessary to really do what you're 
describing.

689
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,093
You know,

690
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,083
I know what you're saying.
Like the one of the things that people 

691
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:25,124
don't understand about striking hard and
having real power is that you're not 

692
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,040
fully tense through the entire movement.
There's a lot of parts of striking where

693
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:38,120
the momentum starts and you're almost 
like completely loose.

694
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,133
Like up until instance,
before the point of contact and then 

695
00:33:43,011 --> 00:33:44,720
it's,
there's this,

696
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,900
there's this weird thing that real 
knockout artists have that you don't see

697
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:55,211
in these fucking tense windmill guys.
Windmill guys are too tight.

698
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,353
Totally.
But a guy like ray robinson will throw 

699
00:33:58,221 --> 00:33:59,510
up,
like there's a,

700
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:03,950
there was a gene fullmer ray robinson 
kao clip from the other night.

701
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,450
Uh,
I was,

702
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,283
I was watching online.
I must have watched like 13 times in a 

703
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:09,260
row.
But you watch them land this thing.

704
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:11,960
It was a left hook,
but you watched the punchline.

705
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:14,570
He liked jesus,
like this nap that,

706
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:17,510
that guy had.
But that snap is not,

707
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,660
it's not,
it's not fully tents.

708
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,980
Here it is right here.
Like,

709
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:24,840
look how soft it is.
Simple.

710
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,300
Yeah.
Soft.

711
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,670
But look at that lead,
that left hook right there.

712
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,560
That one's softens them up,
ties him up.

713
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,260
But everything is like,
yeah,

714
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,300
swimming.
Yeah.

715
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:38,660
I mean it's just,
he was an amazing boxer dude.

716
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,470
And you're talking about a guy who had 
like 100 and something fights,

717
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,300
right?
It's almost gentle,

718
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:46,070
right?
Like he's soft is the right word.

719
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,310
Suppleness there.
So

720
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,650
there's a calmness,
there's a relaxation and mentally too,

721
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:54,120
like you know,
that idea of there's a storm going on in

722
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,600
the middle of this,
this calm area,

723
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,930
that gentleness,
that,

724
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,550
that calmness has to be in your mind to 
allow you to do this.

725
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,260
And that's where diego is,

726
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,290
that man.
Just look at that,

727
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,020
that's fucking incredible.
And that left hook right here,

728
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:09,854
here it is pink yet.
And even just to create that moment and 

729
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:14,970
to see that moment,
you know,

730
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:20,030
and to set it up and lay traps and see 
when the guys moving his hands down,

731
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,983
see when he's coming forward,
see his patterns and 10 they can do 

732
00:35:23,151 --> 00:35:23,984
those things.
Yup,

733
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:24,980
yup,
yup.

734
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,780
But it's that kind of power in that left
hook that does not come from.

735
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,800
That's just this little twists that he 
does like come on,

736
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:38,010
but here

737
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,020
it is right here in slow mo.
Bang.

738
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,050
And it's just hip.
And so I did.

739
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm sure you saw it or I think you saw 
it.

740
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:48,120
I did a little breakdown of your kicks.
I did see that.

741
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,890
And it's just,
that's what I was.

742
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,310
So zooming in on was this double 
paulson.

743
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,153
That's real,
that's.

744
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,030
That is the neurology of high athletic 
performance.

745
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,940
So I have these friends that I've 
developed,

746
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,120
I've gathered over the years and I love 
what I do,

747
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:03,954
man,
like I'm happy every single day and a 

748
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:11,361
big part of it is I've met these people 
that I have these conversations with and

749
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:15,470
sometimes they're very long and deep and
and they've some.

750
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,313
I have friends that are a phd 
psychologists and this one guy dr stu 

751
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,620
mcgill.
Do you know who he is?

752
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,830
His name now?
You've probably heard that name.

753
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:25,980
I'm sure somebody has mentioned it 
because you're around different athletic

754
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,060
types of all types.

755
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,103
He is the world's foremost expert in the
spinal cord and neurology of athletic 

756
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,320
performance,
spinal cord.

757
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,523
The spinal cord and how and your 
neurology and your nerves and how your 

758
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:42,030
nervous system and george st pierre has 
worked with him a lot.

759
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:44,250
He,
if you asked him about him this week,

760
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,263
he would talk about them extensively.
So dr stu and I became friends and it's 

761
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:50,454
a big compliment because he sought me 
out based on seeing my work and saying 

762
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,490
that guy knows some things I want to 
talk to him,

763
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:57,324
which was a plaque and deep compliment 
to me and now we became friends and we 

764
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:00,714
chat all the time and one of the things 
we constantly talk about is the double 

765
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:08,580
pulse in neurology and people talk about
fast twitch fiber.

766
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,530
It's not a fiber as that's just terms 
we've started to hear.

767
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,190
It's a fast twitch neurology.

768
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,410
It's,
it's a base,

769
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,080
a fast ball hitters have it.
You know what I mean?

770
00:37:19,081 --> 00:37:22,340
That neurology where you,
you,

771
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,513
there's a pulse of tension and then a 
complete relaxation until the pulse of 

772
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:28,194
tension.
Again,

773
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,560
the bruce lee's one inch punch was the 
simple example of that,

774
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,453
but that is how that is the neurology of
high athletic performance and that's 

775
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:39,120
what I zoomed in on when I was looking 
at your kid because you can see it quite

776
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:40,740
clearly.
There is the moment,

777
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,540
there's the relaxing those and it ends 
up being more of a whip and stewart Dr.

778
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,373
Stewart has all these incredible 
analogies because he's examined this in 

779
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:49,374
so many different angles and layers,
which is the beauty of analyzing 

780
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:52,884
anything for years and he'll use terms 
like you can't shoot a cannon out of a 

781
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:59,010
canoe and you think about that and 
you're like,

782
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:03,300
of course with canoes all wobbly,
but if it's tense and then shoots or you

783
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:04,920
can't push a rope,
right?

784
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,960
You push a rope,
right,

785
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,820
and so,
but you can whip a rope through tension,

786
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:09,654
relaxation and tension again,
and that neurology is the neurology of 

787
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:16,890
high performance and george,
you talked to george about neurology.

788
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:17,724
He'll go deep down some shit to george 
st pierre because he studied this to 

789
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:24,630
understand himself and what he was doing
at a high level with doctors do.

790
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,873
But it is a fascinating thing because 
when you think we often will say 

791
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,540
fighting is 90 percent mental sipping.
This cup is 100 percent mental.

792
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,843
You know,
my brain told my body to reach out and 

793
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:42,790
do it.
My brain made the choice.

794
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,920
I activated everything,
use,

795
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:45,754
it's all your brain,
everything and once you get to a high 

796
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:49,234
level of performance,
you know how to punch and kick and you 

797
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:52,414
train like crazy and you make the things
happen by themselves almost by trading 

798
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,920
so much they take so little attention 
and decision making.

799
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,700
It becomes about maximizing your nervous
system,

800
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,743
how your nervous system.
And I think that's true of almost 

801
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:06,670
anything history right there.
Yeah.

802
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,973
Yeah.
That susie training with george and dr 

803
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,680
stu.
I couldn't see his face.

804
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,600
Yeah,
that's true.

805
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,750
It looks like a bar guy and to be honest
george.

806
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,180
Yeah,
but got.

807
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,980
I'm whipping the ball around.
Yeah.

808
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:24,140
I'm not sure exactly what he's doing or 
why they're dumbbell press,

809
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,650
but I'll put you in touch with them 
often.

810
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:29,770
So it's like a,
it looks like he's got some heavy weight

811
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,080
at the end of a rope.

812
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,363
Yeah.
And I guess engaging the core through 

813
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:35,350
the use of,
you know,

814
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,503
probably asking him to only engage 
certain things to counter balance the 

815
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:40,194
movement

816
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,920
prize,
to see george waring,

817
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:46,690
your typical a running shoe when he's 
training with the thick heel.

818
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:47,524
And you know,
I'm still surprised to this day when I 

819
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:55,081
see I'm going to talk about neurology 
and activating muscles and tissues.

820
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,143
Like there's so many athletes is still 
train with those big cushy bottomed 

821
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,380
running shoes.
I mean I think that is crazy.

822
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,700
Big time.
It's weird.

823
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,833
It's weird,
mean you should be doing that kind of 

824
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:07,480
shit barefoot.
Especially a fighter.

825
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,523
You fight barefoot.
You should be wearing nothing on your 

826
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:11,510
feet.

827
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,050
The only thing connecting you to a 
stable surface is your foot.

828
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,120
Yeah,
I agree 100 percent.

829
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,690
And sometimes when we're trying to make 
sense of these things,

830
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,610
we go to multiple different sort of 
perspectives of it.

831
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:29,750
So I'll take what I learned from dr stu 
and he's just my friend now as well.

832
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:30,584
So I like hanging out and chatting with 
him about like way out there aspects of 

833
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:34,484
these things.
But you talk to irwin [inaudible] as 

834
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:38,510
well,
who has a different sphere of connecting

835
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:39,344
to this kind of thing in erewhon starts 
with the foot and you've had urban on 

836
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,670
the.
Yeah,

837
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,590
and he starts with the foot and 
everything else.

838
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:46,430
It makes sense,
right?

839
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:47,264
I go to throw a punch and the important 
part is going to be my foot through the 

840
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:51,800
leg,
through the hip,

841
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:55,190
through the core and and relaxed until 
the moment that it hits.

842
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:56,770
But then they'll start song is the same.

843
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,133
when I asked nick's.
Excuse me when I asked nick curse on 

844
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:01,474
about training athletes,
like what's the thing that he thinks 

845
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,400
fighters work on the most?
He's like foot strength.

846
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,650
I was like,
wow.

847
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,570
And I thought about it like,
well of course.

848
00:41:10,571 --> 00:41:12,250
Right?
That's how you push off.

849
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:15,190
That's how you move.
Your feet are weak and they get tired.

850
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:16,120
You can't move.
Well,

851
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,103
which I've experienced.
I'm sure you've experienced when your 

852
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,520
feet are weak and tired.
Like if you.

853
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,520
If you don't run and then you try to run
one of the first things,

854
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:25,600
you get tired of your feet.

855
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,173
The very worst injury I've ever had in 
my life by far was plantar fasciitis of 

856
00:41:32,101 --> 00:41:34,970
both feet.
My last fight and I was through training

857
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:35,804
and everything and then I had my fight 
in montreal and the whole strategy was 

858
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,260
put,
getting to a place where I could be safe

859
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,190
and use better knowledge of the 
situation to fatigue the other guy.

860
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:50,024
So the whole,
a lot of the seven or eight minutes of 

861
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:54,560
the fight took place with me,
pressuring him against the fence,

862
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,423
just driving off both feet,
pressuring against the fence to try to 

863
00:41:57,591 --> 00:42:00,530
land things or make create lines for 
different weapons.

864
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,453
And it's only eight minutes,
but eight minutes of intense drive from 

865
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:04,934
my feet.
And then we went on vacation the very 

866
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:08,144
next day and that night we grabbed 
margarita's and we walked around the 

867
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:14,810
resort and then my feet were destroyed 
for a acutely,

868
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,240
for three or four days.
Like I couldn't walk.

869
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,690
And the inflammation was so unbelievably
bad.

870
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:22,460
It was like bricks.
And,

871
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:24,320
uh,
even for months after it was,

872
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,370
did you ask him,
uh,

873
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,720
tried to ice I ice or I would get in 
immediately into the cold pool and spend

874
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:32,270
the day in the cold pool drinking 
tequila and hopes that it would help.

875
00:42:32,271 --> 00:42:33,104
And it kinda did

876
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,210
foot pain is,
that's one of the things that are hurt.

877
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:44,211
Dominick cruz in his comeback fight when
he fought tj dillashaw,

878
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,020
you notice he was kind of limping a 
little.

879
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,260
We were attributed to the leg kicks.
He said that's not the case.

880
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:52,560
He said what was going on was he had 
plantar fasciitis because,

881
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,493
you know,
he had multiple injuries that he was 

882
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,440
recovering from during that training 
camp.

883
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:03,740
And wHen he got knee surgery and he came
back from that and he tore his groin.

884
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,500
He tried to like really ramp up his 
training.

885
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:09,780
He was doing a lot of sprinting and a 
lot of different things with his feet,

886
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,643
you know,
because obviously he's very footwork 

887
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,010
intensive with his fighting and he 
fucked his feet up.

888
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:14,844
Man.
His feet just weren't in conditioned to 

889
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,570
do the kind of stuff that he used to be 
able to do.

890
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,050
And the first thing he got was plantar 
fasciitis shop had it too.

891
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:24,560
He told me it was the worst things he's 
ever had.

892
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:25,260
I mean,
yeah,

893
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,350
think of this for the big picture 
meaning of this for dominic.

894
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:34,580
So you got somebody else and there are 
going about fighting and their,

895
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,520
their career as a martial artist,
a competitive fighter one way.

896
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:42,330
And dominic goes about a different way.
And through dominic's choices,

897
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,220
uh,
moving training,

898
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:47,520
footwork,
he avoids a lot of the damage that these

899
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:50,010
guys will take.
But you can't avoid.

900
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,620
Something's going to go right.
So instead of taking,

901
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:55,230
getting kicked a lot and punched in the 
head and taking all those things,

902
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,320
the training necessary to make that not 
happen,

903
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,110
fucks up something else.
Like you can't get away from it.

904
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,750
You're going to work yourself until your
body gives up.

905
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,853
Even dom brilliantly finding a way to 
work outside of taking the damage that 

906
00:44:09,031 --> 00:44:12,120
they take still could not get away from 
damaging his body.

907
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,133
Tj dillashaw versus cody garbrandt.
The rematch is one of the most 

908
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:17,910
intriguing parts of the year for me.
I'm really,

909
00:44:17,911 --> 00:44:18,744
really curious about that fight because 
I know those guys were tightly matched 

910
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:23,394
in the gym and I know that cody correct 
him with a big right hand before tj put 

911
00:44:27,151 --> 00:44:30,660
him away and so it was.
He was stunned.

912
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,513
I mean he got rocked and I believe when 
cody cracked and it was towards the end 

913
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:36,540
of the round,
he was.

914
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,420
Yeah,
and so he had an opportunity to recover.

915
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:40,254
I mean,
who knows if he had caught that right 

916
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:44,130
hand the first minute of the round what 
had gone on,

917
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,460
but when tj recovered from that and then
lend that head kick and then knocked him

918
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:53,010
out and put them away,
you got to see like,

919
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,520
oh,
what a high level high stakes game these

920
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:57,354
two guys are playing and you know,
tj has through bang ludwig has really 

921
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,870
radically improved his movement,
his footwork,

922
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,400
his angles,
his approach.

923
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,630
He's so versatile with his ability to 
switch stances,

924
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,613
his ability.
I mean he's constantly cutting angles 

925
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:16,743
and striking as you switching stances 
and there's so much information coming 

926
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:22,290
at you.
If you're fighting him,

927
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,300
your,
your brain's overloaded.

928
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:27,420
If you're not used to that.
And even the guys who used to train with

929
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:28,770
them,
I believe in alpha male,

930
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:30,930
are not used to what he's doing now.
I agree.

931
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,090
Because it's a.
It's a.

932
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:32,963
It's a at a far higher level that said,
cody still has a fucking missile in his 

933
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:40,200
right hand.
It's so god damn fast.

934
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,183
His hand speed is so fast and his,
his fluidity and efficiency in his 

935
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:48,390
boxing is so good.
It's just a very,

936
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:49,620
very interesting fight for me.

937
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,120
That's about as good as it gets right 
now.

938
00:45:52,121 --> 00:45:57,121
Like from the raw materials of those 
guys and the skills that they have.

939
00:45:57,191 --> 00:46:00,280
But I,
I'm definitely with you as far as that.

940
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,470
My deep curiosity of the choices of the 
coaches because,

941
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,050
and you've talked to some of them 
different ones,

942
00:46:08,051 --> 00:46:09,850
you know,
I've got a few key friends that I talked

943
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:13,930
to on a very regular basis.
And so what it will take,

944
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,273
what we would decide to do to train to 
make our guy the best in the world or 

945
00:46:17,951 --> 00:46:19,750
try to be the best in the world in 10 
months.

946
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,733
If we take a different strategy and we 
start to build them to be the best in 

947
00:46:23,321 --> 00:46:24,154
the world in three years,
it's a different game and that's what 

948
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,720
dwayne,
dwayne is sad.

949
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,823
We will and it's,
it's fucking hard work for dwayne to 

950
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,193
like,
that's the thing that people won't 

951
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,000
necessarily appreciate it.

952
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,441
They'll be like,
oh,

953
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:38,274
he's a brilliant coach.
That's nonstop constant searching and 

954
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:41,704
examining and trial and error and 
reinterpreting his language of 

955
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:50,110
understanding where the,
where the chaos is and understanding,

956
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,153
you know,
can we make this guy believes 

957
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:53,374
something's happening or are we too deep
in it that he doesn't think that and it 

958
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:57,064
fails.
Like what levels of misdirection or too 

959
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,090
deep,
how good is he?

960
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,340
And when I talked to them leading up to 
that one,

961
00:47:03,341 --> 00:47:04,750
it was like,
you know,

962
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,613
the conversation was about her making 
cody believe and anticipate something 

963
00:47:11,051 --> 00:47:11,884
wrong.
And that's the root of all of all 

964
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:13,751
combat,
right?

965
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:16,150
Like you make me think this is coming 
and I do this.

966
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,390
Me in the body and the layers,
the multiple layers,

967
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:22,090
like you just said,
overloading the ability to.

968
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:25,960
You're trying to catalog what's coming 
and how you chunk that,

969
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:28,120
uh,
we don't necessarily understand.

970
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,800
So your brain be going,
okay,

971
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:33,650
this is all the stuff from the left 
which happens when this happened or the,

972
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,580
the,
the legs or doing this or you're running

973
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:38,710
algorithms in your brain and we don't 
know.

974
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:39,663
I don't know what yours is.
I don't know how you categorize my 

975
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:42,754
threats.
I don't know whether you categorize 

976
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:46,690
anything from my right hand or anything 
in combination or if you're watching the

977
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:48,700
patterns of my shoulders,
I have no idea.

978
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:54,030
So dwayne and anybody else playing with 
this concept is trying to figure out how

979
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:58,420
you'll read this and use that against 
you.

980
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:03,250
And to me,
that's the layer of complete mindblowing

981
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,960
nature that like,
what did you say?

982
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,030
Chests with dire consequences or 
problem?

983
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,430
Solvable problem.
Fucking hard.

984
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:11,710
those problems are now how many there 
are.

985
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,990
That's the game.
And,

986
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,210
and it can be done at this level because
their skills are so good.

987
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,310
they're minds are so good.
They're physically so good,

988
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:19,840
they're capable,
they're fearless,

989
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:22,690
they are confident.
They have all of those raw materials and

990
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,524
now we're playing a game that most of us
cannot comprehend and they've also 

991
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:27,814
sparred countless hours together so they
stand each other and they've told each 

992
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:34,380
other lies for long periods.
He lies on lies.

993
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:35,763
I one time went with a.
I worked for a company called the score 

994
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:42,510
fighting series.
It was a brilliant show like it was kind

995
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:43,363
of cannabis.
Bella tore like it was on the same 

996
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:47,500
network and they aired bella tour and it
was very,

997
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:48,334
very good developmental league stuff and
that company brought in forrest griffin 

998
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,793
and then a bunch of poker players and 
they were on a train together and 

999
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,933
contest winners on the thing.
Got to ride on this train with forrest 

1000
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:00,904
griffin and a bunch of poker high level 
pro poker players and I was there and 

1001
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,150
that was the first time I met forrest 
and this is a killer,

1002
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,013
smart dude,
but you watch these poker players who 

1003
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:11,134
were all riding together and they all 
know each other and they were just 

1004
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:14,530
telling each other lies all the time.

1005
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:18,250
Trying to tell stories about things that
represent the fact that they are,

1006
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,313
you know,
conservative when really they're risk 

1007
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:21,814
takers are trying to tell each other 
things that make them think they're 

1008
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:25,600
crazy,
but really they're calculating like they

1009
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:29,410
are telling each other lies ongoing and 
the gambling with each other and shit,

1010
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:30,244
it's completely degenerate generative,
but that's the kind of thing that's 

1011
00:49:33,581 --> 00:49:34,414
happening on some level with these,
the high level fighters to making them 

1012
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:38,764
think certain things about what they 
will do or believe they'll do almost 

1013
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:44,080
everything they say.
Um,

1014
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:49,320
we see the fans and the audience we 
should assume is a game chip is like a,

1015
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,110
something to make the other one believes
something that might in that moment,

1016
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:55,510
let me land that kick.
If he thinks that I'm,

1017
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,561
you know,
whatever,

1018
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,150
right?
Let's manipulative stuff.

1019
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,770
And at that level that is just so 
unbelievably fascinating.

1020
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,100
It really is.
It really is.

1021
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,710
When the stakes are so high,
you know,

1022
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,270
the kick lands,
you're a hero,

1023
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:09,460
the kick mrs.
and you get caught with a left hook.

1024
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:10,690
You're a loser.
You know,

1025
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:14,930
there's just so much at stake with every
single choice you make and all,

1026
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:15,764
all those choices have to be almost 
subconscious or semi-conscious because 

1027
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:20,524
you've got to be in the zen state,
you gotta to be flowing so everything 

1028
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:24,730
has to be prepared.
You have to have,

1029
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,740
you know,
while you're in there,

1030
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:28,010
you have

1031
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,220
to have no regrets.
You have to be able to just flow and you

1032
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:33,230
have to be able to capitalize on any 
movement,

1033
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:34,340
any,
any opening,

1034
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:35,174
you see you got to pounds and you have 
to be in condition to execute all these 

1035
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:38,684
things so you have to have had the 
physical discipline and the mental 

1036
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:42,044
fortitude to push yourself through 
training to a level that you probably 

1037
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:45,560
didn't think you could get to

1038
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,510
and,
and I want to pounce with the opening,

1039
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,660
but what if it's a lie,
right?

1040
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:51,563
Right.
But what if matt brown line on that 

1041
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:56,360
thing was actually.
That one would be hard to be alive,

1042
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,740
but there are other ones where it feels 
like that one little opening.

1043
00:50:58,741 --> 00:51:01,140
But instead tj is going to catch you or 
cody's line.

1044
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,790
Do you opt to draw you into something

1045
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:05,490
so god damn fast,
to his hand,

1046
00:51:05,491 --> 00:51:06,324
speed is so ridiculously fast.
I go back to the tom sell modified and 

1047
00:51:09,241 --> 00:51:11,040
I'll made.
Has really never been the same again.

1048
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,710
I'll made a.
Going into that fight was undefeated,

1049
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:14,544
was thought to be the dark horse in the 
division like will look or future world 

1050
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,690
champion and cody lit him up like a 
christmas tree and the way he did it was

1051
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:22,524
so definitive that you like jesus,
like there can be no doubt this guy has 

1052
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:29,090
real world championship potential.
Yeah,

1053
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,140
and I think that the duane ludwig factor
is so fucking huge.

1054
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,460
Really,
really do.

1055
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:40,170
And I,
I've seen dwayne's work in like dwayne,

1056
00:51:40,171 --> 00:51:41,004
unlike a lot of guys has notebooks,
binders full of ideas and his system is 

1057
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:51,000
a,
it's a very declared system.

1058
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,810
It's not like loosely based where we 
always work off the jab.

1059
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:55,820
We've got good footwork.

1060
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,730
No,
there's none of that.

1061
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,183
Like there's a system to his,
like he has a belt system to his style 

1062
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,920
and his style is based on for people 
don't know.

1063
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:09,460
Dwayne was a world class kickboxer 
worldclass,

1064
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,490
muy thai fighter,
I mean fought ramon dekkers,

1065
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,050
mean,
fought some of the best of the best,

1066
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,093
had some amazing fights in both mma and 
in kickboxing and he was a really 

1067
00:52:18,241 --> 00:52:19,074
talented guy and then transitioned on to
being a coach and the obsession that he 

1068
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,374
has towards coaching is really at a 
higher level than even his obsession 

1069
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:31,150
towards fighting and he talks about 
that,

1070
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:34,320
that his passion is teaching people.
He loves it.

1071
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:35,423
He loves being able to mold students and
he's found the perfect muse or the 

1072
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:40,284
perfect willing participant in tj and tj
and him have a very unique friendship 

1073
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,220
and very unique student mentorship sort 
of relationship.

1074
00:52:50,221 --> 00:52:51,054
It's really,
really interesting to watch the two of 

1075
00:52:52,471 --> 00:52:53,220
them together.

1076
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:58,110
Wild now the super jam with 20 guys and 
then you've got a,

1077
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,660
and dwayne has tons of athletes too,
but a but a commitment and connection to

1078
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:03,494
tj.
Then you've got matt hume and demetrius 

1079
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:07,820
like you've got a few of these guys who 
are just like,

1080
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:08,803
we you,
we will funnel all of my experience 

1081
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:13,130
through everything through this super 
athlete,

1082
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,143
but like you talk about those books,
the only way that you get to a point of 

1083
00:53:18,771 --> 00:53:19,604
this level of mastery that we're talking
about is that you must go down some 

1084
00:53:23,001 --> 00:53:28,001
fucking road for six months that amounts
to nothing so that you learned that road

1085
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:31,680
isn't the road and the only way and you 
can't give up too early.

1086
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:32,663
And what if by going down at long enough
some different concepts about how you 

1087
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:39,000
switch your feet in a certain moment.
You think maybe that ain't it,

1088
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:39,953
but you have discovered that by pushing 
through some of these concepts long 

1089
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:43,914
enough,
you find it so you stick with it long 

1090
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:46,134
enough and it turns out now dwayne or 
anybody else reaching that level of 

1091
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:50,004
mastery has gone down some rabbit hole 
for months or years and discovered the 

1092
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,670
only value they got out of it was what?

1093
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,503
No,
there's lots of value.

1094
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,713
That wasn't the rabbit hole and the.
The process of searching this rabbit 

1095
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,690
hole has made me better at searching 
rabbit holes,

1096
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,583
so those two values,
some of the stacks of his books are 

1097
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:08,154
things that didn't work and he will 
probably appreciate those just as much 

1098
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:12,380
as any of the ones that did it was also.

1099
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,273
Tj is approach is really interesting to 
me because tj is obsessed with 

1100
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:22,311
improvement and knowledge and he keeps 
talking about his fight iq and you know,

1101
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,030
him and dwayne,
I've been around them,

1102
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:25,710
I've trained with them,
have worked out with him.

1103
00:54:25,711 --> 00:54:28,740
I've watched him coach tj and I mean 
they're,

1104
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:31,080
they're constantly working on the 
minutia.

1105
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:31,923
That constant working on finite details 
and improving every single aspect and 

1106
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:40,290
tightening things up.
And it's really interesting.

1107
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:43,080
Tj is a fucking open book man.
I mean he's uh,

1108
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,250
he's,
he,

1109
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:48,230
you can talk to that guy about anything 
and he's considering it.

1110
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,710
He's thinking and he's like,
oh,

1111
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:50,700
okay,
I see what you're doing.

1112
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:52,080
I see what you're doing.
Like he's,

1113
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:54,900
he's a guy who's always trying to take 
in information

1114
00:54:56,110 --> 00:55:00,880
that's.
So these are the things when we do watch

1115
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,073
this kind of thing,
whether it is martial arts or even jazz 

1116
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:06,424
or football or whatever,
there are these lessons that are there 

1117
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:13,240
like we should do that corresponds to go
through life doing that.

1118
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:15,220
We're not supposed to look at tj 
dillashaw and go,

1119
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:16,330
wow,
isn't that crazy,

1120
00:55:16,331 --> 00:55:17,620
that guy,
if we do that,

1121
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:19,000
our lives will get better.
Right?

1122
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:21,160
Like I,
I got to.

1123
00:55:21,161 --> 00:55:26,161
So I get to work for tsn in Canada,
which is like espn in the states and we,

1124
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:27,124
I'm myself and erin brought instead or 
like the two person division that talks 

1125
00:55:29,981 --> 00:55:34,100
about about a ufc and fighting.
And uh,

1126
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,103
we uh,
they went and when george was fighting 

1127
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:38,590
michael,
they went and said,

1128
00:55:38,591 --> 00:55:39,424
you know,
could you approach your friends with 

1129
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:41,674
george and his people?
Could you approach them about doing a 

1130
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,450
half hour long documentary on him about 
his comeback and training and stuff?

1131
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:47,973
And I did.
And at first george was open to it and 

1132
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,330
is randolph his manager.
I was like,

1133
00:55:52,331 --> 00:55:53,164
oh god,
I hear the word documentary and I know 

1134
00:55:54,191 --> 00:55:55,810
what that means.
It's going to be months.

1135
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:58,630
And is going to be cameras and it's 
going to be a distraction.

1136
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:03,280
I said I'll just travel with george and 
I have the best producer,

1137
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,590
simon,
the best producer we have and we'll just

1138
00:56:05,591 --> 00:56:06,910
travel with them.
And they saId yes.

1139
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:09,810
And so I got to travel with george for a
month,

1140
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:10,683
six weeks off and on New York,
la montreal life eating ice cream 

1141
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,040
training with freddie roach.
Yeah.

1142
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,810
Yeah.
That was interesting.

1143
00:56:19,811 --> 00:56:21,940
When is this going to come out?
It did come up before,

1144
00:56:21,941 --> 00:56:24,850
so mostly in Canada,
but I'm going to send a message that I'm

1145
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:25,684
going to send a message immediately 
after we get off here to simon and the 

1146
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:30,130
rest of them and say where is that right
now?

1147
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,230
And then I'll,
I'll tweet it out because he had learned

1148
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:33,810
a lot.
Oh man,

1149
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,653
it changed my life because you don't get
to be around the greats of the greats 

1150
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:40,474
and study them.
And we're friends so I can talk to him 

1151
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:43,924
like we hang out here.
I got to fucking train karate with his 

1152
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:48,160
team,
like point karate,

1153
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,181
you know.
So it'd be,

1154
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:50,500
oh,
robin's training with us today.

1155
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,633
What kind of point karate training do 
they do and do they do this to practice 

1156
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:54,814
like blitzing and just think of this 
like you were big on point karate like 

1157
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:00,604
2012,
2013 and I didn't disagree but I didn't 

1158
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,780
really get there.
It is.

1159
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:07,463
There it is.
Yeah,

1160
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,620
it.
Oh fuck.

1161
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:11,590
It was so magical to see like.
And I wasn't just like,

1162
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:12,580
how does he kick?
I'm like,

1163
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:15,970
how does he think and why does he do the
things he does and why?

1164
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:16,803
What's his motivation?
And it really made me a better human 

1165
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:19,474
being getting to do that,
but so what I didn't really connect to 

1166
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:23,683
us.
Sometimes there's something so simple 

1167
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:28,390
and we don't see it because we're in 
deep enough or whatever we're in,

1168
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:32,380
but the idea of point karate people 
right away say,

1169
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:34,290
well they're just touching each other so
I could.

1170
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,160
true.
So if I'm training to just touch you,

1171
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,120
I'm not trying to hurt you.
Okay.

1172
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,420
That seems like that's not valuable when
you're training to not.

1173
00:57:40,421 --> 00:57:45,220
Let me even fucking touch you.
If you can't get touched by me.

1174
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,113
How hard.
Impossible as it for me to hit you 

1175
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:48,790
clean,
you know what I mean?

1176
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,624
If your movement and your,
your defensive systems and your 

1177
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,344
management of the,
of the distance between our weapons and 

1178
00:57:55,811 --> 00:57:58,600
targets are such that I can't fucking 
touch you.

1179
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,220
How can I hurt you?
Right?

1180
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,770
If I can't even get touchy with my 
glove.

1181
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:02,890
Well,

1182
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:06,220
the thing is,
here's what I think about point fighting

1183
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:11,221
and what I think was valid about it is 
if you're just doing point fighting with

1184
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:13,600
a point fighter,
it is extremely frustrated.

1185
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:17,260
I fought and point fighting tournaments 
when I was competing and we.

1186
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,153
There was.
I came from a full contact taekwondo 

1187
00:58:21,101 --> 00:58:21,934
background and we fought in these 
tournaments and the object was to knock 

1188
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:26,660
people unconscious and you would fight,
you know,

1189
00:58:26,661 --> 00:58:27,494
they would have three minute rounds and 
you would fight and you would try to 

1190
00:58:29,261 --> 00:58:32,020
kick people into another.
Very similar in Canada,

1191
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,453
what we.
There was a lot of people that are 

1192
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:35,914
trained with that openly dismissed point
fighting and the reason why they openly 

1193
00:58:39,461 --> 00:58:42,580
dismissed point fighting was because 
they would stop every time someone would

1194
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:44,350
get touched and I would be like,
well,

1195
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,200
in the real world or everybody would say
in the real world,

1196
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,120
you don't just stop when you get 
touched,

1197
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:50,440
you keep fighting.

1198
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,450
And so with our techniques,
a lot of it,

1199
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,403
you would hit someone once and they 
would counter and then you'd set up the 

1200
00:58:55,901 --> 00:58:56,734
big shot afterwards.
like this is part of the thing and if 

1201
00:58:58,811 --> 00:59:02,500
the referee kept stopping you,
then you would never get anything done.

1202
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:07,390
But my thinking once I got into mma was 
okay,

1203
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,343
yeah,
but if you can do that and do the other 

1204
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:12,274
things,
it's like people dismiss taekwondo 

1205
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,240
because they're like,
we'll talk one doe.

1206
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,280
You know,
you get taken to the ground,

1207
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,560
you get your legs kicked out.
Absolutely.

1208
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,280
But if you have

1209
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,940
takedown defense and you know more thai,
you can.

1210
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:29,240
We'll kick someone into another fucking 
dimension.

1211
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:31,880
And we saw that with edson barboza 
versus terry adam.

1212
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:32,893
We've seen these taekwondo techniques 
manifest themselves in mmA and you 

1213
00:59:36,141 --> 00:59:36,974
realize like,
oh,

1214
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,760
these are some of the most powerful 
things you could do to a person inside a

1215
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:41,594
cage,
but when you see the point fighting 

1216
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:45,764
style though,
like the Raymond Daniels or the michael 

1217
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:48,524
venom page,
disability ability to blitz if they can 

1218
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:54,830
do those other things too.
This is another another level.

1219
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:57,050
There's soMething to it.
So as a fighter,

1220
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:57,884
I wasn't willing to dismiss point 
fighting because I had been lied to 

1221
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:01,964
already.
I when I went and took taekwondo and 

1222
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:05,234
then started kickboxing,
first american kickboxing above the 

1223
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:08,144
waist,
first thing I realized was how easy it 

1224
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:12,050
was for me to get punched in the face.
I was like,

1225
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,310
oh,
okay.

1226
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:17,030
Now if I'm trapped in this ring and I 
can't go anywhere and someone's throwing

1227
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:18,970
punches and I don't understand how to 
get away from him,

1228
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:21,950
and I'm used to this taekwondo style of 
having your hands down low.

1229
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,780
I'm getting fucked up.
So I've been lied to.

1230
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,290
Talk window is not the best martial art.
Mma.

1231
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,570
Yeah,
exactly.

1232
01:00:27,571 --> 01:00:29,450
I'm not that.
There is no best push.

1233
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,710
There's something absolutely legit about
that blitz,

1234
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:37,280
that karate blitz that some of these 
guys can do,

1235
01:00:37,281 --> 01:00:41,720
and I fought some really good guys in 
those karate style tournaments and I got

1236
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,430
an ass made out of me.
I mean,

1237
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,264
you,
you don't know what to do and you get 

1238
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,830
kicked and then the reference point and 
the like,

1239
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:52,940
you don't have a chance to fire back 
because they're separating you guys.

1240
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,180
And I,
I really absorb those lessons.

1241
01:00:56,181 --> 01:00:57,014
And I was like in mma,
that ability to close the distance 

1242
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:03,950
because every in mma there's so many 
guys and connor talked about this.

1243
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:04,933
There's so many guys that have this thai
stance and they're presenting this very 

1244
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:09,224
predictable target.
They're standing right in front of each 

1245
01:01:10,341 --> 01:01:12,830
other.
And I think this stance,

1246
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,480
and especially this,
the,

1247
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,740
uh,
change,

1248
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:20,060
the forward stance is one of the reasons
why [inaudible] has been caught,

1249
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,930
knocked out twice with front kicks 
because he squares off veto.

1250
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:27,440
Explain this to me in like,
shit.

1251
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,800
Nineteen 97.
When I was tRaining at carlson gracie's,

1252
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,480
he was explaining that you know,
some kickboxers are going to have a hard

1253
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:40,160
time in mma even though they're really 
good kickboxers because the mma stance,

1254
01:01:40,161 --> 01:01:43,670
you really have to square off more.
You can't stand lIke this.

1255
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:44,504
You can't stand in like a boxer and a 
kickboxer is a little more open than a 

1256
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:48,344
boxer,
but then mma is a little more open than 

1257
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,070
it was like you almost have to be 
square,

1258
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:53,023
but that square leaves you open to front
kicks to the face and then turn turning 

1259
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,214
side kicks and side kicks to the body.
Think about what [inaudible] has been 

1260
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:02,810
dropped with jon jones dropped him with 
a side kick to the body.

1261
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,020
Um,
soccer.

1262
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:07,380
Robert dropped him with a turning side 
kick to the body to fund kick front kick

1263
01:02:07,381 --> 01:02:08,214
to the face.
It's because he presents this square 

1264
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:10,873
thing,
But to him this is sprawl and throw 

1265
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:16,250
punches and throw that they'll like the 
blitz had used on vandelay silva.

1266
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:18,380
Yeah.
And it worked much of his career.

1267
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,070
He either one with it or lost

1268
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:20,903
with respect that thinking,
but those types of doctrines like is 

1269
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:29,931
literally and in martial arts in day to 
day life in anything.

1270
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:31,703
If you think anything is the thing,
you're totally wrong because if we all 

1271
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:36,114
agree it's nothing.
Then we all acting like it's the thing 

1272
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:40,590
that we all start ignoring other things 
and those things will work.

1273
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:44,520
So if you have to,
if mma you have to square up.

1274
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:45,803
All of a sudden some guys,
some connor comes out with a different 

1275
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,384
thing and you were thompson.
The guard is the one that is glaRing to 

1276
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:53,064
me right now because,
and I mean I've talked to some of the 

1277
01:02:56,011 --> 01:03:00,120
smartest and the best and they will and 
we do this over and over again and we do

1278
01:03:00,121 --> 01:03:01,620
it in everything.
You know,

1279
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:02,720
you Remember when you,
you're,

1280
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,400
you cannot cross your feet when you do 
an arm bar.

1281
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,560
Do you remember that?
Are like,

1282
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,400
what the fuck?
What are you talking about?

1283
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,140
Head kicks.
Don't work.

1284
01:03:11,141 --> 01:03:12,630
And mma like,
you know,

1285
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:13,493
this has been going on forever.
So any absolute decision that this is a 

1286
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:21,270
fundamental rule is completely.
That's where you're gonna get fucked.

1287
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,760
How about the low calf kick?
Yeah,

1288
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,250
I mean the benson henderson was in my 
opinion,

1289
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:30,420
the first guy to bring him in and he 
started doing that back in the day,

1290
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:31,254
but not at the effectiveness.
The level of effectIveness that we're 

1291
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:34,524
seeing now.
That low calf kick his fucking people 

1292
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,493
up.
That's really interesting and then 

1293
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:41,940
they'll adapt and then it won't work,
but that adaptation,

1294
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:42,774
we'll put something else available.
I think the problem with the low calf 

1295
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:46,554
kyc is that you really can condition the
lower part of your leg the same way you 

1296
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:52,860
can your thighs and I think it's going 
to keep working,

1297
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,850
but then we have to not get hit by it,
so we'll make a change to not get hit by

1298
01:03:56,851 --> 01:03:57,000
him.

1299
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,833
Once we do,
that'll force us to do something else 

1300
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:03,120
that someone will tAke advantage.
It's amazing how quiCkly it works.

1301
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,580
Like if you see a guy get hit with a 
Brutal leg kick,

1302
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:08,490
like it takes one or two and then they 
start to feel it.

1303
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:10,500
There's something about the first low 
calf kick.

1304
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:11,334
You see guys wobbly like that.
That muscle is like really done at the 

1305
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:17,610
insertion at the bottom is so small and 
it's still taking.

1306
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:21,510
It's taking so much work like it's 
carrying so much.

1307
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,823
Yeah,
it's,

1308
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:23,933
it's.
These are when things work beautifully 

1309
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:26,603
and again,
like I used to take anything we'd talk 

1310
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:29,004
about and I'd bring it back to fighting.
Now I tend to take anything in fighting 

1311
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,500
and I tried to figure out what it means 
in life.

1312
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,410
Like I've kind of slow over time of 
study.

1313
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,030
I've started to do that.

1314
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:40,163
Right?
And this is true of this kick and it's 

1315
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:42,774
true of anything.
It's like that it works best when the 

1316
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:46,854
physiological truth that calf is small 
and weak and then works with the 

1317
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:52,014
systemic issue.
He's got his foot there and the way he 

1318
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:57,090
standing is such that you can hit it to 
those two things together,

1319
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:58,103
are making that thing work right now if 
you can't change the strength of the 

1320
01:05:02,071 --> 01:05:02,904
calf.
So the only thing we can change is how 

1321
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:07,200
available that calf kick is.
If we don't want to get hit with it.

1322
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,750
So we must change that.
And if we do,

1323
01:05:09,751 --> 01:05:13,080
we've changed a lot of different things 
and now something else is available that

1324
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:17,260
dwayne or duke or somebody else has 
already planning how to,

1325
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:19,770
how to take advantage that you've made 
that adaptation,

1326
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,300
that,
that is for me,

1327
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:24,340
what is eternally fascinating,
but martial arts,

1328
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:25,174
but he can dots,
those are the lessons of life that are 

1329
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:27,994
there.
If you can't see that the world around 

1330
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:33,310
you has changed dramatically and you act
as if it's the same,

1331
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,840
uh,
you get fucked up,

1332
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,070
you will get fucked up,

1333
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,143
you know,
bring this to paul daily versus john 

1334
01:05:39,181 --> 01:05:44,181
fitch because that fight was extremely 
frustrating to paul daley and frustrated

1335
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,533
a lot of people that were watching it 
too because john fits was just able to 

1336
01:05:48,961 --> 01:05:49,794
take him down and kinda do what john 
does and hit him on the ground and kind 

1337
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:56,310
of beat him up and control the position.
And,

1338
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,720
and you know,
at the end of the fight,

1339
01:05:57,721 --> 01:06:01,440
paul's yell and boom,
it was so strange,

1340
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,513
you know?
And,

1341
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:06,900
but this is a guy that if you just stand
with him,

1342
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:07,883
he's going to fuck you up.
Like if you just decide to trade shots 

1343
01:06:10,771 --> 01:06:11,604
with paul daily on your feet,
he's got a left hand that is a goddamn 

1344
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,400
nuclear missile,
you know,

1345
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:18,970
and he basically everybody hits with 
that thing goes night night.

1346
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:20,640
It's scary.
Even lorenz larkin,

1347
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:21,683
who's a seasoned striker,
he got clipped by that left hand is 

1348
01:06:24,031 --> 01:06:24,864
like,
yo,

1349
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:25,983
the ability to make,
generate and create that amount of 

1350
01:06:28,271 --> 01:06:31,180
impact is elegant.
It's like,

1351
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,433
it's like we,
we are human bodies and minds don't do 

1352
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:36,634
all that many things that are,
that unbelievably beautiful and rooted 

1353
01:06:40,061 --> 01:06:42,460
in our history as human beings.
You know what I mean?

1354
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:43,294
This is at the basis of what it was to 
survive and protect and expand and 

1355
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:49,450
stuff.
And you see it right there.

1356
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:51,880
When paul daley hit somebody like it's 
unreal.

1357
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:52,953
The opposite of that scenario is I'm 
Johnny Hendricks was fighting Stephen 

1358
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:01,090
Thompson and Johnny Hendricks wanted 
when stephen would come in,

1359
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:01,924
he wanted to drill him with hooks and 
upper cuts and then get to his body and 

1360
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:06,730
take him down and do what,
what,

1361
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:07,480
uh,
uh,

1362
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,810
john fitch did.
But steven's like you doing that.

1363
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,260
And after he kicked him and beat him up 
at distance and then finish the fight,

1364
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,020
johnny was being interviewed and he's 
like,

1365
01:07:17,021 --> 01:07:17,854
well,
that wasn't my neck and johnny is a 

1366
01:07:18,761 --> 01:07:21,910
classy guy.
Overall over the length of his career,

1367
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,920
he sometimes gets heat.
But who cares?

1368
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:26,470
Right?
Like the opinion of the people shouldn't

1369
01:07:26,471 --> 01:07:29,320
matter to Johnny Hendricks.
But johnny said after he said,

1370
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:30,154
well,
I was kinda hoping he'd come in trade a 

1371
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:32,314
little more.
It's like,

1372
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,260
why the fuck would he do that?
That's not his style.

1373
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:39,040
And that's what you want.
He wants to do what you don't want.

1374
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,263
The whole goal is to do something that 
benefits him in the scenario and does 

1375
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:45,940
not benefit you,
which would be exactly what he did.

1376
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,230
Which is why what brings me back to the 
paul daley,

1377
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,770
john fitch fight like this is the answer
to that style.

1378
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:52,813
The answer to that styles take you down 
and not ever let you get up and force 

1379
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,083
john fitches game on you.
Which is what makes fighting so 

1380
01:08:01,551 --> 01:08:02,384
interesting.
If john fitch had just decided to go 

1381
01:08:04,401 --> 01:08:07,820
cowboy and bite down his mouthpiece and 
just wing punches.

1382
01:08:07,821 --> 01:08:10,460
At paul daily,
until one of them went to sleep,

1383
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,550
that would have been a great fight for 
paul dalian.

1384
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:13,500
Great childhood.

1385
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,090
Um,
when nick diaz,

1386
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,170
paul daley did that

1387
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:20,690
mean that was pretty amazing and that 
only happens again.

1388
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,583
You're creating a moment and it only 
happenS because nick was motivated by 

1389
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,584
who he is in that moment.
He wasn't motivated by stRategy even 

1390
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:31,010
necessarily.
He's like,

1391
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:34,130
fuck you,
fuck you.

1392
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:34,930
And,
and,

1393
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,770
and that.
However,

1394
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:38,840
people will look at that.
That is again,

1395
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:41,660
it is an expression of the 
individuality,

1396
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:45,560
the authentic truth of who nick diaz is.
That's why.

1397
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:49,190
That's art [inaudible] art and fight.
That's a fight.

1398
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,420
This was great and he got clipped a 
fight.

1399
01:08:51,421 --> 01:08:53,710
But this year man,
look at this.

1400
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:55,880
He just,
he just kept the pace.

1401
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,620
He's just refusing.
Yeah.

1402
01:08:57,621 --> 01:08:59,850
Paul just got too tired too quick.
He was,

1403
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:02,600
he was whinging big shots.
And look at nick just.

1404
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,043
Oh,
he got clipped his left hook you're 

1405
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:06,900
talking about.
Yeah.

1406
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:07,761
This is over.
Okay.

1407
01:09:07,761 --> 01:09:08,690
It's over there.
We're done.

1408
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,520
No,
nick won't be done.

1409
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,413
Yeah.
Well,

1410
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:14,570
I mean who knows?
Maybe if paul's in better condition,

1411
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,930
but this is the end.
The end is nick just gathering him.

1412
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,580
It's crazy that he beat his striking 
contest,

1413
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,680
but he did it with will.
He was always a great boxer.

1414
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:26,720
But I mean,
again,

1415
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:29,060
we're this,
we're this a metaphor for life.

1416
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:30,023
Like you got to one of the greatest 
victories ever that that's the 

1417
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:37,720
quintessential nick diaz fight to look 
at them.

1418
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:41,590
And there are people who don't like him.
Uh,

1419
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:45,140
I love that guy too,
because that what we're,

1420
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,003
what we're searching for,
I think is we're trying to be 

1421
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:50,510
authentically who we are.
I think that's all we're doing.

1422
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,330
That's what nick diaz's,
whatever the fuck you think he is,

1423
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:54,343
he is authentically nick diaz and w.
And the metaphor to me is paul daley is 

1424
01:09:59,301 --> 01:10:00,134
a wall and you can,
you can dig under it or you can go 

1425
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:04,784
around it or you can trick somebody,
gives you a rope or you can climb it or 

1426
01:10:07,581 --> 01:10:08,510
you can dissemble it.

1427
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,410
And nick's like,
fuck it.

1428
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:11,540
I'm going to go through it.
I'm going to go through it.

1429
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,613
And there are many ways to choose to 
live your life and that's how nick diaz 

1430
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:16,460
lifts his fucking life.
And that's,

1431
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:17,503
that's beautiful.
What sucks is that he hasn't fought in 

1432
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:20,570
forever.
I mean,

1433
01:10:20,571 --> 01:10:22,400
he hasn't fought since the anderson 
silva fight.

1434
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:23,234
That's crazy.
It's crazy that they suspended him for 

1435
01:10:25,341 --> 01:10:26,174
marijuana.
When anderson silva tested positive for 

1436
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:31,130
steroids in that fight and he got a 
shorter suspension.

1437
01:10:31,131 --> 01:10:33,140
The nick.
That's a reflection.

1438
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:36,110
That's a cultural leftover cultural 
reflection.

1439
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:36,973
That's also that nick refused to pay the
fine because that's nick diaz being 

1440
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,800
authentically nicholas.
You're not getting that money from me,

1441
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:47,330
but you can admire that.
Like some,

1442
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,850
some people will look at that and go do 
just pay it.

1443
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:50,690
It'll go this way.
And he's like,

1444
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,640
no.
Fundamentally who I am,

1445
01:10:52,641 --> 01:10:53,474
I cannot do that.
I will get negative consequences in my 

1446
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:59,060
life,
but I will be authentic to who I am.

1447
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:01,470
But nick is like 36 now,
I think.

1448
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,810
How old is nick diaz?
No.

1449
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:04,250
Thirty four.
He's 34 now.

1450
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:05,860
So yeah.
Oh dude.

1451
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,130
He,
his first fight in ufc,

1452
01:11:07,131 --> 01:11:12,131
I believe he was 20 when he fought 
Jeremy Jackson like way back in the day.

1453
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:13,980
He was 18,
you

1454
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,920
know,
I mean he's been around man,

1455
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:17,873
you know,
he's been a brown so he still like 

1456
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:20,723
literally in his physical prime.
And this is crazy considering the fact 

1457
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:28,230
that I want to say the anderson silva 
fight was three years ago,

1458
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,833
somewhere around there.
I would love to see him back in there 

1459
01:11:33,211 --> 01:11:34,230
again,
you know,

1460
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:35,273
I don't know.

1461
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:36,900
Let me to get what you want to do 
though.

1462
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,150
I don't know if he really,
truly.

1463
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:40,380
That's what he wants to do.
He'll,

1464
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,273
he'll find a way to do it.
And if he doesn't know George George 

1465
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:45,060
coming in,
I'm,

1466
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:49,230
I asked george so my at work,
they're like,

1467
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:50,064
hey,
can you see what's up with george and 

1468
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:51,820
this nate diaz?
And I'm like,

1469
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:52,703
well ask.
But.

1470
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:53,843
And I'll ask honestly as a friend and ed
and he knows that I'm also employed by 

1471
01:11:57,691 --> 01:11:59,340
somebody who have a little conversation 
but,

1472
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,413
but I will never ever sacrifice a 
friendship or like a longterm 

1473
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:09,750
relationship to like find something out.
I don't cAre about,

1474
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,750
and I don't care about twitter,
beef,

1475
01:12:11,751 --> 01:12:14,550
sin,
I don't care about the breaking news and

1476
01:12:14,551 --> 01:12:15,730
all that,
so it's not inteResting.

1477
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,210
It's not anything to do with my life,
but I'll go ask george.

1478
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:23,450
so I asked george who we are friends we 
talked yesterday and uh,

1479
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,660
we will,
he will tell me the truth and then,

1480
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:30,450
and something as simple as,
oh,

1481
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:32,850
you know,
not as fucking bullshit and maybe not in

1482
01:12:32,851 --> 01:12:34,380
exactly those terms,
but he would say,

1483
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,120
but when I asked him about it,
he's like,

1484
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,670
no bro,
I haven't signed nothing.

1485
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,430
And the,
I looked at that and like,

1486
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:42,900
oh my god,
that's george tried to be deceptive.

1487
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:45,660
Like george would normally go ads bs,
man,

1488
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,210
that's not happening.
I know I haven't signed anything.

1489
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,103
Well I know they've offered him,
but that was george who's shitty at 

1490
01:12:52,321 --> 01:12:54,720
being deceptive,
trying to be deceptive.

1491
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:55,890
Like he.
Yeah.

1492
01:12:55,891 --> 01:12:57,390
So like you said,
they've offered it to.

1493
01:12:57,391 --> 01:12:58,224
They've offered it to him and by saying 
I haven't signed it means he's 

1494
01:13:00,061 --> 01:13:00,620
considering it.

1495
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:04,080
I think he's considering it,
but I think he's also considering khabib

1496
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,053
[inaudible].
And then there's always the great irish 

1497
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:10,610
leprechaun,
you know,

1498
01:13:10,611 --> 01:13:12,810
I mean,
I think those are the two big fights.

1499
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:13,703
The two big fights or could be at 1:55
or even one 70 gsp wants to winter of 

1500
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:22,821
conor mcgregor versus could be not nate 
diaz insider drops bombshell and this is

1501
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:24,660
a May 19th,
saturday.

1502
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:26,310
Oh yeah,
I'm sure he wants that.

1503
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:29,560
But that fight would have to take place 
first and who the fuck knows when connor

1504
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:32,420
or be but fight afteRwards,
if it's connor,

1505
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,050
it might be a decade later.
I mean,

1506
01:13:34,051 --> 01:13:37,890
who the fuck knows who that guy is going
to do now when you give a guy like conor

1507
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:40,010
$100,000,000,
you know what I mean?

1508
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:43,110
This is what happens.
He's throwing dollars at bus windows and

1509
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:43,944
losing his fucking mind and Yeah,
they come out of jamie that ufc inside 

1510
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:47,934
of a shop.

1511
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:48,911
Was It?
Yeah,

1512
01:13:48,911 --> 01:13:50,840
it was on his podcast.
I did saw that.

1513
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:52,470
I just scrolled down.
Ufc,

1514
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,630
brendan,
brendan schaub as you fucking idiots.

1515
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:02,720
Some of secure inside or some.
Well,

1516
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:05,730
I'm sure he does want that,
but if they offer him a fat paycheck and

1517
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:06,790
they really should,
if they want.

1518
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:09,100
Look,
the ufc is in a weird position that they

1519
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:13,030
bought the company for $4,000,000,000.
I don't know what it's worth,

1520
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:16,090
but I would guess it's probably not 
really worth $4,000,000,000.

1521
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,210
They have a giant monthly,
not it's fucking huge.

1522
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:23,650
The monthly nut that they have to make 
caused them to fIre a hundred employees.

1523
01:14:23,651 --> 01:14:24,484
I mean there's a lot going on and 
there's been some great fights and it's 

1524
01:14:28,061 --> 01:14:28,894
obviously still incredibly popular,
but you want to make those big pay per 

1525
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:35,380
view bucks.
You need the big name stars.

1526
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:36,423
Gsp was always a big name.
Star became even bigger when he came 

1527
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:40,564
back and beat bisping and one by finish.
You've got them in a rear naked choke 

1528
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:48,640
and put them to sleep.
I mean he's still a giant star.

1529
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,410
However,
he hasn't fought in a while,

1530
01:14:50,411 --> 01:14:52,690
vacated the title.
It doesn't have the title anymore,

1531
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:57,100
so it's not as big of a deal to the 
public size when his sit though.

1532
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:58,150
It is,
it is.

1533
01:14:58,151 --> 01:14:59,530
People are dumb as shit,
man.

1534
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,390
the funny thing to me is like I always 
feel like,

1535
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,100
and and I always feel like a lot of 
these mechanisms,

1536
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,750
title shots,
rankings,

1537
01:15:10,751 --> 01:15:12,550
belts,
you know,

1538
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,384
twitter,
beef.

1539
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:14,223
They weren't Intended to be there as a 
short term solution to give people a 

1540
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:23,350
talking point until they saw how till 
they got deeply invested and connected.

1541
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:24,543
I think that was,
but yet somehow these sort of extra 

1542
01:15:27,671 --> 01:15:32,050
outside distractions became the focus.
Who the fuck cares?

1543
01:15:32,051 --> 01:15:32,884
Who is the number eight guy and who 
cares if these guys are mad at each 

1544
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:39,880
other on twitter and the belt itself is 
a mechanism for discussion.

1545
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,520
What matters is the fight and and I know
that.

1546
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:43,990
It's like,
yeah,

1547
01:15:43,991 --> 01:15:47,170
but you're obsessed wIth fighting.
Most people,

1548
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:48,063
if you show them what's really going on 
there and contextualize the fact that 

1549
01:15:50,891 --> 01:15:51,724
these two human beings who have 
dedicated their life and taking all of 

1550
01:15:54,191 --> 01:15:55,024
the knowledge in human history to put on
the line in this moment of of severe 

1551
01:15:59,081 --> 01:15:59,914
intensity and consequence,
you won't care as much about whether 

1552
01:16:02,711 --> 01:16:05,650
somebody has an interim title.
You won't know

1553
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:10,140
and it won't and you won't,
but the average joe blow by a paper view

1554
01:16:10,141 --> 01:16:12,750
once a year is going to care.
Maybe.

1555
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:16,140
I mean that's the idea behind stripping 
tony ferguson.

1556
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,070
Yeah,
I mean,

1557
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:17,913
why?
Why,

1558
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,140
why,
why takeaways?

1559
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,940
Interim title,
let them keep the interim title.

1560
01:16:20,941 --> 01:16:23,200
If you want to strip connor,
just strip connor,

1561
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:26,220
strip connor and then tony's obviously 
going to go through surgery.

1562
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,290
tony didn't do anything wrong.
He fell and hurt himself,

1563
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:32,420
but I think at the root of it is the 
filicides isn't incorrect.

1564
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,100
Philosophical belief.
So when I,

1565
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,353
if I talk to people at the ufc and I 
talked to them periodically and I'll 

1566
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:43,010
discuss somethinG with them about,
you know,

1567
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:45,050
and it's generally at different times 
been like,

1568
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,943
hey man,
you can see the work that i'M doing and 

1569
01:16:47,631 --> 01:16:50,810
you can see people like it.
Could I contribute something x or y?

1570
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,570
And then I'll mention,
you know,

1571
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,340
they will then say,
well,

1572
01:16:55,341 --> 01:16:56,174
you know,
you've got like a really unique way of 

1573
01:16:58,581 --> 01:16:59,414
approaching it.
We think we got so many casual fans 

1574
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:05,230
watching on,
on fox or on these tv stations.

1575
01:17:05,231 --> 01:17:08,270
So it's just such a casual audience and 
I think about it,

1576
01:17:08,271 --> 01:17:09,104
it's like nobody questions at the.
The percentage of people that are a 

1577
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:16,550
casual fan that is watching anything is 
very close to zero,

1578
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,953
very close to zero because the casual,
the not actively choosing what to watch 

1579
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:24,643
is being on a netflix search or is 
someboDy put something on and I go in 

1580
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:30,890
and see what the rock is cooking in this
kitchen.

1581
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:31,983
You Said,
what's your dog's name and the gold dog 

1582
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:34,363
marshall.
I go see what fucking joe is feeding 

1583
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:37,880
marshall.
Nobody's watching something.

1584
01:17:37,881 --> 01:17:40,820
They're not interested in ever in our 
society.

1585
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:41,743
We are all conscious constantly and 
consciously choosing what we consume at 

1586
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:47,774
all times and if we're sitting there 
with our boyfriend or girlfriend or 

1587
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:52,790
husband or wife and they're watching it 
were somewhere else,

1588
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:57,970
by feeding this nonexistent casual 
audience and really believing they exist

1589
01:17:58,071 --> 01:18:00,530
despite all the evidence that there is 
no such thing,

1590
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:05,760
you are now giving less importance to 
the your actual audience who is ready to

1591
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:09,140
go deeper,
ready to see something more meaningful,

1592
01:18:09,141 --> 01:18:09,974
ready to be brought somewhere different.
There was no casual audience of almost 

1593
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:14,990
anything in our modern world.

1594
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:16,663
I like what you're saying,
but I disagree because people are 

1595
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,650
watching and they don't know what the 
fuck they're watching.

1596
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,090
I've done it with people.
I've,

1597
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,953
I've unfortunately watch fights over 
friends houses before because they 

1598
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:29,060
happened to be there and then,
you know,

1599
01:18:29,061 --> 01:18:31,640
there'll be people sitting around 
watching a why doesn't he just do this?

1600
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:35,360
But they still chose to watch it.
They still may pay attention.

1601
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:36,223
Yeah.
But they made that choice barely paying 

1602
01:18:37,851 --> 01:18:39,670
attention and they don't know what the 
fuck they're watching.

1603
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:43,560
So a guy like you comes in talking about
artistry and all this.

1604
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:47,060
They,
I think you are great.

1605
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:47,923
I love your approach,
but I think your approach in their eyes 

1606
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:51,283
is a little bit too esoteric and complex
and maybe it'd be balanced out better 

1607
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:57,240
with someone like me.
Yeah.

1608
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,483
Yes.

1609
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,850
One hundred percent.
And as a result,

1610
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,700
we're not over,
especially the last sort of year or so,

1611
01:19:04,701 --> 01:19:06,450
I've looked at it like,
you know,

1612
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:07,573
trying to force something like I'm not,
I'm not sort of happily saying that I 

1613
01:19:13,161 --> 01:19:13,994
would be,
I would be in a relationship with you 

1614
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:16,484
and accept what you are.
I'm saying I think we should be in a 

1615
01:19:18,741 --> 01:19:22,190
relationship only I want to change you.
And that's not right.

1616
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:22,920
That's right.
Yes.

1617
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:23,753
I'm,
I'm literally saying I'm not saying put 

1618
01:19:26,121 --> 01:19:28,640
a role here.
Tell me what that role you need and I'll

1619
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:31,490
do it.
I'm actually saying I think it should be

1620
01:19:31,491 --> 01:19:33,410
different and that's why it's not a good
fit.

1621
01:19:33,411 --> 01:19:34,244
And that's why I say a one championship 
is a more logical fit for me because 

1622
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:41,660
it's younger and it's in its evolution,
but still growing.

1623
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:42,913
I think I agree with you,
but I think it goes back to the money 

1624
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,363
because I think there's so much money 
involved in the use that they have to 

1625
01:19:48,771 --> 01:19:50,360
make money every month.
I mean it's,

1626
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:53,570
they're in a tricky situation.
It's like,

1627
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:54,803
like if you're a guy and you make 500 
bucks a week and you really liked this 

1628
01:19:58,611 --> 01:19:59,421
car,
god damn.

1629
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:00,940
The core of it is so nice.
I really like it.

1630
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:01,850
Well,
how much is the lease?

1631
01:20:01,851 --> 01:20:05,060
The lease is a thousand dollars a month,
but you only make $2,000

1632
01:20:05,061 --> 01:20:05,900
a month.
Are you going to do that?

1633
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:08,040
Well,
if I only pay 500 bucks a month in rent,

1634
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:12,420
I can kind of pull it off key.
I guess you can,

1635
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:16,410
but you got to watch every penny and you
got to be cautious and I think you could

1636
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:17,244
put yourself in these traps and then you
have to like really micromanage 

1637
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:20,910
everything you do.

1638
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,470
Like we've got to make money but we've 
got to make money,

1639
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,423
but we got to make money instead of we 
got to do what we like and put together 

1640
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:32,470
what we like and do the best possible 
version of what we like.

1641
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:35,760
Like a perfect example is like this 
podcast.

1642
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,940
I don't have a boss.
There's no overhead.

1643
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,520
I don't have.
I mean I have a couple of employees.

1644
01:20:41,521 --> 01:20:43,740
It's very easy.
There's no worries.

1645
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:48,860
So I don't give a fuck if I have you on 
to talk about stuff or a sleep expert or

1646
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,870
I'm not going to have anybody on that.
I don't.

1647
01:20:51,871 --> 01:20:54,120
I'm not interested in talking to 
because.

1648
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,070
And I'll talk about whatever the fuck I 
want to.

1649
01:20:56,071 --> 01:20:57,090
I don't.
I don't think,

1650
01:20:57,091 --> 01:20:57,810
god,
no.

1651
01:20:57,810 --> 01:20:59,580
I don't know if people are going to be 
interest in this.

1652
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:02,730
I need that advertising money.
I need to say if you.

1653
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:04,103
Because of that.
I think it's one of the reasons why the 

1654
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:09,630
show has been successful because it 
honestly represents my thinking.

1655
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:10,703
It's like I'm allowed to pursue my 
interests and have these conversations 

1656
01:21:14,821 --> 01:21:16,260
and,
and let it be pure.

1657
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:19,110
I think if the ufc took that exact 
approach,

1658
01:21:19,111 --> 01:21:22,170
I think the product would be better.
And I think if they had some,

1659
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:26,490
like you breaking down the artistry of 
specific techniques,

1660
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:31,940
the air quote casual fan would be more 
educated and they would learn more about

1661
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:32,990
it.
I mean,

1662
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:33,823
and you get some of that from dominick 
cruz when he does his breakdowns on fox 

1663
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,320
and some of the other fighters who do 
breakdowns.

1664
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:42,660
And when daniel cormier does wrestling 
breakdowns,

1665
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:46,620
breakdowns,
specific techniques of whY they work and

1666
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:48,690
why they don't work and what someone's 
doing right or wrong,

1667
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:50,610
you get educated,
you know,

1668
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:53,450
and I tried to do the best I can to when
it comes to the ground and particularly,

1669
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:54,284
which is where I think is the most 
confusing aspect of mma for the casual 

1670
01:21:57,001 --> 01:21:58,110
fan.
BuT,

1671
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:00,830
um,
I think we should approach the,

1672
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:03,610
the entire sport in the,
the,

1673
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:04,483
the most illuminating way possible.
And I think a guy like you and your 

1674
01:22:08,911 --> 01:22:11,790
approach is very valuable.
And I love your breakdowns.

1675
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:13,170
Thanks man.
I'm a big fan of them,

1676
01:22:13,171 --> 01:22:18,090
so I retweet them all the time.
I just think that you have a very unique

1677
01:22:18,091 --> 01:22:21,750
and passionate and it is not just a 
passionate approach,

1678
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:23,490
but it's genuine.
My guy.

1679
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:24,324
No you,
I've talked to you when the cameras are 

1680
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:28,410
not on and you are just as interested in
this.

1681
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:32,070
I really am.
And I think we're just going through.

1682
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:32,881
Thank you.
By the way,

1683
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:33,714
man.
I think we're going through whatever 

1684
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:36,924
you're doing,
if you're trying to seek some kind of 

1685
01:22:37,921 --> 01:22:40,860
mastery and if you realize you're really
early in it,

1686
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:43,500
you can do it by studying yoga.
Some people do,

1687
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:45,040
some people do it,
they they are in,

1688
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,953
they go to church twice a week.
You're just looking to try to grow and 

1689
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:50,583
if you do it with something that you're 
deeply fascinated and eventually you 

1690
01:22:53,461 --> 01:22:55,860
kind of learn about connections and all 
things,

1691
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:56,783
you know,
it's the study of martial arts or the 

1692
01:22:57,631 --> 01:22:58,464
study of yoga or the study of jazz or 
whatever teaches you about connections 

1693
01:23:02,431 --> 01:23:07,390
and all things and my life is so good 
and these little moments where I'm like,

1694
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,430
I don't know why these guys,
I don't work for them.

1695
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,960
That doesn't make any sense.

1696
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:11,823
It doesn't make any sense for me to 
think that because I get up in the 

1697
01:23:14,171 --> 01:23:17,440
morning and I sit in my.
I make my wife and I coffee and I sit in

1698
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:20,500
my kitchen and I fucking analyze 
fighting.

1699
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:24,940
I sit down and I look at it and I look 
for moments and I look for things.

1700
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:25,774
I think people will find fascinating.
I look for things that will teach us 

1701
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:29,044
something about life and I look for 
these and I make them then what I make 

1702
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:32,674
and people seem to like them and then 
that gets me jobs commentating where I 

1703
01:23:35,561 --> 01:23:36,394
fly off and I get to.
I mean I got it so fucking good to try 

1704
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:44,371
to square peg my way into a large 
corporation because years back I dreamed

1705
01:23:45,671 --> 01:23:48,370
about working there.
Sometimes you change your dream.

1706
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,420
Sometimes it's okay to change your route
and find the world changes.

1707
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:53,254
Constantly

1708
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:56,060
be afraid to be flexible and you know,
the,

1709
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:56,943
the idea of holding onto a dream for 
your entire life despite your interest 

1710
01:24:00,871 --> 01:24:02,330
is pretty ridiculous.
Yeah.

1711
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,650
I mean There's things that I wanted to 
do when I was young,

1712
01:24:04,651 --> 01:24:06,330
but I don't want to do anymore.
It doesn't,

1713
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,970
you know,
you should follow your interest period.

1714
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,690
If they change,
you're changing as you change and grow.

1715
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:13,853
I mean these,
like I talked about my waning love or 

1716
01:24:17,191 --> 01:24:20,220
talk one doe when I realized that it 
wasn't really the right way to go.

1717
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,313
When I first started doing it,
I thought it was the most effective 

1718
01:24:22,921 --> 01:24:24,900
martial art.
Once I realized it wasn't.

1719
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:28,350
I lost interest.
I lost interest in competing in it.

1720
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,273
I just.
It didn't seem like the thing to do 

1721
01:24:30,511 --> 01:24:34,620
anymore and I think that as you grow as 
a human being,

1722
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:37,380
you're in.
You should have oTher interests.

1723
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:38,543
I mean,
and I think the ones that are the most 

1724
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:43,710
intriguing in the most passionate or 
you're the,

1725
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:44,544
you're the most passionate of theirs,
they're going to give you the most 

1726
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:47,664
reward that if you pursue them,
if you're more passionate about music 

1727
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:51,923
than you are about accounting,
but you decide to stick with accounting 

1728
01:24:54,481 --> 01:24:56,460
because it's what's paying your bills 
and like,

1729
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:57,910
man,
that's a dark road.

1730
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,050
That's a soul sucking road.
You're going to go,

1731
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:02,830
damn.
It feels scary in.

1732
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,690
For somebody in that setting to change.
Just in the short run,

1733
01:25:06,691 --> 01:25:07,524
it will be painful,
but in the long run it will be so 

1734
01:25:09,211 --> 01:25:13,770
valuable and less painful.
Twenty years have way less.

1735
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:17,520
PaIn is such a great trade for two years
of pain,

1736
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:18,453
but if you're that guy with that 
corvette that you've got that lease on 

1737
01:25:20,801 --> 01:25:22,810
and you could barely fucking make those 
payments,

1738
01:25:22,811 --> 01:25:27,490
you can not take any chances.
You have to just work those extra hours.

1739
01:25:27,491 --> 01:25:28,324
Well,
if I just put in two hours of overtime 

1740
01:25:29,561 --> 01:25:30,394
every day,
that's still only 10 hours of work a 

1741
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:32,524
day,
but that was two hours at 20 bucks an 

1742
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,130
hour and a little out and start doing 
those calculations.

1743
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,590
And that's how you,
that's how you get fucked and that's how

1744
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:40,180
you get trapped.
And next thIng you know,

1745
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,014
you've got a family and you've got kids 
and you definitely can't move and you 

1746
01:25:43,551 --> 01:25:46,210
got a mortgage and you definitely ain't 
pursued any music dreams.

1747
01:25:46,211 --> 01:25:47,460
Now motherfucker,
it's true.

1748
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:49,840
and this is,
this is the trap that life leads.

1749
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:50,933
Yeah.
You know,

1750
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:52,590
um,
I watched.

1751
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:55,500
So I do a one man show now.
So I belt with a friend.

1752
01:25:55,501 --> 01:25:58,590
I built a one man show.
It's like a theater setting,

1753
01:25:58,591 --> 01:25:59,311
right?
Like,

1754
01:25:59,311 --> 01:26:00,420
it's like,
how do you do that?

1755
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:03,090
Do you use video for now?
It is for,

1756
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:07,580
we put it for punchdrunk ted talks,
right?

1757
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:12,560
So it's four story driven parts of life 
that uh,

1758
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:13,603
take you on a bit of an in theory and in
practice so far people seem to be 

1759
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:21,860
inspired or find it compelling and 
people have cried out of before,

1760
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:24,620
which was really quite moving.
But I people just go to a dog day.

1761
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,570
They may be shut,
especially.

1762
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:27,404
Yeah.
Um,

1763
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:28,483
but,
uh,

1764
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:30,110
I,
I did it with,

1765
01:26:30,111 --> 01:26:30,944
so I decided I wanted to do that.
I decided I want to get up and tell 

1766
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:37,580
stories and hopefully a fun and 
entertain people,

1767
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,730
find them and inspire them or take them 
somewhere.

1768
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:46,270
And I did it partly I watched your show 
and then I would have never in a million

1769
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:47,234
years.
So when I saw you in vegas would never 

1770
01:26:48,141 --> 01:26:48,974
in a million years thought I could do 
that because it's clearly a lifetime of 

1771
01:26:51,471 --> 01:26:52,304
training and development and improvement
and trial and error and thousands and 

1772
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:57,163
thousands of repetitions.
And you look at that and you don't look 

1773
01:26:59,091 --> 01:27:01,910
at an olympic gymnast and say,
I can do that.

1774
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:03,740
And that's kind of.
So I didn't think of it at all,

1775
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:04,873
but then I saw brendan do his show and 
it was awesome and I realized he only 

1776
01:27:08,781 --> 01:27:11,000
started working on this two years ago,
you know what I mean?

1777
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:14,210
And all he represents is hard,
hard work,

1778
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,770
sacrifice and drive to learn.
And that's possible.

1779
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:19,663
Yeah.
Which shop is doing is what I said to 

1780
01:27:21,471 --> 01:27:22,304
him as you are essentially using an 
athlete's work ethic and applying it to 

1781
01:27:26,601 --> 01:27:28,780
an art form.
And that's what's awesome about it.

1782
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:33,020
He's a funny guy who realized like,
I can do standup,

1783
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,410
I just need to put the time in and you 
know,

1784
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:39,250
I've seen that guy kill kill and he's 
been doing comedy for like two years,

1785
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,360
you know,
that

1786
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:42,070
is inspiring.
That should,

1787
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:43,383
you should be aware when you see that,
that that means something you work on 

1788
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:49,350
for only a couple of years as possible 
if you're driven and smart and,

1789
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,670
and really committed.
And that's what I took out of his shell.

1790
01:27:51,671 --> 01:27:55,110
Plus he explained to me the process.
So I decided I'm doing it right.

1791
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:55,983
So I booked about five months ahead in 
winnipeg because there was a ufc in 

1792
01:27:58,961 --> 01:28:01,930
winnipeg and that's my hometown to do a 
small theater and I'm like,

1793
01:28:01,931 --> 01:28:02,890
okay,
five months.

1794
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:04,720
And I'm like,
what the fuck do I do?

1795
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:07,080
So I called up a good friend of mine,
greg,

1796
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,250
when you booked a,
you have a show.

1797
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:12,350
I didn't have the shell.
Maybe force yourself.

1798
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:13,720
Yeah.
So.

1799
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:14,573
And I cut but I had one plan that was 
going to call it my friend graham 

1800
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:17,963
isadore who is a playwright and I'm a 
writer for vice and a bunch of other 

1801
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:24,130
stuff and uh,
and very smart and interesting and we're

1802
01:28:24,131 --> 01:28:26,320
good friends but we have very different 
perspectives.

1803
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,570
And I said I booked this show.
It's in six months.

1804
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,410
I need 40 minutes.
It's got to be.

1805
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:31,703
And he's,
he has told some of my stories and vice 

1806
01:28:33,431 --> 01:28:36,820
before getting drunk with sumo wrestlers
and different,

1807
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:38,800
different stories.
And how much do you weigh?

1808
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:40,463
About 1:56.
And you got drunk with sumo risks was 

1809
01:28:42,941 --> 01:28:45,110
scary.
It was really like,

1810
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:47,630
it was joyous.
It was.

1811
01:28:47,710 --> 01:28:50,980
You've never seen anything like that 
became big though.

1812
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:51,581
Yeah.
Oh,

1813
01:28:51,581 --> 01:28:53,200
you should see it.
So byamba,

1814
01:28:53,380 --> 01:28:54,820
do you know who byamba is?
He's like,

1815
01:28:54,821 --> 01:28:57,790
okay,
so if you ever see us sumal on tv that's

1816
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:58,624
beyond.
So he's the guy like in the geico 

1817
01:29:00,371 --> 01:29:01,204
commercial dot being a figure skater,
tiger woods of sumo wrestling and he is 

1818
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:07,020
a genius.
He's a world champion,

1819
01:29:07,021 --> 01:29:07,854
but he's also an entertainer.
So he lives in hollywood and he was 

1820
01:29:10,701 --> 01:29:12,210
very,
very loose here.

1821
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:13,020
Yeah,
yeah.

1822
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,880
He Is a sumo wrestler.
Yeah,

1823
01:29:14,881 --> 01:29:16,110
there he is.
Yeah,

1824
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,393
he is from Mongolia.
But he spends a great deal of time here 

1825
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:24,450
working as a television personality and 
an actor and whatever,

1826
01:29:24,451 --> 01:29:26,470
but he still just look fat.
Oh,

1827
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,313
he's got it looks jacked.
Like go to that one where he's doing 

1828
01:29:28,891 --> 01:29:31,020
that.
Muscle pows that are there.

1829
01:29:31,021 --> 01:29:31,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

1830
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,680
So that's like those shoulder muscles 
through all that fat.

1831
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,190
That guy looks like a tank.
Well,

1832
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,073
people don't realize,
but underneath there is like you or 

1833
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:42,150
underneath eris like tj dillashaw.
You know what I mean?

1834
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:42,984
There is a muscular person underneath 
all those additional layers of fat and 

1835
01:29:46,761 --> 01:29:48,230
flush and skin.
There was,

1836
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:52,200
there's a powerful athlete,
a real benefit and being that fat,

1837
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:53,580
uh,
yeah,

1838
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:56,400
force,
power generation like momentum,

1839
01:29:56,401 --> 01:29:57,234
the ability,
I mean if the other guy is that big and 

1840
01:29:59,581 --> 01:30:03,270
our goal is just to smash into each 
other until one of us has taken from the

1841
01:30:03,271 --> 01:30:05,040
platform,
you're not that big,

1842
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,600
it's going to be very difficult.

1843
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:07,623
Right.
So it's like An arms race of size over 

1844
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:10,704
generations where they just got bigger 
and bigger out of necessity because if 

1845
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,430
you're a bigger,
I mean,

1846
01:30:14,431 --> 01:30:15,830
what am I going to do?
A,

1847
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,660
we could,
in theory,

1848
01:30:18,661 --> 01:30:20,940
maybe I could use your size against 
your.

1849
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:24,500
I could use technique and strategy and 
smarts to,

1850
01:30:24,570 --> 01:30:28,010
to take you off,
but I could be big and also to that.

1851
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:28,920
Right?
Right.

1852
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:29,753
So why not v also big.
So it good arms raced to that point and 

1853
01:30:33,391 --> 01:30:37,780
there are little guys but uh,
but to watch this guy that's with them,

1854
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,070
I think he was an impractical jokers.
But yeah,

1855
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:43,163
beyond that it's like he's the most 
famous sumo guy in the world and I got 

1856
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:49,080
wasted with him at the world combat 
games and st petersburg,

1857
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:51,390
Russia.
So I got to commentate it,

1858
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:52,403
right.
So I was in saint petersburg and I 

1859
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:55,763
absolutely love,
I found a niche where I get to 

1860
01:30:57,901 --> 01:31:00,420
commentate like real traditional martial
arts,

1861
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:01,254
a fair bit of done taekwondo and karate 
at the pan am games and I did the world 

1862
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:07,530
so much championships or the world 
combat games.

1863
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:11,070
I do the world championships which is 
kung fu and sanda.

1864
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,700
And so I've carved out this niche where 
I get called for these and,

1865
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:19,110
and develop expertise in these different
areas and get to experience them and see

1866
01:31:19,111 --> 01:31:21,330
the little details that change when you 
change something.

1867
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:26,070
And so I got to commentate sumo and then
after he seemed to like me and he's kind

1868
01:31:26,071 --> 01:31:31,071
of like you would drink,
it must suck that mad.

1869
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:36,140
Like a fizzy drink vodka while you were 
in Russia to Russia.

1870
01:31:36,391 --> 01:31:38,500
So I love Russia.
I do.

1871
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,650
I really do.
I love the russians.

1872
01:31:40,651 --> 01:31:41,484
I love that.
Our view of combat and of artists 

1873
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:47,970
martial arts and stuff,
they're very straight.

1874
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,833
Like you know when you negotiate to 
commentate or to do some work that just 

1875
01:31:51,691 --> 01:31:53,580
straight,
this is what we can pay you.

1876
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,220
This is what we expect of you.
If you do that,

1877
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:58,540
we're all going to be happy.
Like it's very sinister story.

1878
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:59,410
Little bullshit.

1879
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:04,270
Frank mir does commentary for them over 
there and he's very good.

1880
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:07,060
Frank mir,
I would hope that someone would hire him

1881
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:07,894
in America.

1882
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:08,903
They can't afford them because I was 
getting paid way too well in Russia in 

1883
01:32:12,091 --> 01:32:12,841
Russia.
Really?

1884
01:32:12,841 --> 01:32:13,674
No kidding.
You had for him and he said that's why 

1885
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:18,230
he couldn't do a deal with bella toi 
know and,

1886
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,313
and his deal with acb who he loves and 
respects and it's become sort of 

1887
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:23,090
partners in there with,
uh,

1888
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:25,470
with mr haas,
who runs it,

1889
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:29,580
where frank is now a part partner of the
presentation of it,

1890
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:31,770
went for american shows.
He'll be part,

1891
01:32:31,771 --> 01:32:32,604
he'll be part promoter and I think Frank
May even get away from some of the 

1892
01:32:36,151 --> 01:32:38,130
commentary as much as he's good at it 
and loves it.

1893
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:41,250
I thiNk he's interested in some of the 
other aspects of it now,

1894
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,500
you know.
But uh,

1895
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:45,240
yeah,
they pay very well.

1896
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,760
They and they pay the athletes very,
very well.

1897
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:51,930
You can be a guy that had a couple of 
ufc fIghts or a belt or fighter to.

1898
01:32:51,931 --> 01:32:52,764
They'll give you 60,000
us cash in your hand in an envelope at 

1899
01:32:55,561 --> 01:32:56,394
the end of it,
you know?

1900
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,230
Interesting.
Yeah,

1901
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:58,220
that's great.
Well,

1902
01:32:58,221 --> 01:33:00,230
it's always great that fighters have 
more options,

1903
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:01,253
you know,
and I know bella tour has become a 

1904
01:33:03,051 --> 01:33:05,150
viable option to a lot of fighters,
you know,

1905
01:33:05,151 --> 01:33:08,480
like guys like ryan bader making good 
money over there now and,

1906
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:09,573
and you know,
Roy Mcdonald obviously who's their 

1907
01:33:11,121 --> 01:33:13,100
champion now.
I just think,

1908
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:14,570
uh,
we need more of those.

1909
01:33:14,571 --> 01:33:15,404
You know,
I,

1910
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:18,380
I know that oscar de la hoya is getting 
into the mix now,

1911
01:33:18,381 --> 01:33:23,240
but just the approach that he's making 
seems to me to be ridiculous

1912
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,160
old school,
promote us approach,

1913
01:33:25,161 --> 01:33:29,690
get some big name and then invest all 
your time in that big fight.

1914
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,553
But It's,
that's the same thing you were just 

1915
01:33:31,821 --> 01:33:32,654
talking about the ufc.
The challenge they face now is that we 

1916
01:33:35,031 --> 01:33:36,770
need another big one.
We need another big one.

1917
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:39,130
It just seems like that,

1918
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:40,790
that approach.
Like we just,

1919
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:41,631
we know,
okay,

1920
01:33:41,631 --> 01:33:44,360
if this wasn't the upper,
would this be the ideal approach?

1921
01:33:44,530 --> 01:33:46,220
No,
it's never the ideal approach.

1922
01:33:46,221 --> 01:33:48,350
The ideal approach is to do the best 
fights possible.

1923
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:49,543
The ideal approach is not necessarily to
make the most money or to have the like 

1924
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:56,560
the most spectacular.
Like,

1925
01:33:56,810 --> 01:34:01,810
like when they were really promoting 
ronda rousey and the rematch with or the

1926
01:34:01,851 --> 01:34:04,400
fight with Amanda Nunez and didn't 
promote nunez at all.

1927
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,840
I was,
I,

1928
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:06,981
you know,
I was like,

1929
01:34:06,981 --> 01:34:10,020
this is a huge ronda rousey fan.
Everybody knows that too.

1930
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,270
Um,
I think she's a,

1931
01:34:11,630 --> 01:34:14,240
she's a legend.
I mean what she did for women's mma,

1932
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:15,343
she essentially was the reason why the 
ufc decided to have women's mma was one 

1933
01:34:19,971 --> 01:34:20,300
woman

1934
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:22,910
that woman fighting now I was here that 
day.

1935
01:34:23,070 --> 01:34:25,980
It just passed her By and it happened so
quick.

1936
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:27,593
But Amanda Nunez,
I was thinking even before holly holm 

1937
01:34:31,741 --> 01:34:33,750
beater,
Amanda Nunez was the big threat.

1938
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,823
I'm like,
that girl could knock you fucking dead 

1939
01:34:36,451 --> 01:34:40,230
with one punch.
She is such a ruthless striker and she's

1940
01:34:40,231 --> 01:34:41,940
a brazilian jujitsu black belt.
I'm like,

1941
01:34:41,941 --> 01:34:44,670
this is a terrible matchup for rhonda.
I thought,

1942
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,200
yeah,
because rhonda is hands,

1943
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:47,870
although good,
you know,

1944
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:48,773
and getting better and you know,
really we're starting to look like a 

1945
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:51,684
polished striker still doesn't have 
nearly the kind of power that nunez has 

1946
01:34:56,370 --> 01:35:01,370
and the that I could nunez nunez is,
she can take it as well as receive it.

1947
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,273
We had just seen rhonda sort of have 
these bullets moments with like betco 

1948
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:07,140
hey,
uh,

1949
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:10,280
you know,
kind of cerebral manner than bricks just

1950
01:35:10,281 --> 01:35:11,114
smashed through.
But when You see the overall game like 

1951
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,840
versus holly holm,
then you got to see all this.

1952
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:18,013
There's a lot oF limitations here and 
trying to smash through the bricks if 

1953
01:35:19,971 --> 01:35:22,040
the bricks aren't there and the bricks 
head kick,

1954
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:23,210
you know what I mean?
There's,

1955
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,073
there's a lot going on there.
So we're seeing the laYers upon layers 

1956
01:35:26,991 --> 01:35:27,824
upon layers.
So what happens after you get to the 

1957
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:31,550
first layer?
Oh well you don't have a second layer.

1958
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:33,150
Your,
this is your layer,

1959
01:35:33,151 --> 01:35:35,030
your layers straightforward.
Move ahead.

1960
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,700
And you know,
coaching is to blame as well.

1961
01:35:37,870 --> 01:35:38,703
There's a lot of things there,
but the fact that they weren't even 

1962
01:35:41,121 --> 01:35:41,954
promoting Amanda Nunez,
you have the very first ever openly gay 

1963
01:35:45,741 --> 01:35:47,220
women's mma champion.
Okay.

1964
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:50,320
There's Interesting aspects and she's

1965
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,333
fun girl.
She's interesting and she's a fucking 

1966
01:35:54,551 --> 01:35:56,650
killer man.
She's a fucking killer,

1967
01:35:56,651 --> 01:35:57,484
and they showed it in that fight.
They had an opportunity to make Another 

1968
01:35:59,591 --> 01:36:00,424
star instead.
They didn't make this other star and 

1969
01:36:03,101 --> 01:36:04,990
then you look at her most recent paper 
view.

1970
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:07,080
I heard the numberS were abysmal.
Bailey,

1971
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:07,983
I heard see if you could find out what 
the numbers were because someone told 

1972
01:36:10,571 --> 01:36:11,404
me,
I think it was shop told me there were 

1973
01:36:12,281 --> 01:36:13,550
85,000.

1974
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:16,530
That's great.
You should be,

1975
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:17,653
but at this point you have to stop and 
wonder is there anything we could do 

1976
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:22,523
strategically different like just 
because something worked all the way 

1977
01:36:25,771 --> 01:36:28,230
along in any business or in anything 
you're doing,

1978
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:29,243
there might be a time to take a slightly
different approach or to change one of 

1979
01:36:32,731 --> 01:36:35,430
the fundamental beliefs of how we do 
business or something.

1980
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:37,770
You know what I mean?
what you can't do is just go,

1981
01:36:37,771 --> 01:36:39,150
well,
hopefully the next one will be good.

1982
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:40,013
I mean you watch that happen all the 
time to some massive change in your 

1983
01:36:42,901 --> 01:36:47,901
business or in life and that change at 
first.

1984
01:36:48,861 --> 01:36:50,770
People deny that it's there,
right?

1985
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:51,643
They deny and then they say it's a niche
and then they say it's a blip and then 

1986
01:36:54,021 --> 01:36:54,854
by the time that it's actually in the 
heat of something scary or challenging 

1987
01:36:58,701 --> 01:36:59,534
happening,
you've wasted two or three years that 

1988
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,090
you could have used adapting to

1989
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,300
ready for it.
You know what I mean?

1990
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,280
No,
I do know what you mean.

1991
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:06,331
Yeah.
I mean,

1992
01:37:06,331 --> 01:37:07,164
I think that what you gotta do when you 
have a champion that has spectacular 

1993
01:37:11,941 --> 01:37:12,774
results like Amanda Nunez,
you've got to hype the shit up or 

1994
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:16,350
invest,
invest,

1995
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:19,680
hype the shit out of her and that would 
have made the ronda rousey fight.

1996
01:37:19,681 --> 01:37:23,250
I think even bigger if you show her 
smashing misha tate,

1997
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,480
you show her,
you know,

1998
01:37:24,481 --> 01:37:27,480
smashing Sarah Mcmahon.
You show what she's capable of.

1999
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:28,650
She's a fucking gun

2000
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,750
for sure.
For sure.

2001
01:37:29,751 --> 01:37:30,584
I know you talked to Mike Brown or 
anyone there who's been around the 

2002
01:37:33,410 --> 01:37:34,243
greats and they talk about it,
but this level now where they are the 

2003
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:39,463
brilliance of where what we've seen,
it's another example if you think that 

2004
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:47,870
all only fighting to stand up when 
you're in guard is right or only keeping

2005
01:37:47,871 --> 01:37:50,110
somebody down is the game and the only 
thing you have to worry about us,

2006
01:37:50,111 --> 01:37:51,500
they'll stand up.
They'll submit you.

2007
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:56,630
Like as soon as you don't recognize 
where you are in the change of the river

2008
01:37:56,791 --> 01:37:57,624
of life and time,
you sometimes get fucked up and and you 

2009
01:38:01,771 --> 01:38:03,000
know it's a.
It's a fascinating thing.

2010
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:06,720
I know I literally was just in Singapore
and I just spent days with this company,

2011
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:12,050
but they see the world differently.
They're strategy is simply.

2012
01:38:12,330 --> 01:38:13,163
There are.
They're a values based company that 

2013
01:38:15,241 --> 01:38:16,074
believes in the values of these things 
and tries to to show people and share 

2014
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:24,000
martial artists reef for the greater 
good and it's not some business.

2015
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:24,893
It's what they truly believe.
They truly are going about making 

2016
01:38:28,621 --> 01:38:30,450
choices.
And when chattery says,

2017
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,480
I would not hire conor mcgregor because 
he represents,

2018
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:37,140
he's dead,
fucking serious people see represent his

2019
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:39,990
ideas,
his and what he sees.

2020
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:42,450
And I shouldn't speak for him at all.
He's a brilliant man,

2021
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:43,291
by the way,
this guy,

2022
01:38:43,291 --> 01:38:46,230
he's a,
he was a homeless kid with,

2023
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:47,223
with a single parent that later became 
educated and then move to America and 

2024
01:38:50,851 --> 01:38:51,684
went to harvard and then started 
managing a corporate funds and became a 

2025
01:38:55,381 --> 01:38:57,930
moitai champion.
And this is all easily documented.

2026
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:03,500
This is who that individual is.
And he's lived that life based on honor,

2027
01:39:04,321 --> 01:39:06,250
respect,
you know,

2028
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:08,340
um,
teamwork excellence,

2029
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:11,280
that mind,
that is what built that company.

2030
01:39:11,281 --> 01:39:14,630
And one is a billion dollar company now 
it's a billion dollar company.

2031
01:39:14,631 --> 01:39:16,980
It's in one point 7 billion homes in 
asia.

2032
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:18,143
This isn't some mythological idea.
This is a guy who's built a massive 

2033
01:39:21,691 --> 01:39:23,790
company based around these values.

2034
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:25,830
And that's a different thing.
He's.

2035
01:39:25,831 --> 01:39:27,240
But what does he say about common?
Oh,

2036
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:28,163
sorry,
yeah,

2037
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,270
I go off on this.
No,

2038
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:30,210
it's cool.
Uh,

2039
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:34,890
so he looks at it as the things that he 
says and the way that,

2040
01:39:34,891 --> 01:39:36,150
and again,
I shouldn't speak for him,

2041
01:39:36,151 --> 01:39:37,590
this was the,
what I've gathered,

2042
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:38,813
throwing things and creating conflict 
and controversy as your currency is not 

2043
01:39:42,991 --> 01:39:45,150
something to be proud of.
It's an interesting way of putting it as

2044
01:39:45,151 --> 01:39:47,220
your currency.
Yeah,

2045
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:48,450
I get it.
You know,

2046
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:52,500
and that sounds because,
and I'm not quite all that although I've

2047
01:39:52,501 --> 01:39:53,334
drank the koolaid,
I believe in what they're doing and I 

2048
01:39:54,691 --> 01:39:55,524
see it as real,
not only because my values line up with 

2049
01:39:57,781 --> 01:39:58,614
it,
but I think they are going to grow 

2050
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:01,530
dramatically as a result of some of 
these,

2051
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,960
the way they see the world,
but not only that,

2052
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:08,100
but I'm still also immersed here and I 
like connor,

2053
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:10,050
I think of connor.

2054
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:11,183
I work for tsn because connor fell out 
of a march to a red carpet to shake my 

2055
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:17,070
hand while the,
my boss was watching.

2056
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:18,960
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

2057
01:40:18,961 --> 01:40:19,794
Like the great.
Some of the most interesting moments 

2058
01:40:21,541 --> 01:40:24,150
I've had are with that guy and some of 
the most interesting,

2059
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:27,810
you know,
many dozens of hours of trying to figure

2060
01:40:27,811 --> 01:40:31,470
out what's happening in research and 
growth has happened by studying that guy

2061
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,633
and I see his games that he is willing 
to play as part of his strategy for 

2062
01:40:37,711 --> 01:40:38,544
success as a fighter and success trying 
to be successful for his family and his 

2063
01:40:43,321 --> 01:40:44,154
future.
I see it all connected so I don't 

2064
01:40:45,391 --> 01:40:47,310
dislike him.
But I respect this,

2065
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:52,410
this idea that conflict and controversy 
are not good for us.

2066
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:54,340
I understand that.
But I also understand

2067
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:55,193
psychological warfare and I think the is
a master of that and that has a huge 

2068
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:59,020
factor in victory.
I mean,

2069
01:40:59,021 --> 01:41:01,690
this is something me and mo musashi use 
to his advantage.

2070
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:03,190
Um,
you know,

2071
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:05,340
when you read the book of five rings,
he,

2072
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:09,490
what connor's doing is fucking with 
people's heads to the point where they,

2073
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:13,600
he has space in their head and then 
conor goes into the cage,

2074
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:17,080
like loose as a goose,
relaxed and calm.

2075
01:41:17,260 --> 01:41:18,093
So he's letting you know,
I don't give a fuck about you but you 

2076
01:41:20,801 --> 01:41:23,500
give a fuck about me and I'm going to 
fuck you up right now.

2077
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:23,981
And you're like,
no,

2078
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:25,060
you're not.
You better not.

2079
01:41:25,061 --> 01:41:25,894
You can't.
I can't.

2080
01:41:26,050 --> 01:41:29,020
This is too much.
And josie all was the perfect example,

2081
01:41:29,021 --> 01:41:29,854
although was so out of composure a 
although charged at him would that just 

2082
01:41:34,331 --> 01:41:37,630
leaping left hook and just got fucking 
waylaid on the way in.

2083
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:39,850
And eddie alvarez,
The greatest game day performer,

2084
01:41:39,851 --> 01:41:42,340
one of the great game day performance 
we've ever seen.

2085
01:41:43,090 --> 01:41:43,923
and I talked to eddie.
Eddie is one of my favorites and I 

2086
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:51,490
admire and am inspired by eddie alvarez,
Michael Chandler tail,

2087
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:52,473
you know,
those two are like the same guy on last 

2088
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:56,620
year almost.
But eddie was like,

2089
01:41:56,770 --> 01:42:01,540
the plan was to wrestle a lot and stay 
at distance and barely at all.

2090
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:03,490
And I stayed at a distance almost the 
whole time.

2091
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:05,050
Barely wrestling.
Like he's just like,

2092
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:06,183
it was real like,
and I am by not accepting it was real 

2093
01:42:09,461 --> 01:42:11,890
coming in and suddenly find yourself in 
there and it's real.

2094
01:42:11,891 --> 01:42:13,510
And you feel different in your,
you know,

2095
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,353
your mind is working differently and 
your hormones are working differently 

2096
01:42:16,421 --> 01:42:18,790
and who you are in that moment is 
different and you're like,

2097
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:20,320
holy fuck,
it's real.

2098
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:21,183
Had I prepared for it to be real,
I could be in a different state right 

2099
01:42:23,921 --> 01:42:24,754
now,
but I denied that this was going to be 

2100
01:42:25,691 --> 01:42:27,010
real and now it's fucking real.

2101
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,630
Santa claus is real.
It's real.

2102
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:32,470
I also think he got clipped early on.
I think that's a factor.

2103
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:34,510
You know,
you get caught on the chin like that and

2104
01:42:34,511 --> 01:42:36,650
your legs give out real quick and your 
just.

2105
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:39,550
Your brain doesn't work right.
Your body doesn't work right anymore.

2106
01:42:39,551 --> 01:42:41,130
I think that's a factor,
the,

2107
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:41,983
the ability that connor has to land 
those sharp shots that come out of 

2108
01:42:45,941 --> 01:42:50,941
nowhere and blitz you and come at you so
fast and just drop those shots on you.

2109
01:42:51,101 --> 01:42:55,270
I mean his left hand is a fucking laser 
beam and planning it.

2110
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:58,210
That's what that is.
The definition of it.

2111
01:42:58,960 --> 01:42:59,793
He's so good at landing that shot and 
he's also good at landing a bunch of 

2112
01:43:02,911 --> 01:43:03,930
other shit too,
man.

2113
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:05,110
I mean,
he pick you apart.

2114
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:07,360
He's a,
he's a real dynamo.

2115
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,253
I just,
I hate to see things like what happened 

2116
01:43:11,231 --> 01:43:12,064
in New York and brooklyn and he threw 
the dolly at the bus and smashed the 

2117
01:43:14,741 --> 01:43:15,100
window.

2118
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,650
It's like,
so it's so fucking stupid.

2119
01:43:18,030 --> 01:43:18,863
All that thug is shit running in with a 
bunch of other guys and everyone's 

2120
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:24,490
screaming at will was what would,
it could be due.

2121
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:27,550
He smacked your friend in the face 
because your friend was talking shit.

2122
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:28,520
So you know,
I mean,

2123
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:30,670
and even the way smacked him was pretty 
gentle,

2124
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:32,083
you know what I mean?
And artem called hIm a coward and he 

2125
01:43:34,571 --> 01:43:35,760
said,
didn't he doesn't fight.

2126
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:37,360
Conor is a real fighter.
Is like,

2127
01:43:37,420 --> 01:43:39,310
listen man,
he's a russian.

2128
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:40,293
your a russian.
You guys got to sort this out on your 

2129
01:43:41,831 --> 01:43:42,664
own.
That is how they saw it was a pretty 

2130
01:43:44,621 --> 01:43:47,800
calm sorting out in my opinion.
They didn't stomp him,

2131
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:51,160
they didn't beat his ass.
But once we get to that point,

2132
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,160
I mean I get

2133
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:52,640
it.
Yeah,

2134
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,710
once you're doing something and I'm 
responding,

2135
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:55,544
which he responds.
That happens everyday in gangs and wars 

2136
01:43:57,891 --> 01:43:58,724
in northern Ireland and Ireland and all 
types of religions that's been going on 

2137
01:44:01,821 --> 01:44:03,710
forever.
Nobody ever wins.

2138
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:05,080
When that happens,
it just goes.

2139
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:05,983
It just perpetuates it and when you 
watch it and then there'll be a lot of 

2140
01:44:08,811 --> 01:44:09,644
people you see this scenario and like 
habib's fans or friends or supporters 

2141
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:16,140
and condos and they're Like,
he did this,

2142
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,980
he did this.
They're both wrong and nobody.

2143
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:20,143
Everybody always,
when soMebody does something bad to 

2144
01:44:21,921 --> 01:44:22,754
somebody else,
they almost always feel like something 

2145
01:44:23,901 --> 01:44:24,734
was done bad to them.
Very few people instigate that was 

2146
01:44:26,931 --> 01:44:27,764
perceived.
Something happened to perceive a slight 

2147
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:32,960
and you know,
some people you do one thing to them and

2148
01:44:32,961 --> 01:44:33,741
then they're like,
okay,

2149
01:44:33,741 --> 01:44:35,660
motherfucker,
now it's to eternity.

2150
01:44:37,330 --> 01:44:38,840
Well that doesn't make any sense either.

2151
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:40,700
You know,
you look like a fool,

2152
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:41,960
like,
you know,

2153
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:45,110
you just can't throw a dolly at a bus.
no.

2154
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:46,223
You know,
filled with other fighters because it's 

2155
01:44:47,571 --> 01:44:49,370
so selfish.
I mean,

2156
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:51,480
all those people that got caught,
you know,

2157
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,333
I mean ray bore got cuts in his eyes.
I mean this is the whole thing is a 

2158
01:44:55,881 --> 01:44:58,190
disaster.
So my theory,

2159
01:44:58,191 --> 01:45:00,980
based on bits of information that that 
we have,

2160
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:03,620
is that connor,
on some level,

2161
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:06,650
it really,
I mean it reinforces constantly.

2162
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:07,543
If your kid does something terrible that
we know is bad and you gave them candy 

2163
01:45:10,701 --> 01:45:14,270
every time they're going to give her 
candy,

2164
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:18,050
every time she does something that 
reward conn has been rewarded.

2165
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:19,670
He gets richer,
more famous,

2166
01:45:19,671 --> 01:45:21,350
more influential,
a belts,

2167
01:45:21,351 --> 01:45:26,060
and he's been given candy every time 
he's done this.

2168
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:26,953
And it works.
And I mean there is parallels in the 

2169
01:45:29,391 --> 01:45:30,860
political system in America.

2170
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:31,693
There's parallels all oVer the world 
that by acting out in these strange 

2171
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:35,084
ways,
it's so bizarre and unsettling that 

2172
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:38,360
we've rewarded,
you know,

2173
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:40,580
the name for a Band,
candy for bad behavior.

2174
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:42,970
Yeah,
that'd be fun.

2175
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,800
But that's what's happening.
Right?

2176
01:45:45,801 --> 01:45:46,634
And so now we take it and he's.
And then you add the strategy element 

2177
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,111
you're talking about,
right?

2178
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:52,910
So he's looking at it and it's like,
okay,

2179
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:56,270
a b would be a great fight.
I'd like to fight in Russia.

2180
01:45:56,271 --> 01:45:59,570
He likes challenges is just hard,
but let's do it now.

2181
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:03,160
If I create some viral controversy,
which I did with,

2182
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:05,300
with mala malignaggi,
who is,

2183
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:07,040
have you.
Do you know polly?

2184
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:08,640
I've only talked to him on twitter.
Yeah,

2185
01:46:08,690 --> 01:46:10,230
I don't know.
I fucking love polly.

2186
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:14,240
I love them.
I love math and I liked him as a dude.

2187
01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:15,530
I really do.
Um,

2188
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:17,120
uh,
but uh,

2189
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:19,850
so he created that and it worked and 
it's like,

2190
01:46:19,851 --> 01:46:20,750
okay,
whether,

2191
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:23,120
how on what level he's strategizing 
this.

2192
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:23,953
He's lIke,
let's go do some pushing and shoving 

2193
01:46:25,641 --> 01:46:26,474
with habib in his guys.
Some given the finger will be caught on 

2194
01:46:28,071 --> 01:46:29,060
cameras.
What?

2195
01:46:29,061 --> 01:46:30,500
Uh,
what one thing we know about connor,

2196
01:46:30,501 --> 01:46:32,900
he's always late,
always late.

2197
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,910
He didn't plan to get there when they're
on a bus.

2198
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:36,710
He planned to get there when they're in 
the hall,

2199
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:37,723
he planned to get their windows,
a bunch of people around and security 

2200
01:46:39,501 --> 01:46:43,130
and it's easy to manage little push and 
little shove and a couple of cameras and

2201
01:46:43,131 --> 01:46:45,270
all of a sudden his $5,000,000
payday,

2202
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,000
so $12,000,000
payday in Russia.

2203
01:46:47,001 --> 01:46:48,380
And everybody's going crazy.
It'll work.

2204
01:46:48,381 --> 01:46:49,710
It's brilliant,
but he's late.

2205
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,023
So he shows up there on the bus.
Now the cameras are out and what's he 

2206
01:46:53,221 --> 01:46:54,660
gonna do?
He's got to perform.

2207
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:55,673
He came there to perform it,
came there to do a thing we showed up 

2208
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:01,560
and now it.
Now it goes sideways and that's the most

2209
01:47:01,561 --> 01:47:04,740
likely scenario is that it was a,
let's do it.

2210
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,260
It'll be.
It'll feel right for us as,

2211
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,333
as defending our friend,
but also it'll have some inherent value 

2212
01:47:10,501 --> 01:47:12,540
in the cameras come out and nobody will 
get hurt.

2213
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:14,360
Well,
I think you're probably right there.

2214
01:47:14,570 --> 01:47:15,920
It's got to get.
He's got a good point,

2215
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:20,060
but obviously it's a terrible thing to 
do and stupid.

2216
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:20,801
You know,
there's,

2217
01:47:20,801 --> 01:47:23,120
there's a way to manage that,
but then people say,

2218
01:47:23,121 --> 01:47:23,661
well,
you know,

2219
01:47:23,661 --> 01:47:26,830
now becomes like the wwe and you know,
there's,

2220
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,833
there's people that love real fighting,
that have a real hard time with these 

2221
01:47:32,631 --> 01:47:37,631
fake wwe style scenarios where you know 
that whether it's colby,

2222
01:47:38,631 --> 01:47:39,920
covington,
you know,

2223
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:42,310
like he did a promo recently.
We had a,

2224
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:47,480
a girl bY the pool and the girl sat in 
his lap and she was like obviously had a

2225
01:47:48,711 --> 01:47:52,490
plan script and it seemed kind of corny 
people.

2226
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:56,120
There's people who think that's great 
and there's people fucking hate it.

2227
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:57,020
I'm the heyday.

2228
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:58,180
Yeah.
I'm the hated too.

2229
01:47:58,181 --> 01:47:59,200
I don't know.
I mean,

2230
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:00,950
I don't have a real problem with pro 
wrestling.

2231
01:48:00,951 --> 01:48:03,980
I joke around about it all the time and 
I get the fact that people like it.

2232
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:07,160
I don't like that kind of shit bleeding 
into mma.

2233
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:08,090
I think it's dumb

2234
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:09,980
bad.
It's also,

2235
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:11,330
I mean,
again,

2236
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:17,230
if you're viewing it as inspiring 
artistry with which there are lessons to

2237
01:48:17,691 --> 01:48:18,524
fucking live your life on one hand and 
on and that's how I truly see it and 

2238
01:48:23,211 --> 01:48:27,280
interface with it and experience it and,
and share it and,

2239
01:48:27,281 --> 01:48:28,114
and want to see people get to feel that 
and then on the other hand you're 

2240
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:35,420
putting together these weird scripts to 
sell pay per views,

2241
01:48:35,421 --> 01:48:36,254
but wrestling,
that stuff that came up in wrestling 

2242
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:42,600
because it isn't inherently real needed.
Those extras.

2243
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:43,453
it needed all that stuff.
If we understood how brilliant colbY 

2244
01:48:46,491 --> 01:48:47,324
covington was,
if we understood how brilliant of a 

2245
01:48:48,681 --> 01:48:51,680
combat sportsman he was,
he wouldn't have to do that.

2246
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:53,900
But he's doing that and that's what got 
him a title shot.

2247
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,890
right?
So on the other side,

2248
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,570
the other side of the coin,
we're wrong.

2249
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:59,960
You want know if we understood he would 
get it based on that,

2250
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:01,400
but we don't understand.

2251
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:02,121
We,
we,

2252
01:49:02,121 --> 01:49:03,800
the royal,
we don't get it.

2253
01:49:03,801 --> 01:49:08,210
It's like I'll see people talk about 
fighting after and they'll be like there

2254
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:09,093
and some people's.
This is their idea of covering a fight 

2255
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:14,780
and our fans or people and everybody's 
entitled to their own thing,

2256
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:16,010
but they'll be like,
yeah,

2257
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:18,890
the show is kind of a lackluster fair.
Not a lot of finishes.

2258
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:20,173
Fuck in your head.
20 brilliant athletes have interact in 

2259
01:49:23,631 --> 01:49:28,631
some of your opinion of how it did or 
didn't excite you is super valid to you.

2260
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:29,953
But that's not what we were watching.
But what I'm talking about is like what 

2261
01:49:32,571 --> 01:49:33,404
got them a title shot?
My title shot is being an asshole 

2262
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:37,640
because of the reality that we live in.
That's what he had to do.

2263
01:49:37,641 --> 01:49:37,860
Right?
Right.

2264
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:40,040
I mean like what he did in Brazil after 
he beat damien,

2265
01:49:40,041 --> 01:49:40,874
maia said this is a shit hole.
That's literally what got in the title 

2266
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:44,720
shot mean if you really stop and think 
about it.

2267
01:49:44,721 --> 01:49:46,760
He's ranked,
what is he ranked number three?

2268
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:49,630
He's only beaten maya.
I mean he's beaten some other people,

2269
01:49:49,631 --> 01:49:54,010
but it terms of top 10 contenders in 
terms of like real world class fighters.

2270
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:55,353
There's a lot of guys that are out there
that have fucked up a lot of other 

2271
01:49:57,341 --> 01:50:00,790
people like wonder wonderboy was like,
how is this guy fighting for the title,

2272
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:01,743
for an interim title and I'm not.
After he's gone through those two big 

2273
01:50:04,391 --> 01:50:06,970
fights with tyron woodley,
beaten jorge mas,

2274
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:07,813
vidar beaten all these debate and Johnny
Hendricks beaten all these different 

2275
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:11,014
fighters.
Colby beat damien maia and that's the 

2276
01:50:12,801 --> 01:50:13,634
really the big name on his resume and.
But it's also because he's going to be 

2277
01:50:16,691 --> 01:50:18,670
fighting hartfield oh,
who is a brazilian?

2278
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,830
He said a lot of stupid shit about 
Brazil.

2279
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:21,664
Brazilians.
Hayden.

2280
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:25,150
Brazil is a giant market.
It's an easy sell and this is.

2281
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:27,760
This is what he's talked himself into 
and it's a tough fight.

2282
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:31,540
Don't make no mistake about it.
The guy that beat damien maia is a tough

2283
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:32,790
fucking fighter.
Colby.

2284
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,740
Tough.
And again,

2285
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:35,783
you talked to dean thomas or Mike Brown 
and they two years back when they were 

2286
01:50:39,691 --> 01:50:42,960
taught and I would.
I'm a jorge mosfet all freak,

2287
01:50:42,961 --> 01:50:43,521
right?
That,

2288
01:50:43,521 --> 01:50:45,750
that's one of those special artists to 
me.

2289
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:47,550
And so I'll be asking,
you know,

2290
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:51,480
when I'll see mike or dean or these guys
or anybody around that.

2291
01:50:51,481 --> 01:50:51,961
I'm like,
hey,

2292
01:50:51,961 --> 01:50:52,950
how's,
how's jorge doing?

2293
01:50:52,951 --> 01:50:53,784
What's he working on?
What is he changes and they'll talk and 

2294
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:58,120
he's always traded with colby.
He's,

2295
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:00,750
he's deadly.
He's one of the greats in the gym.

2296
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:01,593
He,
the two of them are first there last to 

2297
01:51:02,821 --> 01:51:03,654
leave,
like you've heard about how good he was 

2298
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:09,390
under that public surface and I,
but I see what you're saying,

2299
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:10,243
the based on what we've created,
he doesn't have much of a choice if he 

2300
01:51:15,571 --> 01:51:16,404
wants to achieve his goals other than 
doing it this way and the guys who are 

2301
01:51:18,961 --> 01:51:19,860
good at it,
jail,

2302
01:51:19,861 --> 01:51:23,940
obviously the tail is really good at one
of the greatest entertainer.

2303
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:27,340
And don'T you love kale?
I love to fucking love child.

2304
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:28,583
And yet,
this is something I find distasteful 

2305
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:33,090
about this art form,
is that game.

2306
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:36,770
Yet somehow child is so lovable.
I love child,

2307
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:37,643
right?
But it's because there's a natural love 

2308
01:51:40,861 --> 01:51:43,630
of that kind of performance.
And colby and I've,

2309
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:44,753
I've played around with it a little bit 
when I played in a band where you would 

2310
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:48,990
be rude and arrogant and play that kind 
of game.

2311
01:51:49,410 --> 01:51:51,600
It's not.
It's hard.

2312
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:53,370
it's hard.
It's hard to do.

2313
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,650
It's hard when it's hard to be 
convincing.

2314
01:51:55,830 --> 01:51:57,600
It's also hard to behave it all the 
time.

2315
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:58,770
That's real.
Like you.

2316
01:51:59,010 --> 01:51:59,843
You will feel the hatred of all 
brazilians who truly hate you even 

2317
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:07,900
though you're playing a game.
Getting real about that shit.

2318
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:12,110
Zillions are extremely patriotic,
very nationalistic.

2319
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,630
You talk shit about Brazil.
You better duck.

2320
01:52:15,650 --> 01:52:19,220
Yeah.
And in fact,

2321
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:25,450
even if you were talk to somebody like a
stereotypical he passionate person we're

2322
01:52:26,121 --> 01:52:26,954
talking about here,
and you said it's a joke and they'd be 

2323
01:52:28,881 --> 01:52:30,710
like,
you can't make that joke.

2324
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:31,583
Right?
Like at their point isn't that I don't 

2325
01:52:33,531 --> 01:52:34,364
care if he was kidding.
The fact that he was willing to do that 

2326
01:52:37,070 --> 01:52:37,903
is so disrespectful to all of us that we
must slit his throat and that's what 

2327
01:52:41,901 --> 01:52:44,690
they'll chant when he goes to walk out 
there and they mean it.

2328
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:46,250
They do mean it,
but meanwhile

2329
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,770
he just doubled down.
He didn't give a fuck even after get hit

2330
01:52:48,771 --> 01:52:51,140
in the head with the boomerang still 
doubling down,

2331
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,150
swinging for the fences.
What other choice?

2332
01:52:53,151 --> 01:52:54,350
I guess.
Well look,

2333
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:55,273
it has got him to the dance and if he 
wins two saturdays from this one or one 

2334
01:53:01,011 --> 01:53:02,000
saturday,
how's it going?

2335
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:04,100
Next?
One is tail and wonderboy.

2336
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,650
Yeah,
that's another one to talk.

2337
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:10,190
But if he wins,
if he wins,

2338
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:11,660
he will have a belt.
I mean,

2339
01:53:11,661 --> 01:53:14,870
it's not the real belt.
I mean it's an interim belt,

2340
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:17,270
but it guarantees him a shot at the real
belt.

2341
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:18,160
yeah.
No.

2342
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:21,460
so it gets very interesting.
So like I,

2343
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:26,920
I know that I my look at these sort of 
systems and the areas around it,

2344
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:31,860
I have a negative bias.
Like,

2345
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:33,043
you know,
it's not about that and I know that's 

2346
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:39,640
that's negative to me about the belt or 
the rankings or the beefs or whatever,

2347
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:43,430
but the belt cannot mean what it meant 
before.

2348
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:44,473
By the nature of once upon a time there 
were only ever 27 of them and now there 

2349
01:53:47,901 --> 01:53:51,830
has been 340 of them.
By nature it cannot be as valuable as it

2350
01:53:51,831 --> 01:53:52,664
once was and when there's two in yours,
it inherently cannot have the value 

2351
01:53:56,871 --> 01:53:58,880
because scarcity is where value comes 
from.

2352
01:53:58,970 --> 01:54:00,860
Yeah.
It's really just a promotional tool.

2353
01:54:00,920 --> 01:54:03,680
It's a marketing tool and it's a.
It's a questionable one.

2354
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:04,611
You know,
there's,

2355
01:54:04,611 --> 01:54:05,444
there's a real good argument that it's a
bad idea to have these interim title 

2356
01:54:08,781 --> 01:54:10,070
shots because you know,
like,

2357
01:54:10,071 --> 01:54:11,570
okay,
well what's the rules?

2358
01:54:11,571 --> 01:54:13,460
You just decide when to have an interim 
shot,

2359
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:15,230
especially with a guy like tony 
ferguson,

2360
01:54:15,231 --> 01:54:16,064
right?
He beats Kevin Lee spectacular five 

2361
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:21,830
triangles and off to nobody after that 
last one.

2362
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:22,693
One the interim title,
and then you strip it because he falls 

2363
01:54:25,341 --> 01:54:28,100
down during a promotion.
He trips on some wires.

2364
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:29,330
I mean,
this isn't,

2365
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:30,163
I mean,
it's not like he went and did something 

2366
01:54:31,221 --> 01:54:32,054
stupid outside of fighting.
He was just doing promotion and tripped 

2367
01:54:35,991 --> 01:54:40,340
on some wires,
so freak accident and that really,

2368
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:44,390
if we move away all other things and 
just look at the systems at play and how

2369
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:46,160
and why it's there.
If he was,

2370
01:54:46,161 --> 01:54:48,620
if he had another 2 million instagram 
followers,

2371
01:54:48,621 --> 01:54:50,030
that would not happen.
You're right.

2372
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:51,200
And that's it.
You're right.

2373
01:54:51,201 --> 01:54:53,000
It's strictly that.
That is true,

2374
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,863
right?
Yeah.

2375
01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:55,940
It was a giant,
huge star.

2376
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:57,350
There's no way they would strip him.
No.

2377
01:54:57,540 --> 01:54:58,150
Yeah,
no.

2378
01:54:58,150 --> 01:54:59,660
And,
but by not being,

2379
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,210
because he's a character,
he's,

2380
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:03,410
he's an oddball.
He is a unique.

2381
01:55:03,411 --> 01:55:05,960
He's one of a kind.
We should celebrate that.

2382
01:55:06,290 --> 01:55:08,270
He's one of a kind.
He's an individual.

2383
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:10,150
He's different than everybody that's a 
sale.

2384
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:11,990
If you're going to strip connor,
which they did,

2385
01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:16,220
and you have khabib fight for the title,
the true title and,

2386
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:16,910
you know,
look,

2387
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:17,743
that's arguable whether or not you 
should do that as you'd probably be two 

2388
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:21,290
interim fights are transgender,
um,

2389
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:22,610
titles,
which will be cool.

2390
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:25,370
He's not beating the champion if he 
didn't beat the champion,

2391
01:55:25,371 --> 01:55:27,980
he beat out quinta.
How is him beating out?

2392
01:55:27,990 --> 01:55:30,740
I quinta more valid than tony beating 
Kevin Lee.

2393
01:55:30,741 --> 01:55:31,850
That's crazy.
It isn't.

2394
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:33,680
It's crazy.
It doesn't make any sense.

2395
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:35,900
I mean,
not taking anything away against albert.

2396
01:55:35,901 --> 01:55:38,540
Al took that fight on unfucking one 
day's notice.

2397
01:55:38,541 --> 01:55:39,374
Yeah.
So it's even more ridiculous and 

2398
01:55:40,431 --> 01:55:41,420
awesome.
yeah,

2399
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:43,980
and that was a great fight too.
It was

2400
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:44,813
really fun.
Yeah.

2401
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:46,640
Well there's,
there's a puncher.

2402
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:47,483
Yeah.
It was really fun and I like la quinta 

2403
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:53,910
is another one of these guys.
How can you not be inspired seeing a guy

2404
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:55,703
like life is traveling along and all of 
a sudden you have this one shot at 

2405
01:55:58,951 --> 01:56:00,450
something.
You're not ready.

2406
01:56:00,451 --> 01:56:01,284
You're don't have.
You haven't prepared in the ways you 

2407
01:56:02,491 --> 01:56:03,920
want,
but you know what I'm going to go for.

2408
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:08,190
That's a life lesson.
And there's also like I.

2409
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:12,330
There's a forgiving nature to this 
machine that is kind of admirable.

2410
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:13,253
Like alice created problems.
Al has had conflict with that company 

2411
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,840
and then they were still like,
you know what?

2412
01:56:18,841 --> 01:56:19,674
Let's do this.

2413
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:23,810
Did it though.
They did it because they wouldn't,

2414
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:28,160
they wouldn't use paul felder the 
fucking athletic commission.

2415
01:56:28,161 --> 01:56:29,570
That's ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

2416
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:30,703
I mean all their wisdom,
they decided that paul felder isn't 

2417
01:56:36,111 --> 01:56:37,360
ranked high enough like who

2418
01:56:37,610 --> 01:56:38,443
you don't know shit.
Don't even know where rankings come 

2419
01:56:39,681 --> 01:56:40,514
from,
which is a bunch of people like hanging 

2420
01:56:41,871 --> 01:56:43,950
out who kind of watched,
fighting a bunch of,

2421
01:56:43,951 --> 01:56:46,200
making an arbitrary choice and then 
combining it like,

2422
01:56:46,700 --> 01:56:47,560
do you know what,
um,

2423
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:50,610
what a first class noticer is?
Have you ever heard this term?

2424
01:56:50,780 --> 01:56:55,700
So a first class noticer in business or 
any number of things.

2425
01:56:55,701 --> 01:56:56,534
as somebody who over times you start to 
see the different systems and how they 

2426
01:57:00,981 --> 01:57:02,660
interact with each other and you are 
one,

2427
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:06,950
you clearly are a first class noticer,
you see big picture,

2428
01:57:06,951 --> 01:57:09,800
small picture combined.
How the outside right now you're like,

2429
01:57:09,801 --> 01:57:10,410
well,
the,

2430
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:13,250
the commission did this,
but paul felter did that.

2431
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:14,233
Rankings are this way and you're able to
pull all these things together and look 

2432
01:57:16,851 --> 01:57:17,684
at it.
Right?

2433
01:57:17,690 --> 01:57:21,710
And if you look at any of these things 
from that perspectiVe of how the systems

2434
01:57:21,711 --> 01:57:24,080
all work,
the whole thing barely makes sense.

2435
01:57:24,110 --> 01:57:24,943
You know what I mean?
Paul felder is brilliant if it needs a 

2436
01:57:28,570 --> 01:57:30,890
dangerous one,
55,

2437
01:57:30,891 --> 01:57:35,180
including khabib and committed and 
mentally strong and a striver

2438
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:36,143
world class striker and his striking his
fucking deadly and he's not just a 

2439
01:57:39,691 --> 01:57:44,040
striker in terms of punching like al.
He's a really nasty kicker.

2440
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:45,090
I now can kick.
Yeah,

2441
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:48,650
no doubt about it.
But paul was a bit more achieved in,

2442
01:57:48,651 --> 01:57:49,540
in his,
uh,

2443
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:52,740
he's got more weapons,
more complex,

2444
01:57:52,741 --> 01:57:57,741
spinning back fists and elbows and knees
and nasty leg kicks and you know,

2445
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:01,350
went three hard rounds with barboza.
Went toe to toe with them.

2446
01:58:01,351 --> 01:58:02,250
I mean,
he's that good.

2447
01:58:02,251 --> 01:58:02,960
He's that good on it

2448
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:03,793
and smart he is.
He's a great analyst for such a young 

2449
01:58:06,621 --> 01:58:07,730
one.
But when you look,

2450
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:09,350
so you're like,
how is that possible?

2451
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:10,573
Because that's really hard and it's a 
different skill set than just being a 

2452
01:58:12,621 --> 01:58:13,454
good fighter.
This language and being able to 

2453
01:58:14,811 --> 01:58:16,940
rationalize things and all,
all these different things.

2454
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:20,060
But you look back and he did it on the 
small leaks,

2455
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:24,030
which he didn't need to do.
He pursued because it was of interest to

2456
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:24,864
him.
He pursued it to get good at it because 

2457
01:58:26,571 --> 01:58:29,570
he loved it,
which means he's predisposed to thinking

2458
01:58:29,571 --> 01:58:31,610
that way.
So now you also have a thinker,

2459
01:58:32,090 --> 01:58:35,810
a fighter,
incredibly dangerous striker,

2460
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:40,190
a guy who can play complex games in it,
and you in your infinite wisdom,

2461
01:58:40,191 --> 01:58:41,024
don't think he can fight habib because 
somebody somewhere said that he put a 

2462
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:46,480
seven next to his name instead of a 
three

2463
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:51,490
real real problems with the athletic 
commission and we won't go into depth.

2464
01:58:51,710 --> 01:58:54,010
I don't want to cause any problems.
But uh,

2465
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:55,640
they,
they had some real issues.

2466
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:56,630
they're young,
they're new.

2467
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:58,250
Yeah.
there's a lot of nonsense that was going

2468
01:58:58,251 --> 01:58:59,084
on behind the scenes.
But I think that what was interesting 

2469
01:59:02,811 --> 01:59:06,620
about that fight was we got to see al 
step up.

2470
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:10,780
We got to see khabib have some issues 
with striking and you know,

2471
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:13,010
we got to see.
I mean,

2472
01:59:13,940 --> 01:59:16,610
what,
what I don't like about it is this whole

2473
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:19,390
the whole championship thing.
What I don't like about this,

2474
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:21,620
he didn't beat the champion to become a 
champion.

2475
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,260
They just sort of like set this,
fight up our.

2476
01:59:24,261 --> 01:59:27,350
And preparing for that fight,
he was preparing for a three round fight

2477
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:29,750
and then tony gets stripped all those 
things.

2478
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:31,150
Yeah.
It.

2479
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:32,960
because they don't make any sense.
Yeah.

2480
01:59:32,980 --> 01:59:36,130
They don't really make any sense because
if we go back to the.

2481
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:37,143
if we have some kind of value root of 
what we're about other than the 

2482
01:59:40,541 --> 01:59:44,820
necessity to to sell things based on the
same marketing that we used,

2483
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:47,050
we wouldn't have to be in that 
situation,

2484
01:59:47,051 --> 01:59:49,810
but we find ourselves there and when 
you're on,

2485
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,810
when you're on the bottom of half guard,
you just have to work your way on a half

2486
01:59:52,811 --> 01:59:54,550
guard and that's what that machine has 
to do.

2487
01:59:54,551 --> 01:59:58,420
And that's what habib has to do.
And that's got an artificial standup.

2488
01:59:58,780 --> 01:59:59,850
yeah,
exactly.

2489
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:01,693
Exactly.

2490
02:00:02,370 --> 02:00:03,380
Got stood up.
Exactly.

2491
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:04,650
Yeah.
I dunno.

2492
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:08,020
I dunno.
Wonderboy until man,

2493
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:10,020
that's a big fire.
That's this saturday.

2494
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:11,810
That's fucking.
That's chaos stuff.

2495
02:00:11,811 --> 02:00:14,370
Fight is very interesting to me.
I am very,

2496
02:00:14,371 --> 02:00:16,050
very,
very interested in that fight.

2497
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:17,150
Me too.
Yeah.

2498
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,900
I want to see what happens when till 
fights.

2499
02:00:18,901 --> 02:00:22,710
Wonderboy,
because I was stunned by how easily till

2500
02:00:22,711 --> 02:00:27,120
ran through cowboy and cowboy in all 
fairness is not,

2501
02:00:27,330 --> 02:00:29,280
in my opinion,
a real one 70.

2502
02:00:29,610 --> 02:00:33,450
He's a tweener.
I think cowboy would be a one 65,

2503
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:34,553
you know,
and I think maybe his struggles to make 

2504
02:00:36,151 --> 02:00:36,984
1:55
maybe you should be 10 pounds heavier 

2505
02:00:38,341 --> 02:00:41,460
and I think that 10 pound weight class 
thing is real.

2506
02:00:41,461 --> 02:00:44,580
I think that's where it should be every 
10 pounds.

2507
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:48,420
Darren till is a fucking huge guy.
So steve,

2508
02:00:48,690 --> 02:00:52,110
yeah,
they're both very tall and strong,

2509
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:55,750
but till you know,
gregory's well over 100.

2510
02:00:56,160 --> 02:01:00,450
Well over 200 pounds.
He's walking around like um,

2511
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:02,280
you know,
fucking two.

2512
02:01:02,281 --> 02:01:03,180
Oh,
five and shit.

2513
02:01:03,181 --> 02:01:05,670
And cutting down to one 70.
It's a good one man.

2514
02:01:05,670 --> 02:01:05,700
Yeah,

2515
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:07,200
it's a really,
you know,

2516
02:01:07,230 --> 02:01:10,920
there's so many little odd ball 
variables and unknowns,

2517
02:01:10,921 --> 02:01:14,460
right?
Like we literally when we go and we look

2518
02:01:14,461 --> 02:01:18,540
at these,
the more you've studied and analyzed and

2519
02:01:18,541 --> 02:01:20,430
commutative fighting for 20 years of 
your life,

2520
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:23,070
the more you realize how little we 
actually know,

2521
02:01:23,071 --> 02:01:27,210
like we have about two or seven or 18 
percent of the actual information.

2522
02:01:27,570 --> 02:01:29,610
You know what I mean,
and we're trying to work with it and the

2523
02:01:29,611 --> 02:01:30,600
big one.
So when,

2524
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:34,890
when cody fought tgr,
I'm dominic,

2525
02:01:35,370 --> 02:01:37,680
I was like,
I just don't see how he can win.

2526
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:40,390
I don't see how cody can win.
And then somebody say,

2527
02:01:40,391 --> 02:01:41,151
well,
why'd he say that?

2528
02:01:41,151 --> 02:01:42,140
He knocked out all these guys.
I'm like,

2529
02:01:42,141 --> 02:01:42,974
well yeah,
it's hard to get to dominic and we've 

2530
02:01:44,901 --> 02:01:47,450
never seen evidence of him doing well 
after those minutes.

2531
02:01:47,451 --> 02:01:52,451
The evidence isn't there to see it.
Of course 100 percent wrong but there.

2532
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:55,610
But you have to go by what evidence you 
have,

2533
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,473
what have we seen or what information 
that we gathered that can allow us to 

2534
02:01:59,391 --> 02:02:03,380
make this decision to me.
Cody garbrandt did not have.

2535
02:02:03,381 --> 02:02:05,720
There was no evidence he can be dominant
and then boom,

2536
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:08,240
he beats up dominic and you're blown 
away.

2537
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:11,000
And that's an exciting feeling.
And that is,

2538
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:11,834
I think what's at play here.
Is there any evidence that that darren 

2539
02:02:14,811 --> 02:02:15,644
till can do what rory macdonald couldn't
do and jorge mass fidel couldn't do and 

2540
02:02:19,221 --> 02:02:23,740
get to a guy who has that movement,
that blitz thinking that karate's a,

2541
02:02:23,890 --> 02:02:25,700
those karate instincts we were talking 
about.

2542
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:29,720
We've seen no real evidence of that,
but that doesn't mean he can't do it.

2543
02:02:30,230 --> 02:02:32,870
It doesn't mean he can't do it,
but the evidence isn't there.

2544
02:02:32,871 --> 02:02:33,704
I don't know about that.
I was stunned by his ability to close 

2545
02:02:35,871 --> 02:02:39,290
the distance on cowboy,
that nasty left elbow that he learned it

2546
02:02:39,291 --> 02:02:40,124
over the top.

2547
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:42,050
The way he put them away.
I don't know.

2548
02:02:42,051 --> 02:02:44,960
I think that's pretty good evidence that
he's a fucking monster.

2549
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:45,853
I agree.
And his fights previous in the ufc as 

2550
02:02:47,571 --> 02:02:48,404
well,
although they didn't have a lot of 

2551
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:52,100
fanfare behind them.
Stunning results.

2552
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:54,380
And then you talked to people that know 
him,

2553
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:55,293
you know,
talk to people that know his striking 

2554
02:02:56,451 --> 02:02:57,284
aquaman and people that have seen him in
the gym and understand what he's been 

2555
02:02:59,871 --> 02:03:01,400
through in his life.
And he's a young guy.

2556
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:04,150
I thInk he's only 25.
How old darren till?

2557
02:03:05,090 --> 02:03:06,660
I'm pretty sure he's 25.
Celso,

2558
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:09,950
never lost,
never so fuckIng pissed man.

2559
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:11,180
Yeah,
and then you see the pictures.

2560
02:03:11,181 --> 02:03:12,014
Even that 25 years old.
That's wild man and but what I'm saying 

2561
02:03:14,931 --> 02:03:15,764
is I would have,
I would not be the slightest bit 

2562
02:03:18,051 --> 02:03:21,740
surprised if he could do it because 
we've seen enough over time to know that

2563
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:26,750
what a 23 year old is capable of,
they'll see the whole game differently.

2564
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:31,670
They'll see their understanding of where
they are in relation to the other guy is

2565
02:03:31,671 --> 02:03:32,504
so different that it just on one day,
all of a sudden all of these 25 year 

2566
02:03:36,171 --> 02:03:37,004
olds are just so fucking good and we 
don't really have the language to 

2567
02:03:39,261 --> 02:03:41,200
explain why.
You know,

2568
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:42,830
can we just say,
oh,

2569
02:03:42,831 --> 02:03:45,020
he was able to close the distance on 
Stephen Thompson.

2570
02:03:45,350 --> 02:03:46,183
IF he does will say yes,
but then the question will be how when 

2571
02:03:49,131 --> 02:03:52,760
nobody else could do it,
how and why could he do it?

2572
02:03:52,761 --> 02:03:56,630
And that's always what obsesses me.
If you see him do it,

2573
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:57,643
there is now the explanation isn't he 
was better at closing the distance or 

2574
02:04:00,890 --> 02:04:03,740
his range management was excellent dot.
That's true for a bit.

2575
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:06,140
But then my next question,
the next morning will be like,

2576
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:07,820
how the fuck did he do it?
What?

2577
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:08,733
What changed now?
What about the entirety of the game 

2578
02:04:12,171 --> 02:04:13,004
itself?
The systems of the relationships have 

2579
02:04:14,361 --> 02:04:15,194
two fighters.
What changed in such a way because of 

2580
02:04:16,971 --> 02:04:20,840
his behavior and that's where it gets to
me really,

2581
02:04:20,841 --> 02:04:21,674
really wild because right now nobody 
gets to Stephen Thompson and I mean 

2582
02:04:24,411 --> 02:04:25,244
nobody really at all.
Tyrone is knocked down twice about them 

2583
02:04:28,271 --> 02:04:30,410
really badly.
Just 50 minutes,

2584
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:32,710
15 minutes.
The fight.

2585
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:34,760
Those are the moments in the fight where
they engaged.

2586
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:36,650
See,
the problem with those two tyron woodley

2587
02:04:36,651 --> 02:04:38,070
fights is what they fought

2588
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,560
wonderboy the right way.
That's how you got to fIght them.

2589
02:04:40,561 --> 02:04:41,394
You don't engage and when you do engage,
you got to be absolutely convinced 

2590
02:04:43,321 --> 02:04:44,154
you're going to land.
And tyron did and did land and hurt 

2591
02:04:46,291 --> 02:04:48,120
them.
I mean you looked at those two fights.

2592
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:48,983
Tyron is the one who's the wrestler,
but he's also the one that hurt 

2593
02:04:51,181 --> 02:04:52,014
wonderboy.
Wonderboy never heard tyron and those 

2594
02:04:53,011 --> 02:04:53,844
fights.
Nope.

2595
02:04:54,030 --> 02:04:54,863
Tyron had him very close to being out.
and I just wonder if wonderboy is 

2596
02:05:00,271 --> 02:05:01,920
starting to slip,
you know,

2597
02:05:01,921 --> 02:05:02,754
you've got to wonder,
you gotta wonder if all his years of 

2598
02:05:04,861 --> 02:05:07,110
combat sports,
all of his years of kickboxing.

2599
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:08,133
I mean you to remember this guy is one 
of the most spectacular kickboxing 

2600
02:05:09,901 --> 02:05:11,130
records ever.
I mean,

2601
02:05:11,131 --> 02:05:13,520
what is it like $57 or something like 
that?

2602
02:05:13,770 --> 02:05:17,280
Kickboxing.
And then he gets into mma and you know,

2603
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:21,000
he loses to matt brown,
he gets kind of beat up on the ground,

2604
02:05:21,810 --> 02:05:22,643
comes back,
has some really good fights and you 

2605
02:05:24,751 --> 02:05:25,584
know,
it's been in there with world class 

2606
02:05:26,221 --> 02:05:28,230
fighters and beaten some world class 
fighters.

2607
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:30,990
But he's also,
I want to say he's 34,

2608
02:05:30,991 --> 02:05:31,824
35

2609
02:05:32,410 --> 02:05:33,243
and that was a lot of fights.
although we didn't get until recently 

2610
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:39,040
until those three examples,
he ever really get hit all that much.

2611
02:05:39,041 --> 02:05:41,080
But it's still the where Stephen 
Thompson

2612
02:05:41,170 --> 02:05:44,380
find out how wonderful is.
That might even be thirtY five.

2613
02:05:44,410 --> 02:05:44,800
Yeah.

2614
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:48,340
The hips and the knees and the shoulders
and that whole 5:35.

2615
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:53,050
But.
And there's also that what he.

2616
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:56,230
I mean he developed mastery in what he 
does.

2617
02:05:56,890 --> 02:05:57,723
And once you've developed that elite,
elite top level of reached your highest 

2618
02:06:01,781 --> 02:06:03,880
potential,
it's hard to keep going.

2619
02:06:04,510 --> 02:06:07,940
And then the masses start to close that 
distance though the,

2620
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:10,570
the general young kid start,
you know,

2621
02:06:10,571 --> 02:06:12,610
a kid at tristar,
like some of the young guys,

2622
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:13,593
they have that and they've had thompson 
in there for years and for us has been 

2623
02:06:16,331 --> 02:06:20,220
able to study people like that up close 
and they all studied leonardo.

2624
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:21,243
Now the young guy can do a lot of those 
things at a much higher level than 

2625
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:28,810
fighters that came before them.
So your level of mastery starts,

2626
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:31,540
you plateau to a point that it's hard to
go beyond.

2627
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:32,473
It's really hard work and sometimes it 
requires you to get a little shittier 

2628
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:36,213
for a bit too to go past that plateau to
weaken or get worse by having to 

2629
02:06:41,201 --> 02:06:45,370
reexamine what you believe and the way 
that you train or the way that you fight

2630
02:06:45,550 --> 02:06:46,630
to break through a plateau.

2631
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:49,300
You've got to kind of be willing to go 
backwards a bit.

2632
02:06:49,510 --> 02:06:51,580
And when you're fighting tyron woodley's
of the world,

2633
02:06:51,581 --> 02:06:52,414
you cannot go backwards.
So it's kind of kind of stalls you 

2634
02:06:54,761 --> 02:06:55,594
there.
So,

2635
02:06:55,780 --> 02:07:00,670
but ultimately the big question also is,
is there some other strategy that hasn't

2636
02:07:00,671 --> 02:07:01,504
yet been done that is a Stephen Thompson
beater and that loW leg kick you talked 

2637
02:07:04,481 --> 02:07:09,481
about may so I cannot get to you.
So what would I prefer when I'm fighting

2638
02:07:10,631 --> 02:07:11,464
Stephen Thompson body lock,
if I can get to the body lock cover up 

2639
02:07:13,061 --> 02:07:15,520
and down to get to a body.
Like I got to touch him,

2640
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:16,713
that's really hard.
He stops me from doIng that or I got to 

2641
02:07:19,031 --> 02:07:19,864
hit them or kick them.
But when I do that he moves away and 

2642
02:07:21,731 --> 02:07:22,564
hits.
What if I can just get to the edge of 

2643
02:07:24,911 --> 02:07:27,070
his sort of bubble of,
of,

2644
02:07:27,130 --> 02:07:30,040
of hot,
that hot range where he can hurt you and

2645
02:07:30,041 --> 02:07:31,690
maybe that low leg kick is a part of 
that.

2646
02:07:32,330 --> 02:07:33,163
Maybe that low leg kick,
just getting on the outside of it where 

2647
02:07:35,171 --> 02:07:38,380
you're still somewhat safe,
but you can smash him up a little bit.

2648
02:07:38,381 --> 02:07:40,300
Maybe those with a weapon that hasn't 
been used.

2649
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:41,283
Well it's.
This is also arguably the best striker 

2650
02:07:44,591 --> 02:07:48,030
that wonder boys ever faced in mma.
Arguably right,

2651
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:50,560
I mean moskva dolls,
very talented striker as well,

2652
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:52,083
but wonderboy is a master of that front 
leg in that front leg is a real tricky 

2653
02:07:56,891 --> 02:07:59,320
one because that karate style that he 
uses,

2654
02:07:59,321 --> 02:08:00,154
he keeps his hands down low.
He stands totally sideways on you and 

2655
02:08:03,161 --> 02:08:03,994
you've got to get past that front leg 
side kick and johnny couldn't get past 

2656
02:08:06,281 --> 02:08:08,590
it.
hendrix got lit up by that front leg,

2657
02:08:08,591 --> 02:08:11,470
side kick and then front roundhouse kick
to the face right afterwards.

2658
02:08:11,471 --> 02:08:12,304
It's just there's a lot going on with 
that front leg if you're not used to 

2659
02:08:14,771 --> 02:08:15,800
that,
and then if you.

2660
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:18,280
If you get too obsessed with it,
the backlash comes.

2661
02:08:18,770 --> 02:08:23,320
Yeah,
till is a way better way better.

2662
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:26,050
Master of distance.
He understands distance and straight and

2663
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:29,290
he knows how to close that distance with
explosive power.

2664
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:30,453
Very interesting.

2665
02:08:30,870 --> 02:08:31,703
Just before he fought cowboy,
his successes were fighting at distance 

2666
02:08:35,821 --> 02:08:39,300
and smashing guys who came in,
so he does do that.

2667
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,520
He does.
By doing it,

2668
02:08:41,521 --> 02:08:44,250
you understand it on a different level.
You connect to it.

2669
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:48,120
It is tie way,
whereas wonderboy doesn't across way and

2670
02:08:48,150 --> 02:08:48,983
wonderboy is fantastic at moving his 
waist back and forth like a snake and 

2671
02:08:53,641 --> 02:08:55,190
jumped on it.
He's really good at that too.

2672
02:08:55,210 --> 02:08:56,043
Yes.
Tony ferguson's really fucking good at 

2673
02:08:57,301 --> 02:08:58,120
that.
Yeah.

2674
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:58,530
Yeah.

2675
02:08:58,530 --> 02:09:03,420
And that.
So when I get to go study sunda and kung

2676
02:09:03,421 --> 02:09:06,630
fu and woo shu,
there are some of my friends are like,

2677
02:09:06,631 --> 02:09:07,464
well,
you know,

2678
02:09:07,650 --> 02:09:08,670
like enjoy it.
I'm like,

2679
02:09:08,671 --> 02:09:09,504
nah,
there's going to be some brilliant shit 

2680
02:09:10,471 --> 02:09:11,304
to learn over here.
This and some of that long fist stuff 

2681
02:09:14,010 --> 02:09:16,560
like people will often say,
well kung fu is not super relevant.

2682
02:09:16,710 --> 02:09:20,940
Some of that long fist reaching where I 
move my body through space to reach you,

2683
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:22,133
which people would say is dangerous.
You get countered while I check the 

2684
02:09:24,361 --> 02:09:25,194
answer is don't get countered.
The answer isn't discard a valuable 

2685
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:30,900
weapons and so you see some of that.
Tony does that stuff really,

2686
02:09:30,901 --> 02:09:32,910
really,
really a lot of really cool.

2687
02:09:32,911 --> 02:09:35,940
He does some work with the.
That's cool man.

2688
02:09:35,941 --> 02:09:38,220
Yeah.
He doesn't love roast wing chung too.

2689
02:09:38,460 --> 02:09:40,920
When I'm sitting in your guard wanting 
to beat you up,

2690
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:43,110
tell me that.
Isn't wing chung just were attached.

2691
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:45,270
That's what that is.
That's what that is,

2692
02:09:45,271 --> 02:09:45,700
right?

2693
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:49,990
I mean there's techniques in every 
single art that are established.

2694
02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:52,460
Realistic art that are valuable,
you know,

2695
02:09:52,461 --> 02:09:54,340
and there's,
there's gotta be something in wing chung

2696
02:09:54,341 --> 02:09:56,520
the people are missing for sure.
For sure.

2697
02:09:56,550 --> 02:09:57,383
For sure.

2698
02:09:57,630 --> 02:10:00,930
Sarah,
I mean art like that.

2699
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,710
People would look at and mike discard 
because they would think they're limited

2700
02:10:04,711 --> 02:10:07,860
to only this scenario.
Well that scenario happens.

2701
02:10:08,310 --> 02:10:09,780
I'm in your garden,
I want to fight.

2702
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:11,880
We are.
That's that scenario.

2703
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:14,610
So that thing may not be useful to 
fight,

2704
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:16,650
you know,
frank mir.

2705
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:19,410
But that thing will be useful in a 
context when you're fighting.

2706
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:20,523
Well,
how about jon jones is use of you grab 

2707
02:10:22,421 --> 02:10:26,390
his wrist and he comes over the top of 
the elbow that is hand tramping.

2708
02:10:26,430 --> 02:10:27,060
Yeah,
for sure.

2709
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:30,680
I mean it really is what it is.
Or when he leveraged his sherif oh yeah,

2710
02:10:30,681 --> 02:10:33,120
that's limb structure.
That's old school structure.

2711
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:34,040
How and

2712
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:37,040
why that hasn't been rabid hall a lot 
more.

2713
02:10:37,041 --> 02:10:40,790
Although you do start to see that that 
moment where were,

2714
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:42,620
you know,
I get to all four,

2715
02:10:42,621 --> 02:10:45,680
I get to four points that I'm going to 
stand up and you just kind of decide,

2716
02:10:45,681 --> 02:10:46,491
okay,
that's all right.

2717
02:10:46,491 --> 02:10:49,400
We'll get back to the fence in that 
process of standing up.

2718
02:10:49,401 --> 02:10:50,234
A loT of guys throw a fight finishing 
kick there or just at least take that 

2719
02:10:53,631 --> 02:10:57,920
chance to smash your leg with one.
Like if there's free shots that exist in

2720
02:10:57,921 --> 02:11:00,800
these moments and jon jones is a master 
of finding them.

2721
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:02,260
It really is.
Yeah.

2722
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:05,660
I hope they figure out what the fuck 
they're going to do with him soon.

2723
02:11:05,690 --> 02:11:06,523
I don't know where they stand now in 
terms of his suspension or what have 

2724
02:11:11,151 --> 02:11:13,700
you,
but here's my ultimate goal,

2725
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:14,593
my hope,
my dream is that cormier fight for the 

2726
02:11:18,651 --> 02:11:23,651
heavyweight title and somewhere around 
then they announced when jon jones,

2727
02:11:23,751 --> 02:11:24,584
the suspension is up,
they announced John Jones versus brock 

2728
02:11:26,841 --> 02:11:27,674
lesnar.

2729
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:30,080
Love it.
I love that.

2730
02:11:30,081 --> 02:11:31,130
I just,
I mean,

2731
02:11:31,220 --> 02:11:32,053
look at their body types and look at 
what they are and whether they come 

2732
02:11:34,491 --> 02:11:34,941
from.
I mean,

2733
02:11:34,941 --> 02:11:39,110
I love it,
but I know you've sat down with john and

2734
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:41,360
stuff,
but what did you like?

2735
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:43,910
What did he feel like?
You know what I mean?

2736
02:11:43,911 --> 02:11:47,090
Like what?
What reed did you get from him?

2737
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:48,193
Did you feel like he was saying the 
things that he thought you wanted to 

2738
02:11:50,841 --> 02:11:53,810
hear or did you feel he was being honest
and genuine?

2739
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:54,763
Definitely both being honest and he's 
also had some things that he planned 

2740
02:11:57,711 --> 02:11:59,420
out.
I like john a lot.

2741
02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:00,313
I really love that guy,
but I think he surrounds himself with a 

2742
02:12:02,271 --> 02:12:04,460
bunch of knuckleheads.
I Think he's,

2743
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:09,080
he's around too many people that are a 
bad influence and I think he's,

2744
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:09,973
he's a wild man and I think when he's a 
wild man around other people that are 

2745
02:12:13,731 --> 02:12:15,530
sort of indulging that stuff with them.

2746
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:18,710
This is the word that I get,
not just from what I know,

2747
02:12:18,711 --> 02:12:19,544
but from the people that know him very 
well is that he just around the wrong 

2748
02:12:22,551 --> 02:12:23,420
people.
You know,

2749
02:12:23,421 --> 02:12:24,254
he's got bad influences and I mean if 
you can identify that then you must 

2750
02:12:29,181 --> 02:12:29,740
change it.
Yeah,

2751
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:30,573
it's not,
it's not to take any personal 

2752
02:12:31,461 --> 02:12:36,461
responsibility away from him either 
because I'm sure he also makes for a bad

2753
02:12:36,591 --> 02:12:37,424
influence to them.
Know the fucking baddest man on the 

2754
02:12:39,441 --> 02:12:41,880
planet can live like this.
I'll live like this to fuck it.

2755
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:44,780
Let's do more coke and know let's party 
harder.

2756
02:12:44,781 --> 02:12:46,220
Let's drive fast.
Let's go drunk.

2757
02:12:46,470 --> 02:12:47,960
Um,
I don't know,

2758
02:12:48,030 --> 02:12:49,370
you know,
I don't know what the answer is.

2759
02:12:49,380 --> 02:12:51,320
We're a guy like john,
you know,

2760
02:12:51,321 --> 02:12:53,140
I really don't know.
I mean it's a,

2761
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:55,610
he's got to have that come to jesus 
moment.

2762
02:12:55,611 --> 02:12:57,020
Yeah.
Or not.

2763
02:12:57,110 --> 02:12:57,943
You know,
maybe he just keeps doing what he's 

2764
02:12:59,541 --> 02:13:00,374
doing and keeps beating everybody's ass 
and people keep forgiving them and 

2765
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:04,670
hopefully it doesn't wind up in jail.

2766
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:07,460
BuT you should for sure get a driver,
you know,

2767
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:09,260
for sure.
Get someone to fucking driving around.

2768
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:10,820
That's a bad.
that's a good band aid,

2769
02:13:10,850 --> 02:13:12,850
but it's not going to be the problem 
solver.

2770
02:13:12,851 --> 02:13:14,120
Yeah.
The truth is I think,

2771
02:13:14,900 --> 02:13:18,590
I mean we get to live the life that we 
want,

2772
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:20,870
like we get to choose the things that we
do,

2773
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:23,690
like we have free to a certain extent to
a certain extent.

2774
02:13:23,691 --> 02:13:24,524
I know free will is something that's 
been discussed and it's a fascinating 

2775
02:13:27,621 --> 02:13:29,420
concept,
but to some degree,

2776
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:32,070
you know,
we are offering our own lives,

2777
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,993
you know,
and if it isn't going the way that you 

2778
02:13:34,441 --> 02:13:35,274
want it,
small tiny changes can push it a 

2779
02:13:37,831 --> 02:13:38,600
different way.

2780
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:39,433
Yeah.
It's a matter of whether or not he's 

2781
02:13:40,821 --> 02:13:42,510
willing to make those changes.
And you know,

2782
02:13:42,830 --> 02:13:45,800
right now I'm sure he just wants to get 
his license back,

2783
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:46,953
you know,
but like when I see him like having 

2784
02:13:48,981 --> 02:13:52,160
these battles back and forth with chuck 
ladell online,

2785
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:53,003
like bark away from that.
Like chuck liddell's and old warrior 

2786
02:13:57,321 --> 02:14:01,090
who's clearly taken too many shots like 
and you know,

2787
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:06,120
this calling him an old man and saying 
all this stuff and it's like just be the

2788
02:14:07,251 --> 02:14:09,190
better man and this situation.
You're,

2789
02:14:09,191 --> 02:14:12,200
you're the top of the heap right now at 
the top of your game.

2790
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:13,393
You don't want some young guy doIng this
to you 15 years from now talking to you 

2791
02:14:17,751 --> 02:14:18,990
that way.
I mean this is,

2792
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:20,600
these are the dark days,

2793
02:14:21,170 --> 02:14:22,003
but when we turn the tv on,
I don't care if you watch cnn or fox or 

2794
02:14:24,981 --> 02:14:29,981
cnbc or whatever or the nfl or hockey or
fighting or whatever.

2795
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:31,633
A lot of what we see is a bunch of heads
who somebody has said you choose 

2796
02:14:34,670 --> 02:14:38,060
different sides or they know that's what
they should do and then they just argue,

2797
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:39,200
yeah,
we watch it.

2798
02:14:39,230 --> 02:14:41,120
We're taught it.
We see it every single day,

2799
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:42,013
all the time.

2800
02:14:42,390 --> 02:14:43,223
Crazy.
It drives me crazy and fighting the 

2801
02:14:45,281 --> 02:14:46,114
sports guy talk I.
That drives me nuts when it comes to 

2802
02:14:49,771 --> 02:14:50,604
fighting because they have this sort of 
robotic predetermined pattern of 

2803
02:14:55,081 --> 02:14:55,914
behavior that they apply to football and
baseball and and I just feel like 

2804
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:04,440
fighting is more personal,
more intimate.

2805
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:06,780
There's more on the line.
There's more at stake.

2806
02:15:06,781 --> 02:15:07,614
It means more to me and when I see that 
dopey sports guide jock talk applied to 

2807
02:15:12,421 --> 02:15:13,740
fighting,
it makes me angry.

2808
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:14,633
It makes me angry too,
but it for for different reasons as 

2809
02:15:17,281 --> 02:15:19,440
well.
One is this,

2810
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:20,633
this doesn't apply exactly as you said,
and the other one is the city of and 

2811
02:15:23,611 --> 02:15:24,444
apply to football or anything because 
it's ritualistic like it act as if the 

2812
02:15:28,081 --> 02:15:31,080
show doesn't exist,
if that's the reason it looks.

2813
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:34,350
So we were talkIng about how things 
meanings change once upon a time.

2814
02:15:34,351 --> 02:15:38,130
That was a professional speaker.
Now that is a rehearsed over,

2815
02:15:38,131 --> 02:15:38,964
strategized,
constructed artificial speaker and in a 

2816
02:15:41,101 --> 02:15:41,934
world where someone watches the fucking 
joe rogan podcast or goes on and sees 

2817
02:15:45,390 --> 02:15:49,860
dwayne training guys or watches a 
supermodel on instagram or sees what the

2818
02:15:49,861 --> 02:15:51,330
rock has cooking.
Like I said,

2819
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:52,673
we see real people everywhere,
so now this becomes ritualistic and 

2820
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:57,623
artificial.

2821
02:15:57,710 --> 02:16:00,650
It's a strip club dj to hey,
come into the top stage.

2822
02:16:00,710 --> 02:16:05,120
It's like that predetermined sort of 
pattern of behavior.

2823
02:16:05,150 --> 02:16:05,983
The they adopt this pattern and you know
there's a lot of people that adopt that 

2824
02:16:09,711 --> 02:16:13,970
sports guy pattern and there's a lot of 
shitty writers that do it too.

2825
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:15,843
They apply that insulting style of 
Writing to combat sports and some of 

2826
02:16:20,841 --> 02:16:21,674
them have never been inside a cage and 
the fucking life and apparel even 

2827
02:16:23,931 --> 02:16:24,830
trained.
Yeah,

2828
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:25,850
no it,
it's,

2829
02:16:26,450 --> 02:16:30,040
if you,
if you have not been kicked

2830
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:31,690
in the fucking head in front of your 
mother,

2831
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:36,420
you have no right to criticize me.
Fight my fucking god.

2832
02:16:36,450 --> 02:16:38,620
Oh god.
I got.

2833
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:39,543
I wouldn't want that pressure.
So a couple of punches happening and I 

2834
02:16:42,251 --> 02:16:43,084
get caught in a guillotine and I'm 
thinking I'm okay and I'm driving my 

2835
02:16:45,551 --> 02:16:47,680
shoulder in and then I start to go out 
and I'm just.

2836
02:16:47,810 --> 02:16:48,643
And I kind of hit them in the tap and I 
look up and my mom is right fucking 

2837
02:16:51,761 --> 02:16:53,200
there.
She's right there.

2838
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:56,770
and my mom,
my family is wonderful,

2839
02:16:56,771 --> 02:16:57,604
right?
Like I got the best wife that humans 

2840
02:16:59,411 --> 02:17:01,960
have ever had in my parents and her 
parents.

2841
02:17:01,970 --> 02:17:02,803
I'm surrounded by great people and I 
know that my mother literally was 

2842
02:17:06,401 --> 02:17:08,580
looking at me like,
I'm proud of you.

2843
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:10,240
You know,
don't worry,

2844
02:17:10,241 --> 02:17:12,400
this happens,
but my memory has her going,

2845
02:17:14,010 --> 02:17:16,480
well,
she's probably just sad.

2846
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:17,500
Sure.

2847
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:18,810
She's gonna shake shaker here.
Yes,

2848
02:17:19,170 --> 02:17:19,990
it was.
Yeah.

2849
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:23,380
But if you haven't been through that,
if you haven't experienced failure,

2850
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:25,480
if you haven't been carried out on a 
stretcher,

2851
02:17:25,481 --> 02:17:29,080
whereas everybody booze you or felt 
victory or been terrifying,

2852
02:17:29,290 --> 02:17:34,290
you cannot logically criticize them 
because you don't understand the thIng.

2853
02:17:36,570 --> 02:17:39,310
If you haven't done it,
if you have some respect for it,

2854
02:17:39,311 --> 02:17:40,144
I'll respect you.
Just just understand what they're going 

2855
02:17:42,101 --> 02:17:42,934
through.
Like I don't think you necessarily have 

2856
02:17:43,631 --> 02:17:45,700
to have gone to war to be a war 
correspondent,

2857
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:47,730
to understand it,
to talk about it.

2858
02:17:47,740 --> 02:17:48,573
You don't have to have shot someone to 
be able to understand what people are 

2859
02:17:51,731 --> 02:17:54,670
going through or at least try to 
comprehend it,

2860
02:17:54,671 --> 02:17:58,510
but have some respect about it.
There's a way to criticize technique and

2861
02:17:58,511 --> 02:17:59,344
movement without being insulting.
And I think this is a part of the 

2862
02:18:02,141 --> 02:18:02,974
problem with this.

2863
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:06,220
The sports guy attitude isn't insulting 
attitude.

2864
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:07,263
It's a judgmental one that's judgmental 
and mocking and I think they played 

2865
02:18:11,590 --> 02:18:12,423
johnny lunchbox.
I think they play to dumb dumbs and I 

2866
02:18:15,401 --> 02:18:16,234
just.
It really hurts my feelings when I see 

2867
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:21,730
that sort of strategy applied to 
covering mixed martial arts.

2868
02:18:21,870 --> 02:18:23,410
Yeah,
and like I said,

2869
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:24,423
it acts as if as less and less people 
consume this older but valid interface 

2870
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:33,723
television,
less and less and more and more are 

2871
02:18:36,041 --> 02:18:39,640
consuming other things that are 
different and new and and stuff.

2872
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:43,000
It's bizarre that the old one starts to 
say,

2873
02:18:43,001 --> 02:18:44,290
yeah,
well we still do it this way.

2874
02:18:44,460 --> 02:18:45,293
Right?
You can't do it that way because people 

2875
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:47,103
now it looks weird and old now it looks 
as context has changed because we have 

2876
02:18:52,030 --> 02:18:52,863
seen thousands.
We've seen Michael Chandler eight today 

2877
02:18:55,361 --> 02:18:57,940
and how he held his son and this guy is 
saying,

2878
02:18:57,941 --> 02:18:58,571
well,
you know,

2879
02:18:58,571 --> 02:19:00,560
well,
the striker versus grappler like,

2880
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:03,340
and it's just.
They haven't evolved.

2881
02:19:03,370 --> 02:19:03,870
They,
yeah,

2882
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:08,170
you have to step in and this applies to 
us all.

2883
02:19:08,290 --> 02:19:09,123
You have to step in and look at where 
you are and what it's meaning is and 

2884
02:19:11,771 --> 02:19:12,604
realize,
oh,

2885
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:14,260
technology changed.
The audience changed.

2886
02:19:14,261 --> 02:19:15,760
The world changed.
My life changed.

2887
02:19:16,330 --> 02:19:17,980
The economy,
changed the market.

2888
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:20,290
All of these things have changed.
I'm still the same.

2889
02:19:20,470 --> 02:19:21,850
I've met.
I'm a dinosaur.

2890
02:19:21,851 --> 02:19:23,260
That doesn't make sense.
I can't do that.

2891
02:19:23,261 --> 02:19:26,410
I must change,
but the reason sports,

2892
02:19:26,411 --> 02:19:28,010
television,
the nfl or

2893
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:32,060
many of these things,
news doesn't is it starts out that there

2894
02:19:32,061 --> 02:19:34,880
are innovators,
so in fighting it was dana white and the

2895
02:19:34,881 --> 02:19:39,881
fertittas and you guys and this vital 
young innovative creators and then as it

2896
02:19:42,171 --> 02:19:44,540
grows,
you need organized thinkers.

2897
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:48,950
You need people who can organize and 
structure something so that can grow.

2898
02:19:49,430 --> 02:19:50,263
The problem is they get really good at 
structuring hierarchies to get really 

2899
02:19:52,401 --> 02:19:53,234
good at structuring business in such a 
way that they are then in charge and 

2900
02:19:56,541 --> 02:19:58,760
then when it changes,
you need those creatives again,

2901
02:19:59,090 --> 02:19:59,923
but the but these structure guys are 
there and they've built these formulas 

2902
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:05,540
that they are then bound by where it's 
like,

2903
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:06,463
well,
of course we're going starting with the 

2904
02:20:07,041 --> 02:20:09,500
opening shot and then we're gonna go.
We're right here in Brazil,

2905
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:10,573
shot of christ the redeemer,
and then we'll go and here we've got an 

2906
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,250
unbelievable matchup with the winner 
gets a title shot.

2907
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:17,113
Those are rituals was a bizarre 
formulaic rituals created when they 

2908
02:20:20,841 --> 02:20:24,740
mattered and that we're valuable by 
highly intelligent people that that,

2909
02:20:24,980 --> 02:20:27,350
that,
that we're required to make this work.

2910
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:29,810
But now you meet different people,
you need a different thought,

2911
02:20:29,811 --> 02:20:32,960
you need crude the creatives back in and
they usually don't want that.

2912
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:34,763
Yeah.
I think I like your point about 

2913
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:37,313
different approaches and I think one of 
the best ways to maybe perhaps have a 

2914
02:20:41,251 --> 02:20:45,720
different approach is to have more 
intense coverage of training footage.

2915
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:46,301
Great.
You know,

2916
02:20:46,301 --> 02:20:49,680
and I think they're doing that with the 
embedded series of those online things.

2917
02:20:49,681 --> 02:20:50,514
I'd like more people to check those out.
I think if more people got an 

2918
02:20:53,371 --> 02:20:55,590
understanding of how much is involved in
this,

2919
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:57,890
like when people get injured and pull 
out a fight,

2920
02:20:57,891 --> 02:20:58,724
it's like some people will freak out and
complained and write a bunch of stupid 

2921
02:21:01,291 --> 02:21:02,970
shit.
Like I don't know what happened to mirko

2922
02:21:02,971 --> 02:21:06,090
cro cop,
but you can't say anything bad about him

2923
02:21:06,091 --> 02:21:07,910
because he's a superhero.
The guy,

2924
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:09,870
if that guy pulls out of a fight,
you got to go,

2925
02:21:09,871 --> 02:21:10,704
well,
he obviously must be too hurt to fight 

2926
02:21:12,780 --> 02:21:14,970
and this is part of the game,
you know,

2927
02:21:14,971 --> 02:21:15,804
I mean,
but I've read some ridiculous shit that 

2928
02:21:17,221 --> 02:21:18,054
people have said about mirko online.
Like I went to canelo's page the other 

2929
02:21:21,121 --> 02:21:22,710
day,
oh my god,

2930
02:21:22,980 --> 02:21:23,813
this pictures of canelo alvarez and 
people are judging his body and st 

2931
02:21:26,940 --> 02:21:27,773
luke's tiny now and there's all these 
emojis of pills and needles all 

2932
02:21:33,031 --> 02:21:36,810
throughout his entire instagram post is 
fucking.

2933
02:21:36,811 --> 02:21:41,270
The comments are ruthless.
Just ruthlessly fucking insult

2934
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:42,163
thing.
I mean this is just the world we live 

2935
02:21:43,821 --> 02:21:44,340
in.
It is.

2936
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:45,173
It is.
I did a breakdown on vito and like you 

2937
02:21:47,841 --> 02:21:50,900
know,
he'd go and instagram is,

2938
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:52,173
at least in my experience,
is the least negative because it's the 

2939
02:21:54,351 --> 02:21:56,870
newest.
What's the most negatively youtube.

2940
02:21:56,871 --> 02:21:57,550
I agree.
Yeah.

2941
02:21:57,550 --> 02:21:59,540
Probably because it's the oldest,
right?

2942
02:21:59,800 --> 02:22:03,020
It's these elements because as things 
get older,

2943
02:22:03,410 --> 02:22:05,270
a lot of negativity is a random 
positive.

2944
02:22:05,271 --> 02:22:09,020
People leave positive.
People leave because they go on there on

2945
02:22:09,021 --> 02:22:12,740
the early part of the technological 
adoption lifecycle.

2946
02:22:12,870 --> 02:22:13,703
Positive people are innovators and early
adopters and they go onto the newer 

2947
02:22:16,731 --> 02:22:17,564
thing and then you leave behind the 
people who are negative and made the 

2948
02:22:20,151 --> 02:22:22,460
whole place go septic and then they 
argued with each other.

2949
02:22:22,810 --> 02:22:23,280
I wonder.

2950
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:26,070
I wonder if that's the case I want.
I've never figured out

2951
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:26,903
what is wrong with youtube comments,
but there are so ruthless like whenever 

2952
02:22:30,151 --> 02:22:34,020
I have a liberal woman on in particular

2953
02:22:35,340 --> 02:22:38,740
who you have on with an open mind and 
are interested in their perspective.

2954
02:22:38,770 --> 02:22:41,840
Some of them are my friends like abby 
martin when she's on.

2955
02:22:42,110 --> 02:22:45,260
I don't even fucking touch those comms 
or whitney when whitney cummings is on.

2956
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:48,080
I don't look at the comments period 
period.

2957
02:22:48,081 --> 02:22:51,500
But if I did those would be the last 
ones that I would because they've looked

2958
02:22:51,501 --> 02:22:53,780
at them before and like whitney contract
with me and she's like,

2959
02:22:53,781 --> 02:22:54,040
what

2960
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:55,560
the fuck?
And I was like,

2961
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:56,633
don't read that shit.
It's like don't taste the poison that 

2962
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:03,990
wherever the positive people are,
if you're going to spend time.

2963
02:23:04,020 --> 02:23:08,940
And I liked to because if 50,000
people watched me do a break down,

2964
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:13,110
that means a lot to me and if 60 of them
commented,

2965
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:15,990
I'm going to.
If I can schedule in the day 45 minutes,

2966
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:18,390
I'm going to take the time and think as 
many of them as I can,

2967
02:23:18,510 --> 02:23:20,910
but only where the goodwill.
I only where the positive ones are,

2968
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:23,430
not that I want to be reinforced that 
what I'm doing,

2969
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:24,623
but I'm not going to spend the time on 
people who are going through life so 

2970
02:23:27,751 --> 02:23:29,880
negative that I can't get through to 
them anyways.

2971
02:23:30,030 --> 02:23:30,863
Somebody who's going through life 
looking for something and trying to to 

2972
02:23:33,570 --> 02:23:36,780
either be inspired or learn something or
by positive.

2973
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:37,763
Those are the people that you should 
spend time with and it's also like the 

2974
02:23:40,621 --> 02:23:43,160
reverse of giving candy to your kid when
they're bad.

2975
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:46,120
Don't go give those people candy when 
they're negative.

2976
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:49,530
You want them to get away from that.
You want their lives to get better,

2977
02:23:49,531 --> 02:23:52,020
which it will if they stop having that 
behavior.

2978
02:23:52,410 --> 02:23:54,830
Yeah,
maybe of

2979
02:23:54,830 --> 02:23:58,810
them are just so broken,
but it's just like their structure is so

2980
02:23:58,811 --> 02:23:59,644
poor.
The structure of their thinking is so 

2981
02:24:01,571 --> 02:24:02,404
poor and you know,
all a lot of them are shut ins and 

2982
02:24:04,881 --> 02:24:05,714
there's a lot of people with mental 
illness that are just constantly 

2983
02:24:07,691 --> 02:24:09,320
commenting.
I mean,

2984
02:24:09,630 --> 02:24:12,280
and then there's the argument to kill 
the comments,

2985
02:24:12,310 --> 02:24:13,143
but then people get furious at you.
We had an issue for a while and it was 

2986
02:24:16,661 --> 02:24:17,494
an accidental issue and the issue was 
during the stream we don't allow the 

2987
02:24:20,921 --> 02:24:25,921
live chat because it was always like con
to your mother's a like our shit because

2988
02:24:27,371 --> 02:24:28,630
people were just trying to get 
attention.

2989
02:24:28,631 --> 02:24:32,440
If we read that stream while we were 
doing the show,

2990
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:35,980
the show would be inexorably altered,
you know,

2991
02:24:36,160 --> 02:24:38,630
you would you would.
You'd be altered by like what?

2992
02:24:38,740 --> 02:24:39,910
What?
What are you saying?

2993
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,880
Don't say that like you would read it 
and then that would be the show.

2994
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:43,833
The show would be these people as well.
It's just not necessary or valuable 

2995
02:24:48,370 --> 02:24:53,110
because of the fact that we had the 
comments killed during the live feed.

2996
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:55,870
You couldn't.
You couldn't chat during the live feed.

2997
02:24:56,110 --> 02:24:58,300
When we would transfer it over to 
youtube,

2998
02:24:59,250 --> 02:25:00,083
the comments would be disabled and 
people went crazy and I had a tweet 

2999
02:25:03,431 --> 02:25:04,121
about it,
but look,

3000
02:25:04,121 --> 02:25:07,570
I'm not disabling the comments.
I don't know what this glitches,

3001
02:25:07,571 --> 02:25:08,404
but they're going to figure it out.
But she decided to disable his comments 

3002
02:25:12,911 --> 02:25:17,680
on purpose and do they fucking went 
crazy and they were attacking him.

3003
02:25:18,340 --> 02:25:21,990
But what are the numbers that give a 
shit like who?

3004
02:25:22,060 --> 02:25:24,040
Have you ever commented a youtube video?
Have

3005
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,940
you ever watched a youtube video and 
commented on it?

3006
02:25:25,950 --> 02:25:27,820
I don't think I ever have.
I never have either.

3007
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:30,220
I don't know anybody worth a fuck that 
has that.

3008
02:25:30,221 --> 02:25:31,054
That's part of the problem is like I 
know there's some really positive 

3009
02:25:33,401 --> 02:25:34,234
comments and people who are healthy.
People were just interested in debate 

3010
02:25:37,001 --> 02:25:37,834
and discussion about particular topics,
but when you're dealing with all these 

3011
02:25:41,261 --> 02:25:43,030
negative people,
like what are the numbers?

3012
02:25:43,180 --> 02:25:44,013
If you have a million people watching a 
youtube video or are we talking about a 

3013
02:25:47,081 --> 02:25:49,510
100 people?
Is it even.

3014
02:25:49,660 --> 02:25:52,360
I don't even think it's.
It might not even be 100.

3015
02:25:52,361 --> 02:25:53,194
You might be dealing with like 30 
cousins and they're the ones that are 

3016
02:25:56,051 --> 02:25:57,940
going to be mad that you disable the 
comments,

3017
02:25:57,941 --> 02:26:01,510
but is that really matter?
And it is keeping the,

3018
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:02,453
that cesspool open,
keeping that commode open for them to 

3019
02:26:05,801 --> 02:26:10,570
dump their fucking verbal diarrhea into.
Is that really feeding the bay?

3020
02:26:10,690 --> 02:26:12,940
Is that giving the kid candy for being 
an asshole?

3021
02:26:12,970 --> 02:26:13,450
Is it the same

3022
02:26:13,450 --> 02:26:14,283
that maybe maybe I went,
saw you a stand and talk to 600 people 

3023
02:26:20,281 --> 02:26:23,160
who came to a show.
You had an in depth conversation,

3024
02:26:23,161 --> 02:26:27,630
chem trails this and fucking fighting 
that with each of them in the eye.

3025
02:26:27,690 --> 02:26:28,523
You spent for sure four hours when you 
took a bunch of friends out for dinner 

3026
02:26:31,891 --> 02:26:33,660
and invited me,
which was really cool by the way.

3027
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:35,040
Thank you.
I brag about it,

3028
02:26:35,041 --> 02:26:36,040
all of that.
Uh,

3029
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:39,270
and then I saw you walk across.
That was four hours for sure.

3030
02:26:39,930 --> 02:26:41,550
Okay.
Two to four hours.

3031
02:26:41,551 --> 02:26:42,384
I don't know the exact number.
Then I see a walk across the casino and 

3032
02:26:44,910 --> 02:26:49,350
in that time you do it again for another
half hour as you know joey diaz.

3033
02:26:49,490 --> 02:26:50,890
Oh,
you know.

3034
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:53,910
And then we sit down and somebody comes 
over.

3035
02:26:53,911 --> 02:26:55,290
As soon as you sit down and they say,
hey,

3036
02:26:55,291 --> 02:26:56,910
can I go fuck off man,
I'm meeting.

3037
02:26:57,390 --> 02:26:59,940
That's the guy who will tell the world,
joe rogan's an asshole.

3038
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:01,680
That guy say,
fuck off.

3039
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:04,470
Come on man.
I'm whenever I can't.

3040
02:27:04,471 --> 02:27:09,471
You can't just stop your meal.
Every time someone comes over 200 inter,

3041
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:13,260
like human deep interactions,
meaningful interactions,

3042
02:27:13,261 --> 02:27:14,760
that one can fuck off.

3043
02:27:14,830 --> 02:27:16,210
Well,
I don't want to say fuck off.

3044
02:27:16,211 --> 02:27:21,211
I just think that people have this 
distorted idea of space that they should

3045
02:27:21,761 --> 02:27:24,940
just be able to invade your space while 
you literally have a mouthful of food.

3046
02:27:24,941 --> 02:27:25,571
Yeah,
and I mean,

3047
02:27:25,571 --> 02:27:26,650
I've had it happen.
I've had.

3048
02:27:26,651 --> 02:27:28,180
It happened when I was feeding my 
daughter.

3049
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:30,820
Have her in my lap.
He'll go get a selfie and you definitely

3050
02:27:30,821 --> 02:27:32,740
can't get a selfie right now while I'm 
feeding my daughter.

3051
02:27:32,741 --> 02:27:33,970
Get the fuck outta here,
man.

3052
02:27:34,100 --> 02:27:37,150
That's a misunderstanding of,
of space.

3053
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:40,970
Yeah,
there it is.

3054
02:27:40,971 --> 02:27:42,020
A strange thing.
I mean,

3055
02:27:42,260 --> 02:27:46,400
I didn't watch my wife was asking me 
because I was in Singapore.

3056
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:48,770
If I watched the um,
the royal wedding,

3057
02:27:48,771 --> 02:27:49,604
I'm like,
nah,

3058
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:50,753
fuck to stand out at all.
I don't understand the motivation for 

3059
02:27:54,711 --> 02:27:55,540
doing it.
I,

3060
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:59,600
I don't even want to get it through.
But those are still humans.

3061
02:27:59,750 --> 02:28:04,750
Like those are still people.
People don't understand that woman shit.

3062
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:07,850
She thought so this way here.
You know what I mean?

3063
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:09,193
There are people.
And can you imagine if the person who 

3064
02:28:11,470 --> 02:28:12,980
asks you why you're feeding your 
daughter?

3065
02:28:13,070 --> 02:28:14,810
Somebody did that for maybe the first 
time.

3066
02:28:14,811 --> 02:28:15,231
He'd be like,
well,

3067
02:28:15,231 --> 02:28:17,240
I can't believe it's good.
Wants to selfie with me.

3068
02:28:17,241 --> 02:28:19,970
But after that it will be.
You're still living your human life.

3069
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:20,833
Yeah.
I'm the only one you have just can't 

3070
02:28:21,771 --> 02:28:22,280
interrupt

3071
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:25,040
people while they're sitting at dinner 
with their family or with their friends.

3072
02:28:25,041 --> 02:28:28,820
They're sitting there cutting food up.
It's just like they don't owe you that.

3073
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:30,390
Like can.
You shouldn't ask for that.

3074
02:28:30,450 --> 02:28:33,290
It's just not the way to do it.
It's just not.

3075
02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:35,690
And you gotta know when people can't 
stop,

3076
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:38,000
they just can't just say hi.
Can you just say hi?

3077
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:39,193
No one can say hi.
Everybody wants to dress up their 

3078
02:28:40,491 --> 02:28:42,920
facebook.
Everyone needs that fucking selfie.

3079
02:28:42,921 --> 02:28:43,754
It's just like we're.
We're in a weird space with that stuff 

3080
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,400
that,
that whole social media shit.

3081
02:28:49,401 --> 02:28:52,220
Because people want something from you 
that they get up.

3082
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:55,340
It's not just they're a fan and they 
want to say hi.

3083
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:57,850
They want something from you to make 
them look cooler.

3084
02:28:57,860 --> 02:28:59,010
That.
And it's like you,

3085
02:28:59,011 --> 02:28:59,844
you can give them some currency.
It's like you're a pokemon and they can 

3086
02:29:02,481 --> 02:29:03,400
pick you up and

3087
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:05,420
get a point for.
It's weird.

3088
02:29:05,560 --> 02:29:08,840
Really weird.
So I told you,

3089
02:29:08,841 --> 02:29:09,674
I was saying,
oh shit for breezy over doom got flat 

3090
02:29:13,171 --> 02:29:14,780
and he was just going to fight in 
Russia,

3091
02:29:14,781 --> 02:29:16,470
I think against all neck.
Yeah.

3092
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:18,520
Yeah.
Well that's not happening.

3093
02:29:18,540 --> 02:29:20,210
That's a wrap.
That's a wrap on that.

3094
02:29:20,280 --> 02:29:21,760
Well,
he's 40 years old.

3095
02:29:21,761 --> 02:29:24,710
I'm trying to compete in something 
that's a young man's game.

3096
02:29:24,890 --> 02:29:27,440
That's the thing.
It's like you can get mad,

3097
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:31,640
you can get outraged and that's a 
reasonable result,

3098
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:33,980
a reasonable response if you want.
But if you rationalize,

3099
02:29:33,990 --> 02:29:34,823
if you have empathy,
it's like this guy still wants to do 

3100
02:29:36,891 --> 02:29:38,720
this thing that his body won't allow 
them to do.

3101
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:42,230
And so he's willing to bend the rules to
attempt it.

3102
02:29:42,350 --> 02:29:44,260
He failed and now he's going to have to 
pay the.

3103
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:45,853
Yeah,
it's a month after his knock out last 

3104
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:51,160
volkov right?
Volkov fuck yeah.

3105
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:53,730
Dangerous guys.
Fucking dangerous.

3106
02:29:53,820 --> 02:29:54,750
Big,
long,

3107
02:29:54,780 --> 02:29:56,460
tall knockout artists.

3108
02:29:56,650 --> 02:29:58,630
The heavyweight thing is a whole other 
thing.

3109
02:29:59,130 --> 02:29:59,963
The thing man.
And when you get these seven footers 

3110
02:30:01,621 --> 02:30:05,040
that can kick ass like volkov,
that's a fucking nightmare.

3111
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:06,750
What does he like?
He's at least six.

3112
02:30:06,751 --> 02:30:07,130
11,

3113
02:30:07,130 --> 02:30:07,963
right?
Scary.

3114
02:30:08,750 --> 02:30:11,990
He sees a big guys bigger than,
than redoing by a lot.

3115
02:30:11,991 --> 02:30:13,010
So call it six,
six,

3116
02:30:13,011 --> 02:30:13,671
six,
seven,

3117
02:30:13,671 --> 02:30:14,900
somewhere in that range.
Right?

3118
02:30:15,160 --> 02:30:16,400
For dumas,
let six,

3119
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:18,470
four.
Somewhere around that.

3120
02:30:18,471 --> 02:30:21,040
And when we ever met brett rogers,
who's brett?

3121
02:30:21,041 --> 02:30:21,874
Roger,
roger,

3122
02:30:22,030 --> 02:30:25,990
and now brett rogers fought a grim 
rogers.

3123
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:26,853
Yeah.
Yeah.

3124
02:30:28,300 --> 02:30:30,740
That guy.
That's the biggest person I've ever.

3125
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:31,491
Really.
Yeah,

3126
02:30:31,491 --> 02:30:33,950
like I don't know what it was about his 
frame,

3127
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:36,530
but I was trying to interview and it's 
only six,

3128
02:30:36,531 --> 02:30:38,030
nine or six,
eight or something.

3129
02:30:38,031 --> 02:30:41,030
But it was the physical frame of him and
I was just like,

3130
02:30:41,031 --> 02:30:43,870
it was so wild.
A triple h and a restaurant one time.

3131
02:30:43,871 --> 02:30:44,810
And I was like,
whoa.

3132
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:46,340
Like giant dude.
He's,

3133
02:30:46,530 --> 02:30:49,100
he's big,
big athletes like this.

3134
02:30:49,130 --> 02:30:51,630
Like what?
The force that they can generate like in

3135
02:30:51,631 --> 02:30:56,631
god and that ability to,
to create that type of power and impact.

3136
02:30:56,780 --> 02:30:57,613
This is a crazy

3137
02:30:57,650 --> 02:31:01,340
picture of in Ghana standing next to a 
professional basketball player and a god

3138
02:31:01,341 --> 02:31:03,960
who looks like a tiny person.
So weird.

3139
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:07,010
It god who looks like I look what I 
stand next to him.

3140
02:31:07,330 --> 02:31:10,040
Not quite as much contrast but pretty 
ridiculous,

3141
02:31:10,041 --> 02:31:11,030
but there it is.
Look at that.

3142
02:31:11,340 --> 02:31:15,760
it's fucking crazy.
We just,

3143
02:31:15,780 --> 02:31:17,140
there's,
there's more always,

3144
02:31:17,141 --> 02:31:21,060
but I have a chihuahua.
Have a chihuahua and you have your dog.

3145
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:22,800
Put them beside each other and you're 
like,

3146
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:24,590
that can't be the same species.
I know.

3147
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:25,440
It's weird.
Right?

3148
02:31:25,441 --> 02:31:27,360
Then humans are just like dogs in that 
way.

3149
02:31:27,390 --> 02:31:28,111
You know,
we vary.

3150
02:31:28,111 --> 02:31:30,110
so wildly size.
No,

3151
02:31:30,470 --> 02:31:31,860
he listened to it.
Let's wrap this up.

3152
02:31:32,020 --> 02:31:32,853
Um,
tell people where they can get your 

3153
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:37,170
breakdowns,
mma stuff.

3154
02:31:37,380 --> 02:31:39,180
If you're from dublin,
Ireland.

3155
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:41,700
I'm there doing my one man show.
June 22nd.

3156
02:31:41,790 --> 02:31:42,623
How often do you do in this?
I'm doing this will be the fifth I 

3157
02:31:44,221 --> 02:31:46,440
think.
And there was one practice,

3158
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:47,603
one sort of friends and family.
I learned a lot from it then winnipeg 

3159
02:31:49,691 --> 02:31:50,524
than london,
ontario and I did because I knew 

3160
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:53,693
harmonic and now I've got some good 
friends there that would be supportive 

3161
02:31:55,891 --> 02:31:56,460
and that was good.

3162
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:59,400
Then I sold out a little venue in 
toronto and went really,

3163
02:31:59,401 --> 02:32:01,410
really well,
and then now Ireland,

3164
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:06,120
so the 22nd in I'm in Ireland on my 
instagram page you can click through,

3165
02:32:06,121 --> 02:32:08,190
but and john kevin was going to be my 
guest.

3166
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:10,860
Beautiful website.
It's coming up.

3167
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:13,980
It literally could be coming up today or
in the next couple of days.

3168
02:32:13,981 --> 02:32:14,814
I think it's robin black mma.com
and robin black mma on twitter and 

3169
02:32:18,181 --> 02:32:20,730
instagram and if you follow me on 
instagram,

3170
02:32:20,820 --> 02:32:25,280
I set out to do 100 breakdowns in three 
months and I've done 118 10.

3171
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:26,153
That's how you try to develop mastery.
You just got to be prolific and develop 

3172
02:32:29,671 --> 02:32:31,170
a great following.
You know,

3173
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:33,000
it's awesome.
Appreciate you brooks brothers.

3174
02:32:33,001 --> 02:32:35,550
Let's do a scan please.
Robin black ladies and gentlemen.
