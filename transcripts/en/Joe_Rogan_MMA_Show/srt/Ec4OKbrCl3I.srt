1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,370
Yeah,
my oldest one's super.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,713
Here we go.
Five,

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,650
four,
three,

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,240
two,
one.

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,100
Ben Aspirin,
ladies,

6
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:08,880
gentlemen.
Dude,

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,060
I've talked about you on this podcast at
least a dozen times.

8
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,480
You are the number one guy that I'm most
disappointed.

9
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,290
Never fought in UFC.
Yeah,

10
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,590
I always get,
whenever you talk about me,

11
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:20,670
I get like 15 texts.
Like,

12
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:21,504
hey joe,
joe is talking about you now and you 

13
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,940
know,
they'll send me clips or whatever.

14
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,390
So obviously appreciate that.
Um,

15
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:26,941
the.
Yeah,

16
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:27,774
I never,
I never really got to fight those top 

17
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,114
guys.
And it was for reasons beyond my 

18
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:32,640
control.
Yeah,

19
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:34,200
and you're done now.
Yeah,

20
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,040
I saw,
I said,

21
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,320
I said I don't want to say I'm done,
period.

22
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,154
I said I'm done.
Excluding the fact that I get to fight 

23
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,800
and prove I'm number one.
That would be the excluding fest.

24
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:47,070
So if you could get in the UFC you'd be 
willing to do it again.

25
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,510
I mean,
I don't care where it is,

26
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,050
right?
I,

27
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,883
I really genuinely don't.
And obviously that would be the thing 

28
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:53,424
that makes sense,
but there is legislation like the Ali 

29
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:55,710
[inaudible] and the things going 
through.

30
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:57,360
So I don't know that maybe,
you know,

31
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm still 33 so I'm not old and you 
know,

32
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,300
polluted GSP took four years off from 
one flight to next fight.

33
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,163
So I'm not saying I'm an age overnight.
Well your style to you avoided so much 

34
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,354
damage I think.
I think you hit one once this until 

35
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,710
2017.
So yeah,

36
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,080
I didn't get hit once in three fights.
So yeah,

37
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,780
I should tell people you were fighting 
in one FC,

38
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,650
which is a big Asian organizations like 
the Asian version of the UFC.

39
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,740
Yeah.
So one FC started in 2012,

40
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:27,020
I think.
Um,

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,253
obviously my contract with Belcher came 
up in 2013 and then there was that 

42
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,730
negotiation process since I obviously 
went south.

43
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,310
And what happened there?
You were the champ of belt tour and then

44
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,930
all of a sudden you left and everyone 
was like,

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,430
so you're,
you're still undefeated,

46
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,300
right?
I'm undefeated.

47
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:41,220
18 went off,
what the fuck happened?

48
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,580
That beltour let go.
That wasn't what happened.

49
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:47,520
So there's,
there's so much misinformation out there

50
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:48,710
and you know,
uh,

51
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,600
I'm popular but I'm not that popular.
And so a,

52
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:52,434
lots of times in my story gets missed 
toll because I get spoken over by other 

53
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:56,551
people.
Right.

54
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,530
And they don't hear what I say.
So here,

55
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,373
here's what happened.
I'm obviously so prior to me and Bella 

56
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:02,814
tour,
hector and Eddie were the ones that 

57
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:04,531
left,
right?

58
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:05,364
There were.
Hector was the Lombard and Eddie 

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,860
Alvarez.
Alvarez was the UFC.

60
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,860
Both of them.
Both the middleweight champion.

61
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:13,170
Then the lightweight champion.
They both got taken care of pretty well.

62
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:15,180
But if you,
if you remembered Eddie situation,

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,140
I don't know if you remember this,
he got an offer from the UFC still under

64
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:19,860
the matching period.

65
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,620
Beltre beltre says we matched it.
Right.

66
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,340
And in terms of what was in the 
contract,

67
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,450
it was matched.
Right?

68
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,570
But because Belterra has no paper view 
venue,

69
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,230
well if UFC says we'll pay you and pay 
per view belts as well.

70
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,780
We will too.
But that's not real life,

71
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,360
right?
That's what they've done to pay per view

72
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:40,194
shows ever.
And they've never met any type of 

73
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:42,510
threshold.
So you know,

74
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,344
they say imagine what it doesn't say.
I don't know if you remember that they 

75
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:48,390
went to court over it and the UFC one,
Eddie has got the right to.

76
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,590
I'm sorry he didn't.
When he,

77
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,670
he somehow did like a one more fight in 
bellator and then with the UFC,

78
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:56,190
I don't know exactly what the finality 
of that case was,

79
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,160
but anyways,
when that happened,

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,190
his,
his

81
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,190
contract became public knowledge.
Right.

82
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,250
And so a lot of UFC fighters were pissed
because he,

83
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,084
they gave him a whole bunch of money and
so when I was 12 and now I've had my 

84
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,840
last fight in Bellator,
Oregon.

85
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:16,841
Sandra crush coughed July 30th,
May 31st of 2013,

86
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,183
beat him up pretty good.
And then I had a 12 month matching 

87
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,274
period.
And so what was expressed to me by the 

88
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:27,700
UFC brass was that you need to get rid 
of your matching clause and we will make

89
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,534
you an offer,
but we will not make you an offer until 

90
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,560
that happens.
Get rid of your matching.

91
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,730
Yes.
How do you do that?

92
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,631
Well,
here,

93
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,870
here's how I went about doing it exist 
12 months,

94
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:38,770
right?
That's a frequent.

95
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:42,070
I'm not going to sell it for 12 months,
so I'd called Buerger's did it and say,

96
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,570
hey bjorn,
I'm not going to resign.

97
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,750
Please let me this guy who was running 
belt or correct.

98
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:47,190
Yeah.
And now he got fired.

99
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,530
Um,
and bjorn had a terrible reputation,

100
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,860
but I never,
I had a decent relationship with them.

101
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:56,820
I never like butted heads too bad.
So every they said,

102
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,940
bjorn,
let me go.

103
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,590
I'm not coming back.
And then so everyone says,

104
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,090
well,
Bell tour didn't want to resign me.

105
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,850
Well that's not true at all.
Every day is bjorn.

106
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,030
Let me go.
If you aren't,

107
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,810
let me go because,
you know,

108
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,803
I love challenges.
What I love more than anything in the 

109
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:11,580
world is a challenge myself.
If you look at my wrestling career,

110
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,453
that's what it's all about.
Taking the next best thing every single 

111
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,450
time.
And so yeah.

112
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,284
So finally in,
and I'll just time Dana and the UFC is 

113
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,094
saying we want to ask when we were up in
the outskirt I'm ranked number seven in 

114
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,020
the world or you know,
somewhere around there 12 and now.

115
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,293
And so I remember I was going to the 
Asian food store cause I was gonna make 

116
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:33,070
some tom cost soup and bjorn calls me 
and said,

117
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,650
you're released full,
full,

118
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,210
you're released,
you can go.

119
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,590
And I say,
I appreciate that.

120
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,410
So Friday morning was Thursday night,
Friday morning,

121
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,400
it's in November,
sometime in May,

122
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,300
mid November,
I'm morning,

123
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,193
they fax over the release,
my management faxes it to UFC 

124
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:49,924
headquarters and all of a sudden that 
afternoon there's a little scrum 

125
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:53,764
wherever was asking the questions and 
the data says we're not interested in 

126
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:57,760
Ben Aspirin.
And I said,

127
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,120
wait,
what just happened there?

128
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,853
Right?
Because for the last three months they 

129
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,870
were saying we were interested,
where's your where's?

130
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,863
And now I finally produced this full 
release for Bella tour that I got and 

131
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,300
now they're not interested.
And so I said,

132
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,520
wow,
I just got caught in the middle of this.

133
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,850
And was there a reason given also.
Okay,

134
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,350
so the Monday.
So then I say F that I buy.

135
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,160
So I bought a plane ticket to Vegas for 
Monday,

136
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,780
so that was Friday.
That happens.

137
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,070
I say,
fuck that.

138
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,650
I'm going to vegas.
I'm not taking this shit,

139
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:30,484
you know,
so a Monday I buy my plane ticket to 

140
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:33,940
Vegas,
I fly out to Vegas.

141
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:37,360
Do you have to headquarters a lot.
I met with Lorenzo.

142
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:42,361
Dana was on the little speakerphone 
daily and they offered me a contract but

143
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:44,674
it will be confidential and I would have
to fight one fight for the world series 

144
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:49,450
of fighting,
which is like,

145
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,550
well that's bizarre.
What?

146
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,610
Yeah.
And fight for the world series a funding

147
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,970
relationship with the world series.
Like a feeder

148
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,090
organization at that time

149
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,173
thing.
Yeah.

150
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,620
Yeah.

151
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,560
Marlin Mariah's.
Just engage you.

152
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,430
Both those guys came from champs over 
there.

153
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,393
Yeah.
I think the relationship is very hazy 

154
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,440
between the old world series of fighting
in the UFC because there was also.

155
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,030
People don't want the other way.
Right.

156
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:16,240
Andre Arlovski gets dropped in the FC 
goes to world series.

157
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Anthony Johnson,
boom.

158
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,960
All these people.
So they say one fight,

159
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,640
one fight,
world series of fighting.

160
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,370
We will pay Zoopla.
We'll pay you what you do.

161
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:27,010
One fight.
I say let that's F it up,

162
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,900
but okay.
I said,

163
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:30,490
I don't think anyone's gonna go for it,
but I'll do it.

164
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,120
So I leave and uh,
about six hours later I got a phone call

165
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,050
and says,
that deal is no longer available.

166
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:41,080
We're not going to make you an offer.
Yeah.

167
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,290
So wow.
And you have no idea why?

168
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,941
Well,
I,

169
00:06:44,941 --> 00:06:45,410
I,
so I,

170
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,243
here's my guess.
I've never got to sit face to face 

171
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,060
meeting and say,
what was your problem with me?

172
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:52,270
I think there's four things.
My mind,

173
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,180
number one,
he didn't really like me.

174
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,163
I'm stemming from the.
I called them out on the steroid thing 

175
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,163
where he said,
it's impossible and this is where I 

176
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,390
disagree,
is impossible to test all UFC athletes.

177
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,811
I said,
well,

178
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:05,644
that's not true.
You started does it all over the world 

179
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:07,930
for all kinds of athletes.
Right.

180
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,820
You can do it.
It's just expensive,

181
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,430
but let's just call it what it is.
You're a private business.

182
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:13,630
You don't have to do drug tests.

183
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,340
It's good.
Obviously they do it now.

184
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,690
Do it now.
Do it through Usada.

185
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,750
So you were totally right.

186
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,290
Yeah.
So I was correct and now.

187
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:20,921
But that was,
you know,

188
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:24,970
when Dana is wrong in an argument and 
he's got this huge army that follows him

189
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,043
and he said I'd rather hit.
I think his quote was bet because I'd 

190
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:29,860
rather watch fucked and better ask him 
fight,

191
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:31,650
you know,
I think he said something like

192
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,620
ambien takes.
Ben Asked her if it goes asleep.

193
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,050
Yeah,
there there's a few of them.

194
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,430
So the personal attacks started.
Right.

195
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,930
So that,
that's number one.

196
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,003
Number two,
my fighting style is not highly 

197
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:42,134
attractive,
but I also think that's a little bit of 

198
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:48,551
fake news because if you look at 
Georgetown peers to consistently knobs,

199
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,690
Mcgregor's trumped him,
but only a couple of times,

200
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:51,950
but if you will,
a consistent basis.

201
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,900
George Saint Pierre is the number one 
draw of all time.

202
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,810
He heavily relied on takedowns and 
ground and pound.

203
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,290
I mean he didn't have a finish in like 
five years or something.

204
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:00,610
Let me

205
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,443
say what my take has always been on you 
and that style is that it's important 

206
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,230
and that it really.
It really works.

207
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,260
What you're able to do really works.
And I've always said this,

208
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:12,094
and it was proven on a Saturday night in
this deep Emile Francis and modified 

209
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,920
wrestling is the most important part of 
MMA.

210
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,900
Absolutely.
Ability to take the fight to the ground.

211
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,210
Obviously Steve Bay has a lot of other 
attributes.

212
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,160
He took tremendous punches in that 
fight.

213
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,173
I mean,
I know you didn't get a chance to watch 

214
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:26,890
it,
but I saw some highlights that.

215
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:29,470
Holy Shit,
I mean the first round was chaos.

216
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,333
I mean Francis and Ghana was a 
terrifying guy and Steve Bay took the 

217
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:34,570
shots,
use great movement.

218
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:38,050
You striking of his own,
but most importantly after awhile he got

219
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,870
his wrestling going and then once he got
in to the ground and gone,

220
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:41,860
I didn't have any answers.

221
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,870
He didn't know what to do.
What your,

222
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,540
what you've been able to do to guys like
Douglas Lema,

223
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,480
who just fought rory macdonald for the 
bell to our title.

224
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,343
Really good fight chorus goff,
who is another fantastic fight who was 

225
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,393
beaten a lot of really top guys.
You're able to use your wrestling and 

226
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:59,670
completely nullify all their striking 
and offense.

227
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,560
Yeah,
that's a huge part of fighting.

228
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,770
Fighting is not what's exciting for 
people to watch,

229
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,753
fighting is what actually works and what
you've been able to do time and time 

230
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,774
again is take these guys who looked like
world beaters and completely nullify 

231
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:14,784
their offense,
taken to the ground and beat the shit 

232
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:17,310
out of him.
That's huge.

233
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,690
That's very,
very important.

234
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,561
Yeah,
absolutely.

235
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,394
And so,
you know,

236
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,960
not so we can get back to the UFC thing,
but.

237
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,890
So yeah,
I mean when I started fighting,

238
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,851
right,
it was just like,

239
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,451
hey,
let's go fight.

240
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,850
I,
I didn't really have a coaching and so I

241
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,910
didn't move to Duke's until two.
One soup.

242
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,601
Rufus.
Yes.

243
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:36,180
Until 2010 I think.
So I started.

244
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,480
No,
No,

245
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,590
2011.
I'm sorry,

246
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,573
because I was in Arizona.
I was coaching for Arizona State 

247
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,400
University,
but when I moved there,

248
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,271
I know,
hey,

249
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:43,104
the uh,
there's a lot of elite strikers in this 

250
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:44,850
gym.
I said,

251
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,890
I'm,
I'm never going to be elite striker,

252
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,950
but if no one can hit me,
they can't beat me.

253
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,650
They're not going to last me.
They're not going to have crap on me.

254
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,990
They're not going to beat me if they 
can't knock me out,

255
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:56,340
they're not going to beat me.
Plain and simple.

256
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,280
So my whole goal was how do I not get 
hit,

257
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,403
not I,
I don't need to be a great striker 

258
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,490
hitting people.
I just need to not get hit.

259
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,324
If you can't knock me out,
I'm going to eventually get you on the 

260
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,460
ground and I'm going to beat your ass.
Right?

261
00:10:06,461 --> 00:10:07,294
Right.
And so that was kind of my whole goal 

262
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,710
when I got an MBA.
It's how do I not get knocked out?

263
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,360
Right.
And so you said,

264
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,194
obviously I found a really good way to 
do that and it added a lot of longevity 

265
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:17,424
in my career where I wasn't taking 
damage a lot of other people were 

266
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:22,014
taking.
And I think there's also a lot of other 

267
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,100
things to being a really high level 
wrestler that you know,

268
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,980
besides obviously you can control where 
the fight happens,

269
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:29,814
right?
But there's a lot of other things that 

270
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,190
high level wrestling provides us,
right?

271
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,103
That came from that world that other 
disciplines don't get a lot of 

272
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:40,080
competition.
We compete thousands of times.

273
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,340
Right?
How to get our mind right.

274
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,750
I'm these wrestlers are just strong and 
there's just a different strength.

275
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:48,990
I just actually I got to go workout with
term burrows last week because a midtown

276
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,620
world champ and it's like,
you forget how strong wrestlers are.

277
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:53,640
Like you grabbed them.
You're like,

278
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,500
good God.
This guy is like,

279
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,380
you know,
I don't feel that from and people.

280
00:10:57,381 --> 00:10:58,500
I grabbed him and I'm like,
oh my.

281
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,611
Everywhere.
It's like,

282
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:02,340
there's no worries week.
I'm very,

283
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:03,360
very disciplined,
right?

284
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,203
Because wrestlers like we've been in the
system from youth wrestling high school 

285
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:08,700
wrestling to college said,
well we're under,

286
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,713
you know,
coaches and have a very strict training 

287
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:14,280
plan and understand how to put a 
training regimen together where a lot of

288
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:17,310
other martial arts don't have that kind 
of structured system.

289
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:21,360
So I think there's a lot of advantages 
that we as a wrestlers have when we come

290
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:21,950
into mixed martial arts.

291
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,440
And if I could add to that,
the intention is pure.

292
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,380
It's pure for competition because 
there's no financial reward.

293
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:29,540
It's not a bunch of people that are 
getting into wrestling because they want

294
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,374
to get rich.
It's a bunch of people that really want 

295
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:32,204
to prove that they're the best and so 
you have so many top flight guys that 

296
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:39,710
are incredibly mentally strong feeding 
off of each other,

297
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,753
knowing that they're going to be 
competing against each other and almost 

298
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:46,370
no financial possibilities except for 
coaching.

299
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,290
Well yeah,
there's.

300
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,123
I mean now so 2018 to 20 2008 when I was
wrestling and then when I decided to 

301
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:53,530
make that jump mma

302
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,610
there is a lot better financial 
structure for senior level athletes now.

303
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,503
None of them are getting rich and 
there's only about a dozen of them 

304
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:03,280
making a decent living.
Right.

305
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,260
And so,
which is crazy.

306
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:06,940
There's thousands of wrestlers.
Exactly.

307
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:07,774
So your points mostly correct,
but there are a handful of top United 

308
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,133
States athletes now who can do nothing 
but Russell where when I was in in 2008 

309
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:15,670
when I was trained,
that wasn't even the case.

310
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,370
I had to go do camps.
I was coaching at Missouri,

311
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,710
so I was doing other things in addition 
to wrestling.

312
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,980
So like an Olympic athlete.
What,

313
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:24,870
what else would they do to make money?
Well,

314
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:27,520
so like in 2008 I was doing a lot of 
camps,

315
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,930
right?
You can travel around the country,

316
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:29,950
do,
can't make money.

317
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,160
I'm coach a college team that was making
money that way.

318
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,990
So the handful of things like that,
like wow,

319
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:37,090
it wasn't just wake up and train every 
single day,

320
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,770
but the athletes of today that you were 
saying,

321
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,790
now that's what they're doing.

322
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,270
That's it coaching and bunch of 
different things here.

323
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:42,580
No,
no,

324
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:42,911
no,
no.

325
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:43,744
Some of them don't have jobs saying that
just do it from where are they getting 

326
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,160
the money?
Jordan burroughs and James Green,

327
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:51,220
for example,
sponsorships are slightly more lucrative

328
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,083
than they were.
Then there's something called the 

329
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,610
regional training center system,
um,

330
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,560
which,
you know,

331
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:57,394
most major colleges have one that's a 
lot more lucrative and that's 

332
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:00,641
fundraising,
right?

333
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:01,474
They're not,
they're not earning money that the RTC 

334
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,630
people go say,
hey,

335
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,910
rich guy,
would you like to fund this program?

336
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,770
That'll help us develop Olympic 
athletes.

337
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,911
Sure.
Okay.

338
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:11,800
Right.
And then the United States,

339
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,420
a USC has slightly more funding given to
USA wrestling than in the past.

340
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,840
Well,
it's the tragic story of John Dupont.

341
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,950
I mean,
that's literally why that whole,

342
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,200
if people have seen that movie,
what movie?

343
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,370
Carl Fox.
Fox catcher.

344
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,204
Yeah.
Awful too crazy story of Dave and Mark 

345
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,703
Schultz and this millionaire or 
billionaire crazy guy wound up shooting 

346
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,853
Dave Schultz and uh,
was just Weirdo guy that was running 

347
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:39,664
this camp and these guys kind of got 
stuck training with this gap because I 

348
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,960
mean,
and that's 96 was when Schultz got shot.

349
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,793
Right?
And so that's 12 years prior to my 

350
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:53,170
Olympic birth and,
and so then it's even worse.

351
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,720
I mean these guys are literally making 
nothing.

352
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:56,920
And then,
you know,

353
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,220
let me go back to the argument of 
amateurism and the Olympics is stupid,

354
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:03,520
which was abolished like 92 with the 
dream team was kind of totally abolished

355
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:05,150
with amateurism.
But yeah,

356
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:06,970
those guys in that era,
the 84,

357
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,260
88,
92 90,

358
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,240
they were making nothing.
And so when this guy,

359
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:13,690
John Dupont offers them money and 
stipends and places to live,

360
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,920
they don't really have a better option 
and it's freaking sad to be honest about

361
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:18,754
it.
And then obviously USA wrestling 

362
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,370
sanctioned him because he gave you as a 
resident a lot of money.

363
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:22,990
So yeah,
it was really bad thing.

364
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:23,824
And,
and so we're doing a lot better in 2018 

365
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:26,284
than we were 10 years ago and way,
way better than we were doing 20 years 

366
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:29,644
ago.
Yeah.

367
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:33,460
The Olympic thing where they try to 
treat the Olympics,

368
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:38,461
like it's an amateur sport event,
it's a business you're making absolutely

369
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,480
aliens and billions of dollars off these
athletes who get paid zero is to me it's

370
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:47,290
disgusting.
It's just this relic of ancient thinking

371
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,350
and these guys are using it to steal 
money from young athletes.

372
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:51,980
That's what I think.
I

373
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,080
think the other thing is theft.
Yeah.

374
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,923
I usually don't know who ma,
who's more evil than us or the IOC or 

375
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:58,844
the NCA because NCA runs right along the
same lines and I think both are pretty 

376
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,220
evil in both are archaic and both DDB 
changed.

377
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,063
And you know,
if you could abolish the NCAA and the 

378
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:09,764
IOC,
that'd be fantastic for athletes 

379
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:11,780
worldwide.
Yeah.

380
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,490
Well,
especially when you look at the football

381
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:14,324
teams that are getting literally 
billions and billions of dollars every 

382
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:20,990
year and these athletes are ruined in 
their lives.

383
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,630
I mean football players that may be play
one,

384
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,720
two seasons,
if they're lucky,

385
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,603
they get their back blown out,
their legs get blown out and then they 

386
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:33,650
never have an nfl career and meanwhile 
the university has made tons of money,

387
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,540
tons of money and they make nothing.
Yeah,

388
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,810
and to make that even worse because I 
actually had to.

389
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,880
I had a whole podcast about this 
argument with someone and to make that,

390
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,950
and we're on the same side of this,
but to make it even worse,

391
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,440
if you're an ncaa athlete,
Joe,

392
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,610
you can't even make money off your own 
image and likeness.

393
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,463
Yeah.
You can't have a youtube channel where 

394
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:49,334
you can say it's crazy.
So not only will they not pay you 

395
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:54,530
anything,
which I think we can debate and argue on

396
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,364
that,
but the fact that they can't make money 

397
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:58,700
off their own name,
own image and likeness,

398
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,030
that's should be criminal for that to 
happen.

399
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,440
Jim,
you were telling me about this right?

400
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:04,274
Like a guy got in trouble for having a 
youtube channel where punter for like a 

401
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,160
college football team or a kicker to 
remember his name.

402
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,260
I don't remember his name at all and 
there was a.

403
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:15,500
There was a wrestler from the University
of I to say University of Minnesota.

404
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,260
He made a rap album and he had to either
quit the wrestling team or or donate all

405
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:25,510
the money back or something like that.
It's like Rah Rah rap in wrestling.

406
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:27,140
Have they have nothing to do with each 
other.

407
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:27,974
The fact that he can't go make money off
freaking recording an album is 

408
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,920
mindblowing.
It's disgusting because you're keeping a

409
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:37,040
kid from being industrious.
Keeping a a young guy.

410
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,420
I was trying to find his way through the
world.

411
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:42,500
You keeping them from being successful,
but though that kind of success,

412
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,810
like figuring out a way to make some 
money off of our name,

413
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:47,750
doing rap that could lead to all sorts 
of paths in life.

414
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:50,180
Like he's.
He's learning as a young guy like,

415
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:51,910
hey look,
I could be industrious.

416
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,660
I can go do this.
I can be creative.

417
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:54,830
I can go do that.
Like,

418
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:55,664
this is what we should be encouraging 
people to do to take chances and make 

419
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:58,490
money.

420
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,323
The idea that you're saying like somehow
or another this spoils his amateur 

421
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,610
athletic standing.
It's just stupidity.

422
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,270
I think it's fucking disgusting.
It drives me nuts.

423
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,270
Agree.
One hundred percent.

424
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:11,530
It just drives me crazy.
So we're back to your situation with the

425
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,690
UFC.
So the UFC says we're not interested in,

426
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,160
you know,
offer no offer.

427
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,880
So Bella tours released you.
So I,

428
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:21,350
I had spent three months.
Do you think you,

429
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,180
do you feel like the use might've 
played?

430
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,610
They played me her cell.
Okay.

431
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,360
So number the reasons David doesn't like
me,

432
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,860
number one.
Number two,

433
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,840
my style and not that great,
right?

434
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,800
Didn't you say something like he's a 
bald steroid.

435
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,120
So it was mostly after the fact that,
you know,

436
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,970
after that went down that I really 
torture.

437
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:38,601
Um,
but,

438
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:39,620
um,
you know,

439
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,330
but the original one was he's lying 
about the Usada thing.

440
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,193
So that was the simpler the.
So those people who say me and Dana had 

441
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,100
beef prior to me

442
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,540
not getting an offer.
Have you met him?

443
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,850
Yeah,
I mean,

444
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,480
yeah.

445
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,000
Talk to them.
We've never had a length conversation.

446
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,180
So great guy.
A lot.

447
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,610
When you get the wrong impression of 
him.

448
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,960
I mean,
I really love the guy.

449
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,823
Yeah,
you and I have had different 

450
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:02,084
experiences.
I just feel like I should be there when 

451
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:07,160
people have experienced.
Let me let you know the Dana.

452
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,120
I know.
Yeah.

453
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,993
So,
um,

454
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,470
so that would be two.
Number three,

455
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:11,304
I think obviously stealing a key piece 
away from Bella tour was important to 

456
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:15,460
them.
Um,

457
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,823
and then number four,
I think they thought I really had the 

458
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:19,854
ability to be their champion and if 
someone can be a belt or champion and 

459
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:26,430
make this transition directly to the IFC
and then be the UFC champion.

460
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,340
I,
you know,

461
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,190
didn't remember this when they're going 
on right down.

462
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,920
Spike now that bell toward.
Use that to say,

463
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:32,790
look,
we're the same.

464
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,380
He was a champion.
He's a champion there.

465
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,100
So I think those four things are.
And I've had,

466
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,480
I've never got to sit down face to face 
Dana and say,

467
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:41,820
why was there no offer that I've never 
gotten?

468
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,893
You know,
like when Anthony Pettis was the champ 

469
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:46,500
and I'm helping coach him,
or Tyra was,

470
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,280
I've haven't had more than five words a 
day in passing.

471
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,113
Right.
And so it will be really interesting to 

472
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:53,184
me to sit down and say what was the tell
me for real because I have my 

473
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,350
assumptions on what the deal was,
but I don't really know.

474
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,184
And then if I have to add number five,
number five is I think he got the idea 

475
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:05,480
that I would never be a yes man,
which I'm not going to be.

476
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,800
Never would be where Dana really kind of
likes the yes man champion to me.

477
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,700
You see he's got,
he's got some heat with Tyron,

478
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,500
he's got some heat with steep bay as we 
saw on Saturday night and he dated.

479
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,433
Really struggles with the personalities 
that won't cater to what he wants to 

480
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:22,110
happen.
Well,

481
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,040
fighters very rarely are.
Yes men.

482
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,590
Then that's by nature of who they are a 
little bit.

483
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:29,480
Yeah.
Especially the really good ones,

484
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:32,120
especially as things start going well 
and start going their way.

485
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:34,200
They realize they're the fucking man.
I mean this is.

486
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,320
If you're the guy who running the 
division,

487
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:37,760
you're the guy who's running the 
division,

488
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,440
you're not going to take any shit from 
anybody.

489
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,733
Yeah,
but that's [inaudible] you see as some 

490
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:44,610
of these guys ascend right up the ranks,
they do.

491
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:46,740
Like John Jones started having trouble 
with Dana.

492
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,860
Right.
But didn't have it.

493
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,953
He was.
Jones was having trouble with 

494
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,743
everybody's.
His problems I think had very little to 

495
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:56,830
do with Dana and more to do with his 
actions outside of the cage.

496
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,950
I mean inside the octagon he was.
And the way he was promoted,

497
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:01,420
he was promoted.
Fantastic.

498
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:03,280
But he's just crazy.
Yeah.

499
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,170
John's crazy.
You know John Is.

500
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,123
John needs a babysitter.
That means the baddest motherfucker at 

501
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:09,094
205 ever.
He just had to let him drive a car 

502
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:12,724
anymore.
When you got that much money is beyond 

503
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:18,721
me like pace to pay your body 40 grand a
year and have him drive you permanently.

504
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,090
Like why he was driving his own car.
Yeah.

505
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,840
That one's beyond me.
Well,

506
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:23,674
they didn't know until they bought them 
a Bentley and then he wrapped it around 

507
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:27,910
a tree,
but that's when.

508
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,710
That's when they should have known and 
then,

509
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:30,544
but then there was the other one where 
he hit and that was the hit and run was 

510
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,130
after that one.

511
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,963
Yep.
The hit and run was after that one and 

512
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:36,310
then there was the other one.
We got pulled over,

513
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:39,250
speeding and he told the cop to go fuck 
himself.

514
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,390
Terrible decisions.
He's a fucking wild.

515
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,933
That's why he's so good.
But one of the reasons why he's 

516
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,760
absolutely.
But then you put,

517
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:49,440
you've got to put safeguards in place,
right?

518
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,283
Like,
like you're making how many million a 

519
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:52,600
year?
Multiple.

520
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,523
At least for sure.
You can't pay someone 40 grand to drive 

521
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,490
you around this and you're preaching to 
the choir.

522
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,693
I mean,
I wish I could clone me and send me all 

523
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:04,050
to all these stamps.
John,

524
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,110
listen to me.
Everything's gonna be fine.

525
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,810
I've got a driver.
We got a cadillac escalade out here.

526
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,770
Wherever you want to go,
we're going to have some fun,

527
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,970
but no driving,
no driving.

528
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,740
We don't need driving.
We've got me.

529
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,600
We've got fun.

530
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,340
Let's go.
Oh my gosh.

531
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,210
I mean,
seriously.

532
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:19,691
Yeah.
Well,

533
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:22,810
that's what you would have if you had 
like,

534
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,561
you know,
it's,

535
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:25,020
I don't know what he's doing.
I don't know.

536
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,850
I never been to albuquerque.
I don't know how he's living,

537
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,180
but he can't,
he can't babysit everybody.

538
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:33,910
You got the UFC has 500 fighters on its 
roster.

539
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,520
I mean,
how many of those guys are prone to wild

540
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,250
behavior?
I would say three of them.

541
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:38,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

542
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,880
And most of them,
right?

543
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,714
Yeah.
High risk males that play a sport where 

544
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:45,250
you have potential to be hurt every 
single time you step out on the job.

545
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,503
Yeah.
But when you're making millions of 

546
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,873
dollars,
you got to put safeguards against 

547
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:50,800
yourself.
Yeah.

548
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:51,634
But I think also what makes John so good
is this self confidence and he probably 

549
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,060
was like,
I got it.

550
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,800
Yeah.
Fucked up before when I got it now.

551
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,693
So I'm really into sports psychology and
I want someone to write this book 

552
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:06,090
because no one's ever written it,
but I think there's this,

553
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:06,924
uh,
I call it the hypocritical elite 

554
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,990
athlete.
So there's two sides to every coin.

555
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:13,390
Right?
And if you're a really elite athlete,

556
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:14,224
you need both sides of those corner.
And I'll give you a great example 

557
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:16,570
because it's kind of what you're talking
about.

558
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,290
There's these guys who are ultra elite 
prepares to eat right,

559
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,200
sleep right,
they train,

560
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,050
right?
They do everything right,

561
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,273
right?
But then if one little thing goes wrong 

562
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:27,400
and it messes with them,
right?

563
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,800
If they don't get the right food or 
their weight cuts bad,

564
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,570
they start panicking,
right?

565
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,640
And then on the opposite side of the 
coin,

566
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:35,230
there's these cowboys,
right?

567
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,450
And they're just like,
I'm not going to eat right.

568
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,470
I'm not going to sleep right.

569
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,170
I'm not gonna do anything right?
But one time step in the cage,

570
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,930
I'm a fight my ass off and nothing's 
going to bother me.

571
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,730
Right?
And so you need,

572
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,380
you need both sides of those coins to 
make,

573
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,500
to make it whole.
And so you want someone ideally who does

574
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:53,620
everything right?
But at the same time when when something

575
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:56,290
goes wrong or their toe hurts or 
whatever,

576
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,700
they could just say,
well,

577
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,010
it doesn't really matter.
I'm going to go compete anyways.

578
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,350
Right?
You want to have both sides of those and

579
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:02,184
that's where I think a lot of the UFC 
fighters are more on the cowboy side of 

580
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:04,960
it.
Like,

581
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,793
well,
I'm not going to do a lot of things 

582
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,330
right,
but I'm just going to go.

583
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,273
I'm on firearms,
going to fight like cowboy example and 

584
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,620
yeah,
the namesake of my argument.

585
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,260
Yeah.
Yeah,

586
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,530
that's a good point.
And it,

587
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,413
it is a,
it's probably one of the more 

588
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:23,770
fascinating things about any form of 
high stress,

589
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:24,604
high level competition is there's no 
real guidelines of how to prepare your 

590
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:28,310
mind.
You know,

591
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,163
I mean everybody teaches you how to 
wrestle and it teaches you how to 

592
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:31,894
kickbox.
There's all these martial arts schools 

593
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:34,264
that teach you.
Technique is very few real like rock 

594
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,460
solid program of,
uh,

595
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,620
how to,
how to manage your mind.

596
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,280
Absolutely.
I think you should be taught almost like

597
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,270
in,
in,

598
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,890
in a step by step basis.
Like,

599
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,450
Hey,
you get a flat tire.

600
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:52,640
Do you kick,
you scream?

601
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,530
Or do you just go,
this is what it is.

602
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,364
And Hey,
I could have been born in Ethiopia with 

603
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:57,650
Noah,
right?

604
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:00,440
I could be living in a fucking coal mine
somewhere.

605
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,251
No,
I'm lucky.

606
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:02,200
I'm fortunate.
Nothing.

607
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,590
This is a minor setback.

608
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,760
Know.
And so like I,

609
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,160
I actually started going to graduate 
school for sports psychology.

610
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:07,994
I got nine of the 36 credits done and 
then I actually got a scholarship to go 

611
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,240
further and get it paid for.
Um,

612
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,570
but I was just,
I was traveling so much that was 2007,

613
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,423
eight when I was trying to make the 
Olympic team and I was gone all the 

614
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:20,444
time.
And then once I was out of school for a 

615
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,490
year,
I was just like,

616
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,710
there's no freaking way I'm going,
I'm not going back to school.

617
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,563
Not going to sit in a class.
You're not going to freaking write 

618
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:30,470
papers.
I'll still study sports psych on my own.

619
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,543
Right.
And so actually every Monday I do 

620
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,840
something called a mental Monday,
one of my facebook pages and just people

621
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,600
messaged me questions and I talk about 
the mental aspect because you're right,

622
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,250
there aren't enough people to talk about
it.

623
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,083
And then,
you know,

624
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,400
in wrestling is actually this company 
that's been highly successful.

625
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:44,234
I'll call wrestling mindset and they 
have a training program for athletes' 

626
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:50,090
minds because there's nothing out there.
Is there a website for this?

627
00:24:50,091 --> 00:24:50,440
Yeah,
right.

628
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,980
It's wrestling mindset.com.
No kidding.

629
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,380
That's great ends.
They're starting to.

630
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,880
That'll apply to everything.
Well,

631
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,260
they're starting to expand,
expand and in different disciplines.

632
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:58,094
But you're right.
I think,

633
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,323
I think there's these general principles
of sports psych which can kind of go 

634
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,980
into any domain.
Right.

635
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:04,814
And you're,
you're a hundred percent correct that 

636
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:07,370
every single individual is different.
Right.

637
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:09,020
And one of the,
like for me,

638
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,130
uh,
I'm,

639
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,510
I'm an overthinker,
right?

640
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,430
I'm obsessive.
I'll do something over and over and over

641
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:14,390
and over it again.
Right.

642
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,463
And so like when I was 14 I was at the 
big national tournament and I was 

643
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:18,884
obsessing about who I'd have to wrestle 
and all this stuff and it warmed me up 

644
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:21,650
mentally.

645
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,200
I got my ass kicked right.
And my coach said,

646
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:27,200
hey,
I was that person many,

647
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:29,990
many years ago and it helped me just 
talk about fishing.

648
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:31,260
Right?
Because that maybe because I,

649
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,680
if I don think I don't want to think 
about what I'm going to do,

650
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm not one of those guys because I 
think about it too much.

651
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:38,810
All obsessed.
And so ever since age 15,

652
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:39,644
I've,
I've always taught myself to train 

653
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:44,780
myself to not think about the 
competition within like,

654
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,010
you know,
six hours,

655
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,840
right?
So maybe the day before I can think of a

656
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,980
couple of days before I can think about 
it.

657
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,110
But like even when I'm in MMA locker 
room,

658
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,093
I'm not thinking about my fight my minds
off of it because if I'm not federal 

659
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:59,390
understand what my strategy is going to 
be by six hours before.

660
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,180
And I haven't trained myself by six 
hours before a fucked.

661
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,370
I'm already fucked.
Like what am I going to do?

662
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,570
Six hours a brilliant strategy in six 
hours,

663
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:10,410
you know,
so like $6,

664
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,353
you know,
I,

665
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,293
I intentionally fly people to my fights 
who are just my friends who have no 

666
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:17,714
intention of telling me what to do mma 
wise and just want to bullshit 

667
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,290
backstage,
right?

668
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,153
Because really smart keeps me really 
calm because otherwise I started 

669
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:26,270
obsessing and that's going to lead to 
some really negative.

670
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:28,160
So that's like one thing is where,
you know,

671
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,410
but some people are the opposite,
like the f off too much.

672
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:32,090
You kinda gotta bring them back to 
focus.

673
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,180
Right.
You know,

674
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,060
in other sports,
that concept is,

675
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,350
is what they'll learn.
You do.

676
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:37,184
You want going into the competition.
Some people you got to get them amped 

677
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:39,890
up.
Some people,

678
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,600
most people you've got to calm them down
quite a bit.

679
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,950
Like let's relax,
let's execute because we need to.

680
00:26:43,951 --> 00:26:44,340
Anthony

681
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,480
and I execute.
Right.

682
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,463
So I think there's a lot of these sports
psych concepts that can crossover many 

683
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:51,480
different genres,
but you're right,

684
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:52,314
no one trains you about it.
I think it's a huge part of the sport 

685
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,650
and it's,
it's,

686
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,500
it's overlooked because the sport is not
just.

687
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:00,000
And I think this is true with every 
sport,

688
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,160
the sport's not just the movements that 
you make,

689
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:06,930
it's what's going on inside the machine,
who the manager of the body is the mind.

690
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:07,764
And if the manager is like poorly formed
and the structures all out of whack and 

691
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,890
you have like whenever a problem comes 
up,

692
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:17,820
you fall right into a pit and do all 
these things should be addressed and you

693
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:22,410
should develop this mindset and develop 
the ability to manage your mindset.

694
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,760
And He,
I think at a young age,

695
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,830
I think it's really critical.
Yeah.

696
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:26,790
No,
I totally agree.

697
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:27,624
And you know,
I think,

698
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,513
I think one issue thing,
which I don't know if it's going to 

699
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:31,170
happen,
man,

700
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,790
or now we'll see,
right.

701
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,403
There's very few people who came from a 
wrestling background that are head 

702
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:39,000
coaches of MMA teams.
Right?

703
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:39,834
Who came from this very,
very structured environment of college 

704
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,650
wrestling.
It's like you go to,

705
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:47,190
I want you to remember my first training
camp to American top team in Florida and

706
00:27:47,191 --> 00:27:48,600
I show up.
It's 11:00

707
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,090
practice chill,
but 11:00.

708
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,890
Where's,
where's everyone at?

709
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,050
Right.
And then we start at 1145,

710
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:57,420
like 45 minutes late and that's the next
day.

711
00:27:57,421 --> 00:27:58,254
I'm like,
well am I am and 1145 or should I show 

712
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,610
up at 11?
Because we say 1145,

713
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:03,923
I can show up,
blah,

714
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,390
so I show up at 1130 and then they 
started 1120,

715
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,240
you know like what the hell.
Whereas in college wrestling,

716
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,750
if you're a minute late you're going to 
get punished to college wrestling.

717
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,400
Right.
It's a very structured,

718
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,820
organized system,
so I'm very curious to see the day where

719
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,410
there is an MMA team that is very 
structured like a college wrestling team

720
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:23,244
would be.
I think it would be very effective 

721
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,773
towards performance for athletes and.
But then again you are going to have is 

722
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,910
a different structure because called 
dressers are poor,

723
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,761
right?
Where are you gonna?

724
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:32,640
Have a bunch of MMA fighters who get 
rich and then say,

725
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:34,590
well I don't want to do what you're 
saying right now.

726
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,000
How are you going to make them?
Right?

727
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:36,834
They're the one paying your paycheck.
So it does become an interesting 

728
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:42,360
circumstance,
but I think if there was someone who ran

729
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:45,450
a highly structured,
mixed martial arts team as structured as

730
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,313
a college team,
I think they would have a gigantic 

731
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:49,104
amount of success.
I think their guys would get a lot 

732
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:51,060
better,
a lot faster.

733
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,293
Um,
and I think you'd see a really 

734
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,850
interesting dynamic developed between 
the high level athletes and the coaches.

735
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,200
Well,
I think they're still trying to,

736
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,290
trying to figure out what's the best way
to coach fighters.

737
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,570
Everybody's got their own way of doing 
it,

738
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:04,251
you know,
for us,

739
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:04,741
uh,
hobbies,

740
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,260
ways different than the way they do it 
at American top team,

741
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,440
Matt Hume was doing a different than the
way duke does it.

742
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,303
Everybody's got their own way.
And the only way you could tell us how 

743
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:14,874
well the athletes compete,
that's the only way you really find out 

744
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:19,770
who's correct and who's not,
who needs to make adjustments.

745
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:21,840
Yeah.
And it's really hard in fighting because

746
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,550
I mean,
even your highest level camps,

747
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,960
how many say Bella torn ucl?
Ha.

748
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,130
How many high level MMA fights do they 
have per year?

749
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,993
Maybe 30.
I think there'd be a lot for most of 

750
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:32,620
these teams.
Right?

751
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,040
And so you only get 30 samples sizes,
right?

752
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,860
Whereas in college wrestling team,
you're going to have,

753
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,350
between everybody on the team,
the all 40 guys,

754
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,640
you're going to have at least a thousand

755
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,500
matches every single year,
minimum,

756
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:47,170
right.
And then obviously every event is scored

757
00:29:47,171 --> 00:29:49,330
by team.
Every deal made is scored by team,

758
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,164
every Ncaa Championship scored by team,
so you get a very good indication of 

759
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,090
what coaches are doing it right and what
coaches are doing it wrong.

760
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,860
And then obviously with recruiting 
process,

761
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,550
the coaching I'm doing right now get the
next crop of the best talent.

762
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,413
Right.
And so you have a very good idea of 

763
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,120
what's working,
what is not working.

764
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:07,210
We're in MMA.
I think we struggled with it because the

765
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:10,630
sample size isn't large enough to give 
us a really,

766
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:11,980
really direct correlation.

767
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Now you were able to instigate your 
strategy in pretty much every single one

768
00:30:18,231 --> 00:30:21,230
of your mma fights the only fight where 
you really struggled as a fight.

769
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,233
Yeah.
Yeah.

770
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,750
That was,
that was a close fight.

771
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,760
What was different in that fight?
Well,

772
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,640
so that was my first fight at dukes.
Um,

773
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,733
obviously J is pretty damn good too,
but we don't wanna take that away from 

774
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:32,321
him.
I think he was right,

775
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:35,530
number 16 in the world.
There's something at that point in time.

776
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:38,350
So that was my first fight at dukes.
I think the biggest mistake I made,

777
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,580
I mean,
and obviously at that time,

778
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:41,320
I'm literally two years into my fighting
career,

779
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,370
so I stopped wrestling completely.
Um,

780
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,460
I didn't do one wrestling practice.
I moved to Duke's August for a while.

781
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:51,250
I moved to Wisconsin August,
first searching and Duke's August first.

782
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,830
I fought a three months later at the end
of October.

783
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,810
I literally did not do one wrestling 
practice.

784
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,590
So what were you doing?
A,

785
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,350
I was just striking like six times a 
week.

786
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:00,184
I was doing Jujitsu a handful of times a
week and then I was doing conditioning 

787
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,540
instead after that fight my rest.

788
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,770
Well,
and then actually I went to,

789
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,380
my brother was living in New York at the
time who,

790
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,350
my brother is also an ncaa champ and 
went to visit him for thanksgiving.

791
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,990
He whooped my ass and I'm like,
I freaking suck at wrestling.

792
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:14,910
Like,
you know,

793
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,570
like I went cold Turkey and so it's 
like,

794
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:17,404
okay,
I don't need to wrestle every day to be 

795
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,240
great at wrestling anymore,
but I need,

796
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,123
I need to wrestle once a week,
twice a week with high level 

797
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:26,410
competition.
So at that point in time,

798
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,270
and for pretty much the rest of my 
career,

799
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,950
I would go to one of the local colleges 
once a week or twice a week just to keep

800
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:33,784
my skills sharp.
And so I think that was the biggest 

801
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:38,380
mistake I made in Toronto.
I didn't wrestle at all prior to it.

802
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,060
Um,
but Jim Rohn was good.

803
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,620
He was also a division one college 
wrestlers.

804
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,080
He knew what he was doing also.
Um,

805
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,630
but I think if I,
if I had to pinpoint one thing that,

806
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:47,420
that would be it.

807
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,990
Isn't it fascinating that a guy with as 
much wrestling experiences you have,

808
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,830
all you have to do is take some time off
and everything degrades.

809
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,753
Let's timing

810
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,541
sell timing.
Right?

811
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:59,270
So you take three months off your time.
Who's going to go to.

812
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,550
I mean literally,
it's amazing.

813
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,590
Tell you I wasn't doing one practice and
so it's like,

814
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,710
but that was also what helped me get the
striking thing down as I was doing,

815
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:10,370
and this is what I think you actually 
made this point a,

816
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:11,204
who the hell are you talking to about 
wrestlers are willing to go to the 

817
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:15,014
environment.
I was striking six to seven times a 

818
00:32:16,341 --> 00:32:18,660
week.
How many strikers go and wrestle?

819
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:19,660
Six to seven times a week

820
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,910
problem.
None of them do.

821
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,100
They literally,
they refused to.

822
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,230
Well there was Francis in Ghana is 
training camp.

823
00:32:25,231 --> 00:32:27,750
When I talk to people outside 
afterwards,

824
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,550
it's crazy.
Before everyone's saying,

825
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:31,050
oh my God,
he's in tremendous shape.

826
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:33,480
Everything's amazing.
And then afterwards there was like,

827
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,740
he doesn't turn on the ground.
What he crazy training on the ground.

828
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,830
Like all he wants to do is,
yeah,

829
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,090
well you can't let them do that.
You can't.

830
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,023
You can't let him.
He's going to fight and a division one 

831
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:46,700
wrestler,
like,

832
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,450
how is he going to do this?
How is he going to,

833
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,303
how is he gonna stand up.
He's going to somehow or another 

834
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:53,280
magically stuff.
All the take downs,

835
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,400
you have to train that,
you have to train it.

836
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,840
Yeah and well and that,
but you got to train it,

837
00:32:57,841 --> 00:33:00,210
but then even when people train it,
the strikers,

838
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,850
strikers,
they don't want to do it.

839
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,810
Right.
Like I said,

840
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:06,900
when I go to Duke's,
when I started at dukes and it went down

841
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,550
to four times a week where we are 
striking,

842
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:10,320
right,
but in the beginning it was six or seven

843
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,360
times a week sessions a week.
I'm striking.

844
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:15,510
Right?
And so I'm immersed in that culture.

845
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,690
I have to learn.
You can't not learn.

846
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:20,250
We're doing six to seven times a week 
and.

847
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,160
But the strikers,
they want to do one wrestling practice a

848
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,470
week to wrestling practices a week.
Well,

849
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:28,890
if you're here and they're here,
how are you going to catch them by doing

850
00:33:28,891 --> 00:33:31,710
one practice a week?
It's freaking impossible.

851
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,090
You need to.
I mean if I,

852
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:37,140
if I got to like be in charge of an MMA 
guys camp and I don't know,

853
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,000
I coach wrestling.
I love coaching the kids.

854
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:42,210
I don't know if I ever want to coach mma
people I would consider for someone like

855
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:44,490
high level,
but you got to immerse yourself.

856
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:45,324
You literally have to take three months 
and freaking wrestle every single day 

857
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,190
because Russell,
you've got to bill,

858
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,420
you have to build those skills.
You're not going to work,

859
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,700
you're not going to learn something.
Well do it one time a week,

860
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,050
you are going to do it,
period.

861
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,810
No,
I completely agree and I think that it.

862
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,750
It all depends on what the athlete 
brings to the table.

863
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,793
Like some guys have like a little bit of
wrestling and then maybe they need to 

864
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:04,674
work more on submissions.
Maybe some guys need to work more on 

865
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:08,790
their striking that get hit too much.
I mean it's,

866
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:09,953
it's every single fighter is that 
there's a different recipe and you have 

867
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:17,430
to figure out what that recipe is and 
it's hard because it's like you only way

868
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:18,264
you find out is how well they perform in
competition and how many times you even 

869
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:22,980
get the chance to do that.
Three a year,

870
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,720
three a year maybe.

871
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,000
Yeah.
And so that,

872
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,480
you know,
that's,

873
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,940
that's that and listen,
so I'm not saying,

874
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,774
I'm not saying a stryker has to do six 
sessions a week for three years 

875
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:34,430
straight,
but I'm saying take three months,

876
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,800
six months,
immerse yourself in that,

877
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,660
be obsessed,
be obsessed,

878
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,070
learn those skills,
figure it out.

879
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,380
And then after that it might be once a 
week,

880
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,430
twice a week,
three times a week.

881
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:44,050
But then when,
when,

882
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,850
when we start considering the,
the cte factors,

883
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:47,684
which I'm not totally sold on cte yet as
you don't get hit poster boy for 

884
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:56,360
wrestling,
martial art,

885
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,890
if you really think about.
I know for sure.

886
00:34:57,891 --> 00:34:58,790
But.
So I watched,

887
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,653
I watched concussion.
Well I was actually flying in my fight 

888
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:04,130
in April of 2016.
I'll watch.

889
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:04,911
I said,
shit,

890
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:06,290
that's scary.
I did.

891
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,420
I sparked two more times the rest of my 
career.

892
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:11,900
So my crew was 19 months.
I sparred twice.

893
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,823
I just didn't,
I didn't do it just because you didn't 

894
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:14,900
want to get hit.
Uh,

895
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:16,020
yeah,
I felt as an,

896
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:16,620
an,
an,

897
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,350
an,
an unnecessary risk.

898
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,423
Well there was a recent study that came 
out just a few days ago that said that 

899
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:26,150
it's repeated subconcussive hits and 
they're causing cte,

900
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,260
not concussions.

901
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,050
Yeah.
So the.

902
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:32,260
But the study that made me really 
question the cte phenomenon was they,

903
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:33,094
they did that study where they studied a
whole bunch of professional football 

904
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:39,360
players and it was like 100 per se.
It was like 99 percent have ct.

905
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:40,194
Right?
But then they studied people who had 

906
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,810
played football for any length of time,
any length of time and it was like still

907
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,910
like 80 percent of the people and it's 
like,

908
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:50,640
well,
if I can't live my life in a bubble,

909
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,663
like are like,
how can 80 percent of people who have 

910
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,310
ever played football,
I mean how many american males,

911
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:57,144
what percent of american males walking 
around at 40 years old today put some 

912
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:01,410
level of football?
It's like got to be 80 percent.

913
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,050
So you'Re telling me 70 percent of 
americans walking around with cte or the

914
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,300
american males,
like that's crazy.

915
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,390
But that's real.
That's really is what's happening.

916
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,253
No,
I got you got to think there's gotta be 

917
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:12,504
some kind of low threshold because 
otherwise 40 years down the road if 

918
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,570
everybody played football and everyone 
who played football has cte,

919
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,730
everyone's going to be walking.

920
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,690
A lot of people are walking around like 
that.

921
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,660
That's what's going on.
Or is it might be the diet coke.

922
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,840
Little bit,
a little bit of that.

923
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,420
I think way more people have some form 
of brain damage than real estate.

924
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,700
Yes,
I do.

925
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,650
Well,
I think in the world of martial arts,

926
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,040
I know so many guys.
Yeah,

927
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,200
but let's talk about not martial arts 
are just regular people,

928
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,040
ballplayers.
I think football players,

929
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:42,874
it's even worse because you're running,
you're running at each other clashing 

930
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:47,350
heads.
I mean you watch football.

931
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:49,660
I mean the damage those guys take his 
crate.

932
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,060
It's once in a ufc you'll see like a 
wild head kit,

933
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,660
care boom and football games.
These guys are literally running at each

934
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:00,130
other.
I mean it's crazy.

935
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:00,964
One team's running this way,
the other teams running that way and 

936
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:05,730
they slam into each other and these guys
are 250,

937
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,613
300 pounds that,
that impact that the jarring of your 

938
00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:11,044
brain.
Plus they have helmets on which allows 

939
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:14,920
them to be more confident clashing into 
each other.

940
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,980
I think a giant percentage of those 
guys.

941
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,570
But you think.
But so like I said,

942
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,404
so if that one study said it was 
something around 80 percent of anyone 

943
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:27,850
who ever played any level of football,
length of time for I like that has cte.

944
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:28,684
That means like,
I mean if we take the american 

945
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:30,574
population,
at least 80 percent of american men 

946
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,590
played football

947
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,810
point in their life.
They have ct.

948
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,420
So we're talking about like a gigantic 
population.

949
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,770
I think there's levels of cte though.
I mean I think,

950
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,050
you know,
you get to the point where you look,

951
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,390
Joe Frazier,
he could barely talk before he died.

952
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,013
He rest in peace,
but then you also get two guys that are 

953
00:37:47,871 --> 00:37:49,670
just like a little forgetful and don't 
know why,

954
00:37:49,671 --> 00:37:52,040
or impulsive and don't know why.
You know what I mean?

955
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:52,874
There's a lot of them,
there's a lot of weird stuff that comes 

956
00:37:54,861 --> 00:37:55,694
with cte.
I've studied it pretty extensively and 

957
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:59,850
the more studies that I've read on it,
the more have gotten really

958
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,030
derBy.
So do you think there's maybe just a low

959
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,040
threshold for what they call cte?

960
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,203
Well,
there's also genes that certain people 

961
00:38:06,381 --> 00:38:07,130
have.
Um,

962
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,630
what was that gene?
Rhonda?

963
00:38:08,631 --> 00:38:10,220
Patrick talked about it.
Uh,

964
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,630
I don't remember what it was.
Fantastic.

965
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,391
She's amazing,
right?

966
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,760
yeah.
And she was talking about uh,

967
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:19,930
some jeans make you more susceptible for
traumatic brain injury than other ones,

968
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,723
like if you have it,
you are many times more likely to 

969
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,400
develop cte.

970
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,990
But then also.
And then so the other thing that I would

971
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,020
is out of curiosity to me when they did 
a ct studies,

972
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:33,210
especially with they're doing,
you know,

973
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,010
after death with these football players,
right,

974
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,033
were sent out,
they're dying their pipeline in the 

975
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:38,111
sixties,
seventies,

976
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:39,850
eighties,
that time period,

977
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,170
a steroid use very,
very high and drug use is also very high

978
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:48,640
in that culture and so and,
and alcohol including drugs.

979
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,730
So it's like,
did those things contribute,

980
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,250
contribute?
Is it a,

981
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,113
you know,
is it like a mitigating factor or is it 

982
00:38:56,381 --> 00:39:00,800
like going to create this crazy storm of
brain damage that you're.

983
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,550
You're going freaking running into 
people like this.

984
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,623
Then you're doing steroids,
then you're a fricking and drinking a 

985
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:08,010
pack of beer.
Then you're doing some cocaine

986
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,450
that can't be good for you.
Can.

987
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,920
that would be good for you?
Can't be.

988
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,970
No,
it can't be.

989
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,571
Yeah.
Yeah.

990
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:14,404
Especially the pills.
A lot of them get caught with the pain 

991
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,920
pills.
I'm caught up on pain pills.

992
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:18,940
That's a.
That's a big one,

993
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:19,774
man.
We just found out a tom petty died from 

994
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:23,110
fucking pain pills.
My wife and I were talking about sad.

995
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,780
That was that a man.
He couldn't have a sense of a

996
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,350
because that my wife and I both love tom
petty music,

997
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:31,960
but how he did,
how at 66 years old,

998
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:35,800
he was still like not so okay with 
himself,

999
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:37,420
that he was jamming pills down his 
throat,

1000
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:38,770
you know,
that he didn't have a sense of,

1001
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,350
I have had great accomplishments.
I've had a great life.

1002
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,300
You know,
I have people around me that love me,

1003
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,310
that,
you know,

1004
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,430
I mean,
it's got to be a sad,

1005
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:47,830
lonely thing when you're overdosing on 
pills.

1006
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:48,790
I would have to assume.

1007
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,490
I mean,
I don't want to guess,

1008
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:51,324
but I would,
I would imagine he's in some kind of 

1009
00:39:52,471 --> 00:39:55,650
pain if we freeze taken those opiates 
hip fracture.

1010
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:58,620
He was recovering from a.
You got hooked on something,

1011
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:00,960
man.
My friend from amber from the ufc,

1012
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:01,794
she hurt her ankle recently.
She blew out her achilles and she said 

1013
00:40:04,831 --> 00:40:07,720
the doctor immediately tried to 
prescribe oxycontin was like,

1014
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,630
get the fuck outta here.
Yeah.

1015
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,430
she's like,
I'm not taking that shit.

1016
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:13,350
No.
And you know,

1017
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,120
um,
it happens man.

1018
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,370
Doctors just try to shove pills down 
your throat.

1019
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,763
It's a real common thing.
And if you have any sort of serious 

1020
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:22,104
injury and they put you on that stuff,
one of the things they put tom petty on 

1021
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,243
was fentanyl and fentanyl is that shit 
that's fucking killing every bitch with 

1022
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:31,530
meth.
Meth are very similar.

1023
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,940
No heroin.
It's heroin dream.

1024
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:37,070
Really potent opiate.
It's,

1025
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,840
it's much more much more potent than 
heroin.

1026
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,743
I know many,
many hundreds of times more potent and 

1027
00:40:43,021 --> 00:40:43,854
so they give these people fentanyl 
patches and then they're taken 

1028
00:40:45,781 --> 00:40:50,310
oxycontin's too and who knows what else 
taken and I mean I,

1029
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,320
I feel terrible for someone who has bad 
pain like from a broken hip or something

1030
00:40:55,321 --> 00:40:56,154
like that,
but jesus christ take the pain rather 

1031
00:40:58,561 --> 00:41:00,060
than death.
Seriously.

1032
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:00,923
This shit you could take cbd,
you can take cbd doesn't even have a 

1033
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:06,450
psychoactive effect and as radical pain 
reducing properties to.

1034
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,951
Yeah.
Yeah.

1035
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:07,571
And I,
and I,

1036
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:07,820
I,

1037
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:12,320
I don't do drugs,
but the fact that people are so actively

1038
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:13,940
prescribing these,
these heavy,

1039
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:14,774
really heavy hard drugs to patients,
people kill people and weed is still 

1040
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:21,620
illegal and I don't smoke weed so I'm 
not even like for myself,

1041
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:23,270
but just for other people.

1042
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,670
well,
it's crazy.

1043
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:27,850
We need to be a pain reliever really.
I've heard a lot of people say no.

1044
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,920
A lot of people do say that.
It's just maybe,

1045
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,993
I don't know.
I'm the one of those people that you're 

1046
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,320
in pain if you're in pain,
just be in pain.

1047
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,740
Just like just,
just.

1048
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,680
Yes,
just relax,

1049
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:40,940
you know?
I mean,

1050
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:42,800
I remember one time though,
I got my knee operated on,

1051
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:43,634
I had a acl reconstruction and they gave
me one of those buttons in the hospital 

1052
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:50,600
when you press it and you get more fun.
It was when,

1053
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,740
uh,
they,

1054
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,830
they had my leg on this motion machine,
right.

1055
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:56,330
So,
like right after surgery,

1056
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:57,164
they're trying to get your blood moving 
and so there's a couple screws in there 

1057
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:01,574
and they'd taken my patella tendon and 
cut it and put it inside and drilled it 

1058
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:05,600
all in place and everything.

1059
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,643
And then I'm sitting at this thing just,
it's this throbbing pain and they gave 

1060
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:10,310
me this little button.
I'm like,

1061
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,720
claire,
but I'm like,

1062
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,430
I'm in the hospital,
I'm not going to overdose.

1063
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,870
But uh,
I remember thinking,

1064
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:18,704
wow,
this could be really fucking dangerous 

1065
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:21,950
if you had this in life.
Like it was like a little button on your

1066
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:25,280
hip and you just press it and you get a 
dose of morphine.

1067
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:26,114
but it was a wonderful feeling.
I've only done it once while I was in 

1068
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:31,790
the hospital.
I got it for that brief moment.

1069
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:32,630
I was like,
wow,

1070
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,080
this is an amazing feeling.
You feel like,

1071
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,870
like you're floating through a cloud of 
love and just flying through the air.

1072
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:39,770
Like,
ah.

1073
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,620
I went from being in exacerbating pain 
too.

1074
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,230
So how,
how do you feel?

1075
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,870
Then we got into this discussion.
We're talking about cte.

1076
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,150
So now like,
okay,

1077
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:49,984
I think mma is a terrible career path 
and people ask me all the time and as a 

1078
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:57,930
professional,
don't defeat it in two different,

1079
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,330
two different organizations,
a couple people.

1080
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:03,490
It's probably the right career path for 
majority of people.

1081
00:43:03,491 --> 00:43:05,380
Probably not a great career path,
but.

1082
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:06,214
So,
you know,

1083
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,140
how do you feel about it when you think 
that.

1084
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,510
I mean you're obviously saying and I'm 
on the fence,

1085
00:43:10,511 --> 00:43:13,750
but you're saying I think a lot of these
people are getting cte clearly.

1086
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,000
How do you feel about being involved 
with acs?

1087
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:20,110
That's like in my future I could 
probably coach them mma,

1088
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:22,660
but I struggle with it because it's 
like,

1089
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,820
well,
should I really recommend this person to

1090
00:43:24,821 --> 00:43:25,720
have a mayor?
Should I not?

1091
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:26,554
Because are they going to end up fucked 
up and not be able to take care of the 

1092
00:43:28,361 --> 00:43:29,200
kids are aware.

1093
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,510
I don't think you should ever recommend 
mma to anybody.

1094
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:31,961
Okay,
good.

1095
00:43:31,961 --> 00:43:32,794
I usually don't.
I don't think anybody should recommend 

1096
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,550
an.
But I think some people,

1097
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,080
it's their destiny.
Yeah.

1098
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:41,900
There's a few people out there that they
want to look.

1099
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,100
I don't think you should recommend 
skydiving to anybody either though.

1100
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,753
I mean,
my friend andy stump is a world record 

1101
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,030
holder in the world flying.
That's,

1102
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,063
that's the death.
Did you ever read there was that book 

1103
00:43:55,811 --> 00:43:56,930
called,
uh,

1104
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,980
somethIng chasing superman or do you 
remember if it was about people like kim

1105
00:44:02,621 --> 00:44:07,621
and how it almost always ends up very 
poorly becAuse you need this bigger rush

1106
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:08,944
and this bigger rush and this bigger 
rush and tell big wave surfers and the 

1107
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:12,874
flying suit and all this.
I was talking about the psychology 

1108
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:18,010
behind it and how like it ends up poorly
very,

1109
00:44:18,011 --> 00:44:18,844
very,
very often because these people need 

1110
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:22,870
bigger rushes and more challenges and 
then the fucking themselves up.

1111
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,730
It only makes sense.
I never

1112
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,800
encourage anyone to do that,
but for him,

1113
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,160
I mean he's a retired navy seal and this
is just another level psychotic

1114
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,950
shit that he can do to fill his time 
with,

1115
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,070
but he's got a bunch of sponsors and he 
actually makes a living doing that.

1116
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,700
I would never recommend that to anybody.
I wouldn't recommend skiing.

1117
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,340
Think you know,
my kids like skiing.

1118
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:45,174
I don't even like skiing.
I go skiing with them every time I 

1119
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:47,694
skied,
like,

1120
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:49,050
no,
I've never gotten hurt,

1121
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,430
but I'm like,
fuck that.

1122
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:51,600
Every time I'm skiing though,
I'm like,

1123
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:52,710
don't get hurt.
Don't get hurt.

1124
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:54,360
Don't get hurt.
Who wouldn't get hurt?

1125
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,590
Don't get hurt.
Don't get hurt.

1126
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,510
I think it's sonny bono.
Oh,

1127
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,690
who else?
One of the kennedy's and a tree.

1128
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:02,370
Right?
Then maybe that was a.

1129
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,250
That could have been false flag.
No,

1130
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,130
don't push them into the tree.
Fucking took it.

1131
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,310
Ski out with a sniper rifle right when 
he got too close to the woods.

1132
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,860
Yeah.
I think that there's a lot of very,

1133
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:18,861
very dAngerous career and I think if you
feel compelled to do that,

1134
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,290
no one should be talking to you into 
that,

1135
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,280
but I don't think anybody should stop 
you.

1136
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,250
Like I liked the fact that boxing 
exists,

1137
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,840
you know,
would never want to tell,

1138
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,130
you know,
facility lowman,

1139
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:31,050
chanko don't fight.
Sure.

1140
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,000
I would never want to tell them don't 
fight.

1141
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,150
I want to see him fight.
Well,

1142
00:45:34,151 --> 00:45:35,250
what if they,
what if,

1143
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,113
uh,
it gets proven without a shadow of a 

1144
00:45:37,831 --> 00:45:40,220
doubt that these things cause he,
he cte.

1145
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,880
Do you think the government is going to 
ban them?

1146
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,190
No,
I don't think they can really.

1147
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,053
How could they be?
Are they going to ban banning 

1148
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,780
everything?
They really do.

1149
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:49,643
They like banning things that cost them 
money or the cost people who donate to 

1150
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,330
them money.
Fair.

1151
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:57,750
Now the banning of the drugs is really 
tied to pharmaceutical drugs.

1152
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:58,584
More than that,
they're not banning it because they're 

1153
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:03,540
trying to save us that they're banning 
it because someone's putting pressure on

1154
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:07,860
them to ban it or put it in the past and
they're banning skateboarding.

1155
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,220
No one's trying to ban bmx ride.
Those guys get fucked up.

1156
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:12,503
I mean,
I was watching this video the other day 

1157
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:16,920
of those guys doing the ramp with the 
skateboard and the guy got to the top of

1158
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:19,930
the ramp and didn't catch it right and 
fell like $100.

1159
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,290
Awful.
oh jesus christ.

1160
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:23,600
I mean,
they get beat the foot.

1161
00:46:23,601 --> 00:46:24,434
That's up.
That's another one where the damn book 

1162
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:29,160
was chasing superman or being sued or 
something.

1163
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,770
Getting superman.
Superman is a decoding superman.

1164
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:33,340
It was called the coating superman.
Yeah.

1165
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,373
Okay.
So like if you go back and watch the 

1166
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:38,640
rachel x games when I was a kid,
I don't remember what year it is,

1167
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:40,820
nineties at some point.
And uh,

1168
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:42,510
oh,
the rise of the superman,

1169
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,310
decoding the science of ultimate human 
performance.

1170
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,590
This is a,
this is a freaking fantastic book.

1171
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,780
I mean it's like,
it's so awesome.

1172
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,550
I'm so.
I'm obsessed with sports psych,

1173
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:51,540
like I said,
I'm sure.

1174
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,740
Oh,
steven kotler.

1175
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,820
Yeah,
that guy's interesting.

1176
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:54,871
Yeah.
But.

1177
00:46:54,871 --> 00:46:55,704
So if you look like the original x game 
stuff and then you go to like the x 

1178
00:46:58,851 --> 00:47:00,060
games today.
Oh yeah.

1179
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,190
It's different world,
totally different events,

1180
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:06,390
so much work stream because there has to
be this advance advance,

1181
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,253
advance advance,
but then all of a sudden people are 

1182
00:47:08,311 --> 00:47:09,270
getting eft up.
Yeah.

1183
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:10,104
You get to a certain point where you can
only do so many flips in the air with 

1184
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:13,374
your bike.
Apparently they keep trying to do one 

1185
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:17,580
rotation.
Everybody go,

1186
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:18,414
this is crazy.
Somebody that comes along with two and 

1187
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:21,430
then now they're doing three.
Wasn't there?

1188
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,110
The movIe about tony hawk was like the 
first one did the 7:20

1189
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:27,120
or something,
but now they go way more,

1190
00:47:27,121 --> 00:47:28,060
don't they?
Yeah,

1191
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,533
they're.
They're going to be more in every year 

1192
00:47:30,971 --> 00:47:31,804
and if you watch any of those par core 
kids that are jumping from building to 

1193
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:37,480
building and and we've had one of them 
are in here.

1194
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,820
What was his name?
James

1195
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,880
was a.
The

1196
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:44,060
find it.
I don't remember that one.

1197
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,030
I would mostly.
You're a political ones.

1198
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,520
I think some of the people who are 
highly fascinating.

1199
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,680
Yeah.
It's an interesting time.

1200
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,620
I get labeled all right.
I know it's bizarre,

1201
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,440
but everybody's so quick to label people
today.

1202
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,173
it's such a strange time.
Finger pointing and putting people in 

1203
00:48:01,491 --> 00:48:03,850
boxes,
disingenuously.

1204
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,880
It's more divisive of these leftist.
They want to,

1205
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:09,350
uh,
you know,

1206
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:10,350
they want to say,
well,

1207
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:13,430
I'm trying to make people less racist,
but what they're really doing,

1208
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:14,780
they're being very divisive.
Yeah.

1209
00:48:14,781 --> 00:48:15,840
You know,
and like I would,

1210
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,933
I think you identify aS libertarian.
I w I identify more as a libertarian 

1211
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:22,220
than republican or democrat.
But yeah,

1212
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:26,180
a lot of people say I'm all right or 
love trump so much and it's,

1213
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:28,900
well I'm more libertarian than anything,
you know,

1214
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:31,970
I think less government,
less invasion invasion into our lives,

1215
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,133
but people want to put you into a little
box because you don't agree with what 

1216
00:48:35,421 --> 00:48:36,230
they're saying.

1217
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:37,780
Yeah.
It's a weird time for that.

1218
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,310
And that's what I think what you were 
saying about shaming.

1219
00:48:40,311 --> 00:48:42,650
They try to shame you and racist or 
shame,

1220
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:43,484
but you're not doing that if you're 
pretending someone's racist when you 

1221
00:48:45,801 --> 00:48:46,634
know they're not.
Or if you're pretending that someone is 

1222
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:52,610
a sexist or homophobic or whatever.
When you know that you're just there.

1223
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,713
people are,
they're ignoring nuance and what's what 

1224
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,150
they're really doing also is they're 
making.

1225
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,730
They're making people afrAid to speak 
their minds.

1226
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:02,570
Right.
And really how,

1227
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,790
if you and I had a disagreement on 
something,

1228
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,730
how we come to a common ground is by 
discussing it,

1229
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,140
I'd say,
well,

1230
00:49:09,141 --> 00:49:10,910
I think you're a reasonable person.
What do you believe?

1231
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,880
You'd say that as well,
I don't agree with that and this is why.

1232
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,460
And eventually we would talk it out and 
maybe we still disagree,

1233
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:17,600
but we'd come to a common ground.

1234
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,480
Right?
But instead the people on the one side,

1235
00:49:20,481 --> 00:49:22,310
they're not saying that they're saying,
what'd you say?

1236
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:26,000
You're racist or sexist or homophobic,
your name one.

1237
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,690
Right.
And then ended discussion.

1238
00:49:27,691 --> 00:49:29,210
Then there's no discussion at all,
right?

1239
00:49:29,211 --> 00:49:30,290
YeAh.
They're trying to win.

1240
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,280
Yeah,
exactly.

1241
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:32,143
They just turned them when they're 
trying to label you and then get the 

1242
00:49:33,711 --> 00:49:35,050
upper hand when.
Yeah,

1243
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:35,973
I think there's a real problem with 
people not being reasonable and I think 

1244
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:39,703
that you should be able to have 
conversations like I've had people have 

1245
00:49:42,471 --> 00:49:44,990
criticized me,
like even in person I've taught,

1246
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:46,730
like why would you have that guy on your
show?

1247
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,223
Which one?
Any guy like a milo yiannopoulos per 

1248
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,730
sample and I'm like,
well look what happened.

1249
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,880
I mean we got to see how the guy thinks.
Got all,

1250
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,490
all of his weird issues that came up in 
his book deal falling apart.

1251
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,670
A lot of that had to do with 
conversations I had with them.

1252
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,533
Yeah.
It's like now you get a chance to see 

1253
00:50:04,431 --> 00:50:05,330
how the guy.
Actually,

1254
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,760
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with the way things.

1255
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:10,220
I think it's a,
he's a provocateur.

1256
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,380
I mean it's not how I think.
Yeah.

1257
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,333
But I think that everybody has this 
perspective on who he is that is 

1258
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:22,880
exaggerated because of this public 
persona that he does to be outrageous.

1259
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:23,743
So I think that's a double edged sword 
because I think Alex Jones does it as 

1260
00:50:26,361 --> 00:50:27,420
well.
Aware,

1261
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:29,660
way crazier than well,
but okay.

1262
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:31,160
But same idea,
right?

1263
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,790
Is part of their persona is a show is a 
show.

1264
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,624
It's making it more extreme because they
want to say that one thing that's 

1265
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:41,390
totally effing crazy.
IT'll catch a headline somewhere.

1266
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,330
Right.
And so they have these beliefs,

1267
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:45,164
but then they kind of go beyond them 
because it is a show because they will 

1268
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,020
make more money if they get more 
followers or more people clicking on the

1269
00:50:51,021 --> 00:50:52,790
articles or videos or whatever.

1270
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,680
So I think it is.
But then,

1271
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:55,514
you know,
you go to someone like bret weinstein 

1272
00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:57,494
guy,
I think he's fascinating people calling 

1273
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:02,390
him a racist and you know,
he was strong liberal.

1274
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,493
Well he's as progressive as it gets.
He's as far from a racist as you could 

1275
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:07,004
ever get it.
Yeah.

1276
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,061
Yeah.
There's a,

1277
00:51:08,061 --> 00:51:13,061
there's this need to label people.
well alex is alex showman and,

1278
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,120
but also like he says,
some things that are pretty fucked up,

1279
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:19,010
like the sandy hook stuff.
You know what I'm saying?

1280
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:19,844
That sandy hook was a.
He's looking for conspiracies 

1281
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,200
everywhere.
Everywhere.

1282
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:27,140
He finds them someplace.
So sometimes he's right,

1283
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:27,974
exactly.
Sometimes it,

1284
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:28,310
right?
Yeah.

1285
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,143
But the problem with looking for 
conspiracies everywhere as you going 

1286
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:35,180
gonna you're gonna make people feel 
terrible.

1287
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,293
I meaN,
if there was an article that I read 

1288
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:38,743
about a guy who was a conspiracy 
theorist until his son was killed in 

1289
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:45,980
sandy hook,
people were tellIng him that his son was

1290
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:46,883
killed and that is some sort of a 
government actor and this guy was 

1291
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:51,180
devastated,
you know?

1292
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,070
Of course the people that are really the
nutty conspiracy theorist.

1293
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,900
Oh,
vulgar,

1294
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,670
no undercover still.
He's still under grover.

1295
00:51:58,750 --> 00:51:59,583
there's people out there that look for 
conspiracies and everything and it 

1296
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:05,790
becomes a real problem because it 
muddies up the water and I think,

1297
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,630
I think at the same time you,
at least for me,

1298
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:11,300
and I think we have similar thought 
processes,

1299
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,760
you can't just take what makes you made,
it tells you and say,

1300
00:52:13,761 --> 00:52:15,680
well I guess that's how it happened.
Right?

1301
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,720
So as an end in some situations,
but in sandy hook you have dead kids.

1302
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,850
People grieving,
you have bodies.

1303
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,210
Autopsy reports.
Yeah.

1304
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:27,620
It happened.
No guns.

1305
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:30,800
You had a mentally ill person who had 
access to these gut.

1306
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:32,870
Then if you take that same thought 
process on say,

1307
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:34,730
stephen paddock in the las vegas 
shooting,

1308
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,920
well we still don't know how that turned
out.

1309
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:41,990
The las vegas shooting is complicated,
but as we know one guy did do that.

1310
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,120
Well now we're coming out with new 
stuff.

1311
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,450
I think there was other people involved 
and he might've gotten help from people,

1312
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,890
whether it's willingly or unwillingly,
but or wittingly or unwittingly,

1313
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,810
but I don't think there was other people
shooting.

1314
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,540
They've said that,
so I don't know.

1315
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,374
Right,
and that's what the law of these 

1316
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:59,450
conspiracies,
you have to understand that you're never

1317
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:01,070
really gonna know what the real truth,
right?

1318
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,990
You have to keep an open mind and you'll
say,

1319
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:04,310
okay,
well this person says this.

1320
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:06,490
What does this person say?
What does this person say?

1321
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,600
They do these things check out with each
other,

1322
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:10,160
and it's like how many different types 
of.

1323
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:11,990
They changed the las vegas shootings 
timeline,

1324
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:12,824
right?
And then it was kind of weird that it 

1325
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:14,804
went way out of mainstream media.
Like I'll send you heard about it for a 

1326
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:20,570
week and then you didn't hear about it 
again for one of the times.

1327
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,820
I think the news cycle today is about 
billing hours.

1328
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:25,710
Yeah.
But you would think people want answers.

1329
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,010
I mean

1330
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,843
that's the largest mass shooting in 
United States history that we'd want 

1331
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:29,994
some more clear answers on what really 
happened and how it happened and why it 

1332
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:33,744
happened and we never really got those.
And I know there's been a few new 

1333
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:37,854
articles on it recently and so maybe 
we're going to find out more 

1334
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,674
information,
but it's an incredibly confusing story 

1335
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:46,530
because the guy was clearly a psycho 
clearly fucked up.

1336
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,590
I'm clearly planned this out for a long 
time.

1337
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,491
I mean,
he,

1338
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:54,630
he got hotel rooms overlooking music 
festivals and other places.

1339
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,493
Yeah.
And I was planning out how to do this 

1340
00:53:57,181 --> 00:54:00,240
for a long time.
He had a note in his,

1341
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:01,074
uh,
in his hotel room that had all the 

1342
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:03,564
ballistics calculation so he knew like 
bullet drop from x amount of yards and 

1343
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,110
he was calculating how to kill all these
people.

1344
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,040
He was on some weird antidepressants and
anti,

1345
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,243
not anti anti anxiety medication,
which does all kinds of weird shit to 

1346
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,390
your head.

1347
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,690
There's a guy that was prone to fits of 
rage.

1348
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,110
He was a a calculated professional 
gambler.

1349
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,540
There's a lot of weird stuff with this 
guy.

1350
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:30,900
The fact that he accumulated these 
weapons over years.

1351
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,793
Yeah,
and maybe did it knowing that he was 

1352
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:37,460
going to do this so you don't.
There's a.

1353
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,140
Whenever there's a mass shooting or 
anything,

1354
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:41,760
that's crazy.
You have two things happen.

1355
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:43,890
One,
everybody wants answers to.

1356
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:44,724
Everybody forgets about it really quick 
because of new shit happens in the news 

1357
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,020
and if it wasn't your family that got 
shot.

1358
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:50,640
It wasn't someone who.
You're close to the gunshot.

1359
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,410
I know people that got shot there.
Yeah,

1360
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,950
I know people that I met them.
I met people in vegas that that got shot

1361
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:57,540
there.
I talked to them after it was over.

1362
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:03,350
It was complete and total chaos and when
there's complete and total chaos,

1363
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,180
you get all sorts of conflicting 
reports.

1364
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:07,163
People were running into other casinos 
saying that there's a shooter because 

1365
00:55:09,301 --> 00:55:10,134
they ran out of that area and so then 
people were calling and police reports 

1366
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:13,404
because the shooter in monte carlo,
there's a shooter in this and so those 

1367
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:16,704
things get reported as fact when many 
times it's part of the confusion of a 

1368
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,860
chaotic mass shooting like that vegas 
event.

1369
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,293
I don't know what happened other than 
the fact that this one guy definitely 

1370
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:28,044
killed a bunch of people,
but whether or not someone was helping 

1371
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,760
him or whether or not there was other 
people involved or I think they're still

1372
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:33,690
investigating.
I still.

1373
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,553
yeah,
but so I guess my greater point there 

1374
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:37,630
would be that,
uh,

1375
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,873
if you're an intelligent individual,
you can't just take what cvs tells you 

1376
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:44,070
to be complete fact,
right?

1377
00:55:44,071 --> 00:55:46,320
You,
you go do some investigation yourself,

1378
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:48,600
you try to read from different sources 
and then,

1379
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,830
hey,
sandy hook.

1380
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,960
I think there's like a 99 point nine,
nine,

1381
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:52,794
nine,
nine percent chance of the sandy hook 

1382
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:55,230
was real.
Right.

1383
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:59,940
Is there some crazy in the impetus,
really small chance that didn't happen?

1384
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:00,571
Sure.
Right.

1385
00:56:00,571 --> 00:56:01,650
But I think that,
I think there is,

1386
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:04,780
I think it's very unlikely and vegas was
a zero percent chance.

1387
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,400
Sandy sandy hook didn't happen.
Percent looked into it pretty,

1388
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,260
you know,
it's just sad to me.

1389
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:12,480
And you're a dad,
you know,

1390
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,673
the idea of your kid going to school and
getting their school getting shot up by 

1391
00:56:15,901 --> 00:56:17,220
some psychopath.
Yeah.

1392
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:19,440
Imagine if someone was saying that that 
was fake.

1393
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,030
Yeah.
After your kid's dead,

1394
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:24,670
you'd be frustrated,
infuriated.

1395
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:25,504
You wouldn't even know where to turn.
And these that's actually happening to 

1396
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:29,254
these people and they're,
they're getting labeled as frauds and 

1397
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,110
people are emailing them and saying,
how could you do this?

1398
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:38,620
You're defrauding the american people.
You're A part of the illuminati or.

1399
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,201
Yeah.
So.

1400
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:41,034
Well I think so.
I think there's obviously those people 

1401
00:56:42,511 --> 00:56:45,210
who are on right?
The way one side of it,

1402
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:45,871
there's.
So there's.

1403
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:47,940
So if you go a spectrum for me,
right,

1404
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:49,103
there's the american who's drinking diet
coke and eaten frozen pizza and 

1405
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:52,434
listening to ever cbs says.
And then the total opposite of the 

1406
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,624
spectrum.
There's the group that thinks every 

1407
00:56:57,241 --> 00:56:58,074
single thing that ever happens in 
America as a planet conspiracy by the 

1408
00:56:59,941 --> 00:57:00,774
new world order.
So those are two ends of the spectrum 

1409
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,603
right now.
We can fall anywhere in the middle 

1410
00:57:04,441 --> 00:57:05,274
there.
But so I think as an intelligent 

1411
00:57:06,601 --> 00:57:07,434
individual,
we look at situations independently and 

1412
00:57:09,151 --> 00:57:09,984
say,
well,

1413
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,510
there's some sketchy things.
They're not sketchy things there.

1414
00:57:12,511 --> 00:57:13,720
That's probably true,
right?

1415
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,160
And kind of independently think about 
stuff by ourselves and that's,

1416
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,880
that's how I do it.
And so,

1417
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,220
you know,
That's a wise way to approach it.

1418
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,660
and uh,
I think cbs or nbc or you know,

1419
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,970
any name,
your new source,

1420
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,790
they're run by people and if they 
weren't there,

1421
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:30,280
they only have access to a certain 
amount of information and sometimes they

1422
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:33,430
get bad information and sometimes they 
don't necessarily know.

1423
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:34,443
I don't know how much of it as a part of
some grand conspiracy rather than how 

1424
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:40,330
much of it is a part of the chaos of 
these moments.

1425
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:41,543
The lack Of information and people 
drawing conclusions and then also 

1426
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:49,600
witnesses on the scene on people on the 
scene of something that's crazy.

1427
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:52,960
They give all sorts of weird accounts 
and they're just,

1428
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:53,973
they're filled with adrenaline.
They don't know how to handle the 

1429
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,290
situation.
People.

1430
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,530
People don't handle chaotic events very 
well.

1431
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah,
but I don't think the earth is flat,

1432
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:03,821
if that's fair.
Oh,

1433
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:05,750
good for you.
Yeah.

1434
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,210
What do you possibly believe in?
that might be crazy.

1435
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:13,500
Can I take a piss and I'll tell you I go
fast.

1436
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:14,580
Go ahead.
No worries man.

1437
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,680
I wonder if there's something wrong with
my bladder.

1438
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:18,810
You can hold it.
Yeah.

1439
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,510
Do you think I've trained it?
Yeah.

1440
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:21,443
I mean sure.
Just that guy is going to try to shoot 

1441
00:58:23,011 --> 00:58:23,844
himseLf to see the flat earth and a 
couple of days guys shooting himself up 

1442
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:29,970
and go into the space.
Don't take one mark second.

1443
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,900
James kingston was dead.

1444
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,310
James kingston.
Thank you.

1445
00:58:32,311 --> 00:58:33,380
Sorry james.
Yeah.

1446
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,543
Bam.
Yeah,

1447
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:37,020
it's a dunbar.
There is dunbar's number,

1448
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:37,854
brother.
You can only keep 150 people in your 

1449
00:58:39,721 --> 00:58:42,120
brain at any time.
Look at that fucking picture.

1450
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:44,040
We're looking at a picture for the audio
folks.

1451
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:44,874
Have james kingston on the top of this 
tower and I don't know how many fucking 

1452
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,403
stories he's up there,
but it's insane because below him and I 

1453
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:56,460
mean way below him are skyscrapers.
that's probably like dubai or something.

1454
00:58:56,461 --> 00:58:56,790
Right.

1455
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:57,623
Do you think that dunbar's number,
it could apply to other things besides 

1456
00:58:59,691 --> 00:59:03,430
people like websites or chore numbers of
instructions that can.

1457
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,200
Yeah,

1458
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:04,621
yeah,
yeah,

1459
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:05,850
I think so.
You know,

1460
00:59:05,851 --> 00:59:08,970
I think it applies to too many things.
Uh,

1461
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:12,450
it applies.
I just think for names,

1462
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:13,470
names and people.
I'm,

1463
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:14,933
I'm struggling.
I think I'm getting like I have an 

1464
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,340
overflowing pot.
Like,

1465
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:21,980
um,
I'm shane burgos

1466
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,680
and calvin cater.
We're fighting this weekend and I called

1467
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:27,920
calvin cater chris cater after he won,
even though I'm a fan of his,

1468
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,230
like he wanted,
I went chris cater and then I'm like,

1469
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,370
it's fucking name's calvin.
Dunk con.

1470
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:36,380
Like I just don't.
I think we're running out of space in my

1471
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:39,590
head for names.
So my apologies to calvin cater.

1472
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,880
I'm running out of names and I,
we're talking about dunbar's number,

1473
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:45,560
how you can only keep so many people in 
your brain.

1474
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,640
My brain's overflowed.
I don't have any hard drive space left.

1475
00:59:49,641 --> 00:59:50,474
I didn't know.
So I thought it was the is that the guy 

1476
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:53,384
says you can only keep track of 150 
people like what's going on in their 

1477
00:59:56,711 --> 00:59:59,930
relationships in that kind of stuff.
You only have so much room in your.

1478
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,000
In your hard drive space.
Yeah.

1479
01:00:02,001 --> 01:00:04,010
It's based on a tribal societies.

1480
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:07,910
Like our brains are sort of designed to 
keep track of 150 people.

1481
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:10,280
That's how we evolved and then over the 
last,

1482
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,380
you know,
x amount of hundreds of years.

1483
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:14,450
Now all of a sudden you have to keep 
track of many,

1484
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:17,420
many multiples of that.
Especially if you're someone like you or

1485
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:22,250
I that runs into so many people who you 
meet on a regular basis.

1486
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,140
You've got to keep those people on your 
brain.

1487
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,460
But is it,
is it.

1488
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:26,323
So I guess I haven't read that much.
Is it that you have to just know their 

1489
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,334
names and faces or is it that you have 
to know like what's going on in their 

1490
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:34,034
life?
I think you're supposed to be able to 

1491
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:37,150
track them,
like have a,

1492
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,113
some sort of a,
whether it's intimate or personal 

1493
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:42,410
relationship with these people know 
them.

1494
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,753
Yeah,
so it's like there's only something 

1495
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,033
like,
especially if you think about a 

1496
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:47,863
commentating on fights,
I have to pay attention to these guys 

1497
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:50,744
and what they're doing and their career 
and there's hundreds and hundreds and 

1498
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:54,520
hundreds of 500 fighters now.

1499
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:59,390
500 fighters that's active and then how 
manY of them get new guys come in,

1500
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,090
old guy go away.
I still keep them all in my head.

1501
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,710
Hey,
what's sean sherk up to these days?

1502
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,240
They're all still in the head and it's 
like there's not,

1503
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,200
there's only so much room and after 
awhile you'll,

1504
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,101
you'll wonder.
You're like,

1505
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:11,900
Wow,
where are these people going?

1506
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,140
Yeah.
I found that obviously with a,

1507
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,900
It's sad like,
you know,

1508
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,750
college friends.
It's like,

1509
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:18,351
yeah,
you know,

1510
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:20,810
and it's good because you see them and 
it's like no time has passed.

1511
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:22,830
Right?
But it's like I,

1512
01:01:22,831 --> 01:01:24,410
if I,
if I know if I was living in two minutes

1513
01:01:24,411 --> 01:01:25,730
away,
we'd probably be best friends still.

1514
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:26,450
Right?
Right.

1515
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,180
Right now I get to see you once a year,
twice a year maybe.

1516
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:32,510
I can't keep up with you.
It's super challenging.

1517
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:34,340
I totally agree.
And now max and I run.

1518
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,520
The rest of the academy is my brother.
We have three in Wisconsin and it's like

1519
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:39,423
this fall was my first wife fulltime,
worked at one and so now I'm really 

1520
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:47,180
immersed in the one academy whereas I 
was kind of loosely keeping track of all

1521
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:48,014
three,
but now that I'm kind of totally 

1522
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:49,964
immersed in the one,
I find it a lot harder to keep track of 

1523
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,354
what's going on at the other two.
Whereas kind of bed right before when I 

1524
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:58,280
wasn't so immersed in one.
Yeah,

1525
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,280
I can only imagine.
Eddie bravo is 100 schools.

1526
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:01,881
That's crazy.
Right?

1527
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:04,250
As a 110 plans.
Jujitsu's worldwide.

1528
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:07,250
Like how he can't keep track all kennY?
I don't know.

1529
01:02:07,251 --> 01:02:08,600
I don't know.
I'd have to ask him.

1530
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,550
I know he travels to all of them.
He travels.

1531
01:02:10,551 --> 01:02:13,480
He's constantly traveling.
He travels constantly.

1532
01:02:13,481 --> 01:02:16,430
He's doing seminars at all of them.
Got always traveling.

1533
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,653
Yeah.
Once the sodium to do like one time a 

1534
01:02:19,141 --> 01:02:20,040
year for each facility

1535
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,821
or something.
I don't know.

1536
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:22,680
It's a good question because that would 
be columbia.

1537
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,640
He's going,
he's going,

1538
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:25,020
I mean probably wouldn't even be once a 
year.

1539
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,920
Yeah,
he didn't want three years.

1540
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,863
Singapore now he was out in st paul when
I was there and one of my fights this 

1541
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,300
year,
it was maybe the.

1542
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,320
Maybe the may fight dick.
Yeah.

1543
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,173
He was out there doing it as a 10 
seminar and now that now they have a 

1544
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:39,654
10th planet program at evolve is crazy.
Evolve as supposed to be an amazing 

1545
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:45,090
facility.
I've heard some things.

1546
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:49,020
Yeah.
I mean the nicest mma facility I've ever

1547
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:49,854
been to and so they have.
They actually just opened their fourth 

1548
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:51,881
location.
Justin,

1549
01:02:51,881 --> 01:02:54,420
Singapore,
Singapore is a city state,

1550
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:56,450
right?
It's 6 million people in a,

1551
01:02:56,451 --> 01:02:58,080
on a really,
really small island.

1552
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,053
But some of their,
some of their academies are only a mile 

1553
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:02,970
or two apart.

1554
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:06,570
Like they're not far apart,
but the population density is such that,

1555
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,360
you know,
they listened.

1556
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:12,420
They start classes at I think at 6:00
AM and they end class at 11:00

1557
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,253
PM and you can freaking stop in anytime 
of day and there'll be a class there 

1558
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:20,070
that's full with muay thai or jujitsu or
whatever you name it.

1559
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,560
It'll be going on.
That's crazy.

1560
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,553
Yeah.
Well manhattan is kind of like that a 

1561
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:25,300
lot of ways,
right?

1562
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,470
Manhattan as how many jujitsu schools 
are in manhattan?

1563
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,360
I mean obviously marcel.
Yeah,

1564
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:33,240
there's hundreds but run big ones.
Handles got a huge one.

1565
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,640
Marcel has got a huge one,
so yeah,

1566
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:39,440
there's a lot right there.
I mean those are huge places.

1567
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:41,790
Enormous.
Hundreds and hundreds of students.

1568
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,470
I thought that.
I know.

1569
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:44,880
I thought it was thousands.
That's what someone told me.

1570
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:45,743
Hands over a thousand students in the 
main New York city location and I think 

1571
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,470
it's,
you know,

1572
01:03:51,471 --> 01:03:52,304
it ain't cheap because you got to pay 
for rent and so they're probably paying 

1573
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:56,700
a couple hundred bucks a month.

1574
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:01,080
Yeah.
So evolve is I think $350 a month.

1575
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:02,310
Wow.
But obviously,

1576
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:05,010
so Singapore is one of the most wealthy 
countries on the planet,

1577
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:08,220
so you have to take that into account 
for which everyone that lives there,

1578
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:11,530
he has a,
a decent amount of wealth and they spend

1579
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,120
it differently in Singapore is a 
fascinating country if you,

1580
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:14,973
I,
I,

1581
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,520
you know,
I was there 15 times or whatever,

1582
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:18,354
so I got kind of immersed in the culture
and that ended up reading the books 

1583
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:22,290
about lee kuan yew,
the guy who started the country.

1584
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,290
And so,
you know,

1585
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:25,020
there was a whole bunch of those asian 
countries,

1586
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:28,410
they're got independence in the 19 
fifties and sixties.

1587
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:32,490
I'm in Singapore,
I believe was founded in 1965.

1588
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:34,490
It could be off by one year,
there may be,

1589
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,000
um,
but you know,

1590
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:39,330
a lot of those countries are not doing 
super well economically.

1591
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,313
And sIngapore is like,
this is freaking standout country who's 

1592
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:47,830
like top five world per person wealth 
and why,

1593
01:04:47,831 --> 01:04:49,230
why,
why are they doing so much better?

1594
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,153
Uh,
and so this is me from an outsider's 

1595
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:52,734
perspective.
So,

1596
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,170
um,
they really do a lot of kind of.

1597
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:57,450
It's kind of like self tracking,
right?

1598
01:04:57,451 --> 01:05:01,410
And so every month a bunch of your check
comes out to a,

1599
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:02,610
you know,
like we would pay taxes,

1600
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:03,400
right?
Bunch of mannequins,

1601
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,160
other check,
but so they can spend it.

1602
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:07,260
This is fascinating.
They spend their money on three things.

1603
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:08,700
It goes into this fund,
right?

1604
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,710
Education,
healthcare,

1605
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,870
and housing.
Okay.

1606
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,110
And so if you want cheaper,
if any one of those,

1607
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:17,770
if you want the cheapest form of it,
right?

1608
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,160
It's very government subsidized and it 
comes out of your fund,

1609
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:21,994
right?
So only a little bit of mine comes out 

1610
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:27,220
if you want the nicest healthcare,
the nicest housing are nice,

1611
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,610
then it's only a tiny percent government
subsidized.

1612
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:33,010
Right?
So the more expensive stuff gets,

1613
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:35,140
whether it's education or housing or 
healthcare,

1614
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:37,480
the less subsidized it gets in,
the cheaper it gets,

1615
01:05:37,481 --> 01:05:40,210
the more subsidized it gets.
And so everyone kind of,

1616
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:40,991
you know,
they pay,

1617
01:05:40,991 --> 01:05:45,790
they pay into this fund so everyone has 
this personal fund that they can use and

1618
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:47,620
then you know,
into those three things.

1619
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:48,454
And so I think a lot of people have,
I think they feel like they have more 

1620
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,580
control over their lives.
And,

1621
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,443
and you know,
obviously it is very strict regulations 

1622
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:56,620
and laws,
but from what I've seen and I've spent a

1623
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:58,570
lot of time there,
everyone seems pretty happy.

1624
01:05:58,990 --> 01:05:59,680
That's interest.

1625
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,080
Yeah.
That's an interesting way to go.

1626
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:01,923
I mean,
I don't think there's any one good way 

1627
01:06:02,651 --> 01:06:04,960
to government to govern people.
Yeah.

1628
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,330
And I mean I think we have a pretty good
system over here,

1629
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:08,164
but it's obviously filled with 
bureaucratic bullshit and too much 

1630
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,100
weight,
too much government.

1631
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:14,140
There's so much,
there's way too many people doing stupid

1632
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:17,800
jobs and getting paid too much or doing 
them and I mean it's.

1633
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,050
And,
and then the shit like,

1634
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,033
you know,
trying to chase down medical marijuana 

1635
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:25,990
in 2017 trying to stop legal marijuana 
and like why,

1636
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,820
like what,
who's paying you to do this?

1637
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:29,020
Like why,
why are you doing that?

1638
01:06:29,021 --> 01:06:29,854
That doesn't make any sense.
It's not what our tax dollars should be 

1639
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:31,750
going to.

1640
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,310
You know,
it's funny when you go all the way back,

1641
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,213
I think about it.
So we've talked about that process of 

1642
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:39,390
who's keeping them from doing this and 
you have about the pharmaceuticals with,

1643
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,110
with weed,
which I think is true.

1644
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:45,820
You know what a funny one I think about 
is john mccain and mixed martial arts,

1645
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,550
who is sponsoring john mccain,
budweiser,

1646
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:49,384
budweiser,
who was like the main advertise of her 

1647
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:52,024
boxing.
It's like you cannot make an argument 

1648
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:55,190
that boxing safer for them.
Mma,

1649
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,300
you can't freaking do it.
So like it's impossible possible.

1650
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,930
It's impossible.
But john mccain's over here getting paid

1651
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:05,380
by budweiser and saying mma is awful,
let's ban it.

1652
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,570
And the same time he's promoting boxing 
essentially.

1653
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:09,100
It's freaking mindblowing.
Well,

1654
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:10,780
in his defense it was mma

1655
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:11,713
from a long time ago and it was,
it wasn't really the same as them may 

1656
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:15,764
now.
And he's turned the corner and now he 

1657
01:07:16,881 --> 01:07:17,714
supports.
Yeah.

1658
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:22,010
But also you've got budweiser and bud 
light or sponsors now of mna.

1659
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:22,903
So it's like.
But that's a real problem with 

1660
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,030
politicians.
Thirty years.

1661
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,820
There's so many dirty politicians.
I don't know what percentage is,

1662
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,110
but it's high,
97.

1663
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:32,180
It's probably,
it's probably a fucking high.

1664
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:37,070
What crazy shIt that.
What crazy conspiracy do you believe in?

1665
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,613
So the one that got me started really 
like independently think myself as nine 

1666
01:07:41,921 --> 01:07:43,150
slash 11,
which I think that was,

1667
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:45,340
that was for a lot of people.
Yeah.

1668
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:46,383
Yeah.
What,

1669
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:48,080
what do you think about nine slash 11.
Oh,

1670
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:49,750
I know,
I don't know all the answers,

1671
01:07:49,751 --> 01:07:54,630
but I know the given explanation.
I don't believe what given explanation.

1672
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:55,900
Uh,
the one that came,

1673
01:07:55,901 --> 01:07:58,540
what's the damn report that they wrote?
Um,

1674
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,040
the nist report?
No,

1675
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,300
that wasn't what it was,
was it?

1676
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:01,961
Yeah.
Well,

1677
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:06,961
nist is the one who did the report on 
tower seven collapsing

1678
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:08,343
now.
What was the other report that came out 

1679
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:11,230
with right away?
Anyway,

1680
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:14,560
so my buddies live right by the airport 
and he played loose change for me.

1681
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:17,570
And I said,
you were out of your ged mind,

1682
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:19,840
like you are insane man.
Right.

1683
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:22,990
and then I started thinking,
well that doesn't make,

1684
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:25,700
maybe maybe I should think about it,
you know,

1685
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:30,020
that it was an inside job.
I'm not totally,

1686
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:31,100
I mean,
I,

1687
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,220
so I think obviously the planes flew 
into the buildings for sure.

1688
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:35,540
No doubt about that.
But,

1689
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,430
um,
that maybe the,

1690
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:38,293
there was inklings inclinations that it 
had that was going to happen and that 

1691
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:43,580
not enough was done to stop it.
I think

1692
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:45,883
this is one.
This is another thing where you have a 

1693
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:50,060
gigantic tragedy and because of a 
gigantic tragedy,

1694
01:08:50,061 --> 01:08:50,894
there's a lot of people that draw these 
conclusions based on witness testimony 

1695
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:55,634
and things that are happening.
But I think you have to realize that 

1696
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:01,040
anytime there is some,
some thing that happens,

1697
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:05,450
people start looking for all these 
different correlating factors,

1698
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:06,051
right?
You start saying,

1699
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:06,884
well,
hey look,

1700
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:07,933
you know,
there was a local tests that were being 

1701
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:10,994
done.
There was,

1702
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:11,923
they were looking out for planes that 
were potentially gonna fly into 

1703
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:15,734
building.
They knew this was going to happen in 

1704
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:17,144
advance.
But if you talk to anybody that is in 

1705
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,470
intelligence,
there's,

1706
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,690
they're dealing with that shit every 
day.

1707
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:24,943
Just one day something happens.
There's always warnings about terrorist 

1708
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:30,224
attacks.
There's always warnings about things 

1709
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:32,930
happen.
And a lot of times they,

1710
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:35,750
these warnings get toward like,
the fbi stopped that.

1711
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,070
I'm

1712
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:36,850
quick.
There was one,

1713
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:38,410
there was one in san francisco,
right?

1714
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,950
They had bombs and they stopped and we 
through security,

1715
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:41,700
wherever.
Yeah,

1716
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,600
and this has happened many times now 
when,

1717
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:45,443
when it doesn't,
when they don't catch it and it goes 

1718
01:09:47,551 --> 01:09:49,380
through,
then people start thinking,

1719
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,480
oh,
there was some sort of a conspiracy.

1720
01:09:51,481 --> 01:09:53,820
They allow these planes to fly into 
buildings.

1721
01:09:53,821 --> 01:09:56,930
The missile hit the pentagon and he 
pulled up.

1722
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:57,853
Look,
there was a video came out of that last 

1723
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,320
week,
but I might've been fake news.

1724
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,273
The pentagon thing.
There was a video of the pentagon or 

1725
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:03,463
something handed the pentagon which 
looked take a missile and not an 

1726
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:07,030
airplane,
but I don't believe it was know.

1727
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:07,873
I was like,
this is interesting because I've never 

1728
01:10:08,811 --> 01:10:09,644
seen this video before and obviously 
there no video evidence of what hit the 

1729
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:13,483
pentagon.

1730
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:14,803
There's a video of something.
I know there was one camera thing or a 

1731
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:19,303
security camera video that was released,
but what they did have is all sorts of 

1732
01:10:22,101 --> 01:10:22,934
pizza pieces of aircraft all over the 
fucking lawn in a blown up building and 

1733
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:30,380
a plane that's missing and all the 
people dead.

1734
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,460
Like,
I'm going to guess it was a plane.

1735
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:33,740
You know,
I just,

1736
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,980
I think people look for conspiracies and
everything because it's exciting,

1737
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,350
stimulating about it.
There is,

1738
01:10:40,351 --> 01:10:41,184
but then obviously be.
I know that you don't believe that 

1739
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:46,290
everything we're told is the truth right
away,

1740
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,630
right?
I mean if we go to something like a gulf

1741
01:10:48,631 --> 01:10:50,040
of tonkin incident,
right?

1742
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:50,874
I mean perfect.
That's been proven to be false or the 

1743
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:54,240
fat,
like the banana republics,

1744
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:55,103
right?
Where dole asked us to go take out one 

1745
01:10:56,941 --> 01:10:57,774
of their dictators because they were 
going to nationalize all the banana 

1746
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:02,820
plants in that country.
I mean those things have been now proven

1747
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,713
to be totally factual that the United 
States government went and did that 

1748
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:07,710
stuff.
So The fact that,

1749
01:11:07,711 --> 01:11:09,690
and you know,
in 19 sixties or seventies,

1750
01:11:09,691 --> 01:11:12,930
those things were reported the opposite,
right?

1751
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,000
So we can't obviously take

1752
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:15,960
everything that we've been reported as 
truth.

1753
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:17,123
Well,
there's definitely been conspiracies 

1754
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:19,583
that have been put together and executed
and these conspiracies have greatly 

1755
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:28,620
affected the american people.
the gulf of tonkin is a perfect example.

1756
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:33,090
Another one that they were planning on 
was operation northwoods operation.

1757
01:11:33,091 --> 01:11:36,730
Northwoods was one that they were 
planning on blowing up a drone jet liner

1758
01:11:36,731 --> 01:11:37,564
and blaming it on the cubans that were 
going to arm cuban friendlies and have 

1759
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:40,734
them attack,
wanted,

1760
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:43,290
obey.
there would be sacrifice american troops

1761
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,124
in american lives and they were going to
do this in order to get people to be 

1762
01:11:47,161 --> 01:11:48,810
excited about a war with Cuba.
Yes.

1763
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:49,653
Was.
ThIs is a real thing that was signed by 

1764
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:51,414
the joint chiefs of staff.
It was released by the freedom of 

1765
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:55,020
information act and it was vetoed by 
kennedy,

1766
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,530
so we know that there were people,
at least in 1962,

1767
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,180
they were planning on shit like this.

1768
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:01,620
Yeah.
So that's a real thing too.

1769
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,560
And the idea that that just went away 
and no one does that anymore.

1770
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:05,910
It's crazy.
I dOn't,

1771
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:07,210
I don't believe that.
I think there's,

1772
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:12,230
there's most certainly evil people in 
all fucking sectors of life.

1773
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:13,710
Yes,
absolutely.

1774
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:15,780
Yeah.
So it's good to have an open mind,

1775
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,823
but there's also a lot of fucking 
conspiracy loons that and they get 

1776
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:22,560
consumed that that's,
that's the issue they get consumed with.

1777
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,113
nothing that I've been told is true,
which is obviously I said that one far 

1778
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:29,040
end of the spectrum that I didn't know 
who that end is.

1779
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:29,874
Crazy.
Also.

1780
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:30,733
Yeah,
there's people out there that think to 

1781
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:32,003
satellites are fake and they think that 
they were real and that the earth is 

1782
01:12:36,721 --> 01:12:40,110
flat as that's once I just shake my head
like the moon landing one's my favorite.

1783
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,600
I got balls deep in that for years.

1784
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,820
I was completely.
You think they did not go to the moon?

1785
01:12:44,821 --> 01:12:45,231
No,
I don't.

1786
01:12:45,231 --> 01:12:46,750
I don't think that anymore,
but I.

1787
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,750
You know what I think now I think I 
don't know,

1788
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:50,423
but I do think that it is one of the 
more fascinating conspiracies that 

1789
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:57,270
between 1969 in 1972,
they had seven,

1790
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:59,950
seven,
seven attempt.

1791
01:12:59,951 --> 01:13:00,784
Six of them successful when they went to
the apollo 13 was the one that they 

1792
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:05,940
didn't apparently make it and they had 
to come back,

1793
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:07,163
but that was the only time in history 
that a human being has been more than 

1794
01:13:10,531 --> 01:13:14,610
400 miles above the earth's surface.
All the space station missions,

1795
01:13:14,611 --> 01:13:18,420
all the space shuttle missions and all 
that stuff is is within orbit.

1796
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,550
That's low.
That's all very low.

1797
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:24,090
They went 260,000
miles out and back into deep space,

1798
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:28,120
but they had never even flown a chicken 
out there and see if it comes alive.

1799
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:29,280
Like we really,
really?

1800
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:29,741
Yeah.
No,

1801
01:13:29,741 --> 01:13:31,260
I'm not into this space.
Travel.

1802
01:13:31,261 --> 01:13:32,094
And so.
And they did a couple of flybys went 

1803
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:35,880
around the moon early before they landed
on the moon.

1804
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:37,140
Yeah.
But other than that,

1805
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,003
I mean without unmanned drones,
like what we have on mars and things 

1806
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:41,994
like that.
We've never really sent a living thing 

1807
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:44,603
out through the magneto sphere,
through the van allen radiation belts 

1808
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,750
into deep space,
have it,

1809
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,510
you know,
there's all these possibilities of solar

1810
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:52,344
flares and anything that would have 
killed him instantly and they just did 

1811
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,900
that and then we haven't been able to do
that since 1972.

1812
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,480
That's the one way I.
I've never looked into the moon landing.

1813
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,980
I think it's kind of goofy.
Right?

1814
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:03,060
Well,
it's weird.

1815
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:05,580
It's a weird one.
Why have we never gone back?

1816
01:14:05,581 --> 01:14:08,070
It's been fifth,
surely our technology is far superior to

1817
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:09,840
what it was in 1969,
right.

1818
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,733
The technology is far superior except 
that they're not using that technology 

1819
01:14:15,191 --> 01:14:19,630
for man space travel into deep space 
like that and it's going to the moon,

1820
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:23,710
so it's like our technology and all 
these other areas is superior,

1821
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:26,800
but they haven't really worked towards 
that because they haven't been funded.

1822
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,400
So the big issue is in many ways it's 
money,

1823
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:31,383
right?
It's how much money is there and going 

1824
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:36,580
to the moon and it's also very risky to 
send humans out there.

1825
01:14:36,730 --> 01:14:39,520
Maybe we're talking about manned 
missions to mars now,

1826
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:41,500
which may or may not take place by 20,
30.

1827
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:42,334
They're talking about doing that,
but it's way cheaper and safer to send 

1828
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:46,384
robots out there.
Like why risk human lives retro the 

1829
01:14:50,021 --> 01:14:50,710
moon.
Right?

1830
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:53,710
And if put robots on mars,
rovers,

1831
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:54,583
rovers on mars or most,
that's the most interesting because 

1832
01:14:57,311 --> 01:14:58,144
they're.
They're sending these really high 

1833
01:14:58,601 --> 01:14:59,434
resolution photos of the surface of mars
and they're running tests and checking 

1834
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:03,940
for biological life.

1835
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,350
It's really,
really interesting stuff,

1836
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,310
but between 69 and 72 when they did all 
this stuff,

1837
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,173
I mean there's the technology back then 
was nothing compared to what they have 

1838
01:15:14,351 --> 01:15:19,351
now in terms of calculations and 
computers and and it's also there was a.

1839
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:20,823
There's unquestionably some stuff that,
whether it was images or video that was 

1840
01:15:26,411 --> 01:15:30,730
faked and I think really like that never
looked into this at all.

1841
01:15:30,890 --> 01:15:34,390
Gemini 15 is the big one because there's
a photo of Michael Collins,

1842
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:35,523
it shows him in deep space and they,
they use it as a press release saying 

1843
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:40,144
that he was on a space walk when it was 
really an image of him from a test run 

1844
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:49,120
where there was all this stuff in the 
background and he was on his harness and

1845
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:51,550
they just blacked out the background and
tried to sell it.

1846
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:54,820
As him being in space a find that my 
Michael Collins,

1847
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:57,620
I was looking at how much it costs to 
send somebody to space,

1848
01:15:57,621 --> 01:16:01,250
so it's an insane 79,
70 million for ash,

1849
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,580
a nasa astronaut to fly on a russian 
shuttle.

1850
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:08,740
Private guy's trying to sell tickets to 
places that mean phase.

1851
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,930
I was just trying to do at musc 
obviously,

1852
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:12,320
but that space,
that's just,

1853
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,900
that's just low earth orbit.
That's,

1854
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:16,630
that's still inside 400 miles.
None of them are trying to go anywhere.

1855
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,510
No.
Well they might in the future.

1856
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,740
Branson.
Well that's all same thing.

1857
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:22,170
It's all the way through but,
but,

1858
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,620
but they are talking about future visits
to the moon and to mars.

1859
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,630
But a lot of times I feel like when they
say that,

1860
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,673
you know,
George Bush senior said that they were 

1861
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:32,254
going to go to the moon,
back to the moon again in like fucking 

1862
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:36,460
one was that 1990 or whatever the hell 
that was.

1863
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:39,550
But People have always said we're going 
to go back to the moon,

1864
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:43,210
but we haven't been back since 1972.
Does that mean that we never went?

1865
01:16:43,211 --> 01:16:45,880
No,
but then it gets weird when you find out

1866
01:16:45,881 --> 01:16:48,310
that wernher von braun was a fucking 
nazi.

1867
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:49,930
Who?
Wernher von braun,

1868
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:50,764
the guy who was the head of nasa.
He was the guy who organized the moon 

1869
01:16:53,621 --> 01:16:56,830
landings and though he was the head 
rocket guy,

1870
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,113
he was he.
That guy was a legit nazi like he's 

1871
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,620
wanted by the simon wiesenthal center,
said that he was alive today.

1872
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,050
They would prosecute him for crimes 
against humanity.

1873
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:09,063
They would hang the five slowest workers
every day in front of his berlin rocket 

1874
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:14,360
factory.
Oh yeah.

1875
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:15,770
No,
100 percent.

1876
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:17,300
I mean,
that's what they did.

1877
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:21,920
What they did was they took this thing 
was called operation paperclip,

1878
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:23,383
where when we won world war two,
they took all the top nazi scientists 

1879
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:28,723
and they secretly brought them over to 
America and they did it on the down low 

1880
01:17:31,591 --> 01:17:33,080
so that no one would think like,
hey,

1881
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:38,081
why do we have a guy named wernher von 
braun running the american space program

1882
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,313
was because the,
the nazi scientists or insanely 

1883
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:42,554
advanced.

1884
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,330
So the question is like,
well,

1885
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:45,164
were they really nazis or were they 
scientists that were under the boot of 

1886
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:49,290
the nazi administration?
I mean,

1887
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,240
well,
I don't know.

1888
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:51,410
I mean,
I'm not around that,

1889
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,633
but I do know that these are the people 
that were the head engineers and the 

1890
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:57,944
people that designed it.
Wernher von braun's himself was saying 

1891
01:18:01,611 --> 01:18:02,444
how impossible it was just years before 
they did the moon landing and years 

1892
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:08,720
before operation paperclip,
that it was impossible to go to the moon

1893
01:18:08,721 --> 01:18:09,554
or how ridiculously impossible would be,
but technology advanced from then to 

1894
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:15,770
when 19,
69 happened to when they did it.

1895
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,083
I stopped saying that we never went to 
the moon because I really don't know 

1896
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:20,910
what the fuck I'm talking about and 
that's.

1897
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:24,140
That's a big part of understanding these
conspiracies is hard.

1898
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:24,741
You have to.
Well,

1899
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:28,490
you have to really know.
How much do I know about rocketry?

1900
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,710
how much do I know about aerospace?
C?

1901
01:18:30,711 --> 01:18:33,260
Zero.
So if I'm running around saying,

1902
01:18:33,261 --> 01:18:35,600
I don't know,
I don't believe people went to the moon.

1903
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,840
What is it based on?
It's based on mostly on ignorance,

1904
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,733
speculation and the exciting,
the excited feeling that comes with 

1905
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,080
trying to uncover a conspiracy.

1906
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,500
Sure.
But a,

1907
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,140
and I think you do have to be a little 
bit discerning on what you hear,

1908
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:53,120
but it is frustrating and that's where a
lot of these conspiracy guys,

1909
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:53,983
they think they know more than they do 
because you have to come to the 

1910
01:18:57,171 --> 01:19:00,470
realization that you're probably never 
going to know the real answer with a lot

1911
01:19:00,471 --> 01:19:01,720
of these things.
Realize that.

1912
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,200
I mean some of them come out many,
many,

1913
01:19:03,201 --> 01:19:04,490
many,
many years later we're talking about the

1914
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:07,100
gulf of tonkin writer or operation 
northwoods.

1915
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:07,963
Many years later it comes out,
but you know there's a good likelihood 

1916
01:19:10,341 --> 01:19:13,220
that I'll never know the truth on stuff 
I read a lot about.

1917
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:15,970
I think with the moon landing,
it's way more likely that we went to the

1918
01:19:15,971 --> 01:19:18,250
moon,
But that some of the footage is fake and

1919
01:19:18,251 --> 01:19:22,150
I think they probably did that because 
it's incredibly difficult to film things

1920
01:19:22,151 --> 01:19:22,984
on the moon and I think they filmed some
stuff in test runs and then tried to 

1921
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:29,410
pass that.
They didn't have it Back then.

1922
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:33,190
They had these cameras that they had in 
the center of their chest.

1923
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,530
I think they have been taking a selfie 
on the moon.

1924
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:36,453
They have the snapchat snap chatting it.
You'd have to take your shirt off and 

1925
01:19:38,201 --> 01:19:39,034
then you would die because they didn't 
have a camera that you could put in 

1926
01:19:42,551 --> 01:19:43,070
front of you.

1927
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:43,903
Well,
maybe they have all those clicker 

1928
01:19:44,061 --> 01:19:47,480
buttons they could have wIth their big 
gloves on and they put the thing out and

1929
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:50,210
then click it and then boom,
snapchat life on the moon.

1930
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,440
Well,
that's what they said.

1931
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,540
Well,
it was that they did it remotely.

1932
01:19:53,541 --> 01:19:57,380
That's how they captured the video of 
the lunar module,

1933
01:19:57,381 --> 01:19:58,214
leaving the surface of the moon and 
panned up and watched it go that they 

1934
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:01,934
did all that remotely.
It's all this some squirrely footage 

1935
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:06,223
ever.
See the video of them jumping around it 

1936
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:08,500
like they're on trampolines.
See that?

1937
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:11,520
Like they're just bouncing straight up 
in the air and you're like,

1938
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:13,050
well,
what the fuck is that?

1939
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:15,840
How come the physics are different in 
different flights?

1940
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:18,600
Like in some,
some of the flights like apollo 11,

1941
01:20:18,601 --> 01:20:20,700
they're barely getting off the ground 
and one where they're like,

1942
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:23,700
they're walking,
but they're going to do like that.

1943
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,350
Well,
there's ones like that,

1944
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:27,420
and then there's also ones where they 
fall down.

1945
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:29,310
It looks like the getting yanked up by 
wires.

1946
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:33,060
I think it's entirely possible that some
of that stuff was fake,

1947
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:34,170
but I don't.

1948
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:35,003
I think it's way more likely that they 
actually went to the moon then they 

1949
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:38,004
didn't,
but it's way sexier to think that they 

1950
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:41,670
faked the whole thing.
It's fun.

1951
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:45,120
It's fun to think they faked the whole 
thing and everybody was quiet about it.

1952
01:20:45,121 --> 01:20:45,954
And you know,
neil armstrong gave this real cryptic 

1953
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:50,700
speech on the 25th anniversary of the 
moon mission saying that,

1954
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:52,830
you know,
there are hidden truths,

1955
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:53,630
uh,
the,

1956
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:53,971
the,
the,

1957
01:20:53,971 --> 01:20:54,950
that uh,
what,

1958
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:56,970
uh,
what is the exact quote that he said?

1959
01:20:57,710 --> 01:20:58,543
Um,
some of the great truths that could be 

1960
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:07,050
real revealed,
removing some of truths,

1961
01:21:07,051 --> 01:21:10,230
hidden layers.
Like he was giving her away.

1962
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,180
It was real cryptic.
It was like,

1963
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:15,530
what do you see if you could find it?
Yeah.

1964
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,490
Play the.
He might've been given it away.

1965
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:20,190
Well,
it seems if you were conspiracy theory,

1966
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:23,760
this would give you a rock hard boner 
because less than listen to this,

1967
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,860
neil armstrong made a rare public 
appearance.

1968
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:27,610
Next generation of tax payers.

1969
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:28,670
No,
no,

1970
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:29,503
no.
Just play the whole thing so you don't 

1971
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:31,070
confuse everybody.

1972
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:32,363
In 1994,
neil armstrong mater rare public 

1973
01:21:34,861 --> 01:21:39,660
appearance and held back tears as he 
spoke these brief cryptic remarks before

1974
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:43,350
the next generation of tax payers as 
they toured the white house.

1975
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:49,990
Today we have with this group of 
students some on america's best to you.

1976
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:56,330
We say we have only completed a 
beginning.

1977
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:01,390
We leave you much.
That is under.

1978
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:08,330
There are great ideas.
Undiscovered breakthroughs are available

1979
01:22:08,331 --> 01:22:13,331
to those who can remove one of truett's 
protective layers.

1980
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:20,130
What the fuck does that mean?
I mean what you supposed to say?

1981
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:21,480
Yo,
I went to the moon bitch.

1982
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:26,460
That's supposed to say breakthroughs 
away.

1983
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,413
Truth,
protective layers like I don't 

1984
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:31,600
understand what that means.
The via the press conferences.

1985
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:34,440
One of the more fascinating things,
if you watch the press conference again,

1986
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:36,900
I was balls deep in this stuff for 
years.

1987
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:38,123
The press conference from 1969 when they
were returned from the moon is one of 

1988
01:22:41,431 --> 01:22:44,400
the most cryptic weird things you'll 
ever see.

1989
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:49,020
these guys look like they just stole 
something and they're being questioned.

1990
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,390
It's,
it's.

1991
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:54,840
I've never seen a video where people 
look like they're more full of shit.

1992
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:57,720
Then that video of the press conference 
from 1969.

1993
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,130
It's weird,
man.

1994
01:22:59,131 --> 01:23:02,160
It's weird.
They're like fidgety and looking nervous

1995
01:23:02,161 --> 01:23:03,510
lIke they're getting away with 
something.

1996
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:04,344
Then they might have done it.
They might have been forced to say some 

1997
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:11,800
things that they didn't want to say and 
that could be part of it.

1998
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,653
Absolutely know they could have done it,
but there's a lot of weirdness with the 

1999
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:16,690
moon landing.
It's,

2000
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:17,693
it's.
If you wanted to have like a conspiracy 

2001
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,420
that to wrap your head around.
IT's exciting.

2002
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:26,140
It's one of the best ones who benefit,
who benefits from it?

2003
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:27,483
The United States government did because
it showed military superiority over the 

2004
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:31,240
russian,
so we were able to do that,

2005
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:34,720
but also it was the nixon 
administration.

2006
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,960
People would just flat out full of shit.
Well,

2007
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:37,803
yeah.
I mean they were just lying to people 

2008
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:40,030
left and right back the government 
though.

2009
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:40,923
Yeah,
but even more so then because It was 

2010
01:23:42,031 --> 01:23:43,840
unchecked,
there was no media,

2011
01:23:44,670 --> 01:23:48,490
nothing that would expose them for this 
and this stuff.

2012
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:49,803
They would air it on tv once in 1969.
You never see it again unless you 

2013
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:55,210
watched it on failed.
There's no youtube.

2014
01:23:55,211 --> 01:23:58,900
We can go back and watch the astronauts 
on trampolines video.

2015
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:00,730
That's my favorite one.
You wAtch that.

2016
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:02,500
You know what in the fuck is happening 
there.

2017
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:05,470
These guys are bouncing up in the air 
like how are they doing that?

2018
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:06,663
Like they never did.
If you watch apollo 11 when they were 

2019
01:24:08,471 --> 01:24:10,300
moving around on the surface of the 
moon,

2020
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,333
it just like they're moving in slow 
motion and then you go to whatever it 

2021
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:17,920
was like apollo 14 or 15 when they were 
doing the trampoline thing.

2022
01:24:17,921 --> 01:24:20,740
They fucking flying through the air.
Have you seen it?

2023
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:21,593
I have not.
I know I had never gotten to the moon 

2024
01:24:22,831 --> 01:24:25,060
thing.
The flight watching this ridiculous.

2025
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:26,003
This

2026
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:29,410
and like their feet are hidden.
Look at this.

2027
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:30,603
Watch these guys bounced up in the air.
It's like they're on some sort of 

2028
01:24:32,321 --> 01:24:35,080
wireless being yanked up into the air.
Oh yeah,

2029
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:36,693
like what the fuck are they doing?
And they're playing like falling down 

2030
01:24:39,761 --> 01:24:40,594
and it's very weird,
but it could've been that they were 

2031
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:43,624
really on the moon and these guys were 
fucking cowboys and yahoos and they 

2032
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:49,440
wanted to bounce around.
Oh,

2033
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:51,160
you were pacing your posted those 
videos,

2034
01:24:51,161 --> 01:24:52,840
post those videos back in the day.
Yeah.

2035
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:53,703
I had a debate on penn jillette's radio 
show with a guy who was an astronomer 

2036
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:00,880
and he wasn't willing to admit a lot of 
stuff.

2037
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:03,070
That was a fact,
like the fact that wernher von braun was

2038
01:25:03,071 --> 01:25:05,410
a nazi and the fly looks was still 
there.

2039
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:06,573
Well,
the flag had a wire first of all on the 

2040
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:10,030
top of it that stiffened it up to make 
it,

2041
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:15,310
but there there's videos of the flag 
moving in a nonexistent breeze,

2042
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:16,413
which is weird too,
and they try to make some logical 

2043
01:25:19,271 --> 01:25:20,104
explanations for why the flAg could be 
moving in a vacuum and some of it makes 

2044
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:27,250
sense,
but some of it doesn't like the wires.

2045
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,470
One is weird if you watch them fall 
down,

2046
01:25:29,471 --> 01:25:30,970
like go to that one right there.
Jamie.

2047
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:32,463
You like if you watch sometimes they're 
falling down and when they're falling 

2048
01:25:36,551 --> 01:25:38,320
down it looks like they get yanked back 
up,

2049
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,710
but I think it might not have been real 
footage.

2050
01:25:41,711 --> 01:25:46,090
What they might've done is use some test
footage like right there at jamie,

2051
01:25:46,091 --> 01:25:46,924
right there.
Let it go.

2052
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:50,800
Like homeboy falls down and then it 
looks like he is yanked back up.

2053
01:25:50,801 --> 01:25:51,210
Look at it.

2054
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:53,440
Oh,
he did not want him standing up.

2055
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:55,380
Yeah.
What is this that's standing up?

2056
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,720
You can't stand up like that.
Right?

2057
01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:00,370
But you're on the moon.
Earth gravity.

2058
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,233
But there was no.
There was nothing to make them go like 

2059
01:26:02,351 --> 01:26:03,560
this.
Right.

2060
01:26:03,561 --> 01:26:04,050
You can't get

2061
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:05,100
up without.
Exactly.

2062
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:05,983
Now we go back to mma because that's 
what these freaking folkstyle wrestling 

2063
01:26:09,171 --> 01:26:10,004
is.
The next generation of mma you can turn 

2064
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:14,300
to your base to get up.
You can't look at it.

2065
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:15,980
There's nothing on the ground.
How's he going to get them on?

2066
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:18,920
Mexican yanked up.
He would have super abs.

2067
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,590
He would have to be like a break dancer 
because okay.

2068
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:23,780
Maybe a break dancer,
a break dancer,

2069
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:26,510
but you can't get up without putting a 
base down.

2070
01:26:26,511 --> 01:26:27,860
Right?
Yeah.

2071
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:29,350
That waS really weird.
I never saw a court.

2072
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,430
watch it again.
Watch them get yanked up.

2073
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:32,410
Yeah.
He's got no base.

2074
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:36,500
That little pieces played in reverse.
Almost does.

2075
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,430
It almost does.
Yeah.

2076
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,433
That he couldn't stand up like that,
but the thing falls down right 

2077
01:26:40,971 --> 01:26:42,380
afterwards.
So it wasn't a reverse.

2078
01:26:42,381 --> 01:26:45,800
Not.
I think it's entirely possible that some

2079
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:46,634
of the footage was bullshit,
but it doesn't mean that they didn't go 

2080
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:49,454
to the moon.

2081
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,433
It means that overzealous people in.
He only has one sweat on the ground 

2082
01:26:53,331 --> 01:26:54,164
there too.
Right?

2083
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:54,981
Yeah.
Well that's true.

2084
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:56,780
Look at this watch.
So he stood up like,

2085
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:58,280
that's ridiculous.
You can't do it.

2086
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,501
Right.
Foot's down.

2087
01:26:59,501 --> 01:27:01,870
His left foot's up and he just goes 
straight up there.

2088
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:05,450
That's fake.
But I've never been in one six,

2089
01:27:05,451 --> 01:27:10,451
zero gravity and neither of you know 
what that says.

2090
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:15,170
We never went to the moon was fake.
No,

2091
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,120
the video is real.
That's from television.

2092
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:20,750
The video,
that guy standing up like that.

2093
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,250
He got help somehow.
Well,

2094
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:25,040
he can't stand up like that very well.
He could have been on wires.

2095
01:27:25,190 --> 01:27:26,023
It could have been that they were using 
that to simulate what it would be like 

2096
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,240
because they definitely filled a lot of 
simulations.

2097
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:34,880
They get a lot of that because they 
wanted to prepare the astronauts.

2098
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,193
It's entirely possible that some of 
those simulations gotten passed off as 

2099
01:27:39,201 --> 01:27:41,660
being an actual video of them on the 
moon.

2100
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:42,560
Sure.
Yeah.

2101
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,580
FaIr enough.
Or the fake.

2102
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:45,500
The whole fucking thing.
I wasn't there,

2103
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:50,750
so pretty used to it as a privilege.
I think folkstyle wrestling is the next.

2104
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:52,970
That's the next genesis of mma,
right?

2105
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:54,080
We go,
what's next?

2106
01:27:54,490 --> 01:27:55,323
like that guy standing up.
People don't realize if you watched the 

2107
01:27:57,591 --> 01:27:58,510
lima roy fight,
it was,

2108
01:27:58,511 --> 01:28:01,310
it was incredibly frustrating to watch 
for me,

2109
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:02,563
uh,
because lima was literally just laying 

2110
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:06,620
on his back and guard,
you know,

2111
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:11,300
and guard is almost nonexistent 
effective in mma now.

2112
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:12,770
What?
Unless you're Brian Ortega.

2113
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,690
Okay.
There's a few guys,

2114
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,250
tiny amount,
but I think those.

2115
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,690
But those guys are like,
you,

2116
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:21,050
like your wrestling is so highly 
effective in mna.

2117
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,100
Some people could say you can't get by 
just with breslin.

2118
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:23,991
Well,
hey,

2119
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:26,450
I don't wrestle.
I'm a black belt in jujitsu.

2120
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:29,550
You use a lot of wrestling.
Yeah,

2121
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:30,620
primarily.
Yeah.

2122
01:28:30,621 --> 01:28:32,900
I mean It's not that Brian Ortega can 
box too.

2123
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:34,260
We could do a lot of other things.
Strike.

2124
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,450
I mean he's a good solid striker,
but his guard is so dangerous.

2125
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:42,140
It's just another level of dangerous as 
opposed to most mma fighters,

2126
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,640
including lehman.
yeah.

2127
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:44,660
And so,
uh,

2128
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:45,523
you know,
people actually going back to their 

2129
01:28:46,761 --> 01:28:47,451
base,
right?

2130
01:28:47,451 --> 01:28:48,910
Which has been,
it's been a no,

2131
01:28:48,911 --> 01:28:49,940
no forever.
And it may,

2132
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,860
you don't go back to your base because 
you expose your back.

2133
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:53,690
But then again,
you know,

2134
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:54,524
what percentage of guys who are sitting 
in guard actually get submissions from 

2135
01:28:56,901 --> 01:28:57,734
the garden.
Now the numbers really small really 

2136
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:02,190
well.
So you're going to have to find out now.

2137
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,020
Okay.
Like this is so,

2138
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:04,811
so frustrating.
So the,

2139
01:29:04,811 --> 01:29:06,120
in the,
in the lima fight,

2140
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:08,670
roy wins the first two rounds.
It's competitive,

2141
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:11,370
but he wins pretty clearly.
But the leg kicks her state.

2142
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:13,570
I'd never been kicked as hard by 
anyone's douglas lema.

2143
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:16,890
He kicked me one time in the leg.
I freaking it and walk right for a week.

2144
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,030
really?
oh my god.

2145
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:19,560
He kicks so hard.
He took so hard,

2146
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:22,620
so hard.
And so I'm third round.

2147
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:23,663
There's this accumulation of leg kicks 
and all of a sudden roy's leg is really 

2148
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:27,900
up from getting kicked a handful of 
times.

2149
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:29,550
Right.
And you to doing that low caffeine.

2150
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:30,530
Yes.
Will kick it.

2151
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:31,373
I'm kind of all over.
The roy royster are starting to do this 

2152
01:29:33,271 --> 01:29:34,104
one instead of checking it.
So lima starts taking control of the 

2153
01:29:37,801 --> 01:29:38,634
fight.
I think he wins the third run in my 

2154
01:29:39,601 --> 01:29:40,280
opinion.

2155
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,113
Fourth route in the beginning.
He like kicks him once and roy falls 

2156
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:46,290
down and he hops into mountain starts 
beating him up was like,

2157
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:47,124
holy crap,
this fight might be over and then so 

2158
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:50,760
recovers.
But then the fifth round,

2159
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,670
rory goes out and shoots like a single 
leg.

2160
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:55,260
Double leg,
like immediate.

2161
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:58,140
We're talking first 10 seconds.
Right?

2162
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:59,480
And going into that,
ryan,

2163
01:29:59,490 --> 01:30:01,590
you think shit,
he might get finished this round.

2164
01:30:01,591 --> 01:30:02,100
I mean,
he,

2165
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,700
he can barely walk,
look at his leg and so they make us take

2166
01:30:05,701 --> 01:30:06,534
it down 10 seconds into the round,
he literally stayed in guard for four 

2167
01:30:09,901 --> 01:30:11,640
minutes,
50 seconds and you're like,

2168
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:14,910
at some point is he going to try to get 
up because he has to get.

2169
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,130
If he gets up and he lands were two more
kicks it out,

2170
01:30:17,131 --> 01:30:18,780
getting taken down to fights.
Likely over.

2171
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:19,890
Wow.
You know.

2172
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:24,330
But he refuses to turn to his base 
because this is anti Jujitsu.

2173
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:25,164
You shouldn't turn to your base in 
jujitsu because you your budget and 

2174
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:27,713
choked.
Yeah.

2175
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,820
Fuck it joe.
At that point you're losing,

2176
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:31,110
right?
What else are you going to do?

2177
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,790
Well,
he never tried to sweep them.

2178
01:30:32,791 --> 01:30:35,040
He never did try to submit them off my 
back.

2179
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:37,260
Butterfly sweeping a couple of times.
But.

2180
01:30:37,261 --> 01:30:39,840
So at this point,
I mean even if I thought it was two,

2181
01:30:39,841 --> 01:30:40,680
two rounds,
two rounds,

2182
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:41,500
right,
right.

2183
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,333
It was in the fifth round.
You've got to try to get up at some 

2184
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:44,814
point.
So that was the one that did it for 

2185
01:30:45,871 --> 01:30:47,520
rory.
So he won.

2186
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:51,570
He won 49,
46 on two scorecards in 48,

2187
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:53,330
47 slash one.
So what?

2188
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:54,930
It was three to one.
So then even more,

2189
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,670
right?
Even more reason to get up,

2190
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:59,520
right if you're losing by that much,
um,

2191
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,110
but yet lima refused to get up.

2192
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:01,890
So at that point I'm thinking,
well,

2193
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:04,560
hey,
maybe lima thinks he won or something.

2194
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,140
I dunno.
But yeah,

2195
01:31:07,141 --> 01:31:10,980
so a lot of jujitsu people are 
struggling with this fact that in modern

2196
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:11,813
day mma you're going to have to try to 
get up because god is no longer that 

2197
01:31:15,421 --> 01:31:17,910
effective and you just get punched in 
the face over and over and over again.

2198
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:18,744
And that's terrible.
What are your feelings on going to half 

2199
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:23,890
guard and like going for an underwriter?
Same side and yeah,

2200
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:24,930
try it,
but it's not,

2201
01:31:24,931 --> 01:31:25,710
you know,
again,

2202
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:27,720
like as me as a,
as a top guy,

2203
01:31:27,721 --> 01:31:30,630
I would rather be in half guard than 
full guard.

2204
01:31:30,631 --> 01:31:32,430
I'm going to land a lot of damage from 
half guard.

2205
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:33,503
And then you're also,
if you're half guard here and me trying 

2206
01:31:34,741 --> 01:31:37,530
to work and you're tired and you're very
unlikely to sweep me.

2207
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:40,080
So I think half guard is better than 
full guard,

2208
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:41,303
but I think,
I think eventually where people are 

2209
01:31:42,811 --> 01:31:45,120
going to have to get to is they're going
to have to actually get up.

2210
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:45,983
You're gonna have to get up and putting 
your feet on someone's hips and kicking 

2211
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:51,900
them is no longer a great solution.
It works every once in a while,

2212
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:54,000
but it's not like you can do that every 
single time.

2213
01:31:54,001 --> 01:31:55,200
It just gets.
It's pretty rare.

2214
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:56,310
Pretty rare.
So he rarely.

2215
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:58,020
Everybody's so aware of it.
Yeah.

2216
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,040
So bottom bottom and top folk style 
wrestling

2217
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,490
I think is the next genesis and mma 
where people are really going to have to

2218
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:04,324
have a deep understanding because once 
you do get taken down or once you get a 

2219
01:32:07,631 --> 01:32:08,464
takedown,
um,

2220
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:09,221
and there's some,
you know,

2221
01:32:09,221 --> 01:32:12,850
yoel romero was the perfect example.
He never did folks wrestling in America,

2222
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:14,140
right?
He's a very,

2223
01:32:14,141 --> 01:32:14,974
very elite freestyle wrestler,
but he gets his takedowns and you can 

2224
01:32:17,701 --> 01:32:20,000
always stay on top for like 15 seconds.
Right.

2225
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:21,003
It's like you did all that work to get 
the guy on the ground and they use let 

2226
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:24,880
him back up.
Like what was the point?

2227
01:32:25,190 --> 01:32:26,530
Right?
What was the point of it?

2228
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:28,080
Well,
he's,

2229
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:28,913
he smashes some guys on the ground like 
machida when he got him down on the 

2230
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:32,890
ground and some of them you put them 
away.

2231
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:34,023
He's um,
he's a freak athlete too because it's 

2232
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:40,090
hard to say hey,
do what he does because like,

2233
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,080
no one's built.

2234
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,490
Like that guy.
That guy's the weird.

2235
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:44,440
He has the weirdest body I've ever seen.
Really?

2236
01:32:44,441 --> 01:32:45,274
Why?
Because he looks like he's 230 pounds 

2237
01:32:47,741 --> 01:32:51,370
and he weighs one 85 when he weighs in.
How the fuck is that one?

2238
01:32:51,371 --> 01:32:52,600
80 five.
I always look at him.

2239
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:53,770
I'm like,
I don't even understand it.

2240
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:55,690
Like where's the weight going?
And you would think he's.

2241
01:32:55,691 --> 01:32:57,400
Well as guys it's on pds but looking at 
him.

2242
01:32:57,401 --> 01:33:02,401
But then when you look at him like he 
won a world title and 98,

2243
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:04,270
99,
somewhere in there.

2244
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:07,800
He looks the same.
It was the same at age 18 or 19,

2245
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:10,253
you know,
it's incredible because then you think 

2246
01:33:11,570 --> 01:33:14,170
like,
well if he is a pdf that had to be prior

2247
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:15,004
to age 18 because he looks the same.
Well what are your thoughts on like 

2248
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:21,550
corella and cause you know the curlies 
yeah,

2249
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:24,100
but they used to call him d experiment.

2250
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,200
Yeah.
And his parents are tiny,

2251
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,580
you know those parents are like five,
five,

2252
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:28,443
five,
seven,

2253
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:32,380
and then he's six foot whatever the fuck
he is a guru of man.

2254
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:33,214
Yeah.
And I always wondered like one day in 

2255
01:33:35,921 --> 01:33:36,754
the future,
whether it's five years from now or 30 

2256
01:33:38,831 --> 01:33:39,664
years from now,
they're going to be genetically 

2257
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:42,820
manipulated people.
Crazy,

2258
01:33:42,821 --> 01:33:44,980
right.
We watched icarus.

2259
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:46,480
Sure.
Which is to,

2260
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:47,540
oh yeah,
you had.

2261
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,680
And that was fast thing and that pretty 
much just,

2262
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:51,663
I mean cemented the russian that 
anti-doping program or they run every 

2263
01:33:54,461 --> 01:33:55,294
single person,
state sponsored doping program for 

2264
01:33:57,041 --> 01:33:58,080
everybody,
for everybody,

2265
01:33:58,110 --> 01:33:59,770
for everybody.
Which crazy.

2266
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,590
And it's like you had the hint that they
were likely cheating,

2267
01:34:02,591 --> 01:34:04,660
you know,
but then as someone who competed against

2268
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:05,770
them,
man,

2269
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:09,040
that's a tough pill to swallow because 
they wouldn't make you feel.

2270
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,050
I mean,
now it's like,

2271
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:11,913
well shit,
I guess I should have been one way or 

2272
01:34:13,301 --> 01:34:14,134
the other,
but to know that you are a leg down and 

2273
01:34:16,121 --> 01:34:18,280
like going into mma now I haven't met.

2274
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,840
I do.
Everyone was cheating for sure.

2275
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:20,674
Right.
So I'm going to fight them whether 

2276
01:34:21,311 --> 01:34:22,990
they're cheating or not,
like to pride days.

2277
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,850
it was essentially sanction that was 
sanctioned.

2278
01:34:24,851 --> 01:34:26,170
Like tHey would tell them like,
hey,

2279
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:27,213
you know,
when this contract that says you can do 

2280
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:29,080
steroids,
right.

2281
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:31,110
How does one fc handle that?
Uh,

2282
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,920
so they don't,
they don't do drug testing yet.

2283
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:33,970
Well that's,
yeah,

2284
01:34:33,971 --> 01:34:37,150
I mean it should be fun.
I've been pushing them to do so,

2285
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,200
uh,
you know,

2286
01:34:38,201 --> 01:34:39,180
in my time there.
and,

2287
01:34:39,181 --> 01:34:40,600
and their,
their thing is that,

2288
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:42,910
um,
a lot of these countries,

2289
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:46,600
it's not prevalent in Indonesia or 
manila or wherever.

2290
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,310
So what else?
Just to find out,

2291
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:50,220
just get the fuck out of here with that.
That's my,

2292
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,060
that's not my,
that's not me saying that.

2293
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:55,250
That's there joe rogan saying that.
Get the fuck out of there,

2294
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:56,770
but I know you've sought,
you've,

2295
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:57,980
you've talked a couple of

2296
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:58,813
times.
I've heard you bought their way in 

2297
01:34:59,541 --> 01:35:00,374
program at one sts,
which I think is fantastic and I think 

2298
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:03,164
every,
every mma organization should do it at 

2299
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:07,610
the high level one.
Could you explain it?

2300
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:09,140
Yeah.
so it's really simple.

2301
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:11,900
You do hydration and you do wait on 
scale,

2302
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:13,790
same time.
So you can't cut water weight out.

2303
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:14,480
Right?
Right.

2304
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,350
So it depends,
hydrate,

2305
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:17,630
get on the scale.
Literally moments later,

2306
01:35:17,631 --> 01:35:18,950
like you go in the bathroom,
you piss,

2307
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,320
they test the specific gravity you go 
get on the scale.

2308
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:23,600
Right?
So essentially everyone moved up one way

2309
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:25,850
class.
Every one of their champions bumped up a

2310
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:26,684
weight class.
So like over there I fight one of the 

2311
01:35:27,951 --> 01:35:28,910
five,
but you know,

2312
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:30,020
it's essentially welter,
they,

2313
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:30,873
they even call it welterweight because 
it's the same thing because I can't cut 

2314
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:35,510
any waterway.
So they adjusted it.

2315
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,300
So they adjusted,
they moved every day.

2316
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:38,183
So I was the welterweight champion.
I was still the way to welterweight 

2317
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:40,471
champion,
they just move,

2318
01:35:40,471 --> 01:35:42,770
the weight class is different.
Um,

2319
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,240
so there's the day of the fight today 
before the fight for the fight.

2320
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:49,460
If you make the two days before the 
fight,

2321
01:35:49,461 --> 01:35:52,070
if you make both the weight and the 
hydration,

2322
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:54,840
you do not have to wait test or 
hydration test in the last eight years,

2323
01:35:54,841 --> 01:35:55,674
you're clear.
So if you make it both those days 

2324
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,273
because you're not going to be,
there's not going to fluctuate and 

2325
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:00,800
funding for hours.
And listen,

2326
01:36:00,801 --> 01:36:01,634
if you can figure out how to cheat that,
I can't figure out how someone could 

2327
01:36:03,511 --> 01:36:06,200
possibly cheat that test because now 
when they first incident I said,

2328
01:36:06,201 --> 01:36:07,910
well,
how is someone going to cheat on this?

2329
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:08,773
Or how could someone cheat?
You know what it's like they look at 

2330
01:36:11,121 --> 01:36:12,110
their watch,
your piss,

2331
01:36:12,230 --> 01:36:13,063
you know,
you can't have like a withdrawn or 

2332
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:14,713
anything.

2333
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:15,780
Uh,
so I don't,

2334
01:36:15,790 --> 01:36:17,750
I don't know how you achieve.
I don't think you can.

2335
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,400
I don't think you can.
I don't think you can.

2336
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:20,263
So yeah.
So it's fantastic because like fight 

2337
01:36:21,981 --> 01:36:25,610
week then instead of making this.
And so what I would fight at one 70,

2338
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,370
one 83 to one 85 to start my waterway,
cut out,

2339
01:36:28,371 --> 01:36:32,600
cut the waterway to one 70 or 71 
depending on pedal or non title.

2340
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:35,690
And then I would hydrate back up.
so now I don't have to do that.

2341
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:36,583
The dehydration process,
I'm literally the exact same size I was 

2342
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,120
prior.
And uh,

2343
01:36:41,121 --> 01:36:41,954
you know,
media obligations during week are 

2344
01:36:42,891 --> 01:36:43,724
obviously a lot easier because I'm not 
worried about cutting my weight or I'm 

2345
01:36:45,471 --> 01:36:47,740
not feeling miserable or whatever.
Um,

2346
01:36:48,170 --> 01:36:49,640
and it's a lot safer.
And then,

2347
01:36:49,641 --> 01:36:52,580
so if someone misses,
so,

2348
01:36:52,581 --> 01:36:53,414
mrs.
Obviously there find the same as in 

2349
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:54,650
America.

2350
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:57,440
If you miss what you're find,
if you miss hydration,

2351
01:36:57,870 --> 01:36:59,150
uh,
so say joe,

2352
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:01,070
you're wanting 85 and you weighed in 
when a five,

2353
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:04,100
but you're dehydrated,
you didn't really make it right.

2354
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,560
You have to get hydrated and make 
weight.

2355
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:08,150
So if you miss,
if you miss it,

2356
01:37:08,151 --> 01:37:09,500
so it's the last day you haven't made 
it.

2357
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,020
You have to keep drinking until you piss
hydrated.

2358
01:37:12,021 --> 01:37:14,440
And then whatever you way there is what 
you weigh.

2359
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:17,110
What's the parameters when it comes to 
hYdration?

2360
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,410
Not hydration.
It's the.

2361
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:21,470
It's the same skill they use for it.
So in America,

2362
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,780
at the beginning of the college 
wrestling season or high school,

2363
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:27,200
you have to do specific every test.
I believe I might mess up a zero,

2364
01:37:27,201 --> 01:37:28,490
but I think it's one point.
Zero,

2365
01:37:28,491 --> 01:37:29,700
two five.
Okay.

2366
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:32,050
Is this a specific group which I know is
the same they use for hydrated,

2367
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:35,780
not hydrated In wrestling in America to 
anything under that you're dehydrated.

2368
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:36,633
No,
you're good.

2369
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:38,340
So you want to be bullet.
So one point zero,

2370
01:37:38,341 --> 01:37:38,791
zero,
zero,

2371
01:37:38,791 --> 01:37:39,800
zero.
Zero is water.

2372
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:40,250
Oh,
okay.

2373
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:42,080
So you want to be close to that.
Right?

2374
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,890
And so There is like you do have to,
you have to drink some water,

2375
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:47,240
right?
If you drink a whole bunch of water,

2376
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:48,074
you piss it out perfectly hydrated.
But if there have been a couple of 

2377
01:37:51,431 --> 01:37:53,180
times.
So in the early days they did,

2378
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:55,830
they did tests.
This is the first two days actually just

2379
01:37:55,831 --> 01:37:58,710
testing to see where you were at.
The third day was the one that counted,

2380
01:37:58,711 --> 01:38:00,300
you know.
And so like if you,

2381
01:38:00,301 --> 01:38:01,134
if you ate a bunch of meat or something,
you might show up as dehydrated even 

2382
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:06,060
though that's what you walk around and 
every single day,

2383
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:07,950
so you have to make sure you drink a lot
of water.

2384
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:09,360
So it's coming out nice and clear.

2385
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:10,573
That's an interesting way of doing it.
And I think that's a great idea because 

2386
01:38:12,561 --> 01:38:16,220
I think that is one of the biggest 
problems in mma to uriah hall.

2387
01:38:16,221 --> 01:38:17,054
And vito belfort get canceled last week.
Uriah hall was like literally having 

2388
01:38:20,871 --> 01:38:22,760
seizures on his way to the way it's 
crazy.

2389
01:38:22,761 --> 01:38:24,440
Right?
It's fucking insane.

2390
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:25,693
And I think it's one of the worst parts 
of mma because I think mma shouldn't be 

2391
01:38:29,151 --> 01:38:34,151
about who's slickest in being able to 
deceive the weight system.

2392
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:38,630
I mean it should be your skill versus 
your opponent's skill.

2393
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:39,523
You're both the same.

2394
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,550
Well the whole,
the whole point of it is the whole point

2395
01:38:41,551 --> 01:38:42,570
of the way the fight.
Similar,

2396
01:38:42,571 --> 01:38:44,430
same size.
That's the whole point of it.

2397
01:38:44,431 --> 01:38:45,264
Yes.
and so why people would fight back 

2398
01:38:47,131 --> 01:38:50,340
against those system that one fc is 
using is beyond me because listen,

2399
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,410
the most miserable part of my weight 
cut.

2400
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,300
I'm fine dieting.
That's all good.

2401
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:56,670
right?
But when you got to cut that last 12,

2402
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:58,560
13,
14 pounds of water weight out,

2403
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,050
it's miserable.
Everybody knows is miserable.

2404
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:03,000
Right?
And it affects your performance the next

2405
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,511
day.
Yeah,

2406
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:04,250
I mean,
so my,

2407
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,540
my thought process with affects them 
more than it affects me.

2408
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,190
Maybe that's just me being positive 
about it.

2409
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:09,780
Right.
why is that?

2410
01:39:09,781 --> 01:39:14,760
Because if you're a wrestling and pussy 
and I'm not right or maybe it's just me,

2411
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:15,773
my me psyching myself up.
So my thought process on everythIng is 

2412
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,960
anything that goes wrong will affect my 
opponent more than it'll affect me.

2413
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:24,180
Oh that's good.
But I am more stable.

2414
01:39:24,181 --> 01:39:27,960
I can deal with shit that goes wrong.
Most people affects them.

2415
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:29,790
And so maybe that's just me telling 
myself that,

2416
01:39:29,791 --> 01:39:31,110
but that makes me feel good about it.

2417
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:32,443
People feel that way about wakening the 
lightweight cutting because they think 

2418
01:39:34,311 --> 01:39:36,410
that the other guy is not gonna be able 
to handle it as well.

2419
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:39,360
Make them go through some adversity and 
then the next day he's gonna

2420
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:40,251
troubled.
Sure,

2421
01:39:40,251 --> 01:39:41,084
exactly.
So,

2422
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,680
but I think if you take that process 
away,

2423
01:39:42,681 --> 01:39:44,780
I think it makes media obligations a lot
easier.

2424
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:48,140
It makes people a lot healthier and 
yeah,

2425
01:39:48,141 --> 01:39:50,510
I mean how many fights have,
just from a business standpoint,

2426
01:39:50,511 --> 01:39:52,910
how many fights have we had canceled 
this year because of the weight thing.

2427
01:39:52,911 --> 01:39:55,010
I mean quite a few.

2428
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:57,290
Did it change your performance?
How physically?

2429
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:58,150
How do you,
how would you feel?

2430
01:39:58,590 --> 01:39:59,610
I think I felt,
you know,

2431
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:00,453
honestly for me,
I know they said those studies that you 

2432
01:40:01,771 --> 01:40:02,604
don't really fully hydrated.
I believe it was 36 to 48 hours after 

2433
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:07,050
man.
I've always felt fine.

2434
01:40:07,051 --> 01:40:08,080
And so I,
I,

2435
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:11,970
so when I graduated college,
the way class in the United States for,

2436
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:12,943
for the olympic stuff was one 63.
I would weigh roughly one slash 75 on a 

2437
01:40:16,621 --> 01:40:19,440
day to day basis.
And then water cut down to one 63.

2438
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:22,110
Um,
and then when I was fighting in one 70,

2439
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:23,920
I will be say between one eight,
three,

2440
01:40:23,921 --> 01:40:28,590
one 85 and water cut down to one 70.
So my water weight cut was very,

2441
01:40:28,591 --> 01:40:32,490
very similar every single time.
And I was disciplined in that manner.

2442
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:34,200
I want,
I didn't want to be fluctuating.

2443
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:35,034
And so my goal is actually to get down 
to my target weight six weeks prior to 

2444
01:40:38,941 --> 01:40:40,380
competition,
right?

2445
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,030
So I'm walking around one a three,
two,

2446
01:40:42,031 --> 01:40:42,580
one,
one five,

2447
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,413
six weeks prior.
So I'm on the same exact person every 

2448
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:46,433
sIngle day.
Whereas I think the part that a lot of 

2449
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:49,950
these people f up and it's because 
they're not disciplined enough,

2450
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,620
is they try to descend while they're 
training,

2451
01:40:52,621 --> 01:40:53,990
right.
You know,

2452
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:56,950
maybe I get up to one 95,
which is a small bump.

2453
01:40:56,951 --> 01:40:58,480
Some of these guys are really 
undisciplined.

2454
01:40:58,481 --> 01:41:00,010
They get way,
way,

2455
01:41:00,011 --> 01:41:00,910
way,
way overweight,

2456
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:01,744
right?
And so during that last six weeks or 

2457
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:06,280
even the last couple of weeks,
they're trying to bring that body weight

2458
01:41:06,281 --> 01:41:06,821
down.
Right?

2459
01:41:06,821 --> 01:41:08,380
And so in my mind,
there's two ways to lose weight.

2460
01:41:08,381 --> 01:41:11,470
You can diet and lose body weight,
fat mass,

2461
01:41:11,471 --> 01:41:12,740
whatever.
Um,

2462
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:15,760
and then there's the waterweight where 
we're sweating and we're taking that out

2463
01:41:15,761 --> 01:41:16,301
of us.
Right?

2464
01:41:16,301 --> 01:41:19,660
Those are the two ways.
And so I think a lot of guys and I,

2465
01:41:19,661 --> 01:41:20,494
you know,
I don't know if you've ever cut wait 

2466
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:21,784
show,
but I know so for me it was in college 

2467
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:26,530
and in the summers I'd get really fat 
and then I'd bring my weight down in the

2468
01:41:26,531 --> 01:41:27,364
fall and you feel it when you're not,
when you're losing more calories than 

2469
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:30,274
you're taking in,
it's like this weird feeling in your 

2470
01:41:31,301 --> 01:41:32,770
body and you feel like shit all the 
time.

2471
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:34,473
And so I think a lot of fighters are 
doing that really close to when they're 

2472
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:39,723
fighting.
And so now the waterway cut makes you 

2473
01:41:41,351 --> 01:41:43,360
feel terrible and now they're cutting 
everything out.

2474
01:41:43,361 --> 01:41:46,180
Calorically alSo.
So that's like a double whammy.

2475
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:47,193
That's what I think about it.
There's another thing that benefits 

2476
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:50,404
wrestlers in the wrestlers seem to take 
pride in being able to push through 

2477
01:41:54,161 --> 01:41:57,190
discomfort.
And the more miserable you are,

2478
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:00,460
the more you just fucking bite down your
mouthpiece and deal with it.

2479
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:01,593
We're [inaudible] you get used to doing 
that all through camps all through 

2480
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,090
college and high school.
you're always dehydrated.

2481
01:42:07,091 --> 01:42:08,590
You're always losing weight.
Well,

2482
01:42:08,591 --> 01:42:10,600
I mean the college dressing that is not 
that.

2483
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:11,463
The way cutting is not that bad anymore.
So they have the system and people are 

2484
01:42:13,391 --> 01:42:14,224
starting to change a 97.
I think couple people died and change 

2485
01:42:18,761 --> 01:42:19,650
it,
but you know,

2486
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:21,490
then they institute the same thing as 
one fc.

2487
01:42:21,490 --> 01:42:22,323
That's sort of a portion.
So it's once you do it in the being a 

2488
01:42:24,051 --> 01:42:25,360
season,
find your minimum weight.

2489
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,930
But I think more than anything what 
people are,

2490
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:28,330
it's,
it's a one ron.

2491
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:30,850
So you.
So if you're dual meet is at 1:00,

2492
01:42:30,851 --> 01:42:32,290
everybody weighs in at noon,
right?

2493
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:35,070
So what people have found out,
you can't cut.

2494
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:35,980
Wait,
you can't go wait.

2495
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:38,710
You wrestled like shit.
So the problem with fighting,

2496
01:42:38,711 --> 01:42:40,530
doing that though,
his brain injuries.

2497
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:42,130
Yeah.
So that's I think once you'd best.

2498
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,770
But in college wrestling you're talking 
about the discomfort thing.

2499
01:42:44,771 --> 01:42:45,604
Part of that is that,
you know when you go to a college 

2500
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:48,610
wrestling program,
again,

2501
01:42:48,611 --> 01:42:50,140
it's very structured.
You can't skip,

2502
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:53,020
you have to be there every single day,
right on time.

2503
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,410
And then it's like you have 40 black 
belt,

2504
01:42:56,411 --> 01:42:57,520
right jujitsu,
black belts,

2505
01:42:57,670 --> 01:42:58,503
and not even just black belts like world
class 19 to 23 in their physical prime 

2506
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:04,780
ready to fight each other every single 
day.

2507
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:05,913
And so you get used to this grind 
dealing with people battling people 

2508
01:43:08,621 --> 01:43:11,270
discomfort every single day.
Um,

2509
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:12,303
you know,
and a lot of it's also dealing with 

2510
01:43:13,241 --> 01:43:14,074
injuries like,
you know,

2511
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:14,913
in charleston and talks about it a lot 
that hey and I was talking to my kids 

2512
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:18,094
was listening to national tournament for
the nca is March 15th through 17th and 

2513
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:24,190
you cannot guarantee me you're going to 
be totally healthy on that date.

2514
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:27,490
You cannot guarantee meet your and be a 
not sick on that date.

2515
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,160
You're going to have to compete March 
15th through March 17th no matter what,

2516
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:30,994
if you want to enroll a national title.
And so wrestlers get used to this grind 

2517
01:43:34,481 --> 01:43:37,870
where you just don't see that in other 
sports.

2518
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:41,800
Yeah.
I think that that aspect of wrestling is

2519
01:43:41,801 --> 01:43:44,560
one of the biggest tools that they take 
into the octagon.

2520
01:43:44,561 --> 01:43:47,140
The mental toughness and that ability 
to.

2521
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:49,540
I mean the grind,
it's again,

2522
01:43:49,650 --> 01:43:52,340
it's,
it's a badge of in wrestling

2523
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:56,350
to be able to handle the grind.
It's not really in kickboxing or in moy,

2524
01:43:56,351 --> 01:43:57,680
tai or any other sport.

2525
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:58,930
Well,
they're not really forced to.

2526
01:43:58,931 --> 01:43:59,764
I mean how many,
how many kickboxing or or jujitsu 

2527
01:44:02,321 --> 01:44:03,011
schools,
cuny name,

2528
01:44:03,011 --> 01:44:05,160
where there's literally 40 black belts.
I mean it's,

2529
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,030
it's been borne out through high school 
wrestling.

2530
01:44:07,031 --> 01:44:08,190
You go to all these national 
tournaments,

2531
01:44:08,191 --> 01:44:10,180
estate terms,
you find out who the best are,

2532
01:44:10,181 --> 01:44:11,014
the best of the best,
get recruited and they go to these 

2533
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:16,270
institutions to train with the other 
best of the best of the best,

2534
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:17,770
you know,
and then,

2535
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,120
and then in addition to that,
the other,

2536
01:44:19,121 --> 01:44:19,954
the post-collegiate guys who were trying
to make the world teams and olympic 

2537
01:44:22,481 --> 01:44:23,680
teams,
they're sticking around training.

2538
01:44:23,681 --> 01:44:27,310
So you have this melting pot of freaking
really great wrestlers.

2539
01:44:27,311 --> 01:44:28,144
They're trading with each other every 
single day for five to plus five years 

2540
01:44:31,751 --> 01:44:33,730
if you're going to world championships,
right?

2541
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:34,723
Yeah.
There also seems to be like a much more 

2542
01:44:36,471 --> 01:44:40,220
systematic approach to training people 
and a lot more drilling,

2543
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:42,540
you knoW,
and a lot of jujitsu schools like gosh,

2544
01:44:42,630 --> 01:44:45,710
the arm bar from the guard here.
We hooked the arm.

2545
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:47,270
Okay.
I go onto here,

2546
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:48,680
my legs,
I make my leg,

2547
01:44:48,681 --> 01:44:49,790
I lift up.
Okay.

2548
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:51,380
Your practice,
everybody get together.

2549
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:53,960
It drives me insane.
It drives a few times.

2550
01:44:54,420 --> 01:44:55,253
Like I'll go to jujitsu classes 
sometimes and they'll literally go over 

2551
01:44:57,591 --> 01:44:58,424
to techniques.
You drill it twice and then the last 

2552
01:45:00,410 --> 01:45:02,540
rest of the class is just people 
rolling.

2553
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,860
Five minutes,
five,

2554
01:45:03,861 --> 01:45:04,694
five minute goes.
It drives me insane gel because I come 

2555
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:09,680
from this wrestling background and then 
I also like sports.

2556
01:45:09,681 --> 01:45:10,250
Psych and

2557
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:13,220
study of high performance is like that's
what I love.

2558
01:45:13,470 --> 01:45:14,303
I love.
I love studying people who are the best 

2559
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:19,670
in their field at whatever they do and 
we know without a shadow of a doubt,

2560
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:20,533
just saying go for five minutes is not 
the most effective way to train someone 

2561
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:24,260
does not happen.
So the wrestling,

2562
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:25,820
there's a whole bUnch of different you 
could do.

2563
01:45:25,821 --> 01:45:28,580
Some days you might do matches,
some days you might do a 30 minute ago,

2564
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:30,350
some days you might do groups of three 
women.

2565
01:45:30,351 --> 01:45:32,570
That goes,
some days you might do situations.

2566
01:45:32,571 --> 01:45:34,400
I start on the single leg,
I started the high crotch,

2567
01:45:34,401 --> 01:45:35,270
I a friend doc,
right?

2568
01:45:35,271 --> 01:45:38,330
And so there's all these different 
scenarios that we might try.

2569
01:45:38,331 --> 01:45:39,164
I mean,
if I'm coaching my academy right and 

2570
01:45:40,671 --> 01:45:41,504
we're working on,
we drove front headlocks or we call 

2571
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,410
methods position,
we've got both armpits and bounce and go

2572
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:46,790
for that.

2573
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:48,640
We don't just say,
okay,

2574
01:45:48,641 --> 01:45:50,230
now go five minute goes because how 
many,

2575
01:45:50,231 --> 01:45:51,064
how many tribes are they going to get it
going into the maths position that are 

2576
01:45:52,721 --> 01:45:54,310
the front headlock,
maybe one,

2577
01:45:54,311 --> 01:45:55,144
maybe two,
but essentially most people have used 

2578
01:45:56,731 --> 01:45:58,150
say go for five minutes.
They,

2579
01:45:58,151 --> 01:45:58,984
they,
they're not disciplined enough to make 

2580
01:45:59,771 --> 01:46:02,870
themselves do new skills.
They revert to whatever they do best and

2581
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:04,480
then just do it over and over and over 
and over again.

2582
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:05,343
Right?
And so if I want a kid to be good at a 

2583
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:08,213
headlock,
which if you'Re going to wrestle at a 

2584
01:46:09,161 --> 01:46:10,780
high level,
you need a good for headlock,

2585
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:12,700
period factual,
you have to have it.

2586
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:15,910
I'm going to put him in there 50 times 
in that practice.

2587
01:46:16,330 --> 01:46:17,163
He's going to get it over and over and 
over and over and maybe the next day 

2588
01:46:19,271 --> 01:46:22,000
it's single legs and the maybe next day 
it's double legs,

2589
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:23,920
right?
And then maybe some days you say,

2590
01:46:23,921 --> 01:46:24,880
hey,
go for 10 minutes,

2591
01:46:24,881 --> 01:46:25,880
go wrestle,
right?

2592
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,060
Because you want to change it little 
bit,

2593
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:28,713
but saying go for five minutes.
Every single day is very much not the 

2594
01:46:31,811 --> 01:46:32,644
most effective way to do it.
And it's so insanely frustrating for me 

2595
01:46:35,561 --> 01:46:36,394
to have that haPpen.
and almost every jujitsu school on the 

2596
01:46:38,741 --> 01:46:39,574
planet

2597
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:42,140
bravo's talked about this a lot and one 
of the things that he says that,

2598
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:44,680
I'm jujitsu,
so fun to roll,

2599
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:46,660
that people just want to get to the 
rolling part real quick.

2600
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:48,670
I don't care what they want.
He could like,

2601
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:50,250
I don't freaking care,
joel.

2602
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:52,740
I want to.
And my kids tell me all kinds of stuff.

2603
01:46:52,741 --> 01:46:53,430
I said,
I,

2604
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:56,160
I'm running practice,
I went to the olympics,

2605
01:46:56,161 --> 01:46:56,994
I want to have trophies.
You're at my school because you want to 

2606
01:46:59,191 --> 01:47:01,110
learn how to be the best diamond house 
to be the best.

2607
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:02,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

2608
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:04,410
I don't care what yoU like.
I don't care what you like.

2609
01:47:04,570 --> 01:47:05,970
Some days,
every once In a while.

2610
01:47:05,971 --> 01:47:06,870
Hey,
you guys don't play games.

2611
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:09,720
Let's play games every once in awhile 
just to keep it fun.

2612
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:10,860
Just to keep it fun.
Right?

2613
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:11,551
Hey,
you want to do this?

2614
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:13,140
Let's do that every,
every once in a while.

2615
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:15,000
Okay.
I'll indulge you.

2616
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:18,210
But most of the time your here and so,
you know,

2617
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:19,130
we don't.
For our,

2618
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:20,003
for our young,
we don't really push our young kids too 

2619
01:47:21,271 --> 01:47:21,871
hard,
but like,

2620
01:47:21,871 --> 01:47:23,610
especially when we're talking about high
school guys,

2621
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,070
you're telling me you want to be a state
champion,

2622
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:27,150
you're telling me you wanna go to 
college,

2623
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:29,110
you're telling me all these things you 
wanted to.

2624
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:31,380
I know what it takes to get there.
I've been there myselF,

2625
01:47:31,381 --> 01:47:35,040
I've seen many other people achieve 
those things and so you know,

2626
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:35,880
and there's a lot of,
you know,

2627
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:38,010
it's really funny because people choose 
to in this,

2628
01:47:38,011 --> 01:47:40,800
even though mma we can go live,
people choose what they value.

2629
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:42,160
Right?
And I'll juSt give you a simple example.

2630
01:47:42,161 --> 01:47:42,994
I'll get this.
I got this one kid who's probably 

2631
01:47:43,651 --> 01:47:45,210
listening to this show right now because
I know he loves you.

2632
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:47,390
Uh,
what's his name is.

2633
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,380
ah,
well I can't give one of my kids a shout

2634
01:47:49,381 --> 01:47:51,120
out and that all of them,
so okay.

2635
01:47:51,121 --> 01:47:53,640
But he's probably,
he's gonna know who I'm talking about.

2636
01:47:54,430 --> 01:47:57,390
He goes freaking hard.
Just boom,

2637
01:47:57,391 --> 01:47:58,320
grind,
grind,

2638
01:47:58,321 --> 01:47:59,610
grind.
Just I couldn't eat.

2639
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:01,500
I couldn't ask for a kid to work harder 
joe.

2640
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,053
But when I started teaching technique,
he tunes me out and then we go to a 

2641
01:48:05,971 --> 01:48:07,770
national tournament and he places but he
gets,

2642
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:10,560
he gets scored on a whole bunch by the 
technique.

2643
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,020
We were just drilling and then I say,
hey bud,

2644
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:14,393
you just tune me out.
The last three weeks we were just 

2645
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:17,760
drilling that thing and you got your ass
kicked by it.

2646
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:20,730
And so I love the fact that you want to 
go hard,

2647
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:23,670
but you need to also value the 
technique,

2648
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:24,210
right?
Yeah.

2649
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:26,710
And then there's some people who valued 
the technique too much and they all do.

2650
01:48:26,711 --> 01:48:28,650
I do the technique and then when it 
comes to going hard,

2651
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:30,210
they don't go hard enough.
Right?

2652
01:48:30,211 --> 01:48:33,510
Because in wrestling or in any,
in any venture you want to take in life,

2653
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:35,370
there's not just one way to be 
successful.

2654
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:39,660
You need a bunch of different attributes
to be successful and so if you overvalue

2655
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:43,440
one or another and you devalue other 
things,

2656
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,420
you're not going to be as successful as 
you could.

2657
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:46,293
You might still be successful,
but you're not going to reach the 

2658
01:48:47,941 --> 01:48:50,370
pinnacle because you're not putting 
yourself into the right situation.

2659
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:51,463
It's funny because in a lot of ways it's
like what you were talking about 

2660
01:48:53,061 --> 01:48:53,894
earlier,
the two sides of the coin of a fighter 

2661
01:48:55,401 --> 01:48:56,234
being a wild person who doesn't care,
the cowboy and then the other guy who's 

2662
01:49:00,051 --> 01:49:02,840
like super systematic,
everything's controlled.

2663
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:04,003
Yeah.
You almost have to have everything and 

2664
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:05,893
the fighters that have those really 
strong attributes just have to be aware 

2665
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:12,470
that those attributes are strengthened 
even further by technique.

2666
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,990
Yeah,
a hundred percent.

2667
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:16,240
And again,
it's both sides that quantum,

2668
01:49:16,241 --> 01:49:17,700
he and another one would be,
uh,

2669
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,080
you know,
suddenly called beginner's mind and then

2670
01:49:20,081 --> 01:49:21,450
know it all right.
When you come into,

2671
01:49:21,490 --> 01:49:23,860
when you come into practice,
you need to have a beginner's mind.

2672
01:49:23,861 --> 01:49:24,694
I mean,
I got to work out with three or four 

2673
01:49:26,411 --> 01:49:27,244
time world champion olympic champion 
pearl's last week and he was asking me 

2674
01:49:29,501 --> 01:49:30,334
questions.
It's like this guy really cared about 

2675
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:35,560
learning from every possible source and 
he's already,

2676
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:38,020
he's already at the pinnacle and still 
trying to learn.

2677
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:38,933
Interesting thing to dominick cruz said 
during the broadcast about steep meo 

2678
01:49:42,031 --> 01:49:44,190
chick that steep when he went to 
alliance,

2679
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:45,690
mma was asking everybody,

2680
01:49:45,970 --> 01:49:46,910
you have to.
Yeah.

2681
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:51,400
But then when you go into a competition,
you can't have the same mindset thinking

2682
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,960
I don't know,
I need to ask.

2683
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:55,240
Right?
And so like kids who,

2684
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,600
kids who have just the beginner's mind,
theY'll,

2685
01:49:57,650 --> 01:49:58,910
they're great in practice,
but then they go into

2686
01:49:59,210 --> 01:50:00,230
like cultural,
which I do here,

2687
01:50:00,231 --> 01:50:01,210
what should I do?
Which I do.

2688
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:02,990
It's like,
let's just go wrestle,

2689
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:04,243
wrestle.
But then kids Are coming to practice 

2690
01:50:06,111 --> 01:50:07,430
like I know it.
All right,

2691
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:09,700
well that's a very unhealthy mindset 
also because you.

2692
01:50:09,701 --> 01:50:11,750
And it's great when you compete.
It's great when you compete.

2693
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,180
So you got it.
You got to balance both those things,

2694
01:50:14,181 --> 01:50:15,014
right?
Like you can't have just one because if 

2695
01:50:16,461 --> 01:50:17,271
you're,
I know it all.

2696
01:50:17,271 --> 01:50:19,310
I'm a bad ass.
That's great for competition.

2697
01:50:19,311 --> 01:50:21,770
But you come into practice,
you're going to stop.

2698
01:50:21,771 --> 01:50:25,310
You're learning right now when you're 
coaching kids,

2699
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:27,320
how much time,
if any,

2700
01:50:27,321 --> 01:50:29,000
do you spend on mindset?

2701
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:30,483
Um,
and so at every I added my facebook 

2702
01:50:32,231 --> 01:50:34,560
every monday I do this mental monday and
then I usually repeat,

2703
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:38,080
repeat it or something fairly similar to
the kids at practice.

2704
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:40,570
but I also think it's a lot,
you know,

2705
01:50:40,571 --> 01:50:42,970
I think competition is where you get 
your really,

2706
01:50:42,971 --> 01:50:46,480
really good teachable moments because 
that's when kids care the most.

2707
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:48,610
And so,
like the kid I was talking about when he

2708
01:50:48,611 --> 01:50:51,150
loses it,
because he didn't want to listen to me,

2709
01:50:51,151 --> 01:50:51,471
I,
because say,

2710
01:50:51,471 --> 01:50:51,921
well,
look it,

2711
01:50:51,921 --> 01:50:53,650
look at this.
This is a great example.

2712
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:55,223
I did this,
I do private lessons with this fourth 

2713
01:50:56,591 --> 01:50:58,420
and fifth grader.
They're brothers and uh,

2714
01:50:59,170 --> 01:51:01,510
and like five weeks in rome,
you're doing this wrong.

2715
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:03,280
You're doing this wrong,
you're doing this wrong,

2716
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:05,320
you're doing this wrong.
They don't want to listen,

2717
01:51:05,321 --> 01:51:06,370
right?
Then they do it.

2718
01:51:06,371 --> 01:51:09,130
They have a match.
Last week they do it wrong and it didn't

2719
01:51:09,131 --> 01:51:11,080
cost them the match,
but it almost costs in the match.

2720
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,233
And,
and now I can say every single time I 

2721
01:51:13,271 --> 01:51:14,320
say you're doing this wrong,
or I can say,

2722
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:16,840
remember that time in that match when 
you putting your back because you did it

2723
01:51:16,841 --> 01:51:20,440
wrong and you refuse to listen to me.
So I think that,

2724
01:51:20,490 --> 01:51:22,630
uh,
matches create great teachable moments.

2725
01:51:22,631 --> 01:51:23,464
You know,
like,

2726
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,333
hey,
you remember when you wilted under the 

2727
01:51:25,121 --> 01:51:26,620
pressure because you weren't tough 
enough,

2728
01:51:26,650 --> 01:51:28,090
will you need to practice a little 
harder?

2729
01:51:28,091 --> 01:51:28,924
So you get used to that pressure.
Remember when the referee made a bad 

2730
01:51:32,171 --> 01:51:35,860
call and you flipped out because he made
a bad call and they didn't think about,

2731
01:51:35,861 --> 01:51:37,510
well,
I still have to wrestle addresses match,

2732
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:39,410
right?
So there could be all these,

2733
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:40,323
there's all these teachable moments 
within competition where you can say 

2734
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,500
point to something very clearly and say,
well,

2735
01:51:44,501 --> 01:51:48,160
look at this and see how this affected 
you and see how you would have been more

2736
01:51:48,161 --> 01:51:48,850
successful.

2737
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:51,850
So I think for mental aspect it comes a 
lot more on one,

2738
01:51:51,851 --> 01:51:54,490
on one basis and sometimes I'll use it 
in front of the whole team.

2739
01:51:54,491 --> 01:51:57,190
I don't,
I don't like really picking on people,

2740
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,091
uh,
every,

2741
01:51:58,091 --> 01:51:59,980
once in awhile I will.
Um,

2742
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:01,173
but so I think that,
I think there's competition provides a 

2743
01:52:02,711 --> 01:52:04,750
lot of teachable moments for athletes to
see,

2744
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:06,520
well,
am I stronger here?

2745
01:52:06,521 --> 01:52:07,990
What do I need to work on?
Because again,

2746
01:52:07,991 --> 01:52:11,010
we can't,
you can't say one mental aspect makes it

2747
01:52:11,011 --> 01:52:13,570
guy successful.
It's this conglomeration of many,

2748
01:52:13,571 --> 01:52:15,610
many,
many mental aspects that will make

2749
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:17,740
highly successful.
Now when you're coaching,

2750
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:21,220
whether it's coaching wrestlers or mma 
fighter coach anymore,

2751
01:52:21,310 --> 01:52:22,210
none.
Zero.

2752
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:23,021
I have.
Okay.

2753
01:52:23,021 --> 01:52:23,854
I helped a couple of buddies,
but I don't consider it really just 

2754
01:52:26,951 --> 01:52:28,090
helps you.
When you say,

2755
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:29,970
just say when you're coaching,
do you,

2756
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:33,360
do you concentrate it all on strength 
and conditioning or,

2757
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:37,030
or is it from the wrestling that you get
most of your strength conditioning?

2758
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:39,480
So we only got them,
you know,

2759
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,620
an hour and a half,
three or four times a week.

2760
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:44,050
And so we don't do lasting conditioning.
I know I,

2761
01:52:44,051 --> 01:52:44,884
I right.
Especially with the older guard that 

2762
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,100
recommend they do some

2763
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,550
on their own,
um,

2764
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,070
you know,
for a college program,

2765
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:52,520
for high school program where we're 
getting them monday through saturday,

2766
01:52:52,610 --> 01:52:55,100
maybe twice a day possibly.
Obviously we're going to do that,

2767
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:56,210
but you know,
we're an academy,

2768
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:57,500
uh,
you know,

2769
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,630
we're kind of on our own.
We give them three or four times a week,

2770
01:52:59,631 --> 01:53:03,680
so it just doesn't trump what we need to
do in that short time window.

2771
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:05,043
How do you balance it out though?
Like how do you know how much strength 

2772
01:53:07,361 --> 01:53:10,090
and conditioning to do versus how much 
technique and skill work?

2773
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:12,150
I mean at the college level?
Are we talking about our.

2774
01:53:12,210 --> 01:53:14,670
Because we do not,
we do know strength and conditioning and

2775
01:53:14,671 --> 01:53:16,170
I recommend kids.
You're on the road and you know,

2776
01:53:16,171 --> 01:53:19,350
and if I had 12 hours a week with them,
I would do that.

2777
01:53:19,351 --> 01:53:19,981
But we,
you know,

2778
01:53:19,981 --> 01:53:21,510
we don't,
we don't have the ability to,

2779
01:53:21,810 --> 01:53:23,970
um,
I mean I think,

2780
01:53:23,971 --> 01:53:25,950
I think it's important.
I think it's really important.

2781
01:53:25,951 --> 01:53:28,920
I don't think it truly is that I don't 
think it trumps especially knowledge.

2782
01:53:29,010 --> 01:53:32,110
And then if kids wrestle really hard 
against each other and kill had that one

2783
01:53:32,111 --> 01:53:34,350
saying like wrestling is the best train,
the condition,

2784
01:53:34,351 --> 01:53:35,790
I can't remember.
He said something.

2785
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,770
If you wrestle really hard against each 
other,

2786
01:53:37,771 --> 01:53:39,390
you're going to develop those things.
It's like,

2787
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:42,480
I think like people when when I grabbed 
people are squeezed,

2788
01:53:42,481 --> 01:53:43,470
people that are like,
oh my god,

2789
01:53:43,471 --> 01:53:44,550
I've never felt anything like it.

2790
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:46,710
And I think that comes from that doesn't
come.

2791
01:53:46,770 --> 01:53:49,230
If you put me in a weight room,
I can do nothing abnormal.

2792
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:51,180
I'm not abnormally strong in any 
exercise.

2793
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,430
I'm actually like on a college division 
and coliseum.

2794
01:53:53,490 --> 01:53:55,950
I'm significantly less strong than most 
people.

2795
01:53:56,340 --> 01:53:57,173
Right.
But then when they arrested me and 

2796
01:53:57,661 --> 01:53:58,321
they're like,
holy shit,

2797
01:53:58,321 --> 01:53:59,154
I never felt anything like that.
And I think it's because a lot of those 

2798
01:54:02,401 --> 01:54:04,140
things that I do are very,
very,

2799
01:54:04,141 --> 01:54:04,974
very wrestling specific and I developed 
that strength because when I grabbed 

2800
01:54:08,440 --> 01:54:10,410
like freaking grab as hard as I can,
when I squeeze them,

2801
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:13,140
I squeeze him as hard as I can.
And so now from doing that,

2802
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:16,020
thousands of times I've developed that 
squeezer that strength.

2803
01:54:16,410 --> 01:54:17,243
Um,
and so I think strength condition is 

2804
01:54:18,431 --> 01:54:19,264
important,
but I don't think it trumps doing other 

2805
01:54:20,491 --> 01:54:21,324
stuff.
And if I had all the time in the world 

2806
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:24,660
and these kids didn't have to go to high
school or middle school,

2807
01:54:24,661 --> 01:54:25,950
I'd probably put them through some.
But,

2808
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:27,360
you know,
we don't have that luxury.

2809
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:29,650
What did you do when you were finding an
mma?

2810
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,630
How much did you devote to strength to 
get this thing

2811
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:34,730
twice a week?
Kish and maybe three sometimes.

2812
01:54:34,731 --> 01:54:35,564
What kind of stuff?
So I had a personal trainer since I 

2813
01:54:37,311 --> 01:54:38,540
moved to milwaukee.
I actually.

2814
01:54:38,541 --> 01:54:40,640
And then I actually helped them open up 
a crossfit gym.

2815
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:42,373
Um,
and it wouldn't be not specifically 

2816
01:54:45,561 --> 01:54:48,170
crossfit workouts,
but kind of that type of work.

2817
01:54:48,171 --> 01:54:51,080
Nothing slow when I'm doing three sets 
of 10 and two sets,

2818
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:51,840
eight,
you know,

2819
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:54,740
nothing slow like that potentially,
you know,

2820
01:54:54,770 --> 01:54:55,970
one,
one or two days.

2821
01:54:55,971 --> 01:54:57,920
We might do like a slower start and 
then.

2822
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:59,113
But you know,
I think fighting you need to be very 

2823
01:55:00,681 --> 01:55:01,730
highly active.
You know,

2824
01:55:01,731 --> 01:55:04,520
you need to be in really good shape and 
move a lot of things really fast.

2825
01:55:04,521 --> 01:55:08,180
So kinda cross it type stuff I think is 
probably the right direction to go.

2826
01:55:08,181 --> 01:55:11,030
And now when I go back to college 
programs besides light,

2827
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:11,893
the heavyweights that in season stuff 
for college programs is mostly higher 

2828
01:55:15,741 --> 01:55:20,600
paced stuff which I think is very 
relevant to both wrestling and fighting.

2829
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:23,670
So did you do,
when you were saying like you were doing

2830
01:55:23,671 --> 01:55:24,504
like crossfit style workouts,
so are you doing like kettle bells box 

2831
01:55:27,601 --> 01:55:28,950
jumps?
Like everything?

2832
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:31,110
Just so when I said that I just meant 
that,

2833
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:32,143
you know,
we are moving at a high pace through a 

2834
01:55:33,271 --> 01:55:34,380
lot of stuff,
you know?

2835
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:35,730
And it would be like,
he would tell me,

2836
01:55:35,731 --> 01:55:36,510
hey diego,
do some.

2837
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:37,590
No.
Do sled pushes,

2838
01:55:37,591 --> 01:55:38,340
do this,
do that,

2839
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:39,173
do that.
But what about like your diet and 

2840
01:55:40,921 --> 01:55:44,130
nutrition and supplements and things?
Those sites have never

2841
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:47,960
been a that much into nutrition.
I,

2842
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:49,290
I sold it.
I don't.

2843
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:51,360
Okay.
I was fat when I was a little kid.

2844
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:52,200
Right?
Clay.

2845
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:54,840
Too much at age 11.
I said I don't wanna be fat anymore.

2846
01:55:54,841 --> 01:55:57,570
So I went from 130 pounds.
One hundred pounds in.

2847
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:00,110
Damn.
He lost 30 pounds and 11 his sixth,

2848
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:01,230
fifth grade.
Sixth grade.

2849
01:56:01,231 --> 01:56:02,400
Sixth grade.
And you're 100 pounds.

2850
01:56:02,401 --> 01:56:04,500
That's a lot of weight.
That's 30 percent of your body.

2851
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:04,891
Well,
yeah,

2852
01:56:04,891 --> 01:56:06,390
it was fat.
I was fat as shit.

2853
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:09,950
Are you eating everything and you were 
wrestling into.

2854
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:10,833
Yeah.
You know,

2855
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:11,783
I was,
I was having some success because when 

2856
01:56:12,781 --> 01:56:14,640
you're fat or there's not a million 
people to compete against.

2857
01:56:14,650 --> 01:56:16,620
Right.
So anyway,

2858
01:56:16,621 --> 01:56:17,940
so I lost 30 pounds,
sixth grade.

2859
01:56:17,941 --> 01:56:19,620
So I,
I stopped drinking soda.

2860
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:24,030
I had this whole whole list of stuff.
I just kind of discipline at 11.

2861
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:24,660
Yeah,
I know.

2862
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:26,550
And that's a,
that's a now when I look at kids,

2863
01:56:26,551 --> 01:56:27,384
I think,
I think the mental maturity is huge in 

2864
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:31,140
longterm success,
being able to make,

2865
01:56:31,141 --> 01:56:31,920
like,
see,

2866
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,950
see the future and make decisions on 
what you want to do at that young age.

2867
01:56:35,250 --> 01:56:39,360
So I lost 30 pounds and so now I've 
slowly started like reintroducing lot of

2868
01:56:39,361 --> 01:56:40,490
stuff.
But it's like sodas,

2869
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:43,050
gross.
I haven't drank a soda and forever,

2870
01:56:43,051 --> 01:56:43,471
uh,
you know,

2871
01:56:43,471 --> 01:56:45,720
they're growing fast food.
I cut off as food.

2872
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:47,003
I don't,
I don't ever have any fast food in 20 

2873
01:56:48,721 --> 01:56:50,340
years.
I mean it's just disgusting,

2874
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:53,040
you know.
And so like I eat generally healthy.

2875
01:56:53,050 --> 01:56:55,530
My wife and I cook at home a lot.
We make really healthy food.

2876
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,480
Um,
and so,

2877
01:56:57,510 --> 01:57:00,060
but I don't take any supplements.
Zero,

2878
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:01,890
no multivitamin,
nothing,

2879
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:02,783
nothing.
So you get all your nutrients from your 

2880
01:57:04,531 --> 01:57:05,250
food?
Yeah.

2881
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:07,170
And I just figured like,
I.

2882
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:09,530
So I tried a couple of supplements in 
college.

2883
01:57:09,550 --> 01:57:11,130
I never,
I never felt anything from them.

2884
01:57:11,131 --> 01:57:13,080
Like I didn't feel any different,
you know.

2885
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:14,640
And so I'm like,
eh,

2886
01:57:14,740 --> 01:57:16,030
I didn't feel anything.
Why am I,

2887
01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:17,880
why am I going to take that?
I don't need to take it.

2888
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:21,090
And then,
so then oBviously I became like this,

2889
01:57:21,091 --> 01:57:23,830
uh,
anti pd crusader it,

2890
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:25,230
you know,
by chance.

2891
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:26,393
And so then it's like,
well now I really can't take anything 

2892
01:57:27,481 --> 01:57:28,314
because if I go take something and I pop
hot because these idiots or putting 

2893
01:57:30,901 --> 01:57:32,220
something in the supplement that should 
be there,

2894
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:34,890
I'm almost like a total asshole.
So I literAlly,

2895
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:36,780
I don't,
I didn't even take protein.

2896
01:57:37,610 --> 01:57:38,700
Nothing.
Wow,

2897
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:39,953
that's crazy.
So did you make sure that you ate the 

2898
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:44,010
proper amount of vegetables?
Green leafy vegetables.

2899
01:57:44,250 --> 01:57:48,420
I just need some food and latin script,
you know,

2900
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:50,160
like it's like healthy food.

2901
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:51,183
We're eating salads and you know,
I'm not eating cake and ice cream and 

2902
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:58,170
pizza and that kind of stuff and we're 
eating healthy food at my house,

2903
01:57:58,171 --> 01:57:59,004
you know,
but I'm not measuring the grams of thIs 

2904
01:58:01,321 --> 01:58:03,480
are granted that are.
So I really think,

2905
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:06,480
what am I and I,
this has been proven by science that you

2906
01:58:06,481 --> 01:58:07,314
only have a certain amount of time every
single day to have a high amount of 

2907
01:58:10,051 --> 01:58:12,450
mental focus on stuff.
And so I think like,

2908
01:58:12,451 --> 01:58:16,260
my training is more important than 
focusing on nutrition and stuff and so I

2909
01:58:16,261 --> 01:58:21,261
want to really like really zoning in 
really high level focus when I'm trading

2910
01:58:21,391 --> 01:58:23,730
and stuff.
And so I think if I worry about all this

2911
01:58:23,731 --> 01:58:24,564
stuff,
they'll take my focus away from that 

2912
01:58:26,230 --> 01:58:28,020
right or wrong.
That's kind of how I thought about it.

2913
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:30,810
It was a smart way to approach it and it
never really affected me.

2914
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:31,703
I mean,
uh,

2915
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:32,431
like I said that,
you know,

2916
01:58:32,431 --> 01:58:34,050
even when I took the supplements in 
college,

2917
01:58:34,051 --> 01:58:35,830
I never really felt them at all.
So like,

2918
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:37,860
well,
if I don't feel it,

2919
01:58:37,861 --> 01:58:38,694
why would I do it?
You know,

2920
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:39,593
it's kind of ironic though,
that you were an anti-drug crusader and 

2921
01:58:41,771 --> 01:58:44,170
you went to the one place that doesn't 
drug test I have now,

2922
01:58:44,171 --> 01:58:45,010
right?
It really hurt.

2923
01:58:45,011 --> 01:58:47,150
It hurt me.
But,

2924
01:58:47,710 --> 01:58:48,910
you know,
and it is,

2925
01:58:48,911 --> 01:58:49,744
if you look at,
so we talked about like Singapore being 

2926
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:53,050
so fantastic and having a really high 
gdp.

2927
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:55,620
A lot of the countries over there,
uh,

2928
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:57,710
Indonesia,
manila,

2929
01:58:58,840 --> 01:58:59,740
manila,
Philippines,

2930
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:03,100
um,
they don't have huge high gdps right?

2931
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:07,000
I mean they're not super wealthy 
countries and so when we think about,

2932
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:07,893
you know,
how much it costs to buy a lot of the 

2933
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:12,730
steroids that are readily available in 
America,

2934
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:13,564
they're just not as available and so I 
think they do have a point and if you 

2935
01:59:17,291 --> 01:59:18,124
look at the athletes,
there's not a lot of athletes that look 

2936
01:59:19,751 --> 01:59:22,240
like yoel romero now you'll notice 
probably not using,

2937
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:26,290
like I pointed out earlier while he's 
tested clean except one once was tainted

2938
01:59:26,291 --> 01:59:27,124
supplement,
but they proved that it was a tainted 

2939
01:59:28,181 --> 01:59:28,780
supplement.

2940
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:32,680
So when you look at their athletes maybe
except a few of the russian ones,

2941
01:59:32,681 --> 01:59:36,040
they look pretty normal.
Like it's probably unlikely that they're

2942
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:39,850
using from my for a few russian ones 
from Russia.

2943
01:59:39,851 --> 01:59:42,880
They can't help it.
It's like part of the culture.

2944
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,520
Yeah.
That one russian,

2945
01:59:45,521 --> 01:59:48,250
the one russian guy that I fought in 
april of 16,

2946
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:49,773
he was freaking enormous and you know,
the other thing that I think a lot of 

2947
01:59:53,261 --> 01:59:58,210
mma people are using some type of a,
oh my gosh,

2948
01:59:58,211 --> 01:59:59,770
I'm blanking.
What gives you endurance,

2949
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:00,760
epo,
epo,

2950
02:00:00,761 --> 02:00:03,260
that type of stuff.
Because if you want to call dress edge,

2951
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:04,113
how tired people get seven minutes and 
then we're fighting 25 minutes and 

2952
02:00:07,271 --> 02:00:09,130
you're not going to get tired.
Like that's not normal.

2953
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:11,350
well,
people definitely tested hot for that in

2954
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:12,184
the ufc.
Who's the guy that fought mighty mouse 

2955
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:16,890
of Russia?
Yeah.

2956
02:00:17,430 --> 02:00:17,950
Crazy.
Yeah.

2957
02:00:17,950 --> 02:00:18,783
So,
but I think more people are using that 

2958
02:00:19,751 --> 02:00:21,170
and I think if you,
you know,

2959
02:00:21,660 --> 02:00:22,493
I don't have any conclusive evidence,
but if you look at when you started and 

2960
02:00:24,851 --> 02:00:25,684
then how somebody fell down a just 
straight down their bodies look 

2961
02:00:29,351 --> 02:00:30,520
different.
They look different.

2962
02:00:30,521 --> 02:00:31,354
They're competent.
I mean Johnny Hendricks would be one 

2963
02:00:32,771 --> 02:00:33,581
that comes to mind.
I mean,

2964
02:00:33,581 --> 02:00:36,040
what's his freaking records since you 
saw it ain't very good.

2965
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:39,070
I'll tell you that much and all of a 
sudden you can make weight and you know,

2966
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:40,230
if you remember.
and I remember.

2967
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:41,950
So obviously I watched johnny because he
was,

2968
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:42,843
I couldn't stand johnny.
He beat me when we were 17 and then I 

2969
02:00:46,841 --> 02:00:48,510
tried to wrestle in my students.
So we were different.

2970
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:51,550
He was one 65,
I was one 74 and I was wrestling for the

2971
02:00:51,551 --> 02:00:54,730
all star classic and I called the people
who put it on and said I want to wrestle

2972
02:00:54,731 --> 02:00:55,390
him.

2973
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:57,190
And uh,
they turned the match down so it's,

2974
02:00:57,191 --> 02:00:58,024
I've kind of like,
I wanted to get that one back and I 

2975
02:00:59,471 --> 02:01:01,450
never got to get it back from when I was
17.

2976
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:02,613
So I've been following pretty closely.
If you watched johnny like a constant 

2977
02:01:06,101 --> 02:01:10,510
fight prior to that,
he gets so tired in like two rounds,

2978
02:01:10,511 --> 02:01:12,370
right.
Let me just fucking exhausted,

2979
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:13,233
exhausted.
And then all of sudden he's gone these 

2980
02:01:14,620 --> 02:01:16,820
five round fights and you're like,
hello,

2981
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,440
how are you going to get tired?
And that exhausted in two rounds and now

2982
02:01:20,441 --> 02:01:21,730
you can vote for five rounds.
Johnny,

2983
02:01:21,731 --> 02:01:23,200
like,
what's going on here?

2984
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:26,240
I mean,
in his defense to a team take down.

2985
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:29,950
They implemented a pretty fantastic 
program over there.

2986
02:01:29,951 --> 02:01:30,784
I mean they spent a lot of money on it.
That was the whole thing where they 

2987
02:01:32,561 --> 02:01:34,420
were,
they were paying him.

2988
02:01:34,690 --> 02:01:35,523
Then they wanted 50 percent of his own.
I got the same offer right out of 

2989
02:01:37,391 --> 02:01:39,050
college.
Did you know we were both graduates?

2990
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:40,040
How does that work?

2991
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,670
I felt like he was betting as myself.
They paid you a $100,000

2992
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:44,504
a year for seven years.
They got 50 percent of your career 

2993
02:01:46,401 --> 02:01:47,234
earnings and I said my thought was,
well if I ever make it really big I'm 

2994
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:53,750
going to make a million dollars a fight 
and I'm going to pay him back in the one

2995
02:01:53,751 --> 02:01:54,570
fight.
You know,

2996
02:01:54,570 --> 02:01:55,403
like it's,
it would be like hedging your bet 

2997
02:01:56,721 --> 02:01:58,880
against yourself and I don't ever bet 
against myself.

2998
02:01:59,420 --> 02:02:02,360
Yeah.
But for them I get it too.

2999
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:06,260
It's like they have to have some sort of
a reason to put out there and it's a big

3000
02:02:06,261 --> 02:02:08,650
bet whether or not you're going to be 
able to be an absolutely.

3001
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:09,740
But.
So if you think you suck,

3002
02:02:09,741 --> 02:02:13,460
it's good to take that bet.
If you've got an obama make it dog,

3003
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:15,380
I'm okay with making it a little bit of 
money.

3004
02:02:15,381 --> 02:02:15,930
Yeah.

3005
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:19,490
Then it's a good bet.
It doesn't seem like the best strategy.

3006
02:02:19,730 --> 02:02:21,590
It doesn't seem.
It's interesting and I think,

3007
02:02:21,591 --> 02:02:23,570
I think there's probably somewhere in 
there with,

3008
02:02:23,620 --> 02:02:24,181
you know,
I,

3009
02:02:24,181 --> 02:02:26,570
I know if you manage it,
it's where you go pick out,

3010
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:27,463
it's pretty proven that high level 
called justice are going to make really 

3011
02:02:29,391 --> 02:02:31,210
damn good fighters.
That's pretty proven.

3012
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:32,053
So go in and try to find a couple every 
year spending some money on them and 

3013
02:02:35,241 --> 02:02:36,950
then getting a percentage of their 
earnings,

3014
02:02:36,951 --> 02:02:37,784
that's probably a pretty,
I don't want to say a safe bet for the 

3015
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:42,020
people putting out the money,
but it's,

3016
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:43,373
you know,
take down,

3017
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:47,390
take down had jake rush holt who was an 
amazing wrestler and for whatever reason

3018
02:02:47,391 --> 02:02:49,480
he just didn't transition great to 
fighting.

3019
02:02:49,510 --> 02:02:50,343
Right.
He was good but he wasn't great and it 

3020
02:02:51,921 --> 02:02:52,754
was like for as good of a wrestlers he 
was probably third is gonna be a little 

3021
02:02:54,651 --> 02:02:55,160
better.

3022
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,230
Yeah.
What do you think is the fact or like if

3023
02:02:57,231 --> 02:02:58,064
you had to look at it from a wrestler 
because there's not a lot of outliers 

3024
02:03:01,251 --> 02:03:03,730
like that,
like where you don't like and,

3025
02:03:03,731 --> 02:03:05,570
and so when we talk about how good jake,
right,

3026
02:03:05,571 --> 02:03:07,880
he still made the ufc,
he still won some fights,

3027
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:11,650
so it's like he wasn't a bad fighter but
he's a three time ncaa champs.

3028
02:03:11,651 --> 02:03:12,620
So you expect him,
hey,

3029
02:03:12,621 --> 02:03:15,050
he'll probably go challenge for a ufc 
title.

3030
02:03:15,110 --> 02:03:15,650
Right.
so,

3031
02:03:15,650 --> 02:03:16,520
you know,
in his case,

3032
02:03:16,521 --> 02:03:19,680
I don't know what the factor was.
Um,

3033
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:23,360
but there's not a lot of outliers like 
that where it's so there are really high

3034
02:03:23,361 --> 02:03:24,980
level wrestler and then they don't have 
any success.

3035
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:27,890
Mma that's really unique.
You don't see it a lot.

3036
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:29,000
Yeah.
It's,

3037
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:29,833
it's interesting like I've looked at it 
from striking from if you see like 

3038
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:34,573
really high level kickboxers some have a
style that would readily translate to 

3039
02:03:39,141 --> 02:03:40,610
mma and som are fantastic.

3040
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:41,443
Kickboxers like maybe peter hertz is a 
good example or a nesto who's where I 

3041
02:03:44,631 --> 02:03:47,300
wouldn't really think that they would 
translate that well to mma.

3042
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:49,070
Whereas mirko cro,
cop,

3043
02:03:49,071 --> 02:03:52,960
who might've been like a slight notch 
below them in kickboxing,

3044
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,073
translates perfectly to mma because he's
so explosive and quail and I would 

3045
02:03:57,450 --> 02:03:59,250
wonder.
Decent takedown defense too.

3046
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:01,280
He kept it for awhile.
They developed it,

3047
02:04:01,281 --> 02:04:02,114
but the thing about mirko was 
unbelievable power and speed and he 

3048
02:04:06,321 --> 02:04:08,210
could just close the distance quickly 
and blast.

3049
02:04:08,211 --> 02:04:11,150
Yeah,
and I think that is a difference between

3050
02:04:11,151 --> 02:04:13,610
that and a guy who's like,
I'm methodical,

3051
02:04:13,611 --> 02:04:17,480
set things those guys didn't do as well.
they didn't translate as well.

3052
02:04:17,481 --> 02:04:19,490
They get tooken taken down to a 
hustling.

3053
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:20,753
What?
What would you think would be like the 

3054
02:04:22,721 --> 02:04:25,670
step mom?
It's a different guns you don't want.

3055
02:04:25,671 --> 02:04:26,504
The other things that I think benefits 
us wrestlers is the fact that jujitsu 

3056
02:04:28,970 --> 02:04:31,060
people are stuck on doing jujitsu the 
jujitsu way,

3057
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:31,550
right?

3058
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:35,030
Strikers are stuck on striking.
When we come into mma,

3059
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:37,230
we know we can't win a match just by 
wrestling.

3060
02:04:37,231 --> 02:04:39,270
Right?
So we know.

3061
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:41,040
We know.
I got to add striking.

3062
02:04:41,110 --> 02:04:42,030
I got,
I got to add.

3063
02:04:42,031 --> 02:04:43,980
You did,
and I'm open to that idea.

3064
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:45,143
Right?
I'm open to those ideas that I have to 

3065
02:04:45,811 --> 02:04:47,270
add those things into my arsenal.
Were jude,

3066
02:04:47,300 --> 02:04:49,080
some jujitsu guys are like,
well,

3067
02:04:49,081 --> 02:04:50,910
I'm just going to submit them and they 
don't.

3068
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:52,930
They don't develop their.
I mean there's,

3069
02:04:53,210 --> 02:04:56,460
you can literally not name me joe,
uh,

3070
02:04:56,610 --> 02:04:57,443
a jujitsu guy or striking guy.
Well maybe jose aldo who has developed 

3071
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:02,753
high level wrestling,
but you can name a lot of wrestlers 

3072
02:05:05,551 --> 02:05:07,860
who've developed high level something 
else,

3073
02:05:08,340 --> 02:05:10,060
right?
I mean when you see the crossover,

3074
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:14,760
like jon jones was a wrestler,
he can strike with pretty much anyone on

3075
02:05:14,761 --> 02:05:15,570
the planet,
right?

3076
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:17,610
It means steep meo chick wasn't a 
wrestler.

3077
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:19,590
He can pretty much strike when they 
don't on the planet.

3078
02:05:19,591 --> 02:05:20,424
I mean,
so you had these wrestlers who are 

3079
02:05:21,421 --> 02:05:23,460
becoming high level with these other 
skills,

3080
02:05:23,461 --> 02:05:27,330
but you don't have a lot of other skills
becoming a high level at wrestling.

3081
02:05:27,331 --> 02:05:28,170
And I,
and for me,

3082
02:05:28,171 --> 02:05:31,200
I think it's the stubbornness of people 
who come from those other backgrounds or

3083
02:05:31,201 --> 02:05:33,840
too stubborn to want to work a lot in 
wrestling.

3084
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,430
Whereas russell's like,
okay,

3085
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:36,580
teach power strike.
Yeah.

3086
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:39,300
I think it's a,
it's a recognition of what's important.

3087
02:05:39,301 --> 02:05:40,134
Like george st pierre is a perfect 
example of a guard who started off with 

3088
02:05:42,031 --> 02:05:42,864
a ql christian background,
didn't wrestle in college or high 

3089
02:05:44,371 --> 02:05:46,210
school,
became a fantastic wrestling.

3090
02:05:46,270 --> 02:05:47,190
He's good.
Yeah,

3091
02:05:47,191 --> 02:05:50,640
and just figured it out and realized,
realized what a critical skill it is to.

3092
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:51,540
Yeah,
absolutely.

3093
02:05:51,660 --> 02:05:54,000
So there's a handful of very small 
handful,

3094
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:57,180
jose aldo would be like if he wasn't an 
offensive wrestler,

3095
02:05:57,181 --> 02:06:00,440
but who'd be like,
he was so ridiculously hard to take down

3096
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:02,040
mean fantastic takedown defense.

3097
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:03,720
And so there,
there's a handful but there's not a lot.

3098
02:06:03,721 --> 02:06:05,270
And then.
But then if you go to wrestlers,

3099
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:09,420
going the opposite direction into 
jujitsu or striking,

3100
02:06:09,421 --> 02:06:09,740
you know,
you,

3101
02:06:09,740 --> 02:06:12,450
you can name quite a few that were able 
to do those things really well.

3102
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:14,850
You know,
it's interesting when you see a guy like

3103
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:17,550
khabib number grumet off and you see 
fantastic.

3104
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:19,320
Fuck yeah.
In his,

3105
02:06:19,410 --> 02:06:23,730
his mauling wrestling.
I mean,

3106
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:28,410
you see what a massive factor it is.
Fights like the edson barboza fight.

3107
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,710
Like that to me is one of the perfect 
examples.

3108
02:06:31,711 --> 02:06:32,544
When I say look,
the ability to take the guy down and 

3109
02:06:34,020 --> 02:06:38,130
control on the ground is the.
It'S the bottom of the pyramid.

3110
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:38,993
It's the most important foundation 
because he dictates where the fight 

3111
02:06:41,701 --> 02:06:42,450
takes place.
Yeah.

3112
02:06:42,450 --> 02:06:44,460
You might catch him when he's coming in 
and trying to get you.

3113
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:45,990
You might,
but if he gets you.

3114
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:47,610
He was like a fricking terminator 
though.

3115
02:06:47,611 --> 02:06:49,380
He was just like,
I'm just going to come get you.

3116
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:53,110
Yeah.
He just ate kicks and no hope.

3117
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:55,960
Just the constant chasing him around 
chasing them.

3118
02:06:55,961 --> 02:06:56,461
Right.
It was.

3119
02:06:56,461 --> 02:06:57,810
It was insane.
Yeah.

3120
02:06:57,811 --> 02:06:58,650
No,
he's fantastic.

3121
02:06:58,651 --> 02:06:59,311
Yeah,
but no,

3122
02:06:59,311 --> 02:07:02,070
I would totally agree that at the bottom
of the pyramid,

3123
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:02,933
it's like the is the trump card.
If like if you're fighting a wrestler 

3124
02:07:04,931 --> 02:07:05,764
and you can't stop but take down,
you're going to lose 90 percent of the 

3125
02:07:07,801 --> 02:07:08,540
time.
Yeah.

3126
02:07:08,540 --> 02:07:09,373
You know,
and if,

3127
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:12,360
if you're the wrestler and you can go 
get a take down really easily,

3128
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:13,740
you're going to win 90 percent of the 
time.

3129
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:14,783
The only wild card in that equation is a
guy like brian or tig fight so well off 

3130
02:07:19,261 --> 02:07:20,970
his back,
but how many people get submissions from

3131
02:07:20,971 --> 02:07:21,930
garden?
How many of those?

3132
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:22,813
Yeah.
Me even like any of the anthony pettis 

3133
02:07:24,031 --> 02:07:25,220
who got a lot of submissions,
guard,

3134
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:29,490
a lot of that was transitioned off of I 
body kicked benson harrison.

3135
02:07:29,491 --> 02:07:31,950
I bought a kicked benson and benson.
Harrison hates getting body kicks,

3136
02:07:31,951 --> 02:07:33,700
so he dives in for a take down.
It gets armbar.

3137
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:36,120
Gilbert melendez gets and get a teen

3138
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:38,170
show because he got jacked a few times.
Right.

3139
02:07:38,380 --> 02:07:39,820
So there are,
there's a handful of those,

3140
02:07:39,821 --> 02:07:41,620
but just strictly like I'd take you 
down.

3141
02:07:41,621 --> 02:07:43,580
You're in garden then I submit you 
right?

3142
02:07:44,050 --> 02:07:46,150
Maybe for receIver doom every once in 
awhile.

3143
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:49,030
Maybe brian or tega,
but the numbers pretty damn small.

3144
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:50,180
it is very small.
Yeah.

3145
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:51,033
It's smaller now than I think ever 
before because people understand that 

3146
02:07:53,301 --> 02:07:55,500
takedown down or the guard defense.

3147
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:56,920
Yeah.
Even like this guy that I.

3148
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:57,973
So one of the things that frustrates you
the most more than anything else that 

3149
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:02,600
may bad strategy just like drives me up 
the wall,

3150
02:08:02,601 --> 02:08:03,434
like the lima thing,
but this freaking knucklehead to fought 

3151
02:08:05,361 --> 02:08:06,980
Michael Chandler on,
uh,

3152
02:08:07,070 --> 02:08:10,560
on saturday.
I just see it named gordy gordy.

3153
02:08:10,561 --> 02:08:11,480
Yeah.
Moved here.

3154
02:08:11,481 --> 02:08:12,314
I don't know his damn name is.
So the first round he pulls guard like 

3155
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:16,963
fast gets frikking hammered on for like 
four minutes and then he ends up on 

3156
02:08:21,561 --> 02:08:22,394
bottom in the second round,
third round he gets taken down and I 

3157
02:08:25,971 --> 02:08:27,200
don't know,
15 seconds.

3158
02:08:27,260 --> 02:08:29,170
Did he try to get up one time?
Nah,

3159
02:08:29,171 --> 02:08:31,910
he just laid there and I was asked what 
performance in 45 seconds.

3160
02:08:32,270 --> 02:08:35,120
Like everyone's while to try a camera.
Everyone's while to try to triangle,

3161
02:08:35,540 --> 02:08:36,410
but it's like,
dude,

3162
02:08:36,530 --> 02:08:38,990
you're getting your ass whipped.
You're down two rounds and nothing.

3163
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,000
Try to get up.
Try to do something,

3164
02:08:41,001 --> 02:08:43,070
change your strategy.
If your strategy is not working,

3165
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:44,113
you can't just stick with the same 
bullshit and get your ass off for 

3166
02:08:45,561 --> 02:08:47,840
another four minutes and 45 seconds I 
give me a break.

3167
02:08:47,841 --> 02:08:49,130
What do you think's going to happen down
there?

3168
02:08:49,250 --> 02:08:50,083
Well,
I think some guys get locked into a 

3169
02:08:50,931 --> 02:08:51,764
defensive position,
like they realize they're getting 

3170
02:08:53,061 --> 02:08:55,190
overwhelmed and so they just try to 
survive.

3171
02:08:55,220 --> 02:08:56,130
You think so?
Yeah.

3172
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:57,103
Really?
Yeah.

3173
02:08:57,950 --> 02:08:58,783
You don't think that way because you're 
a champ and champions don't think that 

3174
02:09:01,071 --> 02:09:03,570
way.
But for some people there's a.

3175
02:09:04,010 --> 02:09:07,210
There's a acceptance of their,
their faith as well.

3176
02:09:07,220 --> 02:09:08,053
Pin this,
this is just getting their ass whipped 

3177
02:09:09,530 --> 02:09:13,370
and so they just try to stay conscious.
They try this just to protect themselves

3178
02:09:13,371 --> 02:09:14,480
as much as they can.

3179
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:16,260
Kinda like edson barboza.
But then you know,

3180
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:21,440
instrument edson barboza you saw once he
realized he was going to survive.

3181
02:09:21,441 --> 02:09:25,400
Like when it was like two minutes left 
and third round maybe ish side the first

3182
02:09:25,401 --> 02:09:25,821
round.
He's like,

3183
02:09:25,821 --> 02:09:26,990
I'm kidding.
I'm gonna get fucked up.

3184
02:09:27,230 --> 02:09:28,460
I'm just gonna.
I'm just going to survive.

3185
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:30,210
Right?
but then when there was coming with us,

3186
02:09:30,230 --> 02:09:30,760
he's like,
no.

3187
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:31,281
He was like,
okay,

3188
02:09:31,281 --> 02:09:33,530
I'm going to fight again.
I want to make it through this shit.

3189
02:09:33,590 --> 02:09:35,270
I might as well if I want to make it 
through this,

3190
02:09:35,271 --> 02:09:37,160
I might as well just fight back.
Right.

3191
02:09:37,161 --> 02:09:38,510
And so he started fighting back really 
hard,

3192
02:09:38,511 --> 02:09:40,160
like the last two minutes,
theft tried.

3193
02:09:40,190 --> 02:09:41,023
He certainly tried,
but there was a period in the middle 

3194
02:09:42,351 --> 02:09:44,570
where he had resigned to just take it an
asshole open.

3195
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:45,560
Well,
I think he was just.

3196
02:09:45,630 --> 02:09:46,463
Body was just not responding.
He was getting so fucked up and you 

3197
02:09:49,111 --> 02:09:52,740
could see the pace that habib put on a 
first round,

3198
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:55,710
like halfway into the round barboza is 
like,

3199
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:57,630
jesus christ,
you see the look in his eyes,

3200
02:09:57,631 --> 02:09:59,580
got that thousand yard stare.
It's like,

3201
02:09:59,581 --> 02:10:01,590
whoa,
what I signed up for.

3202
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:05,430
This guy's on another level.
I mean he reallY is on another level.

3203
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:09,840
I'm fascinated by him fighting tony 
ferguson and apparently they're going to

3204
02:10:09,841 --> 02:10:11,160
do that now.
It didn't happen.

3205
02:10:11,190 --> 02:10:11,821
April.
Yeah.

3206
02:10:11,821 --> 02:10:12,654
They don't know if it's going to be for 
the interim title or the actual title 

3207
02:10:14,941 --> 02:10:16,360
within.
They're going to strip connor.

3208
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:17,603
They're in a weird way.

3209
02:10:17,990 --> 02:10:18,823
He beats up tony.
That's just my end and I've 

3210
02:10:20,251 --> 02:10:22,410
underestimated tony before so I could be
wrong.

3211
02:10:22,411 --> 02:10:23,790
Again.
I just,

3212
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:25,620
I think it's the again,
trump card.

3213
02:10:25,621 --> 02:10:26,454
I think tony's kind of of those guys 
where he's pretty good everywhere is 

3214
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:31,800
pretty damn solid wrestling,
high level jujitsu,

3215
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:33,313
but I

3216
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:37,040
khabib wrestling being better than 
tony's wrestling so it's going to end up

3217
02:10:37,041 --> 02:10:37,874
on the ground and I think tony is going 
to think he can submit him because his 

3218
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:42,313
jujitsu is very high level,
but I think be one of the things where 

3219
02:10:44,151 --> 02:10:44,984
it could be just good enough not to get 
submitted and then he's going to land 

3220
02:10:47,751 --> 02:10:49,520
damage and land damage,
inland damage,

3221
02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:50,383
inland damage and tony's going to get 
close to a submission and close to a 

3222
02:10:52,731 --> 02:10:53,564
submission,
close to a submission but not quite get 

3223
02:10:55,671 --> 02:10:56,504
it.
And then all this damage is going to 

3224
02:10:57,291 --> 02:10:59,640
just accumulate and accumulate and 
accumulate that.

3225
02:10:59,670 --> 02:11:00,503
That's kinda how I see it going.
It's fascinating and I also think it's 

3226
02:11:02,931 --> 02:11:03,764
fascinating now that could be but has 
changed his training and has a real 

3227
02:11:06,291 --> 02:11:08,300
nutritionist.
Had no problem making weight.

3228
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:09,463
So all the factors that played into him 
getting removed from the last time they 

3229
02:11:13,461 --> 02:11:15,440
were supposed to fight pulled out of the
car.

3230
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:16,820
And I thought that was kind of 
overblown.

3231
02:11:16,821 --> 02:11:18,020
Healy,
ms dot wait one time.

3232
02:11:18,380 --> 02:11:21,590
he only missed one.
WaiT one time.

3233
02:11:21,591 --> 02:11:24,650
But his body shut down when he's making,
waiting for the Michael Johnson fight in

3234
02:11:24,651 --> 02:11:25,484
a similar way.
But he still did the Michael Johnson 

3235
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:27,230
fight.
Yeah.

3236
02:11:27,230 --> 02:11:28,063
But it was the same thing happened 
during the way and it was a rough way 

3237
02:11:30,021 --> 02:11:30,854
in.
But there's been other guys who ms dot 

3238
02:11:31,731 --> 02:11:34,970
wait many times.
I mean if we go to a Johnny Hendricks,

3239
02:11:34,971 --> 02:11:38,510
johny hendricks,
melvin gallard guests and they missed it

3240
02:11:38,511 --> 02:11:39,344
by a long list.
So I thought the thing kind of 

3241
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:42,680
overplayed.
He may sway one time.

3242
02:11:42,681 --> 02:11:44,060
He had some injuries which sucked for 
him.

3243
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:45,350
Um,
but it was,

3244
02:11:45,351 --> 02:11:47,270
that was happening for a world title 
fight,

3245
02:11:47,620 --> 02:11:49,250
you know,
fighting for the interim title.

3246
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:50,120
He,
mrs.

3247
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:50,901
Wait,
yeah.

3248
02:11:50,901 --> 02:11:51,734
I mean,
and so it was one of those where he 

3249
02:11:52,581 --> 02:11:53,800
probably just like,
it was like,

3250
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:55,970
okay for him to make it be difficult.

3251
02:11:55,970 --> 02:11:57,920
And he just got just a little bit too 
big.

3252
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:58,793
Actually.
Was it for an interim title when he was 

3253
02:12:00,351 --> 02:12:02,540
supposed to time?
I think it was the original time.

3254
02:12:02,790 --> 02:12:03,980
Was Kevin Lee,
right?

3255
02:12:03,981 --> 02:12:06,740
That was for the world title or interim 
title.

3256
02:12:06,741 --> 02:12:07,780
Job title.
Yeah.

3257
02:12:07,781 --> 02:12:09,530
The whole.
That whole division is kind of fucked up

3258
02:12:09,531 --> 02:12:10,364
with connor.
Not even knowing whether or not he's 

3259
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:12,710
fighting and they're going to strip him.
Right?

3260
02:12:12,711 --> 02:12:14,180
Yeah.
Mostly I think so.

3261
02:12:14,270 --> 02:12:15,470
I would imagine.
Unless connor says,

3262
02:12:15,471 --> 02:12:16,304
fuck it,
I'm in.

3263
02:12:16,490 --> 02:12:18,620
I think the best comeback.
Fuck it.

3264
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:20,870
Fuck it.
Fuck it.

3265
02:12:20,871 --> 02:12:21,704
I want to keep me belt.
I know the best course of action strip 

3266
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:24,993
cotter let,
let could be even tony fight it out and 

3267
02:12:26,391 --> 02:12:28,390
then it kinda wants to go back.
Get my title shot.

3268
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,570
That's going to happen.
Whatever.

3269
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:32,990
Well,
I think what would be the most lucrative

3270
02:12:32,991 --> 02:12:36,560
thing as connor versus shut up joe or 
the fight gsp.

3271
02:12:36,590 --> 02:12:37,390
Oh,
you do?

3272
02:12:37,390 --> 02:12:38,223
The one thing I want to be number one,
I don't want to fight tyron because 

3273
02:12:40,071 --> 02:12:43,000
we've been friends for 20 years.
Uh,

3274
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:45,250
I to fight gsp.
That's what I want to fight.

3275
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:46,113
You think that they would set that up?
They would try to set up gsp versus 

3276
02:12:48,501 --> 02:12:49,400
tyron.
Right?

3277
02:12:49,401 --> 02:12:51,850
That would be the big super.
Gsp doesn't want to fight him.

3278
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:54,240
Who can hit hard because he's worried 
about the brain damage?

3279
02:12:54,241 --> 02:12:54,951
I think so,
yeah.

3280
02:12:54,951 --> 02:12:55,784
I don't hit that hard.

3281
02:12:58,850 --> 02:13:00,980
Interesting way of looking at it.
You're trained with gsp.

3282
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:01,873
I've never changed,
so I've trained with almost every top 

3283
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:07,250
what the weight of this era except gsp.
Really?

3284
02:13:07,310 --> 02:13:08,700
Yeah.
Well marie,

3285
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:13,340
but a shields,
fitch diaz a couple times.

3286
02:13:13,341 --> 02:13:15,030
Tyron obviously,
um,

3287
02:13:15,260 --> 02:13:16,093
you know,
go down the line of train with pretty 

3288
02:13:16,821 --> 02:13:17,654
much everyone in this era.
What do you feel like if you do wind up 

3289
02:13:20,751 --> 02:13:22,790
retiring,
what do you feel like you'll,

3290
02:13:22,820 --> 02:13:24,240
you'll wind up doing?
Just coaching.

3291
02:13:24,450 --> 02:13:25,283
Wrestling.
I love doing it really enjoyed a lot so 

3292
02:13:27,861 --> 02:13:29,000
I could,
I,

3293
02:13:29,380 --> 02:13:31,710
I don't think I'd go back to the 
collegiate level.

3294
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:32,280
It's obviously

3295
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:33,420
always an option.
It,

3296
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:35,640
I went out for the four years,
I coached college wrestling.

3297
02:13:35,641 --> 02:13:37,050
I loved iT,
you know,

3298
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:37,801
and then it was like,
hey,

3299
02:13:37,801 --> 02:13:42,150
I won the belt is making a lot of money.
I should probably try to be good at this

3300
02:13:42,151 --> 02:13:45,570
instead of just doing it halfway.
And so I did that and then,

3301
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:46,433
you know,
we opened the wrestling schools and now 

3302
02:13:47,701 --> 02:13:51,030
it's going really well and I really 
enjoyed that a lot and you know,

3303
02:13:51,031 --> 02:13:51,864
there's positives and negatives.
Like I love coaching at the highest 

3304
02:13:53,971 --> 02:13:54,804
level,
being able to talk about his level to 

3305
02:13:55,921 --> 02:13:59,610
the college guys.
So I missed that part a little bit.

3306
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:04,020
But then obviously if you go work for an
institution like that,

3307
02:14:04,021 --> 02:14:06,510
there's gonna be a lot of bureaucracy 
and I worry about that.

3308
02:14:06,511 --> 02:14:09,000
I don't like that.
I love owning my own business,

3309
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:09,834
a heavy amount of freedom and not having
to worry about what I tweet or what I 

3310
02:14:12,391 --> 02:14:13,224
say or yeah,
having with telling me what to do or 

3311
02:14:14,881 --> 02:14:16,410
where to be or where to dress or 
whatever,

3312
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:17,610
you know,
like I don't like.

3313
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:18,713
So I love that freedom obviously.
Then running your own business has its 

3314
02:14:21,181 --> 02:14:23,280
own challenges also.
So,

3315
02:14:23,281 --> 02:14:23,751
uh,
but I,

3316
02:14:23,751 --> 02:14:26,640
I think I will coat dress them for the 
rest of my life,

3317
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,640
whether I fight once more where they 
don't find once more,

3318
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:31,290
I'll probably call jonathan for the rest
of my life.

3319
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:31,860
Oh,
awesome.

3320
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:32,820
Yeah.
Well listen man,

3321
02:14:32,821 --> 02:14:34,500
I'm glad we finally got a chance to do 
this.

3322
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:35,370
It was fun.
Really,

3323
02:14:35,370 --> 02:14:36,700
really fun.
And um,

3324
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:38,960
tell people about your podcast.
Uh,

3325
02:14:38,970 --> 02:14:39,803
so I have a wrestling podcast called the
tea room funky show that had said 

3326
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:44,040
another to what t dot rowe and funky 
show,

3327
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:46,410
hero and funky show.
How do you spell that?

3328
02:14:46,950 --> 02:14:51,040
T dash row funky.
So tire a tire.

3329
02:14:51,041 --> 02:14:54,990
And tommy rollins is to 10 minutes a 
champ for Ohio state,

3330
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:57,000
uh,
made a couple of world teams,

3331
02:14:57,001 --> 02:14:58,860
was really close to make an olympic team
and um,

3332
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:01,950
you know,
we was on the phone one day and I said I

3333
02:15:01,951 --> 02:15:02,670
want to do a podcast.

3334
02:15:02,670 --> 02:15:03,180
I'm like,
ah,

3335
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:04,950
I want to do a podcast too.
Let's just do it,

3336
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:07,050
you know,
so it's not like a job for us.

3337
02:15:07,051 --> 02:15:08,520
We just do it for fun.
We enjoy it,

3338
02:15:08,521 --> 02:15:10,290
we love talking about wrestling and you 
know,

3339
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:12,450
for me it's really nice,
like a,

3340
02:15:12,510 --> 02:15:13,343
you know,
no one's on the same schedule as me now 

3341
02:15:14,911 --> 02:15:18,720
that I can talk wrestling with.
So to be able to get on talk for an hour

3342
02:15:18,721 --> 02:15:20,760
a week about wrestling,
it's a blast.

3343
02:15:20,850 --> 02:15:24,480
Awesome.
So that's on itunes and soundcloud.

3344
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:25,373
People want to find you a.
It's been asking on twitter or 

3345
02:15:28,230 --> 02:15:29,970
instagram.
I like.

3346
02:15:29,971 --> 02:15:32,550
I'm on instagram,
but I don't really get into it.

3347
02:15:32,551 --> 02:15:33,211
I don't.
I don't know.

3348
02:15:33,211 --> 02:15:34,044
I Can't.
I can'T get an instagram is just 

3349
02:15:34,831 --> 02:15:37,890
pictures like I get it.
There's no banter back and forth.

3350
02:15:37,891 --> 02:15:39,840
I struggle.
I post every once in a while.

3351
02:15:39,841 --> 02:15:42,770
But you like twitter of twitter fun,
ben asking.

3352
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:43,870
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thanks brother.

3353
02:15:43,871 --> 02:15:44,910
I appreciate it.
It was fun.

3354
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:45,773
Yes sir.

3355
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:48,863
My.
