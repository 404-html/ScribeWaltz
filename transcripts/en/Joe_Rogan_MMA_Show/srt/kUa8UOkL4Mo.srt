1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,320
Okay,
here we go.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,060
Four,
three,

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,950
two,
one,

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,110
boom.
And we'll live cat.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,160
How are you?
I'm good.

6
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:10,130
How are you?
Good to see you here.

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,220
Thanks for having me.
My pleasure.

8
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,113
My pleasure.
I'm looking forward to talking to you 

9
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:15,130
for awhile.
I know it's,

10
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,083
uh,
I feel like been a long time coming and 

11
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,270
I don't even know how much time we have 
affiliate.

12
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,530
There's a hell of a lot to catch up on.
Shit.

13
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,020
Yeah,
there's a lot to talk about.

14
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:25,180
Always.
You're a getting ready for Boise.

15
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:25,811
That's your,
uh,

16
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:26,644
your neck,
spine,

17
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,470
pleats fighting.
I'm Marianne.

18
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:31,650
We're now July 14th.
The end,

19
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,520
the century link arena.
Now you took,

20
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,790
you took a good stretch off,
right?

21
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,090
A couple of times.
Yeah,

22
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:38,871
a couple of times.
I,

23
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:40,160
um,
let's see.

24
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:44,030
After I fought Meesha,
I blew my knee and then,

25
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,650
well,
the world exploded.

26
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:49,220
And so I had I think 18 months off 
between that and fighting,

27
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,240
uh,
Amanda.

28
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,750
And then after I fought Amanda,
I saw Amanda was like September 27,

29
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:59,480
something like that.
And I fought Ronda February 28th.

30
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,240
And then after Ronda,
uh,

31
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,770
took another big stretch off,
fought Juliana the following year,

32
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,360
uh,
July 9th,

33
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:10,070
and then this was another big stretch 
off.

34
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,870
So yeah,
it's been a little bit scattered,

35
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,640
but doing what I can.

36
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,901
Yeah,
you are,

37
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:17,730
you are doing some crazy therapy to 
write some,

38
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,010
some interesting stuff down in San 
Diego.

39
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,861
Yeah.
So,

40
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:22,060
um,
there's,

41
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,830
there's been a few things I've been 
working on,

42
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:25,960
like I'm not a huge fan of western 
medicine,

43
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,830
you know,
like,

44
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,030
uh,
even,

45
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,130
I mean,
you can call it alternative medicine.

46
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,570
It's like original medicine.
I,

47
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,600
I appreciate looking at things like that
way more than you know,

48
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,530
big farm.
But I,

49
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:36,311
uh,
you know,

50
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:38,020
one thing that,
um,

51
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,080
you know,
fighting has gotten me and,

52
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,340
and stuff with,
you know,

53
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:43,090
I th I think it's more prevalent in 
women,

54
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,400
although I'm thinking it's happening 
with men too,

55
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:48,970
is like our endocrine systems are not 
happy with these weight cuts and they're

56
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:51,100
not happy with us.
Like getting hit in the head a lot.

57
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,443
Go figure.
Right.

58
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,643
Yeah.
Go for it.

59
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,210
So,
um,

60
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,910
you know,
within all of that I've just,

61
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,773
you know,
had medical problems and things that 

62
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:02,140
like I'm constantly working on and I 
feel really good.

63
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,460
I'm,
I'm constantly improving.

64
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:04,390
But,
um,

65
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,890
one thing I was feeling a little bit 
stuck on was a wine,

66
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,730
I like some of the endocrine problem 
issues,

67
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:10,690
but,
um,

68
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,000
like I dunno,
I,

69
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,350
I had,
uh,

70
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,760
had I went to this facility in San Diego
is called,

71
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:20,830
um,
Dang,

72
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:21,730
why can't I remember?
Oh,

73
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:22,564
a mindset.
And actually the UFC sent me there 

74
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,530
because I mean,
we have you sought,

75
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:27,520
oh,
we have all of these things.

76
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:28,450
Like,
um,

77
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,943
after fighting Amanda,
I got my head pounded for a good four 

78
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:33,930
minutes there.
Um,

79
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,270
I had a Tbi afterwards,
so that was like,

80
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,400
uh,
immediately lowered my,

81
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,280
a estrogen,
lowered my da ta,

82
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:46,300
my testosterone and I'm hypo thyroid.
Like I will always be hyperthyroid now.

83
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,680
Like I have to that fight.
Yeah.

84
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,030
Yeah.
And um,

85
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,380
you know,
still toughed it out.

86
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:51,214
So it was trying to do what I could to 
go and fight Ronda as soon as I did 

87
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:54,994
afterwards.
And,

88
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,160
you know,
part of my game plan is don't get hit.

89
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,113
And which means like,
let's just dart out her and see what 

90
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,420
happens.
You know?

91
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,790
So what,
that's what happens when you do that.

92
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,050
No,
Tbi is traumatic brain injury.

93
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:08,640
Just in case if someone is listening to 
this,

94
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:10,020
doesn't understand what we're talking 
about.

95
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,570
And then in the Rhonda fight,
if people don't know about that,

96
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:14,820
you just charged after and he got caught
in an arm bar and like,

97
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,110
what was it?
Very quick.

98
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,840
Okay.
14,

99
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,330
it was 14 sayings,
but I did hit her with a knee.

100
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,510
I did throw her ass,
but she practice a little Ninja move and

101
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,710
caught muddy alarm.
And it was,

102
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:27,820
it was over,
you know,

103
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:29,200
but I mean,
even,

104
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,850
even her coaches were like,
I mean,

105
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:31,684
that's the,
you did what you're supposed to do 

106
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,580
there.
And She just got you.

107
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,503
You know?
So,

108
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,463
um,
that would be an awesome fight to be 

109
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,890
able to revisit one day.
Uh,

110
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,310
she even said that we'd do it.
I mean,

111
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:42,340
who knows her career so open right now 
I'm going to fight again.

112
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,620
She doesn't need to.
Yeah.

113
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,523
It really doesn't need it.

114
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,640
I don't think she wants to,
you know,

115
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,930
I think,
uh,

116
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,301
oh,
I mean,

117
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:51,740
who knows,
you'd have to ask her,

118
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:54,200
but there's a lot of lessons to be 
learned.

119
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:55,034
And what happened to her in terms of 
like all of the distractions and 

120
00:03:58,851 --> 00:03:59,684
Hollywood came calling and there was 
scripts and talk about doing road house 

121
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,560
and there was all this,
all this shit going on.

122
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,480
There was other than fighting.
Yeah.

123
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,040
You know,
and then it was also,

124
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,683
look,
the sport has evolved so rapidly in the 

125
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,554
women's,
women's MMA has gotten so high level so 

126
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:19,964
quickly and if he's,
I'm sure you saw a man does last fight 

127
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,110
with Raquel Pennington.
I'm like,

128
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:24,944
Holy Shit.
I mean that was a fucking high level 

129
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:32,150
performance from her.
And five rounds,

130
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,163
super high cardio,
just put a beating down on recal 

131
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,723
painting.
It's one of the toughest girls in the 

132
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:38,930
world for sure.

133
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,400
Right.
I do like,

134
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,263
I mean,
I'm curious.

135
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,280
I was saying the same thing as the 
fights going.

136
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:44,900
Right.
And then I have,

137
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,700
uh,
some people in my ear next to me,

138
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:47,181
they're like,
well,

139
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:48,680
how long has it been since raquel?
Fuck,

140
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:51,780
cause she didn't look her right.
Her like beefiest straight.

141
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:53,480
She,
she looked a little tired.

142
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:57,530
She looked a little like not her typical
and then it was like,

143
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,560
she is a year and a half off herself.
Right.

144
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:00,394
Like right into a title fight,
which I have to say I'm a little bit 

145
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:05,990
envious of because when I beat Misha,
I,

146
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:07,090
when,
uh,

147
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,780
I was supposed to coach ultimate 
fighter,

148
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,140
but that was all ultimately going to end
up in a title shot with Rhonda.

149
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,500
And I blew my knee and my husband passed
away and there was like a long moment of

150
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,870
silence in there.
And then when I was able to come back,

151
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:22,640
they made me read,
earn my title shot,

152
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,380
you know?
And so it was like,

153
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:24,891
wait,
oh,

154
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,360
we're doing that now.
Or just like

155
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,420
penn done.
Like what,

156
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,910
what attractive contenders are 
available.

157
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:31,744
Like what?

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,870
Yeah,
it looks good.

159
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,590
I agree.
Yeah.

160
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,120
I mean,
it was very young at that,

161
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,980
at that age or at that at the time.

162
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,013
Right.
And in Bantam weight right now there's 

163
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:39,944
like there's no standout contender.
And Raquel had beaten some really good 

164
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,310
fighters.
She looked like the next in line.

165
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:49,470
And did she blow her knee out as well?
She had some sort of surgery.

166
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:51,450
I like,
it could

167
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,283
be lion,
but I think she gotten like some 

168
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:54,084
accident with a four wheeler,
like rolled over and broke her leg or 

169
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,823
something.
I could like totally be making that up 

170
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,834
though.
She could have just twisted it walking 

171
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,220
down the street too.
So I don't know.

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,530
Yeah.

173
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,570
Now that you're saying that,
I do remember something like a Bro,

174
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,480
a broken leg,
it would,

175
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,290
you'll find out what it is.
Um,

176
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,010
but would you a,
were you surprised by that fight

177
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,910
between and Amanda?
Yeah,

178
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,900
I mean,
I didn't,

179
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,150
I didn't see where cal being the one to 
beat her,

180
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,540
you know?
Um,

181
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,220
I do feel like Amanda's been working and
doing like,

182
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,240
you know,
improving,

183
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:28,360
I mean,
she changed her camps,

184
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,243
the coaches that she's working with.
I tried out for a while at at one point 

185
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:33,960
too when I was trying to find my spot 
and they're legit.

186
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,670
They're very good.
Um,

187
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,760
and American top team has a lot of high 
level training partners,

188
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:39,960
both girls and guys,
you know what I mean?

189
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:42,750
She had a good,
a good decision made there.

190
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,580
So I,
I see how she's improved.

191
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,280
Um,
I think with the time off with Raquel,

192
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,890
I wasn't sure how it was going to go,
but also I just,

193
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,143
I just don't know.
I just don't see where Kelby and to be 

194
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,940
being the one that beats her.

195
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,870
It's so hard to tell you no,
right.

196
00:06:55,871 --> 00:06:56,704
I mean,
anybody on any given night at the 

197
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:00,850
highest level of the game,
someone can,

198
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:02,800
when someone can be off,
someone can be a hard,

199
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,020
yeah,

200
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,670
there's no math to be done in this 
sport.

201
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,520
There really isn't a,
math is ridiculous.

202
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:08,354
So I mean,
sometimes I hear like statistics on me 

203
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:12,740
or definitions on me or labels on me and
I'm like,

204
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:13,970
wait,
I'm a,

205
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm a,
I'm a known striker.

206
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:18,590
Like I'd never would've thought I'd be 
known as a striker.

207
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,690
I mean,
I've been doing Jujitsu and wrestling my

208
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,070
whole life,
so me and I'll take it,

209
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:23,210
fuck yeah.
You know?

210
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,950
Yeah,
yeah,

211
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,470
yeah.
But even that is yes.

212
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:30,200
But I mean that,
that in itself was like,

213
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,860
I love to wrestle and what can I do once
I've closed that distance,

214
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:35,930
while it's those,
those short and goals strikes,

215
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,740
you know,
there's,

216
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,573
there's needs and there's elbows there 
that those are the most destructive 

217
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,440
things I could possibly do to someone 
when,

218
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,570
when we're that close and to do all that
work to get that close.

219
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,270
But granted,
that's all influenced by my time,

220
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,800
what I got to learn from that 
discipline.

221
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,634
So,
you know,

222
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,200
it's all relevant,
but,

223
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,370
um,
you know,

224
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,713
it's,
uh,

225
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,220
it's always just interesting to hear how
you're now being categorized.

226
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,381
Yeah.
It is weird.

227
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:00,740
Right.
But you are,

228
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:03,400
you are definitely a dangerous striker.
I mean,

229
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,353
you're dangerous.

230
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,450
I agree.
I mean,

231
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,220
I like it and,
and I'm,

232
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,030
I'm enjoying constantly learning and new
things like the,

233
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,610
the basics were always hard for me to 
get,

234
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,680
cause I wanted to do the big girl stuff,
you know,

235
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,420
and uh,
you know,

236
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,490
found my way,
like right in the middle of all of that.

237
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:20,324
And in found a way to use how aggressive
I am and how just like dominique 

238
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,000
domineering,
I can feel in there and all of that.

239
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:29,090
So it's like,
I don't know the,

240
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,750
I want the maximum amount of damage 
without taking damage,

241
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:34,510
which is obviously the goal.
Right.

242
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,210
But like I want to put it into a dance,
so it's like a little,

243
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,523
I don't know.

244
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,073
Did you decide to go to San Diego?
So you're at alliance now moved from 

245
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,330
Colorado to San Diego.

246
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,720
So a few things.
So one of them,

247
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,583
one of them was like,
Colorado is a complicated situation for 

248
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,500
me.
I mean,

249
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,340
I had gyms that they're like,
a lot just happened up there.

250
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,940
Um,
and I love my team elevation.

251
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,220
Like I love ice.
I'm still close with everybody.

252
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:04,680
Like I go to Colorado for Christmas 
holidays.

253
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,120
I get still home,
you know,

254
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,790
but a couple of things.
One with the head injury.

255
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,830
Um,
Colorado is amazing for training,

256
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,640
right?
It's amazing for building your,

257
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:15,540
your endurance and whatever.
But it is not good for healing.

258
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,643
Like you'll never see a doctor tell 
someone with Alzheimer's or a Tbi or 

259
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:25,020
heart problems or even like massive 
allergies or um,

260
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,390
what's the,
uh,

261
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,190
arthritis arthritis,
those are not,

262
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,350
that's not a good place for people to 
live with.

263
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:32,184
Any kind of inflammatory or like major 
thing that needs to be healing because 

264
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,150
your body's already working at such a 
high level because yeah,

265
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,100
because the altitude,
I mean the thin air,

266
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,930
the,
the things like that,

267
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:47,931
it's just like I spent so much time and 
so much money,

268
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,480
like figuring out what the hell was 
wrong with me that,

269
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,343
you know,
I ended up at the Mayo clinic spending 

270
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,900
weeks at a time going to all their like 
specialized different,

271
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,110
uh,
doctors in situations like that for them

272
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,490
to tell me like,
you know,

273
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,324
if you want to heal,
you want to give yourself the best 

274
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:08,730
opportunity to heal,
you're probably not going to do it up at

275
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:09,180
altitude.

276
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,520
Like we would prefer seeing you at sea 
level.

277
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,603
And so combined like I kind of,
I needed to almost exiled myself from 

278
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,820
Colorado cause I want to love it.
And I was starting to,

279
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,220
it was starting to get like less 
colorful for me,

280
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,083
you know,
cause I felt like I had the best there 

281
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,874
was as far as coaches and the best there
was as far as training partners and the 

282
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,370
situations like everything was as good 
as it was going to get.

283
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,880
Like it literally was as good as it was 
going to get.

284
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,280
And it was like this can't be it.
Like I don't feel,

285
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,600
I don't feel right.
No.

286
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,743
And I was like,
that means I'm gonna have to take a 

287
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:44,131
change,
you know?

288
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:46,800
And I was scared.
Like I have a little boy,

289
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,663
like I'm taking them away from 
everything we know and we just packed a 

290
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:54,651
u haul and we left and we,
we got to San Diego in San Diego I went,

291
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,733
I wish I had written down like all the 
gyms I went to in showed up at like 

292
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,380
anonymously to,
because I didn't want them to,

293
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:02,214
like,
I wanted to kind of catch them with 

294
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:03,840
their pants down.

295
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,673
Like,
what are you guys like right now versus 

296
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:07,464
if you're prepared,
I don't want to show up and have you 

297
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:11,220
have people here watching me.
I don't want you to put on a show,

298
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:13,680
like I want to catch you how you are and
like,

299
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:15,720
have you decided what you think of me 
too?

300
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,970
Because these needs,
this needs to be a fit.

301
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:18,804
I mean,
fighting and coaching and training is 

302
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:23,070
very intimate and it needs to be 
authentic and real.

303
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:26,040
The days I'm sitting there,
ugly white girl crying on the ground,

304
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,330
but I need,
I need you to tell me to keep,

305
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,330
stay on the erudite and you know what I 
mean?

306
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,980
Like just let me cry,
you know,

307
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:33,440
that kind of thing.
And um,

308
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,463
it's,
uh,

309
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,490
so I went to all these places and like 
I,

310
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,790
the best part about it is that I got to 
learn and train with so many fighters in

311
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,180
so many coaches that I like.
I'm so excited about the relationships I

312
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,860
made and the people I know.
But,

313
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,600
um,
like all of them,

314
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:49,740
it was like,
this is awesome,

315
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,300
but it's not the place.
This is awesome,

316
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:53,590
but it's not the place.
I came up to La

317
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,860
and I was very close to going to 
American top team.

318
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,080
They had an awesome deal set up for me 
to go,

319
00:11:59,081 --> 00:11:59,914
like helping me with my kid,
helping me with a good percentage for 

320
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,440
training,
like how uh,

321
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,393
living situation was going to be,
they're going to accommodate me really 

322
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:08,794
well.
Um,

323
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,833
but when it was time to like pack my car
and go like something was like that 

324
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,720
wasn't it,
you know?

325
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,080
And so I'm like,
I mean sweaty all the time,

326
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:24,070
like right here and just making that 
look hot.

327
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,990
There's a lot of cool people in Florida,
but there's just,

328
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,740
there's some subhumans down there.
Yeah.

329
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,360
I really appreciate it.
Like the Latin culture.

330
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,770
I mean,
I'm all about,

331
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,690
yeah,
it's Florida.

332
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,990
There's some fucking swamp people 
though.

333
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,700
They're no joke.
No joke.

334
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,990
Um,
so,

335
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,730
uh,
then I looked west,

336
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,840
you know,
um,

337
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,000
I know ed stores out here,
he's my manager and,

338
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:52,834
and I had a few pockets of people I knew
that could maybe be a support to me and 

339
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:55,980
my kids.

340
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,950
So,
um,

341
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,480
came to la.
If I was here,

342
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,340
I was going to go to the black house.
Uh,

343
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:03,120
I think,
uh,

344
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,931
Oh,
where's calvin?

345
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:05,764
[inaudible] I'm again 12 and gasoline.
You got to say his name wrong every 

346
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,274
time.
But where is he coached the MEU ticket 

347
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:12,240
kings.
Kings.

348
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,050
Kayla's going to king's black house.
And I was still trying to pick Jujitsu.

349
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,320
Like I wanted like a art of Jujitsu guy 
or,

350
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,700
or uh,
you know,

351
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,320
just someone really good.
Yeah,

352
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,154
because I came from traditional 
traditional Jujitsu and like I love MMA 

353
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,770
and mixing it up,
but I need that.

354
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,040
So I felt you introduced to purple for 
like ever like six years.

355
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,500
How come?
So long?

356
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,440
Because I'm being a Weirdo about who 
promotes me.

357
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,633
Cause my husband,
my husband promoted me to purple belt 

358
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,213
and like I really want what whoever 
takes over to the lineage to be like 

359
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:49,930
that.

360
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,390
Like I don't want it a different one 
from 10 different people.

361
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:56,560
Like I want that like I want to pick and
it be right.

362
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:01,330
And so actually now I'm super excited 
because I just started training at attos

363
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,140
and I have so much respect for Andre and
his wife and Angelica,

364
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,380
there's so many good fighters come out 
of that gym to Great Jujitsu.

365
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,770
I,
I've been changing,

366
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:14,530
they're like four weeks now and I've,
I mean I've trained there before,

367
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:15,364
but like every day for weeks now,
and I've only had like one day where I 

368
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:20,524
walked out feeling like a rock star.
The rest of the days they were whooping 

369
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:23,890
my ass,
but it was good,

370
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:26,230
you know,
like I needed that and it tells me,

371
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,390
you know,
yeah.

372
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,633
And there it's just been so good.
And to see myself that way and to hold 

373
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,304
people that way.
Like I was legit Jujitsu me and I was 

374
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:38,770
like killing it on the circuit for a 
long time and then Emma May comes in and

375
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:41,770
puts this pressure on,
like even those kinds of competitions,

376
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:43,480
even though they're not even the same 
animal.

377
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:47,440
And I'm annoyed that I let that bother 
me and keep me from competing in between

378
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:51,470
fights because I left the back.
You have a big name in mma?

379
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,160
You feel

380
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,040
weird about competing in Jujitsu 
tournaments?

381
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,943
I think I did I or maybe I thought I'd 
pick up bad habits or I would do 

382
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:59,294
whatever,
but because maybe other people had that 

383
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,690
experience,
but like for me,

384
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:05,780
I need to see it for myself.
Like if I go and I do a tournament and I

385
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,310
do great,
then hell yeah,

386
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:09,620
I'm going to have higher expectations of
myself in a fight.

387
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,270
If I go and I do shitty.
Okay,

388
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,104
well like now I get to learn like that 
competing is where I get to learn 

389
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:17,060
everything and spacing out these 
competitions.

390
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,910
Especially at the time I've had to take 
off in between fights.

391
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:21,530
Like,
like I'm not,

392
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,990
I don't believe necessarily in ring 
rust,

393
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:24,824
but like when they say go,
I don't know what go means until a 

394
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,334
little bit later than I'm expecting and,
and it's been the pattern in these last 

395
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:34,820
two fights.

396
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,730
When the fight starts,
you still feel like,

397
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:39,140
is this really happening?
Kind of.

398
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:40,160
Well,
even this last night,

399
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,100
this last fight with Caitlin,
like we got in and I was like,

400
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:44,930
do I remember what to do here?
You know?

401
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:45,770
And I was like,
fuck it,

402
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:48,650
I'm just a throw bombs.
And the whole time I was just like,

403
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,500
and I'm not,
that's not me there,

404
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,343
you know?
It was just like chucking my hands at 

405
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:55,400
her and hope and they land and if they 
didn't like the fuck out,

406
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,130
you know,
you feel like out of composure.

407
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,420
Yeah,
until the,

408
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:02,780
until the third round.
And then the third round I was awake and

409
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,040
ready to go.
And I mean,

410
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,750
I felt warmed up.
I felt right.

411
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:07,970
And you know,
she was looking at the clock and backing

412
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,340
up and all of this and I was just like,
come here,

413
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:10,700
come here.

414
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,780
Like I'm ready to fight,
finally,

415
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:12,614
like,
come here.

416
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,330
And uh,
you know,

417
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:15,164
I don't know.
So there's something to be fixed about 

418
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:16,830
that,
eh,

419
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,830
I don't think it's a secret,
but,

420
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,740
um,
I dunno.

421
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,613
I think maybe something with the warmup 
I need to like fully like have like a 

422
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,363
respiratory exhaustion before I go in so
I can simulate those first rounds being 

423
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,460
the hell out of the way.
Even in wrestling,

424
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,100
I don't know.
You know,

425
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,710
there's,
there's a lot to it.

426
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:37,544
Like Gosh,
we're bouncing around all these 

427
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:41,740
different things.
But I mean,

428
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,683
one thing with the,
with that treatment center that I went 

429
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,950
to is like,
um,

430
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,190
doing different things,
like dealing with your psychology,

431
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,200
dealing with like the synchrony and your
brain,

432
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,170
you know,
having your brain function and in on the

433
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:57,000
same hurts at the same or different 
areas of your brain.

434
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,810
So it's therapy.

435
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,670
So it's these magnets,
right?

436
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:03,800
Like the,
the main people in there.

437
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,450
I mean,
it's beautiful.

438
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Not Beautiful but beautiful to see 
sitting in the lobby waiting.

439
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,010
When you see people with Alzheimer's 
come in,

440
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,590
like there's a man that wheels his wife 
and every day and,

441
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,630
and you can't,
you can,

442
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,330
I think at the beginning of the week she
gets like an ivy,

443
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,460
so she's like a little bit more up and 
chipper.

444
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:23,960
But by the end of the week,
you know,

445
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:27,500
she's a little bit more slow motion and 
stories like his,

446
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:29,200
where he's talking about,
um,

447
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,160
you know,
before they started going in there,

448
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,353
she would just go to the bathroom all 
over and every day this man takes care 

449
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:37,130
of his wife,
puts her makeup on her,

450
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,400
like goes and gets her hair done even 
though she doesn't even know,

451
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,353
you know,
and now she can at least tell him that 

452
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,840
she needs to go to the bathroom.

453
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,370
Like just be like,
hey,

454
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,840
it's time,
you know,

455
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:50,100
and he can get her there and you know,
sort of,

456
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:53,670
kind of have like meaningful moments 
that they haven't had in awhile for.

457
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,773
There's a ton of veterans in there and 
active veterans to active military guys 

458
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,134
that are,
you know,

459
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,093
they're doing these door breaches and 
then they get their head rattled up too 

460
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,220
many times and they're noticing they 
have problems with some depression.

461
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,930
I mean,
and these are high level navy seals,

462
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:10,764
high level,
like,

463
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,370
like special forces that need,
um,

464
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,230
need.
They're expensive people.

465
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,083
They've,
there's millions of dollars poured into 

466
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:19,920
these people and they're not ready to 
let them go yet.

467
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,840
So they're like,
how can we fix them,

468
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,420
give them this like performance edge but
still get them like,

469
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,680
like healed enough.
But we need,

470
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,060
we need to throw them back in there and 
they,

471
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,430
we need them,
you know?

472
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,313
And so I've had to sit in on 
appointments with the Department of 

473
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,640
Defense in talk about my experience with
it.

474
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:36,660
I had to,
uh,

475
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,090
I,
I don't,

476
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,933
I don't,
there's some really famous people I 

477
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:41,094
don't even think I get to say because 
I'd be a dick and I'm to probably be in 

478
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,334
trouble,
but,

479
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,200
um,
that I've sat in on and,

480
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,020
you know,
they've had their own issues with mental

481
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:51,380
health or ptsd or,
um,

482
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,210
uh,
they're like autism,

483
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,073
different things like family members of 
theirs or whatever that I've sat in on 

484
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:58,044
and kind of been helpful in talking 
about because I went in there on two 

485
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,720
different antidepressants,
um,

486
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,270
and these,
I was put on at the Mayo Clinic and

487
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,860
felt like post the Nunez.
Yeah,

488
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,980
this is how crazy am.
I mean math is right.

489
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,950
You lose to Rhonda in 14 seconds.
You Kao Amanda Nunez.

490
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:22,130
Amanda Nunez beats the shit out of 
Rhonda and 48 seconds.

491
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,000
That's,
you might be like the perfect example.

492
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,900
Having a math,
you know and I mean crazy.

493
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,680
It's crazy.
I need you beaten down to UFC champion.

494
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,290
Well,
I mean I took,

495
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,350
it took two and a half rounds for me to,
for me to sub Pennington too.

496
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,120
You know,
like there's nothing,

497
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,340
you know,
but who is it?

498
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,300
Pennington goes toe to toe and round and
round with holly.

499
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:50,650
Holly Knox out.
Rhonda too.

500
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:52,150
Like it's just this division

501
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,840
to his fight with Ashley.
Evan Smith to this day that the ending,

502
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,200
when she got her in that bulldog choke.
Oh,

503
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,470
Robert and blood and finished her like 
literally one second.

504
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,910
It was a violent,
crazy.

505
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,510
I,
I screamed so loud at the end of that.

506
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:11,080
It was just fucking chaos.
That was,

507
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,183
she's done.
She's had two fights that ended like 

508
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:17,030
that with like one second ago.
She finishes the fight.

509
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,990
It's tough girl.
Anyway,

510
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,240
MMA math is ridiculous.
It doesn't work.

511
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,270
And you might be the best example of how
it doesn't work.

512
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,670
But,
so you go to this,

513
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,813
the,
the Mayo Clinic puts you on 

514
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:33,290
antidepressants because you just feel 
like shit.

515
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:33,810
He like

516
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,643
shit.
And because like of the different 

517
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,890
endocrine problems that I had,
right.

518
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:42,330
So I can't have any of the medications 
that'll help that.

519
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,340
So I have to be more conservative with 
it.

520
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,174
And one way they thought to do it is 
because my cortisol levels are really 

521
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:47,980
high.

522
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,130
They're talking about,
um,

523
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,010
and I mean granted I have a lot of 
stress,

524
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,110
especially like,
you know,

525
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:54,070
life hasn't been easy

526
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,450
was like,
mom,

527
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:57,850
your husband passes away.
You're in the toughest,

528
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,860
probably the toughest sport on the 
planet.

529
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,480
I'm trying to be the best at it.
So yeah.

530
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,120
So your elite,
you're in the top 10 so you're,

531
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:04,954
you're in this weird position where you 
never know when you're going to fire to 

532
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:09,340
who you're going to find is a constant 
amounts to.

533
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,380
And it's not like you're making millions
of dollars doing it either.

534
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,283
No.
Well and it's expediting healing for me 

535
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:16,400
in,
and I also have a kid going through what

536
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm going through,
so it's not like I get to like split and

537
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:20,750
cut corners and just,
you know,

538
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:23,510
it's like there's maintenance to be done
at all times with that.

539
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,940
So I go there,
they tell me,

540
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:26,774
you know,
we could probably lower your coders all 

541
00:21:27,531 --> 00:21:29,720
levels if we could load or lower your 
stress levels.

542
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,700
So we'll try it.
Antidepressants,

543
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,420
what did that make you feel like?
Flat as fuck and like I didn't,

544
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,320
am I,
can I say fuck on this?

545
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,720
Okay.
I know,

546
00:21:38,721 --> 00:21:42,680
I just didn't know if I have a quota.
How far I'm like a bad person.

547
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:45,920
Like did I get handed to like a doug?
It added to a certain level,

548
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,653
zero restrictions.
You can say whatever you want in the 

549
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,583
shit out of it.

550
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,391
Okay.
Okay.

551
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,880
So there's no one listening.
Got It.

552
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,870
Okay.
Um,

553
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:55,440
so yeah,
they,

554
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:58,160
they put me on,
they usually have flat flat,

555
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,820
which like all that training camp 
getting ready for Juliana.

556
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,800
I'm just like,
I'm like,

557
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,520
okay,
I'll,

558
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,990
it'll,
it'll take off in the fight.

559
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,824
Like,
I feel good in the fight when they say 

560
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,890
go and run the loon that no,
no ups,

561
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:11,620
no downs,
no,

562
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,880
no pissed off.
Like want to kill,

563
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:15,230
you know,
nothing,

564
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,610
you know,
and show,

565
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,920
not scared but not happy.
No.

566
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:19,754
And I was like,
why am I not nervous the way that I get 

567
00:22:21,891 --> 00:22:22,610
nervous?
Like,

568
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,800
like,
like I was okay.

569
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,500
Which usually like especially two weeks 
out,

570
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:29,660
I have this like flesh of emotions,
you know,

571
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:31,640
where I'm like,
fetal position in the corner,

572
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:34,680
like what the fuck?
And then once it's over,

573
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:36,620
all I want to do is kill,
you know.

574
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,580
But,
uh,

575
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,910
again I didn't have that either.
What kind of made me nervous because my,

576
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,590
my other friend Barb pancheck,
we,

577
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
she,
she's a new 20 fiver.

578
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,690
Um,
we would always like call each other and

579
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:49,760
laugh at how dumb we are being at that 
point.

580
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:51,260
Like,
look at me,

581
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,870
you know?
And uh,

582
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,000
but that was all gone with the,
yeah,

583
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,260
but what should,
did they put you on?

584
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,090
Um,
oh,

585
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,100
is this one?
Oh my gosh.

586
00:23:01,101 --> 00:23:03,980
So off Paxil,
keep going.

587
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,140
Um,
PROZAC.

588
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,840
What do they have?
Uh,

589
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,490
do you know what I mean?
Jamie affects her fixer,

590
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,170
the fixer and was playing stupid over 
the crazy pills twice a day.

591
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,410
Just tic tacs tries them out.
Um,

592
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,283
so,

593
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,500
so they put you on this stuff and did 
they try different ones?

594
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,860
Uh,
no,

595
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:32,460
because uh,
not a lot of time there isn't,

596
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,121
you know,
and,

597
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,470
and they're looking,
I'm like,

598
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,300
I need the side,
this side effects matter.

599
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,460
Like these can be ones that made me gain
a bunch of weight.

600
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,530
Right.
They can't make me like,

601
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,653
like I need to still be able to sleep.
Like I have to be able to have like 

602
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,010
enough highs,
lows to be able to

603
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,080
function and learn and,
and whatever.

604
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:50,870
And so this is like the best they,
they could have for me.

605
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:52,320
So anyway,
I,

606
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,620
I fight that fight with Juliana.
You know,

607
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:55,454
I,
I feel like the first round I came out 

608
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:57,770
how I wanted,
you know,

609
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,150
and then halfway through the second 
round,

610
00:23:59,151 --> 00:23:59,984
like it was just awful.
Like she had my old coaches in her 

611
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:05,534
corner.
You know what's weird about that fight 

612
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:11,831
is I could hear you and I could like I,
this is where the flat came in is like I

613
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:13,850
wasn't,
I didn't feel like I was in the fight.

614
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:18,851
Like I could see herb Dean's feet and I 
could hear you talking about us and I,

615
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:20,983
I saw like I could hear Juliana's 
coaches and it was breaking my heart 

616
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:26,204
that they were coaching against me 
because they were my Colorado gym and 

617
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:30,464
she went and trained with them and I 
know she had trained with them 

618
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,140
previously.

619
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,270
So I mean before she had taken the 
fight.

620
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:38,450
But to me it was like fucked up to here,
you know?

621
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:40,970
And it hurt me in a way,
like it's,

622
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,403
I wish I could explain it better,
but it was like I heard them and I just 

623
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:46,600
wanted to go home.
You know,

624
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,710
I look at the clock and I'm like,
kittenish just be over.

625
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,840
I don't want to go back to Colorado.
I want to move like in,

626
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,970
I literally on this side of the cage I 
had my past in Colorado,

627
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:58,280
I had these coaches,
I had the drama with that,

628
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:01,580
with that Jim,
like how everything went and,

629
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,690
and then on this side it was like all 
new problems like San Diego,

630
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,120
Eric and then we're good.
Like there was a lot of trading partners

631
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:08,811
there.
It was sunny,

632
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:12,090
it was similar to Colorado at different 
but in the right ways,

633
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,810
you know?
And it's like I just want it out

634
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,763
fight.
You were in San Diego trainer for that 

635
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:17,000
fight or no?
Yep.

636
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,980
I can't,
I just flew out for it for,

637
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,730
for the training camp.
And while you flew out there,

638
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:24,560
you were still taking the 
antidepressants and did it,

639
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,980
did that fight convince you to stop 
taking them?

640
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:27,843
Yeah.

641
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,310
Did that fight?
I went to a,

642
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:33,020
what did I do?
I think I went to the,

643
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,273
I was at the Pi,
I was working with Novinski and people 

644
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:40,760
on like what to do about that.
I even talked to Gordon and Dr.

645
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,720
Gordon.
Mark Gordon.

646
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:44,240
Yeah.
To help me with all of that too.

647
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,074
Cause he thought there was a more 
conservative way to help me with those 

648
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:50,390
issues as well.
And so I knew I was talking with him,

649
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:52,130
I had him talk to them.
Uh,

650
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,360
they were all trying to figure out a 
way,

651
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:54,500
but,
so there's like,

652
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,520
there's no ways to even just naturally 
bring you up to think about retiring.

653
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,660
Yeah.
And that,

654
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:02,450
that's the thing is the center was 
really the place that was,

655
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:03,620
is like,
okay,

656
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,620
I'm going to go here.
I've tried everything else.

657
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm going to go here and if they can't 
fix me then then I'm,

658
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,290
I'm going to have to be done.

659
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,550
How crazy is that man?
How fucking hard is Amanda Nunez hit?

660
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,930
It's nuts.
She does it like she,

661
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,450
I don't want to say she hits like a dude
cause that's kind of weird.

662
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,870
You know,
it was like a dude.

663
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,010
But uh,
yeah,

664
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:26,350
it's uh,
I remember being surprised.

665
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,860
I remember like having this open guard 
on the ground and kind of like,

666
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,940
come here,
you know,

667
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:32,740
like I dare you.
And then she hit and I was like,

668
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,050
Oh,
oh,

669
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:40,170
oh you have those.
You

670
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,360
could see the look on people's face when
she hits him,

671
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:44,240
like where you saw it Rhonda like right 
away,

672
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:44,460
right.

673
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,630
There's a part in that fight.
Cause I watched our fight after and like

674
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,273
you,
uh,

675
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,930
she hit me and it like did say I think 
it's right when it had to be when I hurt

676
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:58,080
my head cause it like drop my arm and it
dropped my neck.

677
00:26:58,081 --> 00:26:58,914
And I just remember like seeing like the
little twin eat tweety birds and I was 

678
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:04,230
pumped because I was like,
that's where the cartoons get it from.

679
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,400
Somebody explained that shit.
That's exactly where they got it.

680
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:09,000
It's like whoo.
And uh,

681
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,270
and my arm,
like I couldn't get my arm back up and I

682
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:15,120
remember listening to you and you're 
like,

683
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:17,190
cousin not intelligently defending 
herself.

684
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:18,330
I'm like,
listen Joe,

685
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,120
that fucker won't work.
You know?

686
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:24,954
And then she screwed up because she 
grabbed my knee and my knee was the one 

687
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:30,690
that was like the catalyst to all my 
problems over the last couple of years.

688
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,250
And it was just like,
don't fucking touch that.

689
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,020
And after that it was just like,
I just angry when she grabbed you in.

690
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,890
Yes.
Who's the wrong knee?

691
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,510
But I knew what she was trying to do.
Right.

692
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,770
Yeah.
So then it,

693
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,760
and then on top of that is like,
it's just,

694
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,223
I don't know,
the rest of it was just like punishing 

695
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:48,234
her.
She was Kinda like Sassy before the 

696
00:27:49,741 --> 00:27:51,960
fight anyways.
Like in awkward ways,

697
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:52,794
like not even like cool hypey ways,
like just staring at me really weird in 

698
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:56,964
a room where it was just like me and Tim
Kennedy sitting there eating like 

699
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:02,160
watermelon and stuff after weigh ins and
I look over and she's just like,

700
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,340
like staring at me all weird.
I was like,

701
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:06,300
Damn.
Tim's like,

702
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,550
dude,
what do we do?

703
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,883
I'm like,
I can throw out a plate of watermelon 

704
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:13,440
at.
I can throw a table.

705
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,260
I don't know.
I don't know what tone we're doing.

706
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,150
Wow.
When,

707
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:19,650
uh,
when you stopped her,

708
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,903
we've played the recording of you 
screaming like maybe 10 times on this 

709
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:27,024
podcast because to this day,
that is one of the Ross moments I've 

710
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:34,490
ever seen inside the octagon.
Like when you,

711
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:35,324
when you jump,
like when they stopped that fight and 

712
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:40,110
you screamed,
it was fucking bone chilling.

713
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,490
It was,
it's so,

714
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,960
I mean,
I'm sure you've heard it,

715
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,650
but that here it is right here.
Play it Jamie.

716
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,970
That's like from your genes.
That's like,

717
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,790
that's some cellular level shit.
Yeah,

718
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,290
that's intense.

719
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,350
It's relief.
It's like I didn't like,

720
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,150
like we lived,
you know,

721
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,490
like we lived,
they didn't,

722
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,100
we get to eat.
They don't,

723
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,210
and you know,
it's,

724
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,800
it's,
it's,

725
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,000
it's a relief.
It's,

726
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,520
Oh yeah,
yeah.

727
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:21,460
I mean you were,
like you said you lived,

728
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,290
cause that was,
I mean,

729
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,550
look,
it's just a fight.

730
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,410
There is a referee,
you're going to be saved.

731
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,650
But one of the things that George Saint 
Pierre said last week when he was on the

732
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:30,640
podcast,
he said,

733
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:33,790
the mentality that you go in there,
the way you fight,

734
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,650
you are a warrior.
Like you,

735
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,390
you know that you're going to be 
rescued,

736
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:38,224
but you are fighting for your life.
And when you're fighting a fucking 

737
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:46,230
killer like Amanda and you get lit up,
like you didn't survive that first round

738
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:50,380
and then go back and stop her.
That's where that comes from.

739
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:52,420
I mean that was just fucking it.
Tense.

740
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,000
Well it's the,
it's the practicality to me,

741
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,511
right?
Like,

742
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:56,231
yes,
exactly.

743
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:58,150
We have a referee,
we have cage walls,

744
00:29:58,151 --> 00:29:59,320
we have whatever,
you know,

745
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,030
fans,
it's entertaining people.

746
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:01,864
But like I need to know,
I need to know that like w that'd be a 

747
00:30:06,441 --> 00:30:07,300
nature,
you know,

748
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:09,930
that'd be doing whatever that be self 
defense that be,

749
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,900
oh fuck us fighting over a territory or 
food or whatever.

750
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:14,734
Like I need to know what would happen.
Like if we had like that's why I want 

751
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:18,394
these finishes.
We only get 15 minutes to be able to 

752
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:23,770
tell ourselves what would have happened 
in that situation.

753
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,441
You know?
And,

754
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:26,950
and when it goes to a decision,
I'm pissed cause I don't know,

755
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,630
you know,
like you don't know,

756
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,483
especially these three round fights 
where I'm waking up like these last 

757
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:33,304
couple of fights,
like late in the fight them I'm pissed 

758
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:35,854
because I'm like,
I don't know if that would have been 

759
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:40,840
another 30 minutes or another two hours 
that we're scrapping in the woods.

760
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,550
Like who gets the bone?
You know,

761
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,110
I want to know.
And,

762
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,180
and so that's us.
It's,

763
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,770
it's crazy and issue practicality and 
it's sheer survival.

764
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:49,840
And this is the way I get to know 
myself.

765
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:53,260
That's deep.
Who gets the bone?

766
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:58,030
Ooh.
Damn the way you just put it.

767
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,800
I don't think I've ever heard anybody 
put it that way.

768
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,530
You need to know.
Yeah,

769
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,770
that's intense.
But I get it.

770
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,130
I get it.
That's where that's cream comes from.

771
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,880
You got the bone.
I don't know.

772
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,000
So you go down to San Diego.
What was your short list before,

773
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,770
by the way?
I'm a huge fan of,

774
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:23,604
uh,
Eric.

775
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,683
Uh,
alliance is just one of the best camps 

776
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,650
for sure.
And I think Eric Delphia was like,

777
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:29,484
probably one of the most underrated.
And because he doesn't toot his own 

778
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:31,830
horn.
Yeah.

779
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,680
He's like in the shadows,
laid back,

780
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,860
doesn't want any intention.
She's not trying to get any attention.

781
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:41,310
Like he's the last guy to like request 
attention,

782
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,750
you know,
but super,

783
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:45,510
super knowledgeable and one of the best 
guys in a corner too.

784
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,320
Like his advice is always excellent.
I never,

785
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,780
never heard him say the wrong thing in 
the corner.

786
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:52,614
He's always like on point.
But what was your short list of places 

787
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:57,140
to go to besides the wines?

788
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,030
Um,
I went to,

789
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,430
did you go to New Mexico by?
Yes,

790
00:32:02,431 --> 00:32:06,870
but I feel like I'm not trying to walk 
in on holly and like make sure it weird.

791
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,670
Then we're going to fight each other at 
some point.

792
00:32:08,671 --> 00:32:10,200
I know.
And that just,

793
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,390
you know,
I don't want to be that guy,

794
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,550
you know?
Although I know I'm welcoming.

795
00:32:14,551 --> 00:32:16,470
I know that everyone,
there's always been nice.

796
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:18,330
I've gone and train there before and 
it's been good.

797
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,450
Um,
but it's just not a cool move,

798
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,440
you know?
Um,

799
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,650
I went down to Arizona,
um,

800
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,040
with crouch.
Loved it there.

801
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,290
Great Guy.
Yeah.

802
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,870
Great.
I feel the same way about him.

803
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,860
Same.
Yeah.

804
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,970
Very,
very,

805
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,650
very humble.
Very good.

806
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,390
Yeah.
I'm super knowledgeable too.

807
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:38,610
Huh?
I'm up in La.

808
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,160
La was cool too,
but it was a lot of that

809
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,993
driving around in the traffic and 
congestion and I couldn't sacrifice the 

810
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:47,450
like the um,
yeah.

811
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,250
Is,
is so many people here.

812
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,181
Yeah.
And,

813
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,014
and coming from Colorado and coming from
like chill out doorsy you can drive 20 

814
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:57,400
minutes and be somewhere no one's ever 
stood before too,

815
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,600
like stuck in traffic,
breathing air.

816
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:02,840
You don't want to breathe like,
like everyone's a little pissed off,

817
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:03,674
but no one really knows why people,
Jamie's Jamie's been saying this 

818
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,470
forever.
Yeah.

819
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,290
Where would you go?
Maybe Colorado.

820
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,790
So dope.
They're sailing.

821
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,090
Food culture could be better there.
I wish we could combine that food.

822
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:25,410
Culture of culture.
What do you went to?

823
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,930
I mean,
I mean,

824
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:29,600
I'm in a health food.
I mean like ethnic food.

825
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,890
I like every,
I like,

826
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,490
I like trying new stuff all the time.
I'm not very like Food Cheney,

827
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,110
you know.
I'm in a fire and meat.

828
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,790
Yeah.
Are you,

829
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:42,340
are you so good lead over fire?
Yeah,

830
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,970
so I've decided I would go for the 
steak.

831
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,040
First of all,
it's a great,

832
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:51,470
I love vegetables,
but you can get them anywhere.

833
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,800
I can get them in Colorado.
Not really.

834
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:57,020
I mean it's not exactly the produce 
capital of the world,

835
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,020
but you can get them.
Yeah.

836
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,940
It's not the best.
Just get a greenhouse,

837
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,020
grow some tomatoes on my spare time.
So,

838
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,010
um,
did you try Montreal?

839
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,760
Did you think about five star?
I,

840
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,610
I did not.
Well,

841
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:12,080
I thought about it,
but um,

842
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,540
I don't,
I didn't get up to Canadia.

843
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,540
Aye.
Aye.

844
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,530
I went to Thailand,
I went to Mexico.

845
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,650
I went to you think about going to 
Thailand.

846
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

847
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:26,060
I mean when I'm there especially,
it's like such,

848
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,690
it's a Buddhist culture.
People are so happy.

849
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,040
I mean,
then you have your shit.

850
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,510
They're just like you have everywhere 
else.

851
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:33,650
But at the same time,
like,

852
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,070
like the Moyie Thai training is good.
I know the places I would go to Jujitsu,

853
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:44,320
like the fair techs and Patios is,
is coming around in,

854
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:45,154
in pretty solid.
Like I've been considered that for this 

855
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:52,070
camp just to kind of like make some 
changes cause I really want to have that

856
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,880
influence in that like exposure to the 
authentic when we tag.

857
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:56,714
And like when I looked back at my most 
successful and most happy times after 

858
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:02,330
these three fives,
I've lost three in a row.

859
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:04,310
Like that doesn't happen.
I'm not saying,

860
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:04,911
you know what?
I'm like,

861
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:06,080
no,
I'm better than this.

862
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,943
Like something's up.
And I know there's a lot that I need to 

863
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:09,980
work on.
I mean like,

864
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,610
uh,
my,

865
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,443
uh,
my life in general and I'm doing it and 

866
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:13,544
I'm happy to be doing it and I'm happy 
to be getting the lessons even if this 

867
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:17,270
is how I have to get him.
Like fuck it.

868
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:18,830
At least I know.
So,

869
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,860
um,
I tried to look back and analyze like,

870
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:24,830
what was I doing when I was my favorite 
fighter,

871
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,550
when I was feeling the best and it was 
like very traditional,

872
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,160
thick Moitai in very traditional,
thick Jujitsu.

873
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,203
So that this camp has been something 
that I'm gonna also be outsourcing 

874
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:38,430
because I want to be like that

875
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,590
element.
So I'm doing my,

876
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,250
I'm doing an actual Moitai with John Ex.
He's uh,

877
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,750
uh,
Jeremy Stevens Moitai coach I think too.

878
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,960
And then my Jujitsu with attos.
And then,

879
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,870
cause before it was like I would do 
these separate disciplines,

880
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:52,704
put them together and drills and 
sparring and then go mango people and 

881
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:58,770
then like have fun with it.
Cause it's like these little goals I had

882
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,623
set,
like this little bucket list I would 

883
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:01,164
take into a fight with me and tried to 
pull those things off and then go learn 

884
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:07,710
new stuff and then go try to do that.
That's why I was constantly evolving.

885
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:10,230
Every fight,
even in the fight with Amanda and I like

886
00:36:10,231 --> 00:36:11,064
snapped her down and I had her by her 
head and everyone's screaming news news 

887
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,770
and like hold my beer.
And that's what I go on a throw her with

888
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:18,870
the,
you know,

889
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:20,730
the old,
they call it a ddt.

890
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,811
I,
it wasn't,

891
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:25,380
it was a freestyle headlock suplex but 
it was like,

892
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,873
like I want,
I want every fight to be different and 

893
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,360
fun,
like know what I have,

894
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,780
but see what else I got right thing and,
and that,

895
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,580
that I don't even get to play that right
now because I'm fucking up and I'm,

896
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:39,600
I'm not doing what I want in these 
fights.

897
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:40,434
So I decided to take steps backwards.
And how do you dial in training and 

898
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:45,720
training?
I,

899
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,690
I don't know it,
it's something's,

900
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,330
something's been missing and I'm 
partially wondering if it's that,

901
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,583
you know,
so like every fight I'm looking to make 

902
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:56,034
improvements and change.
Like I'm not going to ever sit here and 

903
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:59,580
say I know everything and that it's 
just,

904
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,130
I have no excuses.
Katelyn found a way to beat me,

905
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,350
you know what I mean?
Juliana found a way to beat me.

906
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,890
I kind of beat myself in that one too,
cause I let my head get into my,

907
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:10,470
you know,
and that sucked in again,

908
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,190
another thing for me to have put time in
and I'm happy I did,

909
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,500
but I mean that got me to move to San 
Diego.

910
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,630
So I mean I'm,
I'm happy for that message.

911
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,520
It costs me a lot of money to get that 
message,

912
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:21,850
but I'll take it,
you know.

913
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,550
Um,
and Caitlin,

914
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:24,810
yeah.
She found a way to beat me in,

915
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:25,644
into,
have been beaten by Jujitsu when I feel 

916
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:30,090
very accomplished in Jujitsu that like 
stung differently.

917
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,013
You know,
it's done way differently than just 

918
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,010
someone else getting their hand raised.

919
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,960
Do you feel when you're in training that
you're the same as you were before,

920
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:38,794
when you were at your best?

921
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,420
Um,
when I was at my best,

922
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,850
no,
but it's something I'm working on like I

923
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:44,684
have,
I know I have like the hangups that I 

924
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,550
have.
I know there's a ton of mental stuff,

925
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,750
you know,
one,

926
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,300
um,
just how life happened and,

927
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:54,530
and constantly having,
like,

928
00:37:54,531 --> 00:37:56,810
I had this expedited adaptation to 
training.

929
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:59,270
I had to get new coaches,
I had to find new gyms.

930
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:03,380
I had to do all of this while in grief 
and being under like,

931
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,230
like this isn't the most forgiving 
crowd,

932
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,300
you know,
like when,

933
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,010
when you're having a shit day,
definitely not the worst.

934
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,500
It's crazy.
It's crazy because it's such a,

935
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,893
like you're so exposed and you're so 
vulnerable as a fighter and the fans 

936
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:19,340
might be the meanest.

937
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,090
Well,
and yes,

938
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:21,924
there is so mean and,
but I feel like I have the best fans 

939
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:25,914
too.
Like I have the ones like the ones that 

940
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,073
are really old,
they're so ride or die and like I'm so 

941
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:31,500
proud of him.
But um,

942
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,410
like I didn't even start doing my own 
social media.

943
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,673
My,
my husband did my social media and so 

944
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,303
all of a sudden I get thrown in to 
social media and how social media works 

945
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:45,100
when I'm at my most like low vulnerable 
and all that shit.

946
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,630
I didn't know you're not supposed to,
I'm looking at it like investments,

947
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,540
right?
Like I'm like,

948
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,440
Oh,
here's the stock.

949
00:38:50,441 --> 00:38:53,590
I'm going to put money into this stock 
and let's just see how it turned out.

950
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,780
I was like,
ah.

951
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,793
And I think the first person that ever 
told me not to do that was callin like 

952
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:01,001
later.
He's like,

953
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:01,970
never read the comp,
which is,

954
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,910
what are you doing Brian?
Cal doesn't read.

955
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,290
She's,
I don't read the comments,

956
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,210
but I'm like,
well how will I know how I did?

957
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,890
He's like,
just fucking no in here.

958
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,530
Peers,
you're no,

959
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,220
you'll know from your coaches and you'll
know,

960
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,000
you'll know.

961
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,580
Well,
it's,

962
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,050
I mean it's sex when you know,
like six hours later you wrote some shit

963
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:21,470
that people are taking wrong or I mean,
it's like an opportunist situation.

964
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:23,450
They like wait for you to fuck up and 
they're like,

965
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,530
oh,
right there,

966
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:25,131
right there.
I'm like,

967
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:26,330
you know,
I didn't mean to say that.

968
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,970
Or you know what?
That's not how I meant it or whatever.

969
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:29,804
But hard

970
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,653
because everybody's text looks the same.
The tax that you would get from a holly 

971
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:36,144
Holm or someone you respect versus a 
text he get from some fat slob sitting 

972
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:42,450
there eating Cheetos,
farting into their hands.

973
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,650
The same person,
like it looks the same as on text,

974
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,083
but it's just you're going to get like 
some people that just want to hurt your 

975
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:55,350
feelings because they suck in their life
is terrible.

976
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,750
Like I've never met a hater that's doing
great.

977
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,950
Like there's no,
no,

978
00:39:58,951 --> 00:39:59,940
haters are like,
man,

979
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,740
my fucking life is awesome.
But you know what I liked doing?

980
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,220
I go on Youtube and I just go make 
comments.

981
00:40:05,221 --> 00:40:07,080
Then it just trying to hurt someone's 
feelings.

982
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,063
I just try to cut them to the bone,
just say fucked up shit about dead 

983
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:14,820
relatives and what they did wrong.
Like those people were all just losers,

984
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,280
just fucking losers,
you know?

985
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,160
I mean there's just no way around it.
That's all they are.

986
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,640
It was so foreign to me cause I mean in 
wrestling,

987
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,880
like I did wrestling,
I did soccer,

988
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,790
volleyball,
swimming.

989
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:29,630
Like I never ever heard anyone be 
discouraging.

990
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:31,160
Like no one ever came to me and was 
like,

991
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:32,330
fuck you.
You suck.

992
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,570
Yeah,
you wouldn't

993
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,590
get that in someone who was a fan or 
someone.

994
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,750
Even if someone's from an opposing team 
and like she ain't shit this.

995
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,980
They're just saying that because they 
want to beat you.

996
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,860
But the haters that you're dealing with 
online,

997
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,350
they just,
there's a lot.

998
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,150
Look,
life is fucking complicated.

999
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,180
It's hard to get right and as your 
seeing with your very difficult career,

1000
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,283
there's,
there's a lot of like decisions to be 

1001
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:00,930
made.
There's you,

1002
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:03,750
you can fuck it up.
You got to build back up again.

1003
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:04,171
Try.
Right?

1004
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:08,820
And you're a smart person who's strong 
and successful for losers.

1005
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,030
Life is impossible.
It's impossible.

1006
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,923
And so they go through life just angry 
and depressed and sad and failing at 

1007
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:18,534
everything they do.
But they still have a phone or they 

1008
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:23,700
still have a laptop and like you fucking
con flooding loser.

1009
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,560
And that's what you're getting.
That's where you're getting,

1010
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,420
you're getting all that anger.

1011
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,310
You don't even know this person.
Why are they angry at you?

1012
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,610
Because they're angry at life because 
life is fucked him in the ass.

1013
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,473
That's they're angry.
They're angry at life because they got 

1014
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:38,870
dealt a shit existence.
Right?

1015
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,990
They have bad genetics,
they have a bad family,

1016
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:44,780
they have a bad job,
they live in a bad neighborhood,

1017
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,870
they have bad people around them.
They feel bad,

1018
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,320
everything's wrong and,
but they still get to talk.

1019
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,720
They still get to talk shit and they 
still get to type things,

1020
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:55,540
type mean things out.
That's,

1021
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,250
that's why he can't read comments cause 
it's fucking hot.

1022
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,143
The only thing you could do is inspire 
with your work with you what you do and 

1023
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:04,370
you do that already,
you know,

1024
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:06,590
and you're a human being.
You're going to make mistakes and you're

1025
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:07,424
going to do things right and going to do
things wrong and you're going to have 

1026
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,064
these epic moments and you're going to 
have these failures because that's just 

1027
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:13,610
a part of like doing things that are 
complicated.

1028
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,720
But you can't read the comments.
You definitely can't take them to heart.

1029
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,520
Noted.
Yes,

1030
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:20,923
no.
Did he got me good a couple of times I 

1031
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:23,900
get,
Oh fuck up your day.

1032
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,160
I'm like,
yeah,

1033
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,430
yeah,
yeah.

1034
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:28,763
What happened?
It's sad because those people that are 

1035
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:32,830
doing that,
they're in pain.

1036
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:33,280
This is,
oh,

1037
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,810
the only reason why they would lash out 
at you like that and they go,

1038
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,000
no,
I'm just telling the truth.

1039
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,690
He just couldn't handle the truth.
Even if it was the truth.

1040
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,943
The way in which people say it and the 
reason why they're saying is because 

1041
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:48,430
they want to hurt your feelings.
They're not being kind.

1042
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,710
You know,
there's a lot of that going on today.

1043
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,580
I mean,
even then,

1044
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,983
even in the media,
the way people tell stories and write 

1045
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:58,030
stories and write articles about people,
it's like they're not,

1046
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,443
this is,
it's not just that they're trying to 

1047
00:43:01,151 --> 00:43:03,190
tell the facts and explain what's 
happening.

1048
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,730
They're trying to cut people down and 
hurt people and it's,

1049
00:43:06,731 --> 00:43:07,564
this is,
I wonder how much of it has to do with 

1050
00:43:09,431 --> 00:43:13,600
the fact that our fucking president does
that because it seems more prevalent now

1051
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:14,440
than ever before.

1052
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,430
It seems like there's like a trend and I
think a lot of like,

1053
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,060
one of the things about the president,
whoever the president is,

1054
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,670
it's like there's some people that are 
not going to listen to anything he says,

1055
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:25,504
but there's a certain amount of people 
that are going to take his actions and 

1056
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:31,250
use it as almost like a barometer.
Yeah.

1057
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:35,470
An example of how they should behave and
how this country behaves.

1058
00:43:35,471 --> 00:43:40,471
It's like he's the top dog and when the 
top dog is insulting people all the time

1059
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:43,240
and saying shitty things and holds it 
can be successful.

1060
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,150
Yeah.
It's,

1061
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,120
it lets people know there's,
or you want to get ahead.

1062
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,510
I want to get ahead.
You gotta do like him and then they,

1063
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,490
they go out and act like assholes too.
Yeah.

1064
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,260
That's a bummer.
So anyway,

1065
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,933
you go down to San Diego and what,
what are they doing for you that gets 

1066
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:01,420
you off of the antidepressants and gets 
you feeling better?

1067
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,460
Whoa.
Uh,

1068
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,610
it's again,
like you get in there and I mean it's,

1069
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,120
it's scary to go again,
like I said,

1070
00:44:07,121 --> 00:44:07,954
there's,
there's all these different people in 

1071
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:11,150
there.
I'm the man found the,

1072
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,010
the research on it by treating his own 
autistic kid.

1073
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:15,844
And,
and you can see the before and after 

1074
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:18,820
videos of this kid and it's like,
damn.

1075
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,953
Okay.
And then,

1076
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,430
um,
I brought my son into,

1077
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:25,150
cause he has adhd and he's off his 
medication now as well.

1078
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,610
So I'm going in there.
Uh,

1079
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:32,700
they do an eeg first and then they can 
tell which of your brain are firing it,

1080
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:34,910
what hurts in seeing,
um,

1081
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,490
the congruencies in like how all of that
is happening or not happening.

1082
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,480
And um,
then they kind of prescribed these,

1083
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,480
these different,
these machines like on your,

1084
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:47,130
on your brain that make,
uh,

1085
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,000
these like electric impulses,
but they're magnetic to,

1086
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,863
um,
kind of speed up or slow down the 

1087
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:54,060
different parts of your brain.

1088
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,893
So if the front of your brain is moving 
slower than the back of your brain are 

1089
00:44:57,031 --> 00:44:59,400
those or whatever.
So,

1090
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,700
um,
they're noticing obviously patterns with

1091
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:04,080
fighters,
hockey players,

1092
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:05,280
football players,
like,

1093
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,950
like people that are leading with their 
heads basically.

1094
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,810
Um,
having like,

1095
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,060
uh,
and then with the veterans that are like

1096
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:15,600
emotional things to where I mean,
and,

1097
00:45:15,601 --> 00:45:16,350
yeah.
And then like,

1098
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,020
I mean,
having to compartmentalize as well,

1099
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,770
like some of the shit they see should be
upsetting me know,

1100
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,060
and,
and,

1101
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,090
you know,
but there's,

1102
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:26,040
there's different ways that we can train
our brain to,

1103
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,443
to drop things like that.
And then ptsd is when it's an 

1104
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,430
involuntary and it all comes in and,
and that,

1105
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:33,870
so,
you know,

1106
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:37,080
I,
I've been diagnosed with PTSD.

1107
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,500
I had walked in there with medication 
because of being depressed,

1108
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,290
uh,
and the anxiety and all of that.

1109
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:45,900
Like my symptoms were terrible.

1110
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,580
And I know there are a combination of 
things,

1111
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:49,830
but even like my startle reflex,
like,

1112
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,230
you know,
I could hear someone come walking around

1113
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:52,801
the corner,
like,

1114
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:53,310
clap,
clap,

1115
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,330
clap here,
their shoes.

1116
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:55,950
But the second I'd see them,
it would,

1117
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:56,843
it would stop my heart for a second.
And that's like shit on your adrenal 

1118
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:00,810
glands,
you know,

1119
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:01,644
and,
and,

1120
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,630
um,
all this stuff was,

1121
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,820
you know,
an anxiety that,

1122
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,820
um,
I don't know,

1123
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,470
it was hard to fall asleep at night.
Uh,

1124
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:13,020
you know,
my memory was crap and this is all,

1125
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:13,943
you know,
different stuff happening in all these 

1126
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:18,120
other fighters that I know as well.
But I mean,

1127
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,480
like I said,
I've been trying things so much,

1128
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,860
so much over the past few years that I 
get excited about and either it works or

1129
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:27,240
it doesn't.
And um,

1130
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,270
the,
the point is,

1131
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:31,104
is,
is now I found this and I feel better 

1132
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:34,014
from this,
but I,

1133
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,970
I was so excited about all these other 
things.

1134
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:36,803
Like I can't just start telling 
everybody of the new thing that I've 

1135
00:46:38,691 --> 00:46:39,524
found because I've said that and been 
excited about like everything else with 

1136
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:46,080
this one,
this one's like the equal scope.

1137
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,063
It's like,
uh,

1138
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,990
it's uh,
um,

1139
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,960
same thing.
It's kind of like a tens machine or stem

1140
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:53,070
machine,
but like a super,

1141
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:56,130
super low frequency and that's bad ass 
to like it,

1142
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,320
it helped on injuries.
Like,

1143
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,360
you know,
if I rolled my ankle or hurt my toe,

1144
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:03,120
like you could bring the swelling down 
from this to,

1145
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,313
to normal essentially in like an hour 
and a half just working on with this 

1146
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,060
like tens unit on it.
And,

1147
00:47:09,061 --> 00:47:09,894
and I mean,
they originally used it for race horses 

1148
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:13,470
and,
and for,

1149
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,140
you know,
super expensive million dollar horses,

1150
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:19,980
like the equipment they brought over,
it was like 90 grand and like,

1151
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,173
like these really specific like special 
metals that were put into these plates 

1152
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:26,910
and you know,
they do stuff like that.

1153
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,743
But that wasn't working on my head.
It was working injuries and it was 

1154
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:31,270
working on,
um,

1155
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:35,920
I want to say it helped with like my,
like digestive system maybe or my,

1156
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,720
um,
uh,

1157
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,423
I don't remember some,
some other things it was helping with 

1158
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:42,574
too,
but what,

1159
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:43,623
you know,
I,

1160
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,210
I started doing that,
um,

1161
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,143
or I was doing that when I walked into 
mindset and started doing that 

1162
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:50,160
treatment.
And so what do they do it?

1163
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,690
So you sit in a chair,
you know,

1164
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:53,524
and they ha they put this prescription 
in this machine and the machine has 

1165
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:57,243
kinda got like a,
like a arm that goes on in a specific 

1166
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:02,440
part of your brain and you,
you know,

1167
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:04,030
you close your eyes and it sends us 
these,

1168
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:08,320
these magnetic pulses into your head.
And I mean,

1169
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:09,154
you don't feel anything.
It's almost like you can hear what it 

1170
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,310
feels like,
but I don't know how to describe it.

1171
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,540
It's,
it's a sense,

1172
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,520
it's essential,
but it's not,

1173
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,950
it's not exactly hearing and it's not 
exactly feeling.

1174
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,830
Um,
yeah.

1175
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,820
And I mean you,
you,

1176
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,550
you leave the place after your 
treatment.

1177
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:28,810
Like I go,
I would go twice a day.

1178
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:29,644
It's 45 minutes away both ways.
So I am driving a lot everyday to go to 

1179
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:38,740
do this cause I want to give it a fair 
shot to do it every day.

1180
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,753
I do everyday,
I haven't gone these past couple of 

1181
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,080
weeks cause uh,
stuff with my kids.

1182
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:44,973
Uh,
scheduled school's almost out and then 

1183
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:49,000
wanting to try out different things with
different coaches.

1184
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:51,130
Uh,
as far as these new disciplines go.

1185
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,800
So I haven't been there as much.
But um,

1186
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:58,890
yeah,
for the last was August I believe is,

1187
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,960
is when I was like really,
really getting into it and go on twice a

1188
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:03,370
day,
45 minutes each way.

1189
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,210
Twice a day.

1190
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,350
Twice a day.
Yeah.

1191
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,980
So you would,
you would spend 45 minutes one way,

1192
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:14,140
one way and then go back again.
Just fucking move closer to where the,

1193
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,200
because the alliance was down there.
And so I would,

1194
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,670
I would drop my kid off at school,
I would run,

1195
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,370
and then I would go there.
I would do my treatment.

1196
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,160
I go back to practice down in southern 
San Diego,

1197
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,233
then I'd get my son,
and then we'd go up there for the 

1198
00:49:30,221 --> 00:49:33,390
afternoon session and then I'd come back
down and,

1199
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:35,800
and we'd go to his sports.
And then I'd have my second two a day.

1200
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,620
That does not leave a lot of free time 
for cats and Ghana.

1201
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,430
Oh Hell No.
Oh Hell No.

1202
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,720
Just that alone can be stressful.
But I was seeing the results.

1203
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,910
That was the crazy thing is I was 
feeling better.

1204
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,810
Well,
the results when I just walked in like,

1205
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,780
like God,
like I couldn't sleep.

1206
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:57,430
I had just,
uh,

1207
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:59,080
anxiety.
Like I had that,

1208
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,590
that startle effect going like the,
um,

1209
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,500
my memory was shit.
And these were all things that I went to

1210
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,080
the UFC pie to talk to them about 
because I'm like,

1211
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,600
I don't know what to do.
Like I,

1212
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,750
I want to fight.
They offered me to fight Chris Cyborg at

1213
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:17,090
one 45 and I was like,
yeah.

1214
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:17,800
And I was like,
well,

1215
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,180
like hell yeah,
let's take that.

1216
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:20,014
But like,
can you guys at least help me get this 

1217
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:22,750
shit figured out first please.
You know?

1218
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,583
And they're like,
sure.

1219
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,720
Um,
so Dunkin French,

1220
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:27,980
he's at the,
the,

1221
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:28,750
he's,
he's,

1222
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,583
he's,
so he went to college and t and was 

1223
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:32,031
that,
oh no,

1224
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:35,630
he was at Notre Dame using this 
treatment with the doctor.

1225
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,680
I'm Kevin Murphy that runs the mindset.
So,

1226
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,270
uh,
he was like,

1227
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:44,330
this guy is doing a lot of things with 
people as far as brain health.

1228
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:45,164
He's like,
go see them when you get back to San 

1229
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,050
Diego,
it's kind of far from you,

1230
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:49,430
but like give it a shot,
Kat.

1231
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,770
And I called the guy,
I'm on the phone,

1232
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,980
super frustrated,
like super like emotional.

1233
00:50:54,981 --> 00:50:55,950
I'm like,
I'm,

1234
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:56,803
I'm at my wit's end.
Like I've tried everything I can think 

1235
00:50:58,401 --> 00:51:01,730
of like holistic views,
like chemical views,

1236
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:03,200
this like everything.
I mean,

1237
00:51:03,201 --> 00:51:04,034
spending money out of my pocket trying 
to figure this out because none of this 

1238
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,080
is covered by the UFC.
Especially because,

1239
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,220
you know,
not something I claimed in a fight.

1240
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:11,480
I mean,
I thought Amanda,

1241
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,880
and if you don't claim that stuff within
the 30 days,

1242
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:15,980
like you're on your own.
And of course my head her,

1243
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,260
of course I'm dizzy.
Of course the lights are bright.

1244
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:19,670
Of course,
I can't think.

1245
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:20,630
Right.
I got in a fist fight,

1246
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,673
you know,
and I wasn't doing good in it for 

1247
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:23,930
awhile,
so I,

1248
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,400
I figured,
you know,

1249
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:28,220
but then a month and a half,
two months out when I wasn't better.

1250
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,713
It's like

1251
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,973
sure.
Even though it clearly came from that 

1252
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:34,650
fight,
you still don't get covered.

1253
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,910
[inaudible] what not one.
It's endocrine stuff too,

1254
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,400
you know?
And it's like there's very,

1255
00:51:40,401 --> 00:51:41,234
there's like

1256
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,910
how could they dispute that?
That's where it came from.

1257
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:44,820
Now you go,
hey,

1258
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,913
sit down.
I want you to watch something and just 

1259
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:49,190
play that first round.
Go,

1260
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:51,740
what the fuck do you think happened?
I don't know.

1261
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,690
But I mean if you play that video for 
them,

1262
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:54,524
if any,
anybody in the insurance business was 

1263
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,650
denying you coverage,
saying that didn't happen while you were

1264
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,350
under the banner of the UFC.
Like you're out of your fucking mind.

1265
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:04,463
Watch that video.
What do you think is happening while 

1266
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:09,920
this fucking assassin is throwing bombs 
at your face?

1267
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,940
I mean that's it.
That is crazy that that's not covered.

1268
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,890
Yeah,
that makes me sick.

1269
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,140
Oh,
it's frustrating cause bye bye.

1270
00:52:18,141 --> 00:52:23,090
Like literally you look at the papers 
like it costs me more to fight then,

1271
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,590
then it,
then I make

1272
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,553
makes sense.
If it was dealing with a broken hand or 

1273
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:30,860
a torn ligament or something like that,
it might make sense.

1274
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:31,694
And Mike,
it does not make any fucking sense if 

1275
00:52:34,061 --> 00:52:34,894
you're talking about brain injuries 
cause anybody who understands how brain 

1276
00:52:37,511 --> 00:52:38,344
injuries work know that there's,
there's a considerable amount of time 

1277
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,363
after a fight where you still are 
suffering from symptoms and you might 

1278
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:47,380
decide 30 days later,
60 days later,

1279
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:49,060
90 days later you got to do something 
about it.

1280
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,950
Right.
Well I mean now I know how I come out of

1281
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:53,510
a fight and I'm like,
my pinky hurts,

1282
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:55,100
my elbow hurts,
my hair hurts,

1283
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:58,700
my eyebrow hurt.
It's like when a claim all of this,

1284
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:00,470
you know,
because before I was just being tough,

1285
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:02,740
you know,
I'm fine with fuck it dude,

1286
00:53:02,741 --> 00:53:04,700
this is why it's so crazy and I didn't 
like,

1287
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:06,860
I didn't get it and I didn't know and 
then,

1288
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:07,823
but they should know if they're in the,
they're in the business of insuring 

1289
00:53:10,081 --> 00:53:10,914
fighters.
They should have a larger window where 

1290
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:16,140
people can claim head injuries we talked
about

1291
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,253
that's,
I mean it kind of goes together with 

1292
00:53:18,581 --> 00:53:22,030
like any kind of,
any kind of mental,

1293
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:23,380
anything.
Like any,

1294
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:25,830
you talk about mental illness,
you talk about head injuries,

1295
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:28,530
you talked about Tbi.
It all goes into that stigma of like you

1296
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:30,270
can't see it,
so it must not be real.

1297
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,710
You know what I mean?
Or,

1298
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:33,270
or whatever.
So it's like,

1299
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,540
but that's the head injury business 
basically.

1300
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:37,374
Yeah.
The point is to make them drop and be 

1301
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:40,080
done.

1302
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:41,580
That's what everybody,
I mean it's not,

1303
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,460
it's not the worst thing in the world.
The wind with a body kick or an arm bar.

1304
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:45,294
But the reality is what people like is 
to see head injuries were in the head 

1305
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:49,860
injury business.
You know?

1306
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

1307
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:56,750
So how long after you starting with this
treatment do you start to see results?

1308
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,533
So the first,
I would say the first thing I noticed 

1309
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,330
was my motor skills in practice.
And so,

1310
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:06,500
you know,
I would go,

1311
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,690
so you think your motor skills were 
impaired?

1312
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:09,640
No,
I,

1313
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,590
well I just feel like I had a block.
Like I said,

1314
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,690
it's,
it was comical enemy.

1315
00:54:13,691 --> 00:54:16,990
You can even ask them at alliance.
And it was funny,

1316
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,910
it was funny,
but not to have like we're in class,

1317
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,230
you know,
we're learning,

1318
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:27,700
I'm watching the coaches,
like they do a drill and they explain it

1319
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:28,840
and they look up.
All right,

1320
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:30,070
everybody ready?
Ready?

1321
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:30,521
One,
two,

1322
00:54:30,521 --> 00:54:31,354
three go.
And we clap and I have no fucking idea 

1323
00:54:33,341 --> 00:54:34,570
what we're doing.
You know,

1324
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,633
like we walk off and I'm like,
like there was even a couple of times 

1325
00:54:38,741 --> 00:54:40,000
where like they clap,
they,

1326
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,480
they're like,
Kat,

1327
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,950
what are we doing?
And I'm like,

1328
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,550
um,
three kick.

1329
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,660
And they're like,
no,

1330
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,100
20 pushups.
And I'm like,

1331
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,180
man,
I'm not even like,

1332
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,340
I'm not just a bad kid like talking and 
like,

1333
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,530
no,
like I'm in trouble because I'm,

1334
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:55,343
I don't hear you.

1335
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,600
I can not lose eye contact the whole 
time.

1336
00:54:58,601 --> 00:55:01,960
Like sit here and I'm like focused,
but no,

1337
00:55:01,961 --> 00:55:05,920
I'm not retaining it and less like if it
has to be the last thing that they do.

1338
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:09,430
Like we can't talk about shit if,
if,

1339
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,850
if it's the last thing I see I can go do
it or I could go do it.

1340
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,500
But if they're like,
all right,

1341
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,453
and then they explained some philosophy 
about it or do some movement or 

1342
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:20,620
whatever,
like then I lose what we're doing.

1343
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,660
Like my,
my mind would just go right to something

1344
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:23,494
else.
Like I had a very hard time 

1345
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:27,540
concentrating and you know,
it's,

1346
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,680
it's crazy because when I got to this 
facility,

1347
00:55:29,681 --> 00:55:30,910
you know,
I didn't know,

1348
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,190
I didn't necessarily know what I was 
walking into,

1349
00:55:33,191 --> 00:55:34,024
but they have,
you do this questionnaire and like on 

1350
00:55:35,741 --> 00:55:38,050
this questionnaire is like all of these 
things.

1351
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:38,883
I'm like,
that's part of something like me not 

1352
00:55:39,731 --> 00:55:41,530
being able to focus as part of something
my sleep,

1353
00:55:41,531 --> 00:55:44,200
that's part of something.
This startle effect is part of something

1354
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:45,034
like me having these like completely 
like specific things that are all on 

1355
00:55:48,881 --> 00:55:49,714
this was like damn okay.
Like I didn't even want to see the eeg 

1356
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,160
because I was,
I was scared.

1357
00:55:54,161 --> 00:55:54,994
You know,
I was like,

1358
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:55,923
what if you can't fix me and now I know 
all the shit that's wrong with me like 

1359
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,230
that.
That sucks.

1360
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,303
But then you know,
they show you different egs and they 

1361
00:56:02,111 --> 00:56:02,944
show you the,
they take it every single week and so 

1362
00:56:04,991 --> 00:56:05,824
you actually get to see it and you get 
to see the level that you were 

1363
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:09,034
functioning at,
especially the different parts of your 

1364
00:56:10,391 --> 00:56:11,224
brain.
But then,

1365
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:14,410
and the thing is that's awesome about 
this is you get to keep the results.

1366
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:18,850
Like unless you go do exactly what you 
did and go fuck it up again,

1367
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,120
you get to keep it.
It's not like this maintenance package,

1368
00:56:22,121 --> 00:56:23,350
which is,
you know,

1369
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:25,900
a problem for these pharmaceutical 
companies.

1370
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:26,734
There's,
there's,

1371
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,633
there's not a whole lot of retention on 
it because once people get their brains 

1372
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:31,774
functioning,
as long as you're not sitting there 

1373
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,410
hitting your head against the wall,
like you get to keep feeling better.

1374
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,230
Like these,
these veterans get to go back to,

1375
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,513
to combat or whatever it is,
their job is like we fighters get to go 

1376
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:44,710
back,
football players get to go back.

1377
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:46,690
Like I,
I sat in with the chargers,

1378
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,540
uh,
medical staff and talked about our stuff

1379
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:50,230
there as well.
I,

1380
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,480
I,
I don't even remember who else there was

1381
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:57,690
people from all over the country coming 
in asking about this,

1382
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,491
you know,
and,

1383
00:56:58,491 --> 00:56:59,670
and needing to sit in and,
and,

1384
00:56:59,671 --> 00:57:01,960
and they're looking at these is in 
particular.

1385
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:06,230
So what is it doing?
Like how was it fixing it?

1386
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,110
So one,
um,

1387
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:09,550
I think it,
you know,

1388
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,970
there's something with what goes on in 
your brain with,

1389
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,480
with the thyroid stuff,
with the endocrine stuff is like getting

1390
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:18,640
your damage to your hypothalamus.
Right?

1391
00:57:18,641 --> 00:57:19,474
And that's like,
that kind of directs all of the 

1392
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:25,360
information that goes to your thyroid,
your thyroid,

1393
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:26,194
you know,
then sends out everything to your body 

1394
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:29,320
in there when there's like a disconnect 
there.

1395
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,391
Um,
no,

1396
00:57:30,391 --> 00:57:32,800
it was just screws everything up.
And then on top of it,

1397
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:36,580
like now that we're cutting the same way
that we've always had to cut,

1398
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,560
but we don't get ivs.
I mean,

1399
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,483
I mean you,
you cannot 100% rehydrate your brain 

1400
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,463
within 45 or 48 hours.
Like you can get your body decently 

1401
00:57:47,951 --> 00:57:49,000
hydrated,
I believe,

1402
00:57:49,001 --> 00:57:51,100
but your brain is just,
it's its own thing,

1403
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,700
you know?

1404
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,533
And so now we don't have ivs are 
hydraulic system in our brain is down 

1405
00:57:55,691 --> 00:57:58,900
and now we're rattling it even more like
dehydrated.

1406
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,260
I mean,
we're just going to have,

1407
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,890
you know,
bigger side effects,

1408
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:05,050
uh,
tire brains being dehydrated that now,

1409
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:06,543
um,
the damage that comes to the 

1410
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:10,150
hypothalamus to the pituitary,
to the,

1411
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,620
um,
your thyroid,

1412
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,870
all of that that goes on there like 
that.

1413
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,090
They're,
they're saying that you can,

1414
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,750
you can get it firing back at a level 
that it was before it got hurt.

1415
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:20,584
Like,
as long as the cells are still alive in 

1416
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:24,040
it,
they can reenergize those cells.

1417
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:26,670
Now if you have like just a dead party 
or brain,

1418
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,630
you know,
they're not bringing it back to life,

1419
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,493
but they can um,
use these magnets to kind of fluff on 

1420
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,050
backup,
give them back their energy,

1421
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:37,810
their,
their life and put in a,

1422
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,183
put them back into a functional way that
was something similar to you at your 

1423
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:45,090
healthiest and,
and make it,

1424
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,920
I mean not more or less durable just 
back,

1425
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:48,760
right?

1426
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,111
Yeah.
When you,

1427
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:52,080
when you were saying motor skills,
like what was wrong?

1428
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,890
Cause that's one of the things that they
see in fighters that have taken too many

1429
00:58:55,891 --> 00:58:58,200
shots.
They start having the,

1430
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,800
they analyze fighters,
gates and one of the things that happens

1431
00:59:01,801 --> 00:59:04,360
is your legs get closer together.
Um,

1432
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,300
your,
your balance is off your,

1433
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:10,440
your steps are shorter.
You don't have that sort of like dynamic

1434
00:59:10,441 --> 00:59:12,840
fluid motion to your body and you're 
having a heart,

1435
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,000
a harder time with balance and just 
motor skill.

1436
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,140
Totally.
So how I felt before going into there,

1437
00:59:19,141 --> 00:59:21,740
it was all I had was a gas pedal.
I was like,

1438
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,120
just will,
you know,

1439
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,430
and just fuck them.
You know,

1440
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,264
just cause I,
I wasn't reading patterns of people 

1441
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,984
anymore.
Like if someone leans this way a little 

1442
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:32,541
bit,
I'm like,

1443
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:32,931
oh,
okay,

1444
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:33,764
I know what you're thinking.
Like if they set this way or that way 

1445
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,000
and,
and even meet juking them in like China,

1446
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:40,660
like faint at them.
Like I,

1447
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,583
I wasn't,
I couldn't even see the reaction I was 

1448
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:43,934
making them make,
like I knew what motions in my muscular 

1449
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,263
memory to make them do,
but it was like I wasn't getting the 

1450
00:59:49,701 --> 00:59:51,800
feedback because it,
it just like wasn't,

1451
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:54,230
so that was one of the first things I 
noticed was,

1452
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:56,150
you know,
going back into practice and,

1453
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,660
and watching people's angles and beating
them to it and,

1454
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:01,040
and,
and like remembering,

1455
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:01,491
I'm like,
damn,

1456
01:00:01,491 --> 01:00:02,324
I don't just have to shoot to shoot.
Like I can wait and do it when it's at 

1457
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:09,500
the right time or I can even like,
like take advantage of,

1458
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,070
of the fact that,
you know,

1459
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,350
I'm making them step back or I can flash
fire and they're facing and jump on them

1460
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:17,570
at their knee jerk reaction.
You know,

1461
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:18,404
like these things of like being able to 
manipulate the situation and make them 

1462
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:22,424
adjust to me.
Like I could see that again and I could 

1463
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:26,870
see.
Would you seen before?

1464
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:29,830
Like when I just had go,
all I had was good

1465
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,113
when you didn't see movement,
like say if someone was going to spin 

1466
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,990
and they're like reload it up their 
hips.

1467
01:00:34,991 --> 01:00:35,771
You didn't see that?
No,

1468
01:00:35,771 --> 01:00:38,050
it's just hit hit him first.
What were you seeing?

1469
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,450
I all,
I didn't,

1470
01:00:39,451 --> 01:00:43,950
all I saw was get their first,
all I saw was like closed the distance.

1471
01:00:43,951 --> 01:00:44,784
Don't get hit in the head.
Like make like get down and get low and 

1472
01:00:48,481 --> 01:00:50,820
just be a linebacker,
you know?

1473
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,160
And,
and hit him because I,

1474
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:55,170
I knew I wasn't seeing that stuff and 
the more I tried to see it,

1475
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,330
the more I would just sit there and wear
it.

1476
01:00:57,331 --> 01:00:58,770
Cause I'm like any minute now.
I mean,

1477
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,050
any minute now I'm going to,
I'm going to catch the pattern,

1478
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,760
I'm going to catch the pattern.
But it wasn't,

1479
01:01:02,761 --> 01:01:04,950
then it wasn't popping up.
So then all I had,

1480
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,920
you'd have,
you were just like super light sparring,

1481
01:01:07,921 --> 01:01:09,540
just moving around.
You didn't see it?

1482
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:12,320
No.
No,

1483
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,130
not really.
No.

1484
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:14,090
Wow.
Yeah.

1485
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,500
That's fucking terrified.
I was like,

1486
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:17,060
yeah,
it was really scary.

1487
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:21,170
And like even I even get to like a good 
position in Jujitsu and I'd be like,

1488
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:23,420
I know I know stuff here.
I know I know stuff here.

1489
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,920
But she didn't know what to do.
What was it?

1490
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:25,671
What was it?
What was it?

1491
01:01:25,671 --> 01:01:26,510
I know,
I know stuff,

1492
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,820
you know?
But like it wasn't like,

1493
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:33,260
especially with adrenaline firing,
like it wasn't just happening for me.

1494
01:01:33,261 --> 01:01:35,540
And so like three,
four weeks into that,

1495
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,840
all of a sudden like that fog was 
starting to go down a bit.

1496
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,060
Right.
And like part of it was,

1497
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:43,550
and then,
and then I'm also sleeping better

1498
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,310
to goal before,
like during like the first week.

1499
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,193
Oh yeah.
Cause every fucking person I went to 

1500
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:49,790
could fix me.
Right.

1501
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,860
And you drive in 45 minutes,
like what the fuck?

1502
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:53,220
Yeah.
Eh,

1503
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:55,450
yeah,
it in a,

1504
01:01:55,451 --> 01:01:57,310
in a,
in a car I leased.

1505
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:00,570
So all those miles that,
you know,

1506
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:02,890
it's like damn.
And um,

1507
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,440
it's uh,
it was super frustrating.

1508
01:02:05,441 --> 01:02:06,820
Yes,
everyone can fix me,

1509
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,680
everyone can fix me.
And then they don't.

1510
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:09,514
And then my heart's broken again and 
then I go to the next one and then my 

1511
01:02:11,321 --> 01:02:12,940
heart's broken again and then it,
and then the next one.

1512
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:14,620
So this one I'm like,
I'm like,

1513
01:02:14,621 --> 01:02:18,850
I'm not even going to tell people about 
this because I'm sick of fucking hitting

1514
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:21,840
up and being excited about it and 
telling them to come with me and then it

1515
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:23,490
doesn't work.
And then I'm that guy again,

1516
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,010
you know?
And so going into this and then watching

1517
01:02:26,011 --> 01:02:26,844
it work and then seeing all the other 
people that was working for in there 

1518
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:31,230
that,
and they were never trying to push me to

1519
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:32,700
promote it.
They were like,

1520
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,290
just come in,
just get here.

1521
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,380
You know?
And if you like it then till the,

1522
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,243
cause the UFC was talking about getting 
one of the machines at the Pi and 

1523
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:45,000
they're kind of going to have me be like
a Guinea pig for it.

1524
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,640
Ian Mccall went in there too,
but it didn't like he,

1525
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:48,923
he was doing his own kind of other stuff
that was making it so it wasn't working 

1526
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:54,840
for him,
but like I was all in,

1527
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:55,770
you know,

1528
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:57,250
was making it so it wasn't working.

1529
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,050
I don't think he was coming in often.
So I think,

1530
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,270
and the thing is is that it does stir 
shit up,

1531
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,770
right?
So like they,

1532
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:05,690
they,
they mess with your,

1533
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,683
the the levels because again,
they have to like the back of your 

1534
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:11,840
brain's running at four hertz and,
and okay,

1535
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,210
eight is technically where like you're 
sleeping,

1536
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:15,044
you're at rest like year,
there's part of your brains that could 

1537
01:03:16,431 --> 01:03:18,800
be under your resting hurts,
right?

1538
01:03:18,801 --> 01:03:23,630
While the front of your brain is running
at 12 so that's like high anxiety,

1539
01:03:23,631 --> 01:03:28,310
but like low energy and they can,
they can almost tell you how you've been

1540
01:03:28,311 --> 01:03:31,100
feeling lately,
which was like nuts to me.

1541
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,430
Right.
And you could,

1542
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,530
they can tell,
you know,

1543
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:34,650
because of this and this,
that,

1544
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:35,484
that you have some ocd tendencies versus
this person constantly feels like they 

1545
01:03:39,471 --> 01:03:40,304
have no energy in their memory,
isn't working in their emotionally and 

1546
01:03:42,501 --> 01:03:45,530
capable of like being in,
you know,

1547
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,660
being a positive force in a relationship
right now.

1548
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:49,400
Cause I don't have it so they could read
it.

1549
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,790
You should.
You should.

1550
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:54,290
You should.
It's scary though.

1551
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:56,210
Cause I cute when you see that like 
little like,

1552
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:57,710
and they're like,
what's that?

1553
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,850
It's for me.
It's,

1554
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,560
that's a two hour drive.
Shit.

1555
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,970
Yeah,
I know that there,

1556
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,560
I don't know if they have anything up 
here.

1557
01:04:03,561 --> 01:04:05,990
I know that they have a bunch all over.

1558
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:07,890
It's called,
I couldn't,

1559
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:08,733
the website's not coming up at this 
personalized repetitive transcranial 

1560
01:04:11,411 --> 01:04:12,244
magnetic stimulation,
a noninvasive therapeutic approach to 

1561
01:04:14,861 --> 01:04:18,520
the treatment of Ptsd and other neuro 
neurocognitive disorders.

1562
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,200
Kevin,
Tim Murphy,

1563
01:04:20,201 --> 01:04:21,340
MD,
Vice Chair,

1564
01:04:21,341 --> 01:04:24,280
department of Radiation Medicine,
applied sciences,

1565
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:29,110
Uc San Diego Director,
Pediatric Radiation Oncology Program.

1566
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:30,910
Uh,
rady children's hospital,

1567
01:04:30,911 --> 01:04:32,140
San Diego.
Wow.

1568
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah.
So that's where you're going.

1569
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,470
And,
um,

1570
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:37,383
I mean obviously during this whole thing
you have to be questioning what you do 

1571
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:41,330
for a living.
Oh yeah.

1572
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:42,171
Well,
and it's like,

1573
01:04:42,171 --> 01:04:43,760
okay,
so they can fix this.

1574
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,330
Say they fix it and then I go do it 
again.

1575
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,020
You know

1576
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:48,950
Cyborg,
right.

1577
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,053
I mean you were,
you were thinking about fixing it and 

1578
01:04:51,411 --> 01:04:52,244
you,
you were going from one girl who hits 

1579
01:04:54,531 --> 01:04:57,830
like a dude to another girl who might 
hit like a bigger dude.

1580
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,220
Yeah.
I mean cyborgs fucking terrified.

1581
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,350
And it's like I know healthy at my 
healthiest,

1582
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,090
like no,
no problem.

1583
01:05:05,091 --> 01:05:07,640
I believe that like,
I believe in myself like that.

1584
01:05:07,641 --> 01:05:08,474
Like I can figure them out,
especially in find a way to not get hit 

1585
01:05:11,811 --> 01:05:15,110
doing it.
Like I didn't get hit in my mma career,

1586
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:15,944
significant a hit,
not one significant significant hit and 

1587
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:19,594
tell Amanda.
And then after that I was getting 

1588
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:22,360
fucking lit up.
Right.

1589
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:23,980
And,
and not even,

1590
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:24,814
not even Juliana,
like she kind of opened him bitch slap 

1591
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:31,780
me a little bit from the sides but I and
but like I can find a way to,

1592
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,420
to like still control it enough to be 
like,

1593
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,990
like very effective without taking too 
much damage.

1594
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:40,870
But like that,
that slow of my,

1595
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:43,360
my motor skills,
my mechanics,

1596
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:44,680
it was,
it was really bothering me.

1597
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:46,930
And that's not how you go fight someone 
like Cyborg.

1598
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:49,750
You don't go in there with that weight 
in your pocket.

1599
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:50,230
You know,

1600
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:53,650
it's so important that you're talking 
about this because this is a,

1601
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:57,850
this is such a factor that we don't see 
on the outside.

1602
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:58,990
Other people,
you know,

1603
01:05:58,991 --> 01:06:00,520
other people.
Then the people that are really close to

1604
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:04,060
the talk to about these things.
Like if we were seeing you fight and you

1605
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:04,894
know,
when we see the decline of certain 

1606
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:07,301
fighters,
you know,

1607
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:08,800
you see certain fighters,
they,

1608
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:12,040
they're in a couple of really hard 
fights and then you see a decline,

1609
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:14,800
like a real obvious decline and their 
skills and their abilities.

1610
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:16,203
Very,
very rarely are they opening up about 

1611
01:06:18,011 --> 01:06:20,800
what's going on,
about losing memory,

1612
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:24,040
about not being able to see patterns and
people about not,

1613
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:28,210
not having their motor skills in tune 
anymore that things are off.

1614
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,610
You know,
so you talking about this I think is,

1615
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:34,840
it's so important and it's so important 
for young fighters to recognize like,

1616
01:06:34,841 --> 01:06:37,000
Hey,
this is also on the table.

1617
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:41,680
Like here's a great therapy for it.
But this is also a possibility of,

1618
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:42,543
you know,
if you do fight a fucking killer like 

1619
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:45,274
Amanda Nunez,
this is one of the things that can 

1620
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:47,350
happen to you.

1621
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:50,520
Well,
and it's partially because I have man,

1622
01:06:50,521 --> 01:06:51,630
I have teammates.
Yeah.

1623
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:55,140
I have people that are 10 times worse 
than me that are just like,

1624
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,950
I mean the stuff I hear,
the stuff I see,

1625
01:06:58,951 --> 01:06:59,784
it's,
it's sad and it's scary and they have 

1626
01:07:00,961 --> 01:07:03,570
kids and they're not going anywhere 
soon.

1627
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,460
You know what I mean?
And they're passing their Mris.

1628
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,230
Right.
You know what I mean?

1629
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,220
Like

1630
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:10,380
their Mris.
Cause what does the MRI really see?

1631
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,870
I don't know.
I don't know.

1632
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:13,853
But if they went to this place and got 
all their brain mapped out and find out 

1633
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:19,734
how everything is firing,
it might be a completely different 

1634
01:07:21,331 --> 01:07:22,164
result.
Like we might be retiring people way 

1635
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:24,624
earlier,
at least forcing them into therapy way 

1636
01:07:26,281 --> 01:07:28,020
earlier.
It's possible.

1637
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:29,183
And I mean in that,
and that's the thing is it's like the 

1638
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:33,990
risk needs to be worth the reward and,
and you know,

1639
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:35,063
like right now in this sport it's a 
juvenile and it's not getting us like 

1640
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:42,550
this kind of like,
like I,

1641
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:43,423
I can't afford to take another two years
off because I went and I fought cyborg 

1642
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:49,470
while I'm sick and something bad happens
to me.

1643
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,900
You know what I mean?
Like I want to be sharp and if,

1644
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:52,734
and if that means I have to take time,
take the time I took off off and get 

1645
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,740
healthy and do all of these different 
therapies,

1646
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,740
the conservative,
traditional and nontraditional,

1647
01:08:01,741 --> 01:08:04,560
like all of that.
And so I can feel the way I feel now and

1648
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:07,140
the like,
I'm pumped and I'm excited.

1649
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:08,183
But like that is something that I really
want to know that people know they can 

1650
01:08:13,411 --> 01:08:14,190
go do.

1651
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:17,120
And it's not vulnerable.
It's not saying you're weak,

1652
01:08:17,121 --> 01:08:18,850
it's not something wrong with you.
Like,

1653
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:23,810
like it's your health and your longevity
and your future because that shit,

1654
01:08:23,811 --> 01:08:26,300
if you don't treat it,
it doesn't get better.

1655
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,610
And like you don't understand the 
depression,

1656
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:29,444
you don't understand like,
and there's an identity that goes away 

1657
01:08:31,611 --> 01:08:35,330
with the seeming like you failed or you 
can't do it anymore or whatever.

1658
01:08:35,331 --> 01:08:36,164
Like that,
that mental health aspect that comes 

1659
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:38,954
with the physical health of your brain,
like that all that all needs to all 

1660
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,610
needs to be more educated as far as,
as these fighters go.

1661
01:08:46,611 --> 01:08:47,720
As far as all of it goes.
Like,

1662
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:50,510
I'm happy to be the Guinea pig because 
I'm damn,

1663
01:08:50,511 --> 01:08:52,040
I just want to see everybody.
Okay.

1664
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:52,874
You know?

1665
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,930
Well,
I'm happy that you're talking about it,

1666
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:56,130
but it's,
um,

1667
01:08:56,610 --> 01:08:58,320
it's been something that,
you know,

1668
01:08:58,321 --> 01:09:01,300
I've talked about quite a bit and um,
the,

1669
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:03,570
the,
the real problems behind traumatic brain

1670
01:09:03,571 --> 01:09:04,404
injuries because I've had a bunch of 
experts and I've talked to a bunch of 

1671
01:09:06,901 --> 01:09:07,734
neurologists and I've talked to 
neuroscientists and people that are 

1672
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:15,650
really studying this stuff and um,
I've been real vocal about it and it's,

1673
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,530
it's a tricky situation because 
obviously I'm a commentator,

1674
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,393
but like when someone gets knocked out,
I'm very vocal about them taking a long 

1675
01:09:24,271 --> 01:09:25,104
time off.
And it was one of the things that 

1676
01:09:26,341 --> 01:09:28,800
happened after Rhonda got knocked out by
Holly.

1677
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,350
Um,
they were talking about getting her back

1678
01:09:31,351 --> 01:09:32,184
within like,
it was like four or five months later 

1679
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:35,100
to,
to fight again.

1680
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:35,963
And I was like,
they were going to have a rematch with 

1681
01:09:37,111 --> 01:09:39,930
holly and I'm like,
you guys are fucking crazy.

1682
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,400
Like,
you're crazy.

1683
01:09:41,401 --> 01:09:44,280
She shouldn't be doing anything.
She shouldn't be getting hit.

1684
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,470
She shouldn't it be sparring.
She,

1685
01:09:46,471 --> 01:09:47,304
there's,
she shouldn't be getting her head 

1686
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:48,834
rattled and she definitely shouldn't be 
fighting holly fucking home who just 

1687
01:09:51,841 --> 01:09:52,674
kicked her into another dimension five 
months later or whatever it was six 

1688
01:09:55,831 --> 01:09:56,491
months later.
I'm like,

1689
01:09:56,491 --> 01:09:59,130
there's no way this is not,
should not be happening.

1690
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,020
Like you don't even know what's going on
yet.

1691
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,420
You don't even know what kind of damage.
I mean,

1692
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:04,254
think of what happened with you and 
Amanda did you stayed conscious at 

1693
01:10:06,241 --> 01:10:07,470
least.
I mean,

1694
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,350
Rhonda got fucking flat lined and then 
got hammer fist.

1695
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,270
It didn't the head while she was 
flatlined.

1696
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:14,010
It was,
uh,

1697
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,770
one of the most brutal knockouts in 
women's mma ever.

1698
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:18,563
And you know,
and you saw when she came back and 

1699
01:10:21,241 --> 01:10:24,570
fought Amanda and got hit like right 
away,

1700
01:10:24,571 --> 01:10:25,590
that hesitation.

1701
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:28,140
Oh,
she was just stiff and up and the fear.

1702
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:33,470
And then also Amanda,
I felt even before the Holly Holm fight,

1703
01:10:33,841 --> 01:10:34,674
I felt like Amanda was the more 
dangerous fight for her because of her 

1704
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:38,304
hands.
Because Rhonda is always in this 

1705
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:41,094
position where she's closing the gap.
She's getting close to you because she 

1706
01:10:43,171 --> 01:10:44,004
wants to clinch up with you and throw 
you and take you to the ground and arm 

1707
01:10:46,531 --> 01:10:48,600
bar you and what have you.
But with Amanda,

1708
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:49,434
you're dealing with a Brazilian Jiu 
Jitsu black belt who knocks people 

1709
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:55,560
fucking dead with one punch,
like it's a terrible match up.

1710
01:10:55,561 --> 01:10:59,370
I felt,
and obviously that proved to be true,

1711
01:10:59,371 --> 01:11:00,204
but what drove me crazy was how 
dismissive all these people behind the 

1712
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:04,884
scenes where all these agents and 
Hollywood people and all these people 

1713
01:11:08,161 --> 01:11:11,880
that just have no idea what business 
they're in,

1714
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,880
they really don't even this business,
the business,

1715
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,740
it's basically the business,
like we said,

1716
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:17,753
of head injuries and you're just like,
you're trying to sell this thing where 

1717
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:23,394
you're,
you're dealing with someone who had a 

1718
01:11:24,061 --> 01:11:28,050
fucking significant head injury and now 
you're pushing it back in.

1719
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:32,130
There was someone who's really good at 
delivering head injuries and is this,

1720
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:35,220
is this really all been mapped out?
I mean,

1721
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:38,040
what kind of training have has changed?
I mean what you,

1722
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:41,520
she's still with the same coach.
Has she done anything differently?

1723
01:11:41,521 --> 01:11:42,570
Like what,
what do you think?

1724
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,790
What,
what result is going to be different,

1725
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,043
you know,
and the downplaying of the significance 

1726
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:50,303
of a fucking ruthless knock out like 
that I just don't think can be 

1727
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:53,544
understated.
I think people should take a long time 

1728
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:58,320
off when they get knocked out like that 
a long time.

1729
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:00,070
Yeah.
Well,

1730
01:12:00,071 --> 01:12:00,904
and I mean especially some sort of like 
invasive treatment like from out the 

1731
01:12:06,011 --> 01:12:09,620
gates for something like that.
You studied and I mean,

1732
01:12:09,790 --> 01:12:10,623
I mean I know they put a flashlight in 
your eyes and ask you if you okay send 

1733
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:13,990
you to the doctor,
do whatever.

1734
01:12:13,991 --> 01:12:15,290
But I mean like,
and,

1735
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,490
and I think honestly that's what the UFC
is like effort was in,

1736
01:12:18,491 --> 01:12:19,324
in this,
in it and offering this information of 

1737
01:12:23,201 --> 01:12:25,270
this treatment to me was to see like,
hey,

1738
01:12:25,271 --> 01:12:28,000
is this something that would,
would benefit fighters in,

1739
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:29,920
in a situation like that?
It's at the Pie.

1740
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:32,350
It's not at the Pii,
but what they were saying is it would be

1741
01:12:32,351 --> 01:12:33,850
at the Pi,
um,

1742
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,673
still.
But the trick with it is that it is 

1743
01:12:37,931 --> 01:12:39,580
something you need to,
you need to go to.

1744
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:44,610
I need you to go to twice a day and have
that like schedule of it in that routine

1745
01:12:44,771 --> 01:12:48,430
of it.
But US says fighters like flying to only

1746
01:12:48,431 --> 01:12:52,060
vegas for it and paying our own room and
board are own flight,

1747
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:54,880
potentially having to fly our coaches 
and to have to,

1748
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,640
you know,
keep us working and doing whatever while

1749
01:12:57,641 --> 01:12:58,960
we're working.
I mean it's just an,

1750
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,430
I don't know.
I mean,

1751
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:03,640
I don't know.
It's tricky business.

1752
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:04,030
You know,

1753
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:05,990
it's real tricky business.
And how old are you now?

1754
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:06,973
35.
Do you wonder how much longer are you 

1755
01:13:08,781 --> 01:13:09,520
going to do this?

1756
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,900
I like,
I,

1757
01:13:10,901 --> 01:13:13,090
I feel like I got like a good couple of 
years left.

1758
01:13:13,091 --> 01:13:15,010
Like I'm,
I'm still having fun,

1759
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:15,933
you know,
and like the chest of it is still fun 

1760
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:21,250
and like the training is still fun and 
I'm still learning and like enjoying it.

1761
01:13:21,251 --> 01:13:23,230
And um,
I dunno,

1762
01:13:23,231 --> 01:13:24,064
like getting through everything that I'm
getting through and learning everything 

1763
01:13:26,771 --> 01:13:29,530
that I'm learning is like,
it's so inspiring to me.

1764
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:31,150
Cause I,
I definitely don't feel done.

1765
01:13:31,151 --> 01:13:31,984
Like I still have so much fight in my 
heart and like I really love putting my 

1766
01:13:35,381 --> 01:13:36,214
hands on people in,
in always like advancing and improving 

1767
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:42,070
in,
in the day I stopped improving,

1768
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:43,850
you know,
uh,

1769
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:46,030
then I can look at that.
But right now,

1770
01:13:46,031 --> 01:13:46,864
like I don't care about plan B,
I don't care about what's next because 

1771
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:51,460
that's not what's happening.
So your passion for doing it,

1772
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:52,210
it's still there.

1773
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:53,440
Yeah.
And the purpose,

1774
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,570
there's the passion is,
is huge.

1775
01:13:55,571 --> 01:13:56,830
I love the passion,
you know,

1776
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,680
that to me is huge.
But the purpose,

1777
01:13:59,681 --> 01:14:01,270
like the bigger picture,
the,

1778
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:04,270
the what I'm doing here,
what I was born to do,

1779
01:14:04,271 --> 01:14:07,870
what I was born to get through.
Like I have to get through this,

1780
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,080
like I want to get through this and I'm 
getting through this.

1781
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:14,170
I'm,
I'm watching myself and that is like,

1782
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:17,800
it's bad ass to me.
It's exciting to me.

1783
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:18,610
It's,
it's,

1784
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:20,770
um,
it's what I'm doing here,

1785
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,620
you know,
and I am,

1786
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:30,060
I'm all in like in and I can make,
I can just make things for myself that,

1787
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:31,923
um,
I get to show myself every single day 

1788
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,430
that like no one could have ever told 
me,

1789
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,593
you know,
it's all stuff that I know firsthand 

1790
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:40,840
from my experience,
from my world,

1791
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:45,040
from me trying things from me,
risking things like all of that and,

1792
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:45,963
and um,
to understand myself and to know myself 

1793
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:53,230
like it's been the biggest reward out of
all of this.

1794
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:57,700
Know yourself through the struggles and 
know yourself through the fights.

1795
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,541
Yeah,
all of it.

1796
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:01,210
I mean,
and even how much you get to learn,

1797
01:15:01,211 --> 01:15:02,740
just even going into a fight,
right?

1798
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:06,760
Like realizing so going into a fight,
being on antidepressants like,

1799
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:07,871
okay,
I'll wake up,

1800
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:10,030
I'll wake up,
but I don't know what this will do.

1801
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:11,620
I feel flat.
I don't feel flat.

1802
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,480
I'll be okay with these people there.
I'll be,

1803
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,370
I won't be okay with this.
These people here,

1804
01:15:15,371 --> 01:15:16,204
like,
like all of that is very clear about 

1805
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,253
things that like,
this has my attention whether I know it 

1806
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:24,244
or not,
that that's something in my life that 

1807
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:26,823
needs,
needs to be looked at and needs to be 

1808
01:15:27,971 --> 01:15:28,631
addressed.
Okay.

1809
01:15:28,631 --> 01:15:29,464
There's direction.
Like all I ever want is understanding 

1810
01:15:32,531 --> 01:15:34,120
and direction.
Like I just want to know,

1811
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:35,530
you know,
and so,

1812
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,510
um,
I get to deal with that,

1813
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:39,610
that that leads me to come to San Diego.

1814
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:40,443
San Diego is,
is a new chapter in my life that I get 

1815
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:43,600
to name,
you know,

1816
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:46,360
uh,
also for my kid and myself.

1817
01:15:46,361 --> 01:15:47,170
Like it's,
it's,

1818
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:50,020
I,
I get a reveal so much to myself through

1819
01:15:50,021 --> 01:15:50,854
trying different things and to just kind
of like letting life take me down the 

1820
01:15:54,491 --> 01:15:59,110
path that I'm supposed to without me 
sitting here freaking out about control,

1821
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:02,980
freaking out about things that I,
I can do nothing about.

1822
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:03,873
You know,
I just want to walk away from all of 

1823
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:10,990
this like content and happy with how I 
did.

1824
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,260
Whether that means I never have my hand 
raised again.

1825
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,220
I don't think that's the case.
Like I beating these girls,

1826
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:20,710
having the belt that is not a pipe 
dream.

1827
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,270
I already beat them.
You know?

1828
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:23,104
It's not like I'm incapable of that and 
I'm just wishing I got my fingers 

1829
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:26,891
crossed.
You know?

1830
01:16:26,891 --> 01:16:27,724
It's,
it's not that my whole journey of my 

1831
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:33,790
life in sports from being a kid was to 
meet my highest,

1832
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:35,770
best,
to be my highest good.

1833
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,903
And,
and that is what's driven me the whole 

1834
01:16:40,331 --> 01:16:43,960
time.
I look at these girls and I respect them

1835
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:45,970
because they're here doing what I'm 
doing.

1836
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:48,790
We're all just out here trying to be the
best at it.

1837
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:50,830
We're all trying to participate.
We're all trying to,

1838
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:52,043
you know,
find ourselves in it and learn what we 

1839
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:55,090
can learn and go implement it,
you know?

1840
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:56,080
And,
and so for that,

1841
01:16:56,081 --> 01:16:57,670
I have respect for every single one of 
them.

1842
01:16:57,671 --> 01:17:01,180
Some of them I like less than others.
Some of them are like more than others,

1843
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:02,014
you know,
but,

1844
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,213
um,
really like we're building this stage 

1845
01:17:05,441 --> 01:17:07,030
together,
we're doing this together,

1846
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,460
you know,
and I'm,

1847
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,070
I'm extremely proud to be part

1848
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,570
of something like this and my position 
in it and my purpose in it is to,

1849
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:18,080
you know,
find my personal good,

1850
01:17:18,081 --> 01:17:20,690
my personal best.
And you know,

1851
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,850
this has been extremely long road for 
me.

1852
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,340
Nothing has been easy and I respect 
that.

1853
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,423
Like I'm grateful for that.
Like all the things I know because of 

1854
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:33,140
the hard times,
like I feel fortunate to know,

1855
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,513
you know,
and I would never have learned them any 

1856
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:38,000
other way.
And I get to handle them.

1857
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,520
And not only do I get to handle them,
I get to like,

1858
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:45,850
like relate and understand people and 
see things differently because I get it,

1859
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:50,690
you know,
maybe not exactly word for word pinpoint

1860
01:17:50,691 --> 01:17:52,490
per pinpoint.
Oh,

1861
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:56,390
I'm not even gonna try to say that I was
going to make me fall over.

1862
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:57,740
Right.
But you know,

1863
01:17:57,741 --> 01:18:00,500
it's,
it's all there and it all matters to me.

1864
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,333
And how I get through this really,
really matters to me because I know it 

1865
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:05,720
matters to other people too,
you know?

1866
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:08,720
And,
and how they do inspires me as well.

1867
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:10,760
Do you know what you're going to do when
you stop?

1868
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:13,190
I,
I just don't,

1869
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:14,083
I mean,
I feel like there's this thing is 

1870
01:18:16,611 --> 01:18:18,230
there's this awesome resume and 
building,

1871
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:18,921
right?
You know,

1872
01:18:18,921 --> 01:18:21,800
like I'm a UFC fighter,
I'm a national champion in wrestling.

1873
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,320
Like I'm,
I'm,

1874
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:25,580
um,
I don't know,

1875
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:30,581
constantly advocating and working on 
working on myself and trying to help get

1876
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:31,453
other people working on themselves too.
Like I don't know what all that's going 

1877
01:18:33,611 --> 01:18:34,960
to look like.
And the thing is,

1878
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:36,710
is I don't even want to,
I don't want to look,

1879
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,530
I don't want to care about all that yet.
Right.

1880
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,910
Cause that's not where I'm at.
And like,

1881
01:18:40,911 --> 01:18:41,744
I want to be all in here.
I don't want to think about what's next 

1882
01:18:43,821 --> 01:18:46,460
or plan B or,
or how all of like,

1883
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,130
all of that because my heart is here.
Right.

1884
01:18:49,131 --> 01:18:49,671
You know,
it's like,

1885
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:51,380
what are you going to do in your next 
marriage?

1886
01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:53,420
Right,
right.

1887
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:55,100
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1888
01:18:55,101 --> 01:18:56,690
Like I,
I'm right now,

1889
01:18:56,691 --> 01:18:57,524
I'm,
I'm,

1890
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,520
I'm here,
right.

1891
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:59,810
I'm doing what I'm doing.
I don't,

1892
01:18:59,811 --> 01:19:00,644
I,
I'm not looking towards what's next 

1893
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:04,160
because right now I'm here.

1894
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,031
Yeah.
That's great.

1895
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:05,864
Listen,
that's what you want to hear from 

1896
01:19:06,591 --> 01:19:08,150
someone who's fighting.
I mean,

1897
01:19:08,151 --> 01:19:11,840
fighting should be all in that study is 
the only way to approach it.

1898
01:19:11,841 --> 01:19:15,320
If you're a fighter and you're also a 
neurosurgeon and a part time real estate

1899
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:17,200
salesman,
good fucking luck.

1900
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:21,040
You don't have 100% to give everything.
You got one,

1901
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:21,890
100%.

1902
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:22,963
Especially with something like fighting,
it's just such a crazy way to make 

1903
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:26,823
living.
You really have to be 100% committed to 

1904
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:30,170
it.
It has to be your life.

1905
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,010
Yeah.
And I,

1906
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:36,300
I appreciate the opportunity.
I like,

1907
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,720
I like,
I like everything I'm doing right now,

1908
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:41,670
you know?
And I feel like all of that will be part

1909
01:19:41,671 --> 01:19:42,504
of what's next.
But I like that that'll manifest that 

1910
01:19:44,941 --> 01:19:48,060
it'll figure itself out.
I mean not to,

1911
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,590
not the like hippy way of,
oh,

1912
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:50,790
everything will be great.
I'm sure.

1913
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:53,610
Like when it's time I'll look at that.
Right.

1914
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,110
But right now this is what I'm looking 
at.

1915
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:56,203
So the,
the kind of drive and discipline and 

1916
01:19:57,921 --> 01:19:58,754
work ethic that you showed to become a 
top level MMA fighter and a national 

1917
01:20:02,151 --> 01:20:02,984
champion in wrestling,
you could do anything with that and 

1918
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:07,860
whatever you set your mind to.
I really believe that.

1919
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:08,694
I mean,
I think the biggest problem that 

1920
01:20:09,331 --> 01:20:14,100
fighters have when they retire is 
finding a thing to put their energy too.

1921
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:14,934
And then their identity because their 
identity is of a fighter and when that 

1922
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,660
is taken away from them,
there's that.

1923
01:20:21,661 --> 01:20:24,270
And also the thrill.
I mean there's,

1924
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:29,280
you guys are experiencing a level of 
excitement and intensity.

1925
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:32,190
Like when you're talking about two weeks
out,

1926
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:33,960
you're crying in the fetal position and 
going,

1927
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:34,794
what the fuck am I doing?
But that all builds up to these moments 

1928
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:43,410
like that crazy primal scream after you 
stopped Amanda Nunez.

1929
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,433
Like that's a experience that very few 
people other than people fight to the 

1930
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:49,890
death are feeling.

1931
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:51,480
There's,
there's something,

1932
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:52,613
there's something that you guys are 
experiencing that unless you're the 

1933
01:20:56,161 --> 01:20:58,200
person in the woods fighting over that 
bone,

1934
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,270
you really don't know.
You don't know.

1935
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:03,690
And then for you to go to regular life 
after that,

1936
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:07,380
it's going to be hard and it's going to 
be hard for a lot of fighters.

1937
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:08,214
It's,
it's very difficult for a lot of 

1938
01:21:09,151 --> 01:21:12,960
fighters to find another thing that 
excites them.

1939
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:17,010
The way finding excites them because 
it's such a crazy pursuit.

1940
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,473
And then on top of that,
you're dealing with what you're dealing 

1941
01:21:20,491 --> 01:21:22,290
with,
but you're dealing with it publicly.

1942
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:23,940
You're talking about it,
which I think is a,

1943
01:21:23,941 --> 01:21:24,774
you're doing a great service to 
everybody when you talking about your 

1944
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:28,044
problems and your issues because there's
so many fighters that you know that 

1945
01:21:31,051 --> 01:21:33,630
you're experiencing this and that I know
that are experiencing this.

1946
01:21:33,631 --> 01:21:34,464
And you know everybody who,
anybody who's done any sort of martial 

1947
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:42,900
arts competition and been in gyms,
you're going to see people that have,

1948
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:46,080
that have taken too many shots.
It's just part of the game.

1949
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:47,880
And you,
you know,

1950
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,240
it's what you're doing by talking about 
it so openly.

1951
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:54,690
While you're still a top level fighter 
is I think,

1952
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:56,280
very,
very important for everybody.

1953
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:57,703
Huh.

1954
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,990
Thanks.
I'm trying man.

1955
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,520
It's been a lot of trying things,
but I do,

1956
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:06,920
I do feel value in this,
you know,

1957
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:09,590
and I mean exactly when people are done 
like,

1958
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,330
Eh,
there's some pride in,

1959
01:22:11,331 --> 01:22:13,910
in having to go get a nine to five or 
whatever,

1960
01:22:13,911 --> 01:22:15,010
you know,
after being a,

1961
01:22:15,011 --> 01:22:18,170
a level of fighter at this level,
mind you should,

1962
01:22:18,171 --> 01:22:20,930
you not have the fucking brain cells to 
be in life.

1963
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:21,943
It's like,
like I got high functioning thing that 

1964
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:24,950
you can be proud of.
You know what I mean?

1965
01:22:24,951 --> 01:22:25,784
It's,
it can be really stressful to not live 

1966
01:22:28,251 --> 01:22:30,350
up to the capability that,
you know,

1967
01:22:30,351 --> 01:22:31,184
you have what you're just not like 
there's that wall or that fog or 

1968
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:33,681
whatever,
you know.

1969
01:22:33,681 --> 01:22:34,514
So I mean,
I just think people maintaining 

1970
01:22:36,471 --> 01:22:38,240
themselves and doing everything they 
can,

1971
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:40,760
however vulnerable it feels like fuck 
it.

1972
01:22:40,761 --> 01:22:41,594
Do it like

1973
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:44,830
both that they could spread this therapy
across the country.

1974
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:45,610
And how big are these?
Yeah,

1975
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:47,500
they have,
I mean,

1976
01:22:47,501 --> 01:22:48,760
they look like they,
so they,

1977
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:50,350
they have,
um,

1978
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,810
like mobile units.
But again,

1979
01:22:52,811 --> 01:22:53,644
like it would need to be on,
I don't know if it's on some sort of 

1980
01:22:55,751 --> 01:22:58,720
route or whatever that people would need
to be able to show up to or what.

1981
01:22:58,721 --> 01:23:00,790
But um,
they,

1982
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:01,863
uh,

1983
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:03,140
yeah,

1984
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:03,973
I know they have one in Indiana know,
I know they're going to have one in 

1985
01:23:06,971 --> 01:23:09,430
Colorado soon,
I think relative to the training center.

1986
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:10,643
And when you say mobile units,
like how big are these mobile units and 

1987
01:23:13,051 --> 01:23:14,960
are they as effective as the one that 
you're going?

1988
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,600
It's a,
it's a creeper van.

1989
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:17,523
You know,
it was like a little dish of candy in 

1990
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:21,850
there.
Yeah.

1991
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:23,590
It's like you get in and,
um,

1992
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:25,660
it's the same exact chair,
you know,

1993
01:23:25,661 --> 01:23:27,870
and then they have their,
they're trained,

1994
01:23:27,871 --> 01:23:29,050
uh,
uh,

1995
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,940
nurse nowhere to put it on you.
I don't,

1996
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,800
and then even the Eeg,
I mean,

1997
01:23:32,801 --> 01:23:34,900
it's like a,
it's a wireless eeg,

1998
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:38,260
so I know that every week they make you 
do the eeg,

1999
01:23:38,261 --> 01:23:41,410
like same time,
a relatively the same time,

2000
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:42,244
so they can keep good track of what your
brain is doing and how to prescribe the 

2001
01:23:45,761 --> 01:23:48,700
levels to be at what on your head.
Um,

2002
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:52,810
and I,
I think they have one in Arizona.

2003
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,450
I know there's one in Texas.
Um,

2004
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,820
I want to say there's 12 over the 
country,

2005
01:23:57,821 --> 01:23:59,290
but I can't tell you where.

2006
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,300
And the mobile one.
I mean,

2007
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,340
how big is this?
I mean,

2008
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:04,174
is this something that uh,
Jim could get and how is it 

2009
01:24:05,981 --> 01:24:07,240
prohibitively expensive?

2010
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:10,620
Want to say again?
I might be full of Shit,

2011
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:13,890
but I think they're like $100,000
for that machine.

2012
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,600
But I do know that they're being,
um,

2013
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,740
insurance will cover it because,
uh,

2014
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:23,670
for the insurance will cover it for 
Migraine,

2015
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:29,120
uh,
ptsd and autism I think.

2016
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,130
I think that insurance will cover it for
that.

2017
01:24:32,131 --> 01:24:33,240
But then,
um,

2018
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,420
tricare's is also accepting them as an 
insurance as well.

2019
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,510
Wow.

2020
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:40,810
And so when they're doing this to you,
and you know,

2021
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:41,644
you said you got it in August,
you started doing it and you started 

2022
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:46,840
seeing improvements after he said four 
weeks.

2023
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,051
Yeah,
four weeks.

2024
01:24:48,051 --> 01:24:48,884
It was like the first time I saw 
improvements and then the bigger 

2025
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:52,550
improvements where coming leader,
yeah.

2026
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,550
Does it,
does it keep getting better?

2027
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,500
I mean,
is it better now than it was last month?

2028
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:57,490
Yeah,
I mean,

2029
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,230
to the point where I can,
I'm,

2030
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,630
I'm okay not going for three,
four weeks,

2031
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:02,920
you know,
like,

2032
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,080
like I said,
these last few weeks have been all about

2033
01:25:05,081 --> 01:25:07,540
me getting everything right to be in 
training camp right now.

2034
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,850
So you feel right now like you felt 
before the noon hour?

2035
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:12,530
Right.
In the way I'm changing.

2036
01:25:12,531 --> 01:25:14,590
Like I'm having fun with it again.
Like I'm,

2037
01:25:14,591 --> 01:25:16,820
I'm watching people,
I'm like fucking with them.

2038
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:20,450
Like I'll get them to step that way and 
then I'll step that way and then I'll be

2039
01:25:20,451 --> 01:25:21,800
very satisfied.
Oh my God.

2040
01:25:21,801 --> 01:25:23,080
Especially on for a while.
Yeah,

2041
01:25:23,090 --> 01:25:24,020
it was gone.
And,

2042
01:25:24,021 --> 01:25:29,021
and like that is the art to me is the 
games and the playing and,

2043
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:33,320
and the like getting you to do this so I
can do that.

2044
01:25:33,321 --> 01:25:34,330
And then,
you know,

2045
01:25:34,331 --> 01:25:36,290
like that was what was fun.
Yeah.

2046
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:38,150
Good.
Getting in a fight is not fun.

2047
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:40,130
Right.
But the chess,

2048
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:42,530
that's what's fun.
The game like,

2049
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:43,653
like making the oohs and the Ahs and the
crowd happen because you know some 

2050
01:25:48,171 --> 01:25:49,700
gangster shit,
you know what I mean?

2051
01:25:49,701 --> 01:25:52,250
Like that's fun.
That part's fun.

2052
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:56,270
Going in and getting cut up and bloody 
and having headaches and like your ankle

2053
01:25:56,271 --> 01:25:58,610
hurts for a month and boil or she's not 
fun.

2054
01:25:58,670 --> 01:26:01,340
No one wants to do that on purpose.
You know,

2055
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:02,233
I want to go in and do what I can not 
get touched and then have it go on a 

2056
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:06,440
highlight reel,
you know?

2057
01:26:06,441 --> 01:26:10,100
And that wasn't happening for awhile and
even on this last one,

2058
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:10,761
and it's just like,
man,

2059
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:14,690
I felt better.
I totally felt better and in,

2060
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,500
but what I needed to change wasn't that,
that that was fine.

2061
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:19,993
What I need to change.
This is other things that I'm changing 

2062
01:26:21,321 --> 01:26:23,300
and I am,
and again,

2063
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:24,710
like if that's how I have to learn it,
cool.

2064
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:27,560
But like it's all part of the process,
you know?

2065
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:32,480
I'm not no second in this entire thing.
Have I stopped believing in myself?

2066
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,960
No second.
The only thing I worried about was like,

2067
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,670
it was like,
all right,

2068
01:26:37,671 --> 01:26:38,504
am I going to be,
is my son changing my diapers here in a 

2069
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:42,380
few years if I keep doing this shit,
you know,

2070
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:43,850
like,
I don't want that,

2071
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,380
but I never stopped believing that this 
is what I'm meant to do right here right

2072
01:26:48,381 --> 01:26:49,214
now.
And I have time and I have more fights 

2073
01:26:50,661 --> 01:26:53,780
and I have everything it takes to go out
and be every single one of these girls.

2074
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:54,740
Some of them again,

2075
01:26:56,410 --> 01:27:00,280
you know,
I do know now when you're in camp,

2076
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,770
um,
how many days are you,

2077
01:27:02,771 --> 01:27:04,570
you doing two a days?

2078
01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:08,590
Yeah.
So some of them are,

2079
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:09,753
it'll be like,
sometimes I'll have to add more cardio 

2080
01:27:11,471 --> 01:27:13,380
in the morning.
So like if there's fasted cardio,

2081
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,650
if I'm heavy,
you know,

2082
01:27:14,651 --> 01:27:18,250
depending on how that goes,
as it's like a science at about 45.

2083
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,470
Like what do you walk around?
Yeah.

2084
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,240
What do you walk around?
I can get all the way up to like,

2085
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,700
I've,
I've been all the way up to 76,

2086
01:27:24,701 --> 01:27:27,130
but that was before.
I didn't know that was when,

2087
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,480
uh,
I didn't,

2088
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:30,560
I was,
I didn't know I was hyperthyroid.

2089
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:31,510
Oh.
So I mean,

2090
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,490
now I was eating like 600 calories a day
and doing fasted cardio and two workouts

2091
01:27:36,491 --> 01:27:38,770
in my weight wasn't changing.
My coaches were like,

2092
01:27:38,771 --> 01:27:40,180
what the Fuck's wrong with you?
I'm like,

2093
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:41,133
I don't know.
I guess the women in my family get kind 

2094
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:44,170
of big,
so shit.

2095
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,420
Maybe it's just that midwestern style 
hitting me now,

2096
01:27:46,421 --> 01:27:47,650
you know?
But,

2097
01:27:47,651 --> 01:27:49,180
um,
no,

2098
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:51,200
and then when I went and I got my panels
does that,

2099
01:27:51,201 --> 01:27:53,350
and like everything was all screwed up,
you know?

2100
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:54,120
And then that

2101
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,990
Nunez fine before the Nunez five.
What was the heaviest got before then?

2102
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:01,770
I never broke a hundred.
150 552.

2103
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,030
Wow.
Yeah.

2104
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:04,440
That's crazy.
Yeah.

2105
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:05,310
Yeah.

2106
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:06,143
Yeah.
I walked around like one 40 I didn't 

2107
01:28:07,231 --> 01:28:09,600
even have to cut cut for Misha.
I walked,

2108
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:12,360
I woke up in the morning like two just 
didn't eat breakfast.

2109
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:13,440
Wow.
Yeah.

2110
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:15,653
And then now I'm a big Mama.
Jamma like how I look at food and I get 

2111
01:28:18,541 --> 01:28:20,660
fat.
It's in the solid.

2112
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,360
No,

2113
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,510
but I don't hate it on armour thyroid 
or,

2114
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:24,980
um,
uh,

2115
01:28:24,990 --> 01:28:26,340
leave.
Levothyroxin.

2116
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:27,643
Yeah.
Okay.

2117
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:28,613
Yeah.
I take it every morning and like 15 

2118
01:28:29,431 --> 01:28:33,360
minutes before I can eat anything heavy.
You should look into armor thyroid.

2119
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,720
It's a thyroid that's made from a pigsty
Roy.

2120
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,600
And uh,
apparently it's a,

2121
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:42,990
it's more bio available.
A lot of people have better results with

2122
01:28:42,991 --> 01:28:44,190
it.
I would,

2123
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:45,590
I would,
I would try it.

2124
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:46,424
I won't try.
I wouldn't try it now just cause I'm in 

2125
01:28:47,251 --> 01:28:49,210
camp,
but maybe in between the next ones.

2126
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,060
Yeah,
I'm hyperthyroid too.

2127
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,350
Yeah.
Runs in my family.

2128
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:53,550
Yeah.
My family too.

2129
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,720
I didn't,
um,

2130
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:56,970
I have a weight problem cause I was 
working out a lot,

2131
01:28:56,971 --> 01:29:00,770
but I was getting headaches and uh,
I went to a doctor,

2132
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,190
get a,
like at the end of the day,

2133
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:05,280
like a say around like seven o'clock at 
night.

2134
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:06,361
Um,
uh,

2135
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:10,560
after dinner I would be so tired that I 
just like,

2136
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:13,080
I couldn't talk.
I just had a lie down.

2137
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:15,870
I couldn't hear it.
I couldn't log on,

2138
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:17,370
talk,
boom.

2139
01:29:17,371 --> 01:29:19,260
And I'd go out and it was like,
God,

2140
01:29:19,261 --> 01:29:21,210
these headaches are weird.
Like this is,

2141
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:24,030
it didn't seem,
it didn't seem normal,

2142
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,800
like the,
the late,

2143
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:29,070
I guess it was like after dinner 
headaches,

2144
01:29:29,071 --> 01:29:31,320
like right before bed,
it was just,

2145
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,440
it was,
it was not a normal exhaustion.

2146
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:36,930
I started getting nervous about it and 
then when I got it checked out,

2147
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:40,010
it made sense and my mom has it.
My sister has it,

2148
01:29:40,011 --> 01:29:42,210
it runs in our family.
Yeah.

2149
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:45,420
I don't know if it's that genetic for my
family,

2150
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:47,240
but you think it's from the head and I,
yeah,

2151
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,020
I mean it was right away.
Yeah,

2152
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:50,460
it was onset.
And then,

2153
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:51,400
um,
you know,

2154
01:29:51,401 --> 01:29:54,330
and then you do these Mris and you do 
all of this other stuff and it's like,

2155
01:29:54,331 --> 01:29:55,164
all right,
well there's where your head hurts and 

2156
01:29:56,611 --> 01:29:59,640
they're just what's wrong and you know,
so I mean,

2157
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,290
it was just,
it's all too perfect,

2158
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,153
you know,

2159
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:05,240
puts together your camps,
like who decides what you're going to do

2160
01:30:05,241 --> 01:30:07,130
as far as like how much work you're 
going to do,

2161
01:30:07,131 --> 01:30:08,210
what kind of training you're going to 
do,

2162
01:30:08,211 --> 01:30:09,950
where they're going to do sparring,
or they're going to do

2163
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,590
this training camp.
Um,

2164
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:13,740
I,
I'm,

2165
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:16,550
I'm outsourcing different things,
so I have like,

2166
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:17,413
I,
I talked to Eric Delphia about it and 

2167
01:30:19,671 --> 01:30:23,150
like I said,
I said I wanted to outsource the Jujitsu

2168
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:26,840
and the Moy Tai and those are going to 
in itself takes so much time.

2169
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:27,950
Right.
And then,

2170
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:28,783
um,
my strength and conditioning and I'm 

2171
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:32,560
doing with Chad missy is he's,
he's mad ass.

2172
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:34,070
Uh,
so my strength and conditioning coach,

2173
01:30:34,071 --> 01:30:36,530
Lauren Landauer,
do you know who she was in Colorado?

2174
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:40,710
So he's like family to me.
He's been there for everything.

2175
01:30:40,711 --> 01:30:42,080
Like I didn't even know when he got 
there.

2176
01:30:42,081 --> 01:30:43,190
He,
but he was always there,

2177
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:44,053
you know,
um,

2178
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:47,540
he told me about Chad.
Uh,

2179
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,940
and so I started doing strength and 
conditioning with him.

2180
01:30:49,941 --> 01:30:50,940
I'm going to do that,
um,

2181
01:30:50,990 --> 01:30:52,730
three days a week.
And then,

2182
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:53,593
um,
I know that I want to get working with 

2183
01:30:55,431 --> 01:30:57,350
the more traditional Moitai again.

2184
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:59,990
So I'm working with John next two days a
week,

2185
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:00,883
um,
and I think he's going to arrange my 

2186
01:31:02,901 --> 01:31:04,760
sparring as well.
And then,

2187
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:07,200
uh,
Andre Galvao,

2188
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:10,070
I'm going to try to work two or three 
days a week.

2189
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,510
And then,
um,

2190
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:16,940
so I handed all of that information to 
Lauren Landau and my other coach,

2191
01:31:16,941 --> 01:31:18,740
my nutrition issues,
Josh Ford.

2192
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:20,323
Have you seen him before?
He's got like a tattoo goatee on his 

2193
01:31:21,891 --> 01:31:22,724
face?
No,

2194
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,990
he's been doing my nutrition and um,
I've,

2195
01:31:26,150 --> 01:31:28,670
he's known me since all I did was 
Jujitsu,

2196
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:30,260
you know,
so he's been around,

2197
01:31:30,261 --> 01:31:31,094
he knows my style.
He knows me as a crazy fighter and all 

2198
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:37,190
of that.
So between Lauren and Lauren,

2199
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:39,980
Lando and Josh Ford there,
they're putting it together based off of

2200
01:31:39,981 --> 01:31:41,570
what they've seen out of me in the past.

2201
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:42,473
But if you're going to Jujitsu and 
you're doing a lot of Jujitsu training 

2202
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:47,100
and then you're going to Moitai doing 
Muay Thai training,

2203
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:50,190
when do you get together and do mma 
training?

2204
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:50,520
Okay.

2205
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:54,240
That'll be the sparring days.
And then there'll be a light sparse,

2206
01:31:54,310 --> 01:31:56,340
like kinda drill day in the middle in 
there too.

2207
01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:00,340
So are you sparring Moy,
Tai and sparring mma?

2208
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,750
No,
I'm going to be swearing mme.

2209
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:04,270
So that'll be where I mixed together the
and like,

2210
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:05,104
that's kind of how I like it too.
Like I like doing the disciplines 

2211
01:32:07,291 --> 01:32:08,124
separate.
And then and then me finding where to 

2212
01:32:11,021 --> 01:32:11,854
put them in in a lot of times that's 
where my freestyle wrestling just ties 

2213
01:32:14,231 --> 01:32:14,870
it all together.

2214
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:18,230
So you're more Thai training would 
basically just be technique drills,

2215
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:22,610
[inaudible] a Ninja moves,
all that and your moves.

2216
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:25,850
And then Jujitsu.
Are you going gear?

2217
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:26,703
No,
gay.

2218
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:30,890
I didn't know beef or I did g for like 
the past four weeks and yeah,

2219
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:33,460
fuck man,
shit hurts your feelings.

2220
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:38,460
But then uh,
obviously it's more practical to do the,

2221
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:41,280
to do the Nogi and now they took the g 
off of me and me.

2222
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:44,010
I'm like a thousand miles an hour.
I'm so happy with myself.

2223
01:32:44,011 --> 01:32:45,000
Slippery.
Yeah.

2224
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,270
Can I grab my shirt?
And what about wrestling?

2225
01:32:49,271 --> 01:32:50,104
Are you doing any rustling?

2226
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:52,180
That part?
I,

2227
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:53,213
I will.
I still got to figure out down in San 

2228
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:58,350
Diego I want a freestyle wrestler.
I'm not like,

2229
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:01,090
I got a great shot,
I'm good at shots and whatever,

2230
01:33:01,091 --> 01:33:03,820
but I'm,
I'm way more about throws.

2231
01:33:03,821 --> 01:33:07,010
Like I like,
there's so much more efficient from,

2232
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:09,820
yeah,
I got awesome hips for him and it's just

2233
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:11,110
like,
man,

2234
01:33:11,111 --> 01:33:12,760
they're,
they're high risk,

2235
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:14,440
high reward.
But it's my funky style.

2236
01:33:14,441 --> 01:33:15,970
Like I just get them done.
Right.

2237
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:16,833
And it's so much less effort when you 
taught someone over their head on the 

2238
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:21,250
ground and they don't know where they 
are for a minute.

2239
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:22,084
There's so much to capitalize on there 
with the equilibrium just off and like 

2240
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:26,440
those are things I like,
like I count on,

2241
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,453
so I need to find that freestyle 
situation yet I have good freestyle 

2242
01:33:31,451 --> 01:33:33,190
wrestling myself,
but obviously like,

2243
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:35,680
like it's good to stay on top of those.

2244
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,800
Like it's my strength,
but I need to keep my strength strong.

2245
01:33:38,801 --> 01:33:41,560
So I'm looking,
I'm going to make that happen.

2246
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:42,633
So what do you walk around that?
Right now I'm like one 55 when 56 72 45 

2247
01:33:48,851 --> 01:33:50,590
is a possibility.
Yeah,

2248
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:51,310
I mean,
and I,

2249
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:53,440
I've,
I've wanted to go there as well.

2250
01:33:53,441 --> 01:33:54,071
I mean,
like I said,

2251
01:33:54,071 --> 01:33:57,970
not having that fluid on our brains when
we fight kind of bugs me.

2252
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:00,790
Like if I can walk down at one 45 and 
eat breakfast,

2253
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:01,624
like,
yeah,

2254
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:02,523
I mean I won't,
I'm like eating clean eating right 

2255
01:34:05,621 --> 01:34:07,450
everything perfect.
I'm one 55

2256
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,860
yeah,
because I watched one of the,

2257
01:34:08,861 --> 01:34:09,694
uh,
they had a video of Cyborg cutting 

2258
01:34:10,631 --> 01:34:12,910
weight to make one 40 member in the 
winter,

2259
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:15,520
which didn't make any sense.
There wasn't even a weight class for one

2260
01:34:15,521 --> 01:34:16,410
40.
Yeah.

2261
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:17,553
I don't know what the fuck they were 
doing with her or they were trying to 

2262
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:23,440
prime her for one 35 or seeing if she 
could make one 35.

2263
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:24,573
Yeah.
But she was like weeping and it looked 

2264
01:34:26,561 --> 01:34:29,200
like she was dying and like what the 
fuck man.

2265
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:29,660
Yeah.

2266
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:32,300
Did she do the water cut in that one?
Like the,

2267
01:34:32,301 --> 01:34:33,134
the bathtub?
Well she did a lot of shit but it was 

2268
01:34:35,631 --> 01:34:39,980
just hard to watch and she gets big too.
Like they uh,

2269
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:44,480
I'm friends with the way I'll be who?
Her boyfriend and he like hit me up when

2270
01:34:44,481 --> 01:34:45,314
I was supposed to fight Ronda,
they were hitting me up during my 

2271
01:34:47,751 --> 01:34:48,860
training camp.
Like,

2272
01:34:48,861 --> 01:34:50,340
Hey,
cause I think they have,

2273
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:51,223
obviously they have beef and I think 
they wanted it to be like kind of 

2274
01:34:53,211 --> 01:34:55,430
political,
but I'm just like not in to that.

2275
01:34:55,431 --> 01:34:56,720
But they were like,
hey,

2276
01:34:56,721 --> 01:34:58,040
how Chris you,
do you have

2277
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,873
any girl training partners?
How about Chris come train with you to 

2278
01:35:00,201 --> 01:35:02,360
get ready for Rhonda?
And I was like,

2279
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:03,650
oh,
maybe.

2280
01:35:03,651 --> 01:35:04,910
I mean,
how big is she?

2281
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:05,460
And they're like,
like,

2282
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:07,320
oh,
one 82 and 83 and like,

2283
01:35:07,650 --> 01:35:10,460
what was the,
how does that help me?

2284
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,030
Another big motherfucker on me.
Like,

2285
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:16,120
Oh God.
I'm like,

2286
01:35:16,121 --> 01:35:16,871
um,
thanks.

2287
01:35:16,871 --> 01:35:20,250
But like I got Neil Magni right there.
Hey Dude,

2288
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:24,370
over like those guys are one 82 yeah,
I'm not paying her hotel.

2289
01:35:24,371 --> 01:35:27,100
She so fucking big.
That's so crazy.

2290
01:35:27,101 --> 01:35:27,701
I mean,
she really,

2291
01:35:27,701 --> 01:35:32,530
she probably be fighting one 65 yeah.
And there there's a 55 you know,

2292
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,700
common,
hopefully.

2293
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:34,570
Yeah.
I mean,

2294
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:35,440
I just don't know.
I mean,

2295
01:35:35,441 --> 01:35:38,170
there's only so many 40 fives.
I mean,

2296
01:35:38,171 --> 01:35:39,004
she's obviously got the belt at 45 but I
think even 45 is a brutal struggle for 

2297
01:35:42,401 --> 01:35:44,170
her.
And you know,

2298
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:47,200
as you said,
you could only do that so many times.

2299
01:35:47,201 --> 01:35:50,110
It's taking a little bit of your life.
Every time you do that,

2300
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,310
you know,
you're,

2301
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:53,370
you're chipping away at Oregon.
Yeah.

2302
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:54,413
And I just remember like I remember 
coming into mma and like I used to cut 

2303
01:35:57,481 --> 01:36:01,010
to one 25 like dying,
dying and that,

2304
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,033
so I was,
I wanted to be ranked number one at one 

2305
01:36:04,861 --> 01:36:07,530
25 that it was my goal before I moved up
in like I,

2306
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,720
I did,
I was ranked number one,

2307
01:36:09,721 --> 01:36:10,554
their beat everybody I can be.
And then it was just kind of like the 

2308
01:36:12,781 --> 01:36:15,450
last time I made one 25 I just,
I,

2309
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,293
I fought a girl named to k Ohashi from 
Japan and I remember it was like last 

2310
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,553
minute cause I suppose to fight a girl,
something happened to her and then they 

2311
01:36:24,421 --> 01:36:25,254
replaced her with Tko and I just 
remember being so happy that we were at 

2312
01:36:29,641 --> 01:36:34,270
altitude because I was like,
I think I had a heat stroke at the,

2313
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:35,273
the water cut,
like the bathtub cut because I was in 

2314
01:36:37,411 --> 01:36:42,411
the water for like 20 minutes and I 
remember at 10 minutes I was like,

2315
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:43,650
something's wrong,
something's wrong,

2316
01:36:43,651 --> 01:36:44,100
something's wrong.

2317
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,150
And they're like,
you have to stay,

2318
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,360
you have to stay.
And so the 20 minute line,

2319
01:36:48,361 --> 01:36:49,194
I like dove like a salmon,
like out of the water and I passed out 

2320
01:36:52,741 --> 01:36:57,210
on my floor and they gave no shits that 
my managers there and I'm naked and like

2321
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,770
I don't,
I don't know,

2322
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:02,070
I'm out to the point where they're doing
the knuckle rub on my sternum,

2323
01:37:02,071 --> 01:37:02,904
you know,
to try to get me up and then I'd rub on 

2324
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:06,571
your skin,
you know,

2325
01:37:06,571 --> 01:37:08,720
trying to wake you up.
That's how they wake you up.

2326
01:37:08,721 --> 01:37:09,840
Yeah.
It's like in your sternum.

2327
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:10,703
Yeah.
Cause it's like something with the 

2328
01:37:11,191 --> 01:37:13,270
nerves hero like hit your adrenaline 
awake.

2329
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,980
She was crisis so bad.
And so I'm up and I'm like,

2330
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:17,873
you know your hands and arms are 
tingling and everything cause you're 

2331
01:37:19,591 --> 01:37:20,670
like waking up,
you know.

2332
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:21,893
And I'm like,
I don't want to get back in that 

2333
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:23,490
bathtub.

2334
01:37:23,490 --> 01:37:26,400
Like put the sauna suit on me.
I don't like put it on me.

2335
01:37:26,401 --> 01:37:27,290
I don't,
you know,

2336
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:31,320
so not that that like,
I mean health wise I was not okay,

2337
01:37:31,321 --> 01:37:32,970
but it was like I'm not getting back in 
there.

2338
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:37,260
So they put this on a suit on me and my 
hands are like freaking out,

2339
01:37:37,261 --> 01:37:42,261
like doing this weird shaky like t rex 
arm thing and cramping so bad in my feet

2340
01:37:43,381 --> 01:37:44,970
were doing the same thing.
But it was like,

2341
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:46,163
like they had to cover me in the 
blankets and put all of the stuff on me 

2342
01:37:48,991 --> 01:37:49,824
to keep me hot cause I was not getting 
back in that hot tub or the bathtub is 

2343
01:37:53,461 --> 01:37:55,140
terrible.
And after that,

2344
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:57,420
like I remember I felt it in the fight 
and I was like,

2345
01:37:57,421 --> 01:38:00,450
I'm so glad we're at altitude cause I 
feel horrible.

2346
01:38:00,670 --> 01:38:03,740
I can't do this again.
And then I went up to 35.

2347
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:05,350
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

2348
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:08,950
It is the worst part of fighting.
It really is.

2349
01:38:08,951 --> 01:38:11,020
And it's so,
it's so unnecessary.

2350
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:12,130
There's gotta be,
I mean,

2351
01:38:12,131 --> 01:38:14,290
what one FC is doing,
they've got some,

2352
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:15,300
uh,
they're,

2353
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:18,190
they're eliminating weight cuts by doing
hydration tests and,

2354
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:20,860
and testing people several times during 
the camp,

2355
01:38:20,861 --> 01:38:24,220
finding out what your way,
finding out what your actual weight is.

2356
01:38:24,221 --> 01:38:26,470
And Ben ask him,
went into uh,

2357
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,333
the,
the,

2358
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:31,090
the way they're doing it in,
in detail when I did a podcast with him,

2359
01:38:31,091 --> 01:38:34,750
but that seems to be the way,
and they made everybody move up a weight

2360
01:38:34,751 --> 01:38:35,610
class essentially.

2361
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:36,391
Jeez.
I mean,

2362
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:37,680
and that's the thing is I,
okay,

2363
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:38,514
like contract contracts can still exist,
but maybe you're just contracted as a 

2364
01:38:42,151 --> 01:38:45,690
fighter and you have to fight certain 
amounts of time a year or or whatever.

2365
01:38:45,691 --> 01:38:48,480
But to have people contracted to weight 
classes is like,

2366
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:49,343
it's hurting the sport and it's 
obviously hurting fighters individually 

2367
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,310
as well.
But like

2368
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:55,210
it's just unnecessary.
Yeah.

2369
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:58,710
Well you should do is fuck,
I mean there are weight classes,

2370
01:38:58,740 --> 01:38:59,573
there should be more weight classes,
so there's more opportunities and you 

2371
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:04,800
should be fighting for what you are when
you're healthy.

2372
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:06,260
It's hard enough.
Well,

2373
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:08,460
and I think especially because the sport
is,

2374
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:11,370
because I mean,
it's very blatantly clear that it's,

2375
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,130
it's,
this is not a bracketed sport.

2376
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:15,053
Like this is an entertainment sports now
it's clear like we're doing what puts 

2377
01:39:18,391 --> 01:39:19,530
butts in the seats,
right?

2378
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:22,470
We're doing what's best for the fans.
So at that point,

2379
01:39:22,471 --> 01:39:25,080
what are these divisions really matter?
It's about the matchup,

2380
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:26,470
you know,
you can throw a belt on it,

2381
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,120
any fight these days,
like,

2382
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:31,350
so I think if we're going to evolve the 
sport to,

2383
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:35,160
to having entertaining fights or 
entertainment type fights,

2384
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:38,640
like we should just evolve the,
the contracts to that as well.

2385
01:39:38,641 --> 01:39:39,450
Like,
shit,

2386
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:40,283
I mean,
it'll still save the entertainment 

2387
01:39:41,911 --> 01:39:42,480
value.
Like,

2388
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,313
look,
you can get,

2389
01:39:44,030 --> 01:39:46,020
uh,
or catch weights even.

2390
01:39:46,021 --> 01:39:47,460
Like,
what do you guys want to agree on?

2391
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:48,530
You know?
Right.

2392
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,070
Like who's down for what?

2393
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:52,080
If you had an ideal weight,
what would it be

2394
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:53,930
to find out?
Yes.

2395
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:55,513
Uh,

2396
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:59,210
probably 45,
45.

2397
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,073
Yeah.
I feel like I'm skinny enough that I'm 

2398
01:40:02,511 --> 01:40:04,320
like flying squirrel,
flexible stuff,

2399
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:05,720
you know,
but,

2400
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:07,760
uh,
but still a hell of a strong,

2401
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,470
you know?
Um,

2402
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:12,350
but when you're dealing with someone,
like Cyborg is coming down from one 80.

2403
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,970
That's the thing though,
is me healthy.

2404
01:40:14,971 --> 01:40:18,070
Like it don't matter.
Like,

2405
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:19,050
um,
I'm the water,

2406
01:40:19,051 --> 01:40:19,920
she's a rock,

2407
01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:21,803
you know?
And that,

2408
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,450
that's something I remember thinking 
when I was going into 20 fives.

2409
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:25,284
It's like,
I'm going to be huge against all these 

2410
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:28,200
girls,
you know,

2411
01:40:28,201 --> 01:40:30,750
like they,
they may not be as dehydrated and fucked

2412
01:40:30,751 --> 01:40:32,730
up is me,
but I can hold them down.

2413
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:33,571
Right.
You know,

2414
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:34,404
and,
and I can do what I want and eventually 

2415
01:40:35,431 --> 01:40:36,630
break them.
Right.

2416
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:38,680
You know,
and I,

2417
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:39,241
she's,
um,

2418
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:41,380
she's got that in her back pocket too.
Yeah.

2419
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:42,990
But like,
you know,

2420
01:40:42,991 --> 01:40:43,824
you get the,
the,

2421
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:46,830
I I thought watching the Tonya Avenger 
fight,

2422
01:40:46,831 --> 01:40:48,630
like there was a lot of things,
uh,

2423
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:49,853
that I,
I saw in that fight against Chris and I 

2424
01:40:51,631 --> 01:40:52,291
was like,
damn,

2425
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:54,040
like that,
that right

2426
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:54,670
there,
there's,

2427
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:55,210
there's,
uh,

2428
01:40:55,210 --> 01:40:56,043
there's,
there's something I could do there just 

2429
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:57,923
fine to me seemed like Chris is being 
very cautious and conservative and that 

2430
01:41:02,441 --> 01:41:06,340
she was just picking her shots and,
and just trying to be very professional.

2431
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:11,540
Like the way she was fighting was not 
like this marauding rampaging destroy or

2432
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:13,240
like we've seen in some of her other 
fights.

2433
01:41:13,241 --> 01:41:14,074
She fought much more technical and just,
and Tanya evenger was throwing wild 

2434
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:21,790
fucking bar stool type shit.
She was just,

2435
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:23,650
she,
her hands were down.

2436
01:41:23,651 --> 01:41:26,740
She's whinging big bombs.
She knew she had to go for broke and you

2437
01:41:26,741 --> 01:41:27,521
know,
Tonya,

2438
01:41:27,521 --> 01:41:29,740
every juror's tough as fuck just to take
that fight.

2439
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:31,113
I mean the difference in size was so 
apparent between the two of them when 

2440
01:41:33,211 --> 01:41:35,780
you saw them inside the cage.
And you know,

2441
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,140
tom is just,
just a really tough woman.

2442
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:39,573
But her style,
she was just trying to be unpredictable 

2443
01:41:41,921 --> 01:41:43,390
and wild,
you know?

2444
01:41:43,870 --> 01:41:47,020
And cyborg was just moving in.
Let's just real,

2445
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,170
real professional and technical.
I felt like she was cautious.

2446
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,000
I mean it was a big fight for her too,
you know?

2447
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:54,020
Yeah,
yeah.

2448
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:57,340
That was the first,
was that the first belt defense?

2449
01:41:58,330 --> 01:41:59,520
What was that?
No,

2450
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:03,080
that was the first ballot because her 
winning the belt for the belt.

2451
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,380
Right.
That didn't happen again.

2452
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:06,940
Yeah.
And it was like,

2453
01:42:06,941 --> 01:42:10,240
see Ya Germain de Randamie is like not 
interested.

2454
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:11,521
Yeah.
Wait,

2455
01:42:11,521 --> 01:42:12,460
does she go there?
She said,

2456
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:15,550
oh she's still fighting.
Well she remember right after the fight,

2457
01:42:15,551 --> 01:42:17,830
I interviewed her after she won.
First of all,

2458
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:21,160
that fight bothered me.
It bothered me a lot cause she hit holly

2459
01:42:21,161 --> 01:42:25,720
after the bell twice.
One hard and really rocked her.

2460
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:27,160
And I watched that.
I was like,

2461
01:42:27,161 --> 01:42:29,440
fuck man,
that was a big shot.

2462
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:30,303
And like you,
you could say you accidentally did it 

2463
01:42:31,961 --> 01:42:32,290
once.

2464
01:42:32,290 --> 01:42:33,123
Maybe,
but she did it twice and one time hurt 

2465
01:42:35,471 --> 01:42:39,730
her bad.
And even so when I watched the fight,

2466
01:42:39,731 --> 01:42:40,520
I'm like,
that's the,

2467
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,353
the,
the times when she hurt holly was after 

2468
01:42:43,451 --> 01:42:44,284
the bell,
but holly fucked her up twice in that 

2469
01:42:46,151 --> 01:42:47,590
fight.
She hit her with that question.

2470
01:42:47,591 --> 01:42:48,424
Mark kick cracked her and rocked her and
then she hit her with a straight left 

2471
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:52,174
hand and dropped her too.
I felt like holly deserved the nod in 

2472
01:42:54,551 --> 01:42:55,384
that fight and I definitely think she 
deserved the nod if you take points 

2473
01:42:57,941 --> 01:42:59,920
away,
which I definitely think she should have

2474
01:42:59,921 --> 01:43:01,810
taken.
She hadn't points taken away from her.

2475
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:04,660
I just think I just didn't,
it didn't sit with me well,

2476
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:07,870
and then after the fight she said she 
needed,

2477
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,540
when I asked her about Cyborg,
she's like,

2478
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:11,860
yeah,
I'm getting surgery.

2479
01:43:11,910 --> 01:43:12,461
She was like,
I'm good.

2480
01:43:12,461 --> 01:43:14,230
I got something wrong with my thumb or 
something.

2481
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:15,370
So I was like,
okay,

2482
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:17,410
she's going to get some surgery.
And then.

2483
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:18,363
Then it became a ped issue.
She said the Cyborg is a lifetime ped 

2484
01:43:21,311 --> 01:43:22,144
cheater,
that she's a performance enhancing drug 

2485
01:43:23,411 --> 01:43:26,110
user and that everybody knows it and 
she's not going to fight her.

2486
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:30,340
So she basically just gave up her title 
and went back down to 35 I think.

2487
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:35,050
So she is fighting again.
I don't know if she went and got surgery

2488
01:43:35,051 --> 01:43:38,980
on whatever was going on with her hand,
but she is going to fight again,

2489
01:43:39,070 --> 01:43:43,250
but she hasn't since I don't believe.
I don't think so either.

2490
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,820
See if you can find that.
Jermaine Duran to me.

2491
01:43:45,821 --> 01:43:47,350
See what she's,
who she's fighting next.

2492
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,040
She hasn't tweeted since November about 
a fight then.

2493
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,490
Damn,
November.

2494
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:53,690
Yeah,
that didn't happen.

2495
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:55,443
See,
that's the person not investing in 

2496
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:59,540
social media.
Are you doing it right?

2497
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:00,940
Are you doing it wrong?
Oh No.

2498
01:44:00,941 --> 01:44:02,890
She was like,
I'm just not interested in this.

2499
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:04,883
Which is crazy because this is how 
fucking tufts cyborg is Germane to 

2500
01:44:08,091 --> 01:44:10,610
random.
He fought a dude and coyote them.

2501
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:12,900
I mean there's a Moy Thai fight with her
fighting.

2502
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:13,830
Yeah.

2503
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:14,663
I remember when I first started fighting
and like getting pointed at looking at 

2504
01:44:19,771 --> 01:44:20,760
like that,
like,

2505
01:44:20,761 --> 01:44:22,950
here's why you want to learn.
Moitai and I was watching her,

2506
01:44:22,951 --> 01:44:23,880
I was like,
that girl is,

2507
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:27,810
she looked at me and do some wars and 
she's like older too.

2508
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:28,980
I mean,
I can't say older.

2509
01:44:28,981 --> 01:44:31,740
I'm like one of the older ones now,
but she is she older than me.

2510
01:44:32,670 --> 01:44:33,750
Yeah.
But she,

2511
01:44:33,751 --> 01:44:35,130
um,
she fucked up a dude.

2512
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,560
She Kao to Dube is tray right hand?
Yeah.

2513
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:38,610
I mean it's a,
I mean,

2514
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:42,450
and then if she fought a guy like knew 
it was a guy signed up to fight,

2515
01:44:42,451 --> 01:44:44,860
a guy fought on,
beat them and they're like Cyborg.

2516
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:46,770
Yeah.
I'm not doing that.

2517
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,270
That's how scared she is a Cyborg and I 
get it.

2518
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:54,810
I fucking get it.
Cyborg walking around 182 pounds.

2519
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:57,940
I get it.
Kz around.

2520
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,870
I need to have,
yeah.

2521
01:44:59,890 --> 01:45:04,890
I mean it's a really open division.
A one 45 right now and Megan Anderson,

2522
01:45:05,341 --> 01:45:08,970
it's about to fight.
Is that at 45 or 35 I believe that's it.

2523
01:45:08,971 --> 01:45:11,370
45 Megan innocence.
Big Girl.

2524
01:45:11,710 --> 01:45:12,960
Big Girl.
Yeah,

2525
01:45:12,961 --> 01:45:15,090
that's what we're legit 40 fiber.
She's,

2526
01:45:15,091 --> 01:45:18,660
she's strong.
She's in her prime.

2527
01:45:18,990 --> 01:45:21,330
She's really tough.
She's good at everything,

2528
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,193
you know?
And she's a legit girl and fighting 

2529
01:45:23,881 --> 01:45:28,290
holly in her first fight in the UFC also
like shows how much they think of her.

2530
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:29,873
But I mean,
how many fighters do they have at 45 

2531
01:45:31,650 --> 01:45:33,930
he's like fucking three.
Let me know who the fuck is there.

2532
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:38,880
You got holly who fought Cyborg and lost
and then you know,

2533
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:39,793
w what else you got?
You got Megan Anderson who was over in 

2534
01:45:41,881 --> 01:45:46,350
Invicta and most people other than the 
hardcore fans don't know about her.

2535
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:47,633
You know?
And she was trying to get her name out 

2536
01:45:48,691 --> 01:45:50,760
there.
So what do we got here?

2537
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:52,440
Is that the whole division?
Yes,

2538
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:54,420
for sure.
That's a whole division.

2539
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:56,610
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

2540
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:58,320
Oh,
y'all nose on there too?

2541
01:45:58,380 --> 01:46:00,240
Well,
Yana fought Cyborg.

2542
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:02,310
She little isn't she?
She got nuked.

2543
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:04,560
Yeah.
That was a,

2544
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:06,030
I mean,
she did her best,

2545
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:07,260
right?
She,

2546
01:46:07,261 --> 01:46:08,490
when did she fight Cyborg?

2547
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,690
Same night.
I fought a UFC two,

2548
01:46:10,691 --> 01:46:11,524
two,
two mm.

2549
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:13,670
The July or she looked good.

2550
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:16,880
Cyborg got ahold of her.
It's just like one of those things where

2551
01:46:16,881 --> 01:46:17,714
when Cyborg starts landing on girls,
you see the look on their face and in 

2552
01:46:20,601 --> 01:46:22,970
the fuck,
what am I doing in here?

2553
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:25,483
I mean,
I was most impressed with Cyborg on her 

2554
01:46:27,441 --> 01:46:30,860
kickboxing loss when she,
when she fought Zarina barge.

2555
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:34,910
Did you ever see that fight?
She fought her and Moitai terina bars is

2556
01:46:34,911 --> 01:46:36,450
a fucking beast.
Demand.

2557
01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:37,323
I,
she doesn't need her from across the 

2558
01:46:38,781 --> 01:46:39,614
room in the face bars knocked her down 
with a front kick to the face and she 

2559
01:46:43,701 --> 01:46:44,534
dropped her and time still cyborg was 
still chasing after her for every 

2560
01:46:48,231 --> 01:46:49,280
fucking round.
Yeah.

2561
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:50,510
I was like,
that girl's lid.

2562
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:51,443
I mean,
she's,

2563
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:56,100
she's big and she's strong and she's,
but mentally she's tough too.

2564
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:57,023
Like she's,
I mean to just a fight that girl at 

2565
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,204
during the bars had,
she had I think almost three years 

2566
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:04,794
without a fight where she couldn't get a
fight cause nobody wants to find her 

2567
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:12,030
because she's just a fucking bad ass Moy
Thai fighter real long and tall and just

2568
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:15,180
classic Dutch style Moy Tai,
you know,

2569
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:18,960
and um,
cyborg stepped up fodder in lion fight.

2570
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:19,883
I mean,
when she was like the most feared mma 

2571
01:47:22,171 --> 01:47:24,120
fighter in the world and said,
fuck it,

2572
01:47:24,121 --> 01:47:24,954
I'll take a Moitai fight.
And with like zero Moy Tai professional 

2573
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:30,630
fights fought like one of the best girls
ever.

2574
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:31,793
It's really pretty admirable.
You know how bad ass she is in that 

2575
01:47:34,861 --> 01:47:36,180
regard.
Oh that's cool.

2576
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:37,613
But you know,
when you have a division that's that 

2577
01:47:39,181 --> 01:47:40,800
small,
it's like what,

2578
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:43,260
what do they do?
You know what I mean?

2579
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:45,630
What are you going to grow the girls,
make them get bigger.

2580
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:50,660
Like hey girls want some food.
Like Hey,

2581
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:52,260
you know,
I mean this isn't,

2582
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:55,200
this isn't the pride days where they can
just fill them up with,

2583
01:47:55,670 --> 01:47:56,730
um,
you know,

2584
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:59,460
whatever the fuck Gabby Garcia is on,
you know,

2585
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:02,430
and toss them out there.
They have to be legit,

2586
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:03,293
you know,

2587
01:48:04,250 --> 01:48:06,260
I don't know.
I don't know.

2588
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,160
Yeah.
I mean it's,

2589
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,550
it's a,
it's a weird situation cause I,

2590
01:48:09,551 --> 01:48:10,550
I mean,
I don't,

2591
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:16,180
I don't follow enough to,
to know what is out there to follow

2592
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:21,020
invicta or do you pay attention to any 
other organizations outside of the UFC?

2593
01:48:21,110 --> 01:48:22,400
No,
no,

2594
01:48:22,401 --> 01:48:23,270
I'm in,
honestly,

2595
01:48:23,271 --> 01:48:25,700
I don't watch the UFC that much either 
cause I like,

2596
01:48:25,701 --> 01:48:28,490
I don't have cable.
Like don't know.

2597
01:48:28,491 --> 01:48:32,440
I have netflix and a DVD player.
We just in school.

2598
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:35,210
Yeah,
we go crazy on 80s and nineties movies.

2599
01:48:35,330 --> 01:48:36,240
Wow.
Yeah.

2600
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:37,250
Well look,

2601
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:38,450
Netflix,
you kind of don't,

2602
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:42,080
I mean you could watch good shit all day
long.

2603
01:48:42,110 --> 01:48:42,950
You don't really,
I mean,

2604
01:48:42,951 --> 01:48:44,900
so many people have severed their cable 
now.

2605
01:48:44,901 --> 01:48:47,420
They just don't want to do it anymore.
Fuck a commercial.

2606
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:49,893
I mean and how much is cable?
It's like a hundred bucks a month or 

2607
01:48:52,131 --> 01:48:55,490
something like that.
It's Netflix 10 yeah.

2608
01:48:55,491 --> 01:48:56,324
I felt like that like get the fuck outta
here and it's not like you run out of 

2609
01:48:59,691 --> 01:49:03,440
shit to watch.
Like you could watch Netflix all day for

2610
01:49:03,441 --> 01:49:06,080
the rest of your life and never run out 
of shit to watch.

2611
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:07,093
You know?
It's a weird time for those cable 

2612
01:49:09,441 --> 01:49:10,274
companies.
It's like the only thing that really 

2613
01:49:11,931 --> 01:49:15,830
keeps people buying cable I think or or 
direct TV.

2614
01:49:15,831 --> 01:49:16,664
One of the big things is live sports.
Live sports is like one of those things 

2615
01:49:21,501 --> 01:49:25,010
where you kind of have to have direct tv
or cable or something

2616
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:27,080
generational too.
I mean,

2617
01:49:27,081 --> 01:49:29,000
there's a lot of people that just always
had it.

2618
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:30,580
Yup.
Yeah,

2619
01:49:30,740 --> 01:49:32,060
yeah,
yeah.

2620
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:34,040
My generation,
these young kids,

2621
01:49:34,041 --> 01:49:36,180
they don't give a fuck about it.
Yeah.

2622
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:39,290
John Young kids don't watch CBS and 
like,

2623
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:42,220
see what the fuck is that?
And if you,

2624
01:49:42,260 --> 01:49:43,093
the weird thing is if you watch regular 
tv now it seems like you're watching a 

2625
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:49,240
machine,
like you're watching some,

2626
01:49:49,241 --> 01:49:50,074
some shit from like a bygone error,
like laugh tracks and then cut to 

2627
01:49:53,501 --> 01:49:54,400
commercials.
They're like,

2628
01:49:54,401 --> 01:49:55,234
what is that

2629
01:49:55,370 --> 01:49:58,010
cliffhangers to be continued?
What is,

2630
01:49:59,030 --> 01:49:59,900
it's just weird.

2631
01:50:00,830 --> 01:50:04,430
So what do you do when you're not 
training other than a watch dvds?

2632
01:50:05,470 --> 01:50:07,630
Um,
not really much.

2633
01:50:07,631 --> 01:50:10,150
Like I'm trying to get out in San Diego 
and like,

2634
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:12,040
like live,
you know,

2635
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:12,874
in play by the like I'll get to the 
beach when I can try to soak up the sun 

2636
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:17,350
and whatever.
Um,

2637
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:21,850
really like I have a struggle because I 
realized I came here to,

2638
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:23,500
to work.
Like I came here,

2639
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:24,334
I changed in my life to come out here 
and be all in and be as successful at 

2640
01:50:27,311 --> 01:50:30,700
this as possible.
So my day is about training,

2641
01:50:30,701 --> 01:50:35,200
about doing the like rehabilitation type
things that I need to do and then making

2642
01:50:35,201 --> 01:50:37,990
sure my kids' needs are met and you 
know,

2643
01:50:37,991 --> 01:50:38,501
wash,
rinse,

2644
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:41,770
repeat with that.
Like I recently went to,

2645
01:50:41,771 --> 01:50:42,604
like,
I've been to a couple of escape rooms 

2646
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:47,500
but was fun.
Yeah.

2647
01:50:47,501 --> 01:50:49,690
They're super fun.
Unless you're not getting out,

2648
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:52,210
you sit there and they're like,
hey,

2649
01:50:52,211 --> 01:50:53,980
let's take your picture at the end.
I'm all pissed,

2650
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:55,950
right.
I'm still here.

2651
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:57,820
Yeah.
I didn't get out.

2652
01:50:57,821 --> 01:50:59,710
We didn't get out either.
We got out of one room,

2653
01:50:59,711 --> 01:51:01,280
but it led us into the second room.

2654
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:04,390
It's hard.
I can be like,

2655
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:05,440
there's a,
there's hard,

2656
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:07,390
it was hard for me being an athlete 
because I'm like,

2657
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:08,440
there's harder.
We can do.

2658
01:51:08,441 --> 01:51:11,380
Like I can work harder at this,
but there no working harder at it.

2659
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:12,670
Right.
It makes you smarter.

2660
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:17,050
And it's also like weird shit to put 
pieces together,

2661
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:18,180
you know?

2662
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,920
Yeah.
And then,

2663
01:51:19,950 --> 01:51:21,510
um,
let's see,

2664
01:51:21,511 --> 01:51:23,670
there's like a,
there's like a horse,

2665
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:24,613
a rescue that I go down and I'll like 
put time in down there and just kinda 

2666
01:51:27,810 --> 01:51:28,643
like be with the animals and feed them 
and like you can try to rehabilitate 

2667
01:51:32,131 --> 01:51:33,840
them.
Some of them are scary man,

2668
01:51:33,841 --> 01:51:34,674
like,
but it's cool cause they're actually 

2669
01:51:35,311 --> 01:51:36,144
like something really to be scared of 
like half the shit we're afraid of is 

2670
01:51:38,281 --> 01:51:39,114
just in our head anyway.
But there's this like gigantic animal 

2671
01:51:42,001 --> 01:51:43,410
that doesn't know if it wants to kick 
you.

2672
01:51:43,411 --> 01:51:44,244
I love you.
And it's like trying to be friendly so 

2673
01:51:47,101 --> 01:51:49,260
you can help it and teach it.
Stuff like that.

2674
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:52,170
That's taken some of my time.
It's been cool.

2675
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:53,710
That is weird with horses,
right?

2676
01:51:53,711 --> 01:51:54,544
Like you could break them,
you can lasso them and they'll let you 

2677
01:51:56,591 --> 01:52:00,190
ride them.
Like wild horses.

2678
01:52:00,191 --> 01:52:03,400
People go out and catch wild horses and 
ride them around.

2679
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:06,350
Like what other fucking animal can you 
do that too?

2680
01:52:06,850 --> 01:52:09,640
That's so strange.
You know,

2681
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:12,730
like that is really strange that you 
could like get a horse.

2682
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,380
He got them in the bar and the horse was
like,

2683
01:52:14,381 --> 01:52:15,550
fuck you.
Fuck you.

2684
01:52:15,551 --> 01:52:16,384
And you're like,
no,

2685
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:18,760
fuck you.
You get a rope around them.

2686
01:52:18,761 --> 01:52:19,510
And they're like,
all right.

2687
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:20,343
All right,
you got me.

2688
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:24,940
You're riding me around now.
It's very strange.

2689
01:52:25,510 --> 01:52:26,343
I mean,
it would have weird relationship people 

2690
01:52:27,611 --> 01:52:31,570
have with fucking horses.
It's very strange.

2691
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:32,663
Oh.
Then my friend Whitney Cummings has a 

2692
01:52:35,381 --> 01:52:38,590
horse and she's all in.
She's all in with this fucking horse.

2693
01:52:38,591 --> 01:52:40,450
She rides it bare back.
She's like,

2694
01:52:40,451 --> 01:52:41,950
you have to have a connection with the 
animal.

2695
01:52:41,951 --> 01:52:44,410
It has to feel you like not a satellite.
Alright,

2696
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,040
crazy.
I've seen

2697
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:47,083
clint eastwood movies seems like he's 
riding the horse pretty good with a 

2698
01:52:49,401 --> 01:52:50,234
saddle on and she doesn't do that.
And she rescued this horse and she'd 

2699
01:52:53,811 --> 01:52:54,644
like on her instagram,
she's always like riding around with 

2700
01:52:55,911 --> 01:52:57,440
this fucking horse and hanging out with 
it,

2701
01:52:57,900 --> 01:52:58,733
you know?
And she's like spending all this time 

2702
01:52:59,541 --> 01:53:00,374
with it.
It's like,

2703
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:01,200
it is,
I,

2704
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:06,200
they call it equine therapy and like,
like I was trying to get this because my

2705
01:53:07,271 --> 01:53:08,104
brain was working in all these ways.
Like I got really excited about that 

2706
01:53:09,821 --> 01:53:11,110
treatment center,
that,

2707
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:12,520
um,
the mindset place.

2708
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:13,683
And then again,
there's all those other people in there 

2709
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:16,480
that are in there in the veterans and 
stuff.

2710
01:53:16,481 --> 01:53:17,031
I was like,
man,

2711
01:53:17,031 --> 01:53:17,864
if,
if I could get someone them down there 

2712
01:53:19,481 --> 01:53:20,650
working with these horses,
one,

2713
01:53:20,651 --> 01:53:21,484
it gives them something to do cause the 
ones that are disabled like their hate 

2714
01:53:23,970 --> 01:53:26,560
in life and,
and that place,

2715
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:29,290
like it's awesome because after a few 
months of being there,

2716
01:53:29,291 --> 01:53:31,210
they all want to know how to help their 
like,

2717
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:33,790
like tell me what I can do around here,
you know.

2718
01:53:34,450 --> 01:53:36,310
And um,
even that,

2719
01:53:36,311 --> 01:53:38,170
with that on my man,
if I could even get them down,

2720
01:53:38,171 --> 01:53:39,004
they're like,
sometimes if all you do at this place 

2721
01:53:41,021 --> 01:53:42,490
has shovel shit,
you know,

2722
01:53:42,491 --> 01:53:43,324
it's,
it's still like you're around these 

2723
01:53:44,081 --> 01:53:47,080
horses and um,
this place in particular,

2724
01:53:47,081 --> 01:53:47,914
they're all rescues and they,
it's called Ferdinand's familiar and 

2725
01:53:49,961 --> 01:53:50,794
they've all been mistreated at some 
point or they were trained to be 

2726
01:53:53,501 --> 01:53:55,690
something that they never graduated to 
being.

2727
01:53:55,690 --> 01:53:56,523
And so there were trash and now they 
need to turn these horses into like 

2728
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:04,240
rideable like horses or whatever.
Like that's the goal.

2729
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:06,160
And then they have this,
um,

2730
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:08,800
it's near imperial beach.
It's like on that land,

2731
01:54:08,801 --> 01:54:09,634
like right on Tiawana so you get,
the goal is to take them on this like 

2732
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:15,033
trail that goes all the way to the beach
and you can ride up and down the beach 

2733
01:54:17,561 --> 01:54:20,940
like freely zero.
Can you ride the beach to Tiawana?

2734
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:22,060
Is there a wall?
Oh yeah,

2735
01:54:22,061 --> 01:54:25,690
you can write it that both.
And it's like a see through wall and you

2736
01:54:25,691 --> 01:54:27,070
see them in through,
yeah,

2737
01:54:27,071 --> 01:54:27,904
I mean it's just like,
it's like panels and you can see right 

2738
01:54:30,521 --> 01:54:31,354
through it.
Like I went down there and I could swim 

2739
01:54:32,951 --> 01:54:33,784
around it.
Yeah.

2740
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:36,550
Yeah.
I was thinking that the other day.

2741
01:54:36,551 --> 01:54:39,520
I'm like this,
you guys are almost too tempting.

2742
01:54:39,521 --> 01:54:41,700
Like I almost want to go over there.
Is it right here?

2743
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:42,790
Yeah,
it's there.

2744
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:46,150
That's exactly where we ride.
Fucking strange to me.

2745
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:49,750
That is so God damn strange.
So which side is Tijuana?

2746
01:54:49,751 --> 01:54:52,370
This is tia one or the other side is the
United States.

2747
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:53,410
Right.
And yeah,

2748
01:54:53,411 --> 01:54:55,600
that's exactly what it looks like.
They have their little umbrellas.

2749
01:54:55,601 --> 01:54:57,280
They're having their little barbecues,

2750
01:54:57,800 --> 01:54:58,880
chillin,
playing music,

2751
01:54:58,881 --> 01:55:00,260
having fun.
Meanwhile we're all over.

2752
01:55:00,261 --> 01:55:01,670
They're like,
Huh.

2753
01:55:01,980 --> 01:55:02,813
Like,
I almost want to try to swim over just 

2754
01:55:04,371 --> 01:55:09,200
to see if anyone's going to stop you 
because there is a little bit of like,

2755
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:10,034
if you keep going up that fence,
they have like one car with one dude 

2756
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:16,800
who's watching,
who's watching the border patrol.

2757
01:55:16,801 --> 01:55:19,760
And it seems so easy to get here from 
Mexico,

2758
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:20,850
right?
All you have to.

2759
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:23,450
Oh,
and how deep can that fence go?

2760
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:26,160
Yeah.
How deep can it go?

2761
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:28,530
Dig under that fucker.
Shitty coffee.

2762
01:55:29,010 --> 01:55:29,843
I mean he's put up here,
put up your umbrella and like a special 

2763
01:55:31,771 --> 01:55:33,630
angle and you're good.
Just climb.

2764
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:36,780
That doesn't seem like it's impossible 
to come on.

2765
01:55:37,650 --> 01:55:39,390
I mean,
I'm not the best climber in the world by

2766
01:55:39,391 --> 01:55:41,310
fucking guarantee you.
I could make it over that fence.

2767
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:43,260
100% look.
Yeah,

2768
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:44,170
you just grab a whole

2769
01:55:44,170 --> 01:55:45,003
the APP,
some gloves on so you don't fuck you're 

2770
01:55:45,901 --> 01:55:48,240
hands on.
You're going to have to do some soft

2771
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:51,130
soft sand Shane and cause that sprint 
afterwards.

2772
01:55:51,131 --> 01:55:51,964
Again,
burn your leg.

2773
01:55:52,130 --> 01:55:53,360
Yeah,
the sports world,

2774
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:56,570
but unless they're on Dune buggies,
they're not going to catch you.

2775
01:55:56,571 --> 01:55:58,660
Those fat fucks.
I just,

2776
01:55:58,850 --> 01:56:01,730
I feel like swimming is the move.
Why climate?

2777
01:56:01,731 --> 01:56:03,220
You just swim a couple of hundred yards.
Okay.

2778
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:03,751
Yeah.
Right.

2779
01:56:03,751 --> 01:56:05,280
It's like 200 yards.
Maybe.

2780
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:07,340
Shit,
go left and then come back.

2781
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:11,570
It's so weird that like bill dot wall 
build that wall.

2782
01:56:11,571 --> 01:56:14,450
People are so crazy.
The whole thing is so strange.

2783
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:18,600
I think one day we're going to look back
on countries like the human race one.

2784
01:56:18,650 --> 01:56:19,483
I think one of the things that's 
happening to the human race for sure is 

2785
01:56:21,591 --> 01:56:23,870
that we're getting closer to each other.
We're getting,

2786
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:24,763
we can,
like I'll read tweets that someone will 

2787
01:56:27,351 --> 01:56:28,184
post in Spanish or in Chinese or 
whatever and you just press translate 

2788
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:34,010
and then you get to read it,
you know,

2789
01:56:34,011 --> 01:56:35,270
translate to English.
And I'm like,

2790
01:56:35,271 --> 01:56:36,080
wow,
there it is.

2791
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:36,913
I could read this guy words.
And they have this thing called the 

2792
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:40,860
Google Pixel.
Uh,

2793
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:41,451
it's a,
you know,

2794
01:56:41,451 --> 01:56:45,080
it's a phone and um,
they have these pixel buds,

2795
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:49,100
these earbuds and these ear buds will 
translate in real time.

2796
01:56:49,130 --> 01:56:49,963
Like you could say some shit to me in 
Spanish and it'll translate it in 

2797
01:56:52,101 --> 01:56:53,780
realtime to English.
Yeah.

2798
01:56:53,870 --> 01:56:54,703
And how long is it going to be before 
that's way better and we're going to 

2799
01:56:57,741 --> 01:56:59,240
realize that countries are stupid.

2800
01:56:59,480 --> 01:57:00,313
See,
but I think,

2801
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:03,470
I mean I agree on that on the social 
media side that I feel like social media

2802
01:57:03,471 --> 01:57:07,760
has made that connection for us on that,
like that I guess mental,

2803
01:57:07,761 --> 01:57:09,740
social side or whatever.
But as,

2804
01:57:09,741 --> 01:57:12,080
as humans individually like here and 
now,

2805
01:57:12,081 --> 01:57:14,480
right next to each other,
like I feel a huge disconnect.

2806
01:57:14,481 --> 01:57:17,330
Like look at,
I mean a century ago,

2807
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:21,320
more than less than like you knew who 
the town butcher was,

2808
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:23,660
right?
He knew who the blacksmith was.

2809
01:57:23,661 --> 01:57:25,940
You knew who the mayor was like you knew
like,

2810
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:27,043
and everybody had their position.
Your kids were safe to run around like 

2811
01:57:29,511 --> 01:57:30,344
everything.
Like everyone knew and there was value 

2812
01:57:32,781 --> 01:57:35,200
to every single person for,
for what it is that they're,

2813
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:38,570
their craft was or who they are and now 
no one knows anyone.

2814
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:40,880
And like,
people don't want to like,

2815
01:57:41,150 --> 01:57:43,880
like I almost feel weird sometimes at 
like,

2816
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:45,260
you know,
my kids,

2817
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,273
my kid doesn't see all of the same 
pictures that I see because I have 

2818
01:57:49,251 --> 01:57:50,084
facebook and he doesn't or you know,
but I'm not ready like to have my kid 

2819
01:57:53,751 --> 01:57:56,690
exposed to the library right there,
you know?

2820
01:57:56,690 --> 01:57:58,760
And it's a terrible thing for kids to be
exposed to.

2821
01:57:58,790 --> 01:57:59,360
Yeah.
And,

2822
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:00,830
and I think that,
um,

2823
01:58:01,130 --> 01:58:01,963
you know,
so like shoulder to shoulder person a 

2824
01:58:03,411 --> 01:58:05,810
person,
I feel like a bit of a disconnect,

2825
01:58:05,811 --> 01:58:07,340
you know?
But social media,

2826
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:10,730
like we get to share information 
sometimes not good information.

2827
01:58:10,731 --> 01:58:11,564
Sometimes you get information like the 
fact that people are communicating I 

2828
01:58:14,391 --> 01:58:15,950
think is important.
Um,

2829
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:17,990
it's,
it's making people take stands on things

2830
01:58:17,991 --> 01:58:19,580
that they're all finding out.
Oh,

2831
01:58:19,581 --> 01:58:21,410
you believe that too.
Or I think that too,

2832
01:58:21,411 --> 01:58:23,510
like cool.
Like I can find my people,

2833
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:26,180
you know?
But on the actual like oxytocin,

2834
01:58:26,181 --> 01:58:27,014
like social side,
people actually getting to know each 

2835
01:58:28,551 --> 01:58:31,190
other like those like intimate 
relationships.

2836
01:58:31,191 --> 01:58:35,180
Like I feel like that part is,
is suffering a little bit from it.

2837
01:58:35,410 --> 01:58:37,390
Yeah.
I think that's suffering a little bit in

2838
01:58:37,391 --> 01:58:38,360
real life.
Um,

2839
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:40,990
because people were in cars,
they're in traffic,

2840
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:41,973
isolated,
then they go to work and then a cubicle 

2841
01:58:43,391 --> 01:58:44,224
all day,
and then they'd get home and they're in 

2842
01:58:44,771 --> 01:58:46,720
their apartment or their house.
Yeah.

2843
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:51,060
There's not a lot of like interaction 
with people and it's just stinked.

2844
01:58:51,061 --> 01:58:53,770
This is just a,
a side effect of modern life.

2845
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:54,610
Yeah.
You know,

2846
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:57,130
and it's weird that there's so many,
like in La,

2847
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,113
there's so many people next to each 
other and almost nobody knows their 

2848
01:59:00,191 --> 01:59:02,080
neighbor.
It's a very strange,

2849
01:59:02,110 --> 01:59:02,943
right.
But what I'm talking about is I think 

2850
01:59:03,971 --> 01:59:06,340
countries are stupid,
like states.

2851
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:09,430
I think countries like states,
like I think we should build a wall over

2852
01:59:09,431 --> 01:59:11,800
Florida before we should build a wall 
for Mexico.

2853
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:15,460
I mean,
Florida's a state,

2854
01:59:15,461 --> 01:59:19,450
right?
But Florida is just as alien as like say

2855
01:59:19,451 --> 01:59:21,160
Finland or something like that.

2856
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:21,993
I mean,
it's just,

2857
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,580
just the fact that you can move out of 
Florida and like,

2858
01:59:24,581 --> 01:59:25,241
Fuck Florida,
man,

2859
01:59:25,241 --> 01:59:26,830
I'm going to,
I'm going to move to Atlanta.

2860
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:29,410
And he'd go up there and like,
nobody stops you.

2861
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:32,440
You just go.
But if you're in Tiawana like you,

2862
01:59:32,441 --> 01:59:34,630
like no dog,
there's a fence up here,

2863
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:36,220
pitch like this.
No,

2864
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:37,203
there's no crossing did to,
to me that seems like super fucking 

2865
01:59:39,671 --> 01:59:40,504
strange and almost like guaranteeing 
that those spots are fucked forever and 

2866
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:44,953
the only way those anythings ever going 
to level out is if you let anybody 

2867
01:59:48,011 --> 01:59:48,844
travel wherever they want.
And nobody's willing to do that because 

2868
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:54,160
it might fuck up the good spots.
Like la Jolla would be like,

2869
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:54,791
no,
no,

2870
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:55,690
no.
You can't just like,

2871
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:56,530
yeah,
we're not.

2872
01:59:56,530 --> 01:59:57,363
Yeah,
we're not,

2873
01:59:57,650 --> 01:59:59,830
you can't just come over from,
I mean you think about it,

2874
01:59:59,831 --> 02:00:02,740
La Jolla has some of the wealthiest real
estate in the world,

2875
02:00:02,741 --> 02:00:04,960
right.
And unbelievable.

2876
02:00:04,961 --> 02:00:05,794
Beautiful views.
And you could walk to Mexico from La 

2877
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:10,690
Jolla.
You could walk,

2878
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:12,033
I mean,
what's the distance between Tijuana and 

2879
02:00:13,661 --> 02:00:15,070
La Jolla?
Let's guess.

2880
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:17,200
Let me guess.
I'm going to say it's 50 miles.

2881
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:18,520
Is it 50

2882
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:19,353
I'm going to say 50 no,
I it's not that many cause it's already 

2883
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:23,410
depending on,
oh yeah.

2884
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:26,320
I would say it's a 30 minute drive.
Like,

2885
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:28,960
like moderate.
Yeah.

2886
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:30,340
Normal speed limit.
Yeah.

2887
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:31,930
No traffic,
35 maybe.

2888
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:35,110
So maybe it's 30 miles.
So it's like a marathon,

2889
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,780
like a marathon run.
Which people do.

2890
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:39,400
They run it all.
They've run marathons,

2891
02:00:39,401 --> 02:00:41,770
all Tom 20,
30 to 32 miles.

2892
02:00:41,771 --> 02:00:44,890
Nine 30.
So you're in fucking Tiawana.

2893
02:00:44,891 --> 02:00:45,724
You were in a third world country and 
one of the worst neighborhoods of a 

2894
02:00:48,161 --> 02:00:48,994
third world country and 32 miles away.
You have like these unbelievable 

2895
02:00:53,261 --> 02:00:56,320
mansions on these bluffs overlooking the
ocean.

2896
02:00:56,650 --> 02:00:57,550
Look Nigga,
that shit.

2897
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:01,010
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

2898
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:03,370
And Clara Natto it's very weird.
Yeah,

2899
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,800
exactly.
It's very weird.

2900
02:01:06,330 --> 02:01:07,163
Yeah.

2901
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:09,330
And,
and yeah,

2902
02:01:09,331 --> 02:01:10,980
that corn auto,
the island,

2903
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:13,400
that's all super wealthy people,
right?

2904
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:14,423
Yeah.
That's where Dick Cheney lives 

2905
02:01:15,841 --> 02:01:16,674
apparently.

2906
02:01:17,050 --> 02:01:17,771
Yeah.
They,

2907
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:20,530
they have the ability of shutting that 
whole island down.

2908
02:01:20,531 --> 02:01:22,840
If there's like vandalism or like,
cause it's,

2909
02:01:22,841 --> 02:01:26,290
it's got its entry and it's out like,
um,

2910
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:30,490
what is it called way?
So it's not exactly an island.

2911
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:33,100
Like it does attach to the land.
What does that call the peninsula?

2912
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:33,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

2913
02:01:33,710 --> 02:01:37,610
So,
but they have an ability,

2914
02:01:37,611 --> 02:01:40,400
uh,
both the peninsula edge and

2915
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:43,190
the bridge to shut it down as a 
community.

2916
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:45,710
If Shit's going down on the island and 
they don't want someone right

2917
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:46,910
get off.
Wow.

2918
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:49,770
Yeah.
That's how rich they are.

2919
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:50,753
Yeah.
It's only one of the wealthiest places 

2920
02:01:51,961 --> 02:01:55,950
in the world and another one.
There's a one off sawed off of Miami.

2921
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:59,670
There's like some little tiny island 
that's filled only with rich people.

2922
02:01:59,671 --> 02:02:01,140
Star island I think.
Is that what's called?

2923
02:02:01,590 --> 02:02:03,900
Yeah,
it's like one of the most wealthy places

2924
02:02:03,901 --> 02:02:06,030
on the planet.
It's one little spot off Miami.

2925
02:02:06,330 --> 02:02:09,450
Just fill with rich folks waiting for a 
hurricane to fuck up their lives.

2926
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:12,313
Is that it?
Star island is a tiny neighborhood of 

2927
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:16,380
massive houses in drama.
Oh,

2928
02:02:16,381 --> 02:02:17,280
there's drama.
Oh,

2929
02:02:17,281 --> 02:02:19,890
see the big X on it?
Like fuck this place.

2930
02:02:20,130 --> 02:02:21,090
Okay.
It's not a drama.

2931
02:02:21,850 --> 02:02:24,540
Damn bad ass houses though.
But they have good brunch to,

2932
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:25,560
yeah,
that's a little too,

2933
02:02:25,561 --> 02:02:28,500
so they have a little bridge and it's a 
little tiny island.

2934
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:30,980
All right.
Good luck people.

2935
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:33,090
Weird people are weird cat.

2936
02:02:33,150 --> 02:02:35,520
That's not safe.
It doesn't feel safe.

2937
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:36,600
Not in Miami.
Pirate.

2938
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:38,520
A pirate.
Come wipe that whole crocodiles.

2939
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:43,800
The place is filled with pirates.
That place is filled with weird shit.

2940
02:02:43,830 --> 02:02:45,570
It's just Florida's so straight.
I love it.

2941
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:46,920
I'm joking around,
but I hate it.

2942
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:48,840
But I love Miami.
I just,

2943
02:02:48,841 --> 02:02:50,610
it's so strange.
It's such a,

2944
02:02:50,790 --> 02:02:51,990
every time I go down there,
I'm like,

2945
02:02:51,991 --> 02:02:53,850
you should have to have a passport to 
come here.

2946
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:56,790
This is not America.
I don't give a fuck what anybody says.

2947
02:02:56,791 --> 02:02:57,750
It's great,
but it's,

2948
02:02:58,140 --> 02:02:58,973
it's chaos.
But then there's some s Florida spots 

2949
02:03:00,721 --> 02:03:01,800
like we like,
okay.

2950
02:03:01,801 --> 02:03:04,050
Pensacola,
you could just go fuck yourself.

2951
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:08,730
Would you say it's basically Alabama by 
as wealthy?

2952
02:03:09,150 --> 02:03:09,961
It might as well.
We,

2953
02:03:09,961 --> 02:03:12,510
other than Roy Jones jr I mean he came 
out of there.

2954
02:03:12,860 --> 02:03:14,990
You put pence coal on the map.
Hey.

2955
02:03:15,210 --> 02:03:16,680
Nope.
Do you do any boxing training?

2956
02:03:16,970 --> 02:03:17,803
I do.
So I,

2957
02:03:17,860 --> 02:03:18,693
um,
alliance has been like real helpful on 

2958
02:03:22,251 --> 02:03:23,084
my hands.
Like I wouldn't say there's a ton of 

2959
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:26,360
improvement as far as that goes,
like,

2960
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:28,520
and I never really focused on boxing 
before.

2961
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:29,413
Like I,
I worked Muay Thai and kickboxing and 

2962
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:34,550
between Dutch and tie sal,
you know,

2963
02:03:34,551 --> 02:03:37,260
and then to go there and have my hand 
sharpened was,

2964
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,030
it was pretty cool.
Uh,

2965
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:40,550
I just never,
um,

2966
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:46,690
it was hard for me to like to relate 
boxing to any sport I'd ever done.

2967
02:03:47,961 --> 02:03:49,880
And like,
as a,

2968
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:52,670
as a athlete growing up as a kid,
like if I don't,

2969
02:03:52,730 --> 02:03:54,800
if I can't understand something that I'm
learning,

2970
02:03:54,801 --> 02:03:55,634
I try to relate it back to some like 
muscle memory of some motion I've done 

2971
02:03:58,641 --> 02:03:59,474
before in some other sport,
like volleyball or swimming or like 

2972
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:04,460
what's the mechanics of how I've moved 
in,

2973
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:08,420
something that I can even dance,
like turn into getting like some kind of

2974
02:04:08,421 --> 02:04:09,254
value out of so I can learn this thing.
And like boxing was not like anything 

2975
02:04:12,321 --> 02:04:13,154
that I'd ever done before.
Like I've never had a predominantly 

2976
02:04:15,381 --> 02:04:18,890
hands on sport that I was good at.
So it's been the,

2977
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:22,310
um,
the most,

2978
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:24,980
uh,
what's the word?

2979
02:04:24,981 --> 02:04:26,330
I don't know.
There's the,

2980
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:28,213
the most work in the less,
the least natural of all of the 

2981
02:04:31,251 --> 02:04:32,040
disciplines.

2982
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:32,873
That's a come into cause for this word,
but you've trained Moitai so much and 

2983
02:04:35,311 --> 02:04:36,870
more tie his hands in it.
Right.

2984
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:38,070
The

2985
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:41,310
thing I'm excited about the most,
we ties the clenching and the cakes,

2986
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:43,350
you know,
so to set up,

2987
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,540
right,
right.

2988
02:04:45,541 --> 02:04:48,510
And just having the,
the hips and everything with that,

2989
02:04:48,511 --> 02:04:50,100
that came with wrestling and that came 
with,

2990
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:51,850
you know,
the footwork of,

2991
02:04:51,930 --> 02:04:53,010
of soccer,
of dance,

2992
02:04:53,011 --> 02:04:54,240
of all of that,
stuff like that,

2993
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:58,650
that contributed I think easily and 
translated easily over to that.

2994
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:00,750
But boxing was,
um,

2995
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:02,250
not so much,
you know,

2996
02:05:02,251 --> 02:05:04,620
but part of me also thinks like,
you know,

2997
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:07,140
some of that had to come with,
with learning.

2998
02:05:07,141 --> 02:05:07,974
Like you,
you got to get hit to realize you don't 

2999
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:12,090
want to get hit.
I'm not ready.

3000
02:05:12,091 --> 02:05:14,190
I don't want to talk about that.
I don't want to get hit.

3001
02:05:14,191 --> 02:05:15,024
So

3002
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:17,820
yeah.
Yeah.

3003
02:05:17,910 --> 02:05:19,970
And slip and roll was shit.
Yeah.

3004
02:05:20,660 --> 02:05:24,700
It hurts my feelings and get punched in 
the face and I'm happy.

3005
02:05:24,701 --> 02:05:26,500
I'm the kind of person that it pisses 
off,

3006
02:05:26,810 --> 02:05:27,643
you know,
like,

3007
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:30,160
so it makes me,
it makes me fight harder,

3008
02:05:30,190 --> 02:05:31,810
you know?
But like,

3009
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:34,090
it's stunning.
It's stunning.

3010
02:05:34,091 --> 02:05:34,924
Especially when you get one of those 
good ones in the nose and now your eyes 

3011
02:05:36,881 --> 02:05:40,490
are watering but you're not crying like 
that.

3012
02:05:40,510 --> 02:05:43,870
Weird stinging sensation.
Yeah.

3013
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:45,520
Learning all of that,
that,

3014
02:05:45,550 --> 02:05:49,330
that all was definitely within the last 
few years and it's been,

3015
02:05:49,690 --> 02:05:52,630
it's been fun.
It's been not fun but fun.

3016
02:05:52,631 --> 02:05:54,540
When you see like the evolution,

3017
02:05:54,740 --> 02:05:57,080
no,
a lot of fighters are getting into yoga.

3018
02:05:57,081 --> 02:05:57,914
A lot of fighters are doing yoga.
A lot of fighters are finding that they 

3019
02:06:01,051 --> 02:06:01,884
have like real benefits and protecting 
their back and strengthening a lot of 

3020
02:06:07,231 --> 02:06:09,170
their joints and their ligaments and 
stuff like that.

3021
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:10,793
It's supplemental towards like the 
physiology of it or because it's 

3022
02:06:13,961 --> 02:06:16,420
something as far as adding to the 
combative side,

3023
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,730
uh,
I think both.

3024
02:06:17,790 --> 02:06:22,610
I think for sure it's good for your 
mental endurance because it's,

3025
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:23,623
it's hard.
I mean it seems like something that 

3026
02:06:24,691 --> 02:06:26,290
should be very easy.
You hear about Yoga,

3027
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:26,640
like,
oh,

3028
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:30,240
housewives do that shit.
But if you do it 100% in,

3029
02:06:30,241 --> 02:06:31,074
especially hot yoga,
you're stuck in that fucking box at 104 

3030
02:06:33,931 --> 02:06:36,090
degrees for 90 minutes,
sweating your ass off,

3031
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:39,680
pissed at about 60 minutes and that one.
Yeah.

3032
02:06:39,681 --> 02:06:42,640
So there's definitely some mental 
toughness that goes into the night

3033
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:46,030
you endure.
You endure a 90 minute hot yoga class.

3034
02:06:46,031 --> 02:06:46,864
But I think for your joints,
for your range of motion and 

3035
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:50,644
flexibility,
there's almost nothing better because 

3036
02:06:51,851 --> 02:06:55,180
you're so hot and sweaty,
everything's loosened up and you can get

3037
02:06:55,181 --> 02:06:58,320
into like deep,
deep stretches and deep poses and,

3038
02:06:58,321 --> 02:07:01,810
and also like for your foot strength and
posture and balance,

3039
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:05,200
all that stuff is amazing.
Amazing for your back,

3040
02:07:05,230 --> 02:07:07,090
strengthening your back,
your knees.

3041
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:10,170
Um,
it's really good for Jujitsu fighters.

3042
02:07:10,190 --> 02:07:11,410
Mean Jujitsu.
People love it.

3043
02:07:11,830 --> 02:07:15,070
So one of the best things for Jujitsu,
because Jujitsu,

3044
02:07:15,071 --> 02:07:16,390
so static,
you know,

3045
02:07:16,391 --> 02:07:20,920
so much of it is like holding on and 
trying to advance position in slowly.

3046
02:07:20,921 --> 02:07:23,470
And then there's these bursts of,
uh,

3047
02:07:23,490 --> 02:07:25,120
you know,
explosive movements.

3048
02:07:25,121 --> 02:07:29,530
But so much of it is just clenching and,
and yeah.

3049
02:07:29,531 --> 02:07:30,364
So much of it is that,
and I think you really benefit from 

3050
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:34,380
being able to,
you know,

3051
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:38,110
in these yoga poses,
holding these poses for 30 seconds.

3052
02:07:38,111 --> 02:07:39,910
When you're,
your body's burning and you're,

3053
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:40,871
you know,
you're,

3054
02:07:40,871 --> 02:07:43,330
you're having a difficult time to 
standing up.

3055
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:46,570
I think adding the heat component to it 
too,

3056
02:07:46,571 --> 02:07:48,500
especially if you're a weight cutting 
finder,

3057
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:52,570
like getting to know your body and in 
teaching it how to sweat,

3058
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:53,433
right.
This last training camp was pretty 

3059
02:07:55,451 --> 02:07:57,970
awesome with that because I got a sauna 
for my,

3060
02:07:58,360 --> 02:07:59,193
when I got us on a while ago,
I was using a red light for healing and 

3061
02:08:03,011 --> 02:08:06,610
I was using the sauna because I know 
that you can naturally boost your,

3062
02:08:06,611 --> 02:08:08,850
a growth hormone if you're in that every
night and,

3063
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:10,930
and help yourself before you go to 
sleep.

3064
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:16,320
So I was in that every night.
I tried to go in for like 45 minutes and

3065
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:20,560
that was so helpful in going into the 
fight week wait,

3066
02:08:20,561 --> 02:08:21,640
cut.
Because it was like,

3067
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:24,760
I know what it feels like when it's time
to get the fuck out.

3068
02:08:24,761 --> 02:08:25,594
And I know what it feels like when it's 
time that I'm like that sound like when 

3069
02:08:29,141 --> 02:08:29,974
I'm dripping like crazy.
I still got another good 20 minutes of 

3070
02:08:32,771 --> 02:08:35,590
me sitting here like this,
you know?

3071
02:08:35,591 --> 02:08:38,080
And,
and I think it's really hard on fighters

3072
02:08:38,081 --> 02:08:42,190
when they're not in a sauna or that hot 
for their entire camp and then they just

3073
02:08:42,191 --> 02:08:45,100
expect that out of their body the day 
before a fight.

3074
02:08:45,190 --> 02:08:46,090
Yeah.
I think you're right.

3075
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:48,790
This is rolling real good benefits as 
you said,

3076
02:08:48,791 --> 02:08:51,580
two for recovery or reducing 
inflammation.

3077
02:08:53,070 --> 02:08:54,780
Yeah,
I thought it was hopeful.

3078
02:08:54,781 --> 02:08:57,480
I got a portable sauna to bring up my 
fights with me.

3079
02:08:57,540 --> 02:08:58,373
Oh that's nice.
Is it one climb into and like just your 

3080
02:09:00,481 --> 02:09:01,314
little head sticks out is uncomfortable 
as hell cause you can't lean against 

3081
02:09:03,841 --> 02:09:04,674
anything or it'll burn your ass in the 
chair and the chair is like this little 

3082
02:09:07,711 --> 02:09:09,960
half chair and by that point you're 
like,

3083
02:09:09,961 --> 02:09:13,590
Oregon's are so depleted in and you're 
like leaning all weird anyway.

3084
02:09:13,591 --> 02:09:15,120
So it was just hell.
But I mean,

3085
02:09:15,121 --> 02:09:16,560
it gets it off and you don't have to 
leave your home.

3086
02:09:17,340 --> 02:09:18,390
Oh,
that's nice too.

3087
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:20,340
Especially if you're doing something on 
the road.

3088
02:09:20,341 --> 02:09:22,440
Like who was it that,
um,

3089
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:28,470
somebody that somebody was fighting 
somewhere and they didn't have hot water

3090
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:30,850
and they couldn't make weight cause they
didn't have the,

3091
02:09:30,851 --> 02:09:34,890
the bathtub?
I think it was a fuck.

3092
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:39,420
I'm trying to think of who it was.
Thomas have been stressful.

3093
02:09:39,450 --> 02:09:40,350
Yeah,
they were,

3094
02:09:40,351 --> 02:09:43,560
I think they were fighting in Brazil and
there was no hot water for some reason.

3095
02:09:43,561 --> 02:09:45,510
Like the hot water was down and they all
like,

3096
02:09:45,511 --> 02:09:46,950
what in the fuck?
And they couldn't,

3097
02:09:46,951 --> 02:09:47,810
they want.
And why not?

3098
02:09:47,820 --> 02:09:51,750
Not Making weight?
I don't remember who it was.

3099
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:54,330
I wasn't there for that event.
But I remember thinking like,

3100
02:09:54,331 --> 02:09:56,760
that is one of the real problems with 
doing these,

3101
02:09:56,761 --> 02:09:58,310
some of these gigs in the road,
you know,

3102
02:09:58,340 --> 02:09:59,173
you're traveling to these places and 
there's no fucking hot water if there's 

3103
02:10:03,031 --> 02:10:05,860
no sauna and no hot water.
How he's supposed to make weight.

3104
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:06,963
Oh.
And it's awkward to be in a sauna with 

3105
02:10:07,781 --> 02:10:10,620
your opponent to,
and why I fought Carina Damn.

3106
02:10:10,860 --> 02:10:13,000
Uh,
again,

3107
02:10:13,001 --> 02:10:15,490
as a 2,425,
like a few years ago,

3108
02:10:16,950 --> 02:10:19,540
there is Eric Anderson.
Oh,

3109
02:10:20,540 --> 02:10:22,800
Cheetah was very respectful.
Damn.

3110
02:10:23,010 --> 02:10:23,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

3111
02:10:23,980 --> 02:10:25,450
The is Brazilian.
He knows.

3112
02:10:25,490 --> 02:10:27,610
Yeah.
He was like,

3113
02:10:27,690 --> 02:10:28,523
yeah,
but we were in North Dakota and we had 

3114
02:10:30,851 --> 02:10:33,440
to go in and the same song and it became
a competition there.

3115
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:34,030
Oh my

3116
02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:34,930
God,
I'm not getting out.

3117
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:37,700
And when she,
when she,

3118
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:41,330
like there was a point,
like I'm sitting there with my coach and

3119
02:10:41,331 --> 02:10:43,970
I'm just like biting down here.
I don't even know how long we were in,

3120
02:10:43,971 --> 02:10:45,980
but it was like a hard,
it was rough.

3121
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:47,950
And um,
it's Kinda,

3122
02:10:47,970 --> 02:10:48,591
yeah,
exactly.

3123
02:10:48,591 --> 02:10:50,450
Like who's going to break first?
Who's gonna go first?

3124
02:10:50,451 --> 02:10:52,250
And she ended up being like,
fuck it.

3125
02:10:52,251 --> 02:10:54,470
And she goes and she gets out and I was 
like,

3126
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:55,790
Oh,
you have quit in you.

3127
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:59,540
And I already knew I wanted to fight.
I didn't knew I won the fight.

3128
02:10:59,541 --> 02:11:01,460
I was like,
I saw everything I needed to see.

3129
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:02,803
We're good.

3130
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:05,490
Crazy.
That's so true.

3131
02:11:05,491 --> 02:11:06,810
I mean,
look,

3132
02:11:06,811 --> 02:11:08,100
there's something to that.
I mean,

3133
02:11:08,101 --> 02:11:09,690
you definitely don't want to die in 
there,

3134
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:11,393
but there's,
there's moments when you're in the 

3135
02:11:12,541 --> 02:11:13,620
sauna,
you know,

3136
02:11:13,621 --> 02:11:17,100
I have one here and there's this thing 
that happens at like 30 minutes.

3137
02:11:17,101 --> 02:11:19,020
We were like,
what in the fuck am I doing?

3138
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:21,300
Well,
you start fucking weird now you're like,

3139
02:11:21,301 --> 02:11:22,260
oh,
I gotta get Outta here.

3140
02:11:22,290 --> 02:11:24,980
I gotta get Outta here.
It's like claustrophobia.

3141
02:11:25,090 --> 02:11:25,923
Like you're,
you know that if you just opened that 

3142
02:11:27,391 --> 02:11:29,320
door,
this cold air and you're going to feel

3143
02:11:29,410 --> 02:11:30,243
great,
just want someone that domain just lost 

3144
02:11:31,991 --> 02:11:32,820
someone that asks you,
okay

3145
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:33,630
question.
Just hoping.

3146
02:11:33,630 --> 02:11:35,780
It just opens the door for a second.
Let's open a door.

3147
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:36,653
Let me run out that door right there.
But that is what creates those heat 

3148
02:11:40,921 --> 02:11:41,754
shock proteins is that your body 
realizes that it's in this terrible 

3149
02:11:44,071 --> 02:11:44,904
situation where your way overheated.
So your body starts creating these 

3150
02:11:48,061 --> 02:11:51,630
anti-inflammatory proteins and that's 
what's so good for your body.

3151
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:53,880
They did a study,
I think it was in,

3152
02:11:53,910 --> 02:11:55,920
was it Norway?
A doctor,

3153
02:11:55,921 --> 02:11:56,754
Rhonda Patrick brought it up on the 
podcast that they showed a 40% decrease 

3154
02:12:00,451 --> 02:12:04,560
in mortality from all causes,
from use of daily Sauna,

3155
02:12:05,190 --> 02:12:08,040
40% decrease in heart attack,
stroke,

3156
02:12:08,041 --> 02:12:10,020
cancer,
everything across the board.

3157
02:12:10,230 --> 02:12:12,900
It's unbelievably good for you to use 
the car.

3158
02:12:12,930 --> 02:12:15,960
Yeah.
It's because your body in reaction,

3159
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:17,233
the the,
the response that your body has in 

3160
02:12:18,841 --> 02:12:19,674
reaction to that extreme temperature is 
just to create all these anti 

3161
02:12:22,981 --> 02:12:25,890
inflammatory properties and that's just 
so good for your body.

3162
02:12:26,130 --> 02:12:26,963
Inflammation is just the root of so many
different diseases and problems that we 

3163
02:12:30,211 --> 02:12:31,044
have.
Yeah,

3164
02:12:31,380 --> 02:12:33,180
so do you,
what is like the temperature,

3165
02:12:33,181 --> 02:12:34,870
induration duration recommended for 
that?

3166
02:12:34,990 --> 02:12:39,550
I think it's 170 degrees in,
I think 20 minutes is what they want.

3167
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:44,640
They want 20 minutes at 107 degrees,
170 degrees for four,

3168
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:48,550
I believe the test protocol was four 
days a week.

3169
02:12:48,680 --> 02:12:52,250
Is that the same statistic for say like 
a Red Light Sauna?

3170
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:55,190
It's a good question.
They didn't use a red light's on or they

3171
02:12:55,191 --> 02:12:57,740
didn't use an infrared sauna.
Traditional say just use the traditional

3172
02:12:57,741 --> 02:13:00,860
sauna.
But the theory is that it doesn't matter

3173
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:01,813
because what matters is your body 
reacting to the temperature change and 

3174
02:13:04,731 --> 02:13:06,350
that doesn't matter how it's getting to 
you.

3175
02:13:06,410 --> 02:13:08,420
They used a regular,
like hot rock sauna.

3176
02:13:08,450 --> 02:13:10,280
That's what I have,
regular hot rock sauna.

3177
02:13:10,610 --> 02:13:11,443
But I don't think it matters.
I think what really matters is just 

3178
02:13:13,101 --> 02:13:13,934
extreme temperature.
And there's a lot of people believe in 

3179
02:13:16,011 --> 02:13:17,900
those infrared saunas.
I think they're better.

3180
02:13:18,110 --> 02:13:18,943
I don't know.
No,

3181
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:21,230
I just know your body,
your body likes sauna.

3182
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:23,120
Whenever I do that,
I just feel better.

3183
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:25,640
Sleep all good.
She's better.

3184
02:13:25,641 --> 02:13:28,520
It just feels better for my brain to,
I just feel better about everything.

3185
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:29,953
I just think it's just like getting your
body heat it up like that and then it 

3186
02:13:32,281 --> 02:13:34,110
cools off.
It just chills everything out.

3187
02:13:34,460 --> 02:13:37,020
Just everything feels looser.
A quiet.

3188
02:13:37,050 --> 02:13:38,970
There's like a quiet afterwards.
Yeah.

3189
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:40,290
But yeah,
it just,

3190
02:13:40,291 --> 02:13:42,730
everything feels like it works better,
you know?

3191
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:45,150
And then when I do it on a regular 
basis,

3192
02:13:45,570 --> 02:13:46,403
you know,
but I feel the same way about 

3193
02:13:47,071 --> 02:13:47,904
cryotherapy when I do cryotherapy on a 
regular basis to everything seems to 

3194
02:13:50,701 --> 02:13:51,400
work better.
Yeah.

3195
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:52,233
See I,
I only do cryo therapy a couple times 

3196
02:13:54,731 --> 02:13:59,410
and it hurt my boobs like so much that 
I,

3197
02:13:59,411 --> 02:14:00,550
and I'm,
I just,

3198
02:14:00,820 --> 02:14:01,653
I don't want to go all ice bath and I 
mean the thing is I'll get an ice bath 

3199
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:07,143
and I'm really like,
I'll get in but I'm complaining the 

3200
02:14:10,121 --> 02:14:11,320
whole way,
you know,

3201
02:14:11,321 --> 02:14:14,620
like not not saying one nice thing to 
you or your Mama.

3202
02:14:14,621 --> 02:14:18,840
Like I'm getting in there and I'll do it
when I'm ready and oh man,

3203
02:14:18,850 --> 02:14:20,380
it's awful.
Awful.

3204
02:14:20,381 --> 02:14:23,860
And those cryotherapy,
things like I appreciate the speed.

3205
02:14:23,861 --> 02:14:24,694
I appreciate like the,
but like do you really feel that they 

3206
02:14:28,061 --> 02:14:28,894
get through all of those layers of skin,
like down to the optimal level on your 

3207
02:14:32,051 --> 02:14:32,884
tissue?

3208
02:14:33,290 --> 02:14:34,370
Well,
it's the same thing.

3209
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,710
It's cold shock proteins.
What happens is,

3210
02:14:36,711 --> 02:14:38,090
I mean if they really got it through 
your skin,

3211
02:14:38,091 --> 02:14:39,240
you'd be dead.
Okay.

3212
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:40,093
They're really got through.
But the idea is that your body produces 

3213
02:14:43,611 --> 02:14:44,444
these cold shock proteins in response to
anything that's over are under 150 

3214
02:14:48,981 --> 02:14:50,900
degrees below zero.
That's the sweet spot.

3215
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:53,840
Apparently when you hit that 150 degree 
below zero,

3216
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:57,380
your body produces all these massive in 
antiinflammatory properties.

3217
02:14:57,381 --> 02:14:58,214
Cause again it thinks it's going to die.
So it's like freaking out and people 

3218
02:15:02,181 --> 02:15:03,014
with arthritis and people with severe 
autoimmune issues where they have a lot 

3219
02:15:07,071 --> 02:15:08,390
of inflammation,
real,

3220
02:15:08,420 --> 02:15:10,700
real problems with their joints in their
hands.

3221
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,960
They have huge results from cryotherapy.
And there's a bunch of people that go to

3222
02:15:14,961 --> 02:15:15,794
my place that um,
they say that it's really essentially 

3223
02:15:18,021 --> 02:15:18,854
change their life.
They were just in pain all the time and 

3224
02:15:20,511 --> 02:15:22,850
now they know all they have to do is go 
there,

3225
02:15:22,910 --> 02:15:26,420
step in that thing for three minutes,
leave and they're going to feel better.

3226
02:15:26,450 --> 02:15:30,440
And they just feel looser and relaxed 
and whatever their flare ups and instead

3227
02:15:30,441 --> 02:15:32,690
of their condition deteriorating,
they're conditioned,

3228
02:15:32,691 --> 02:15:34,220
improved and stabilized.

3229
02:15:34,690 --> 02:15:35,523
Dang.
So it's about your body in the chemical 

3230
02:15:37,061 --> 02:15:39,280
value,
not the cold itself.

3231
02:15:39,310 --> 02:15:41,710
Exactly.
It's about your body freaking out.

3232
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:42,810
Yeah.
Yag Go,

3233
02:15:42,890 --> 02:15:46,360
what does this bitch doing?
It's 150 degrees below zero.

3234
02:15:46,510 --> 02:15:47,410
Oh my God.

3235
02:15:47,900 --> 02:15:50,330
And then when you get out of there,
you feel so good.

3236
02:15:50,331 --> 02:15:53,870
That's what does it for me.
When I get out all my God,

3237
02:15:53,871 --> 02:15:57,140
I feel amazing.
It's like this rush of,

3238
02:15:57,950 --> 02:15:59,990
it's just the,
what's it called,

3239
02:15:59,991 --> 02:16:01,850
norepinephrine.
Yeah.

3240
02:16:02,150 --> 02:16:04,310
You're,
you have this rush of it in your brain.

3241
02:16:04,311 --> 02:16:07,430
It's like you just took an awesome drug.
He's feel fantastic.

3242
02:16:07,431 --> 02:16:09,080
I get out,
the sun feels great,

3243
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:11,660
people look better.
Everything just feels better.

3244
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:14,030
You know,
I do two sessions too.

3245
02:16:14,270 --> 02:16:15,103
I do three minutes and then I go out for
10 minutes and then I go back in for 

3246
02:16:17,871 --> 02:16:20,330
another three minutes.
That's how many times a week.

3247
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:21,433
I try to do,
depending on how many times I'd do the 

3248
02:16:23,571 --> 02:16:27,080
sauna,
I want to do one or the other four times

3249
02:16:27,081 --> 02:16:27,914
a week.
So either I'm doing the sauna or I'm 

3250
02:16:29,411 --> 02:16:30,244
doing cryo.

3251
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:34,600
So you don't do both in the same day.
Some temperature manipulation.

3252
02:16:34,601 --> 02:16:34,930
Yeah,

3253
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:36,310
four time,
four days a week.

3254
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:38,020
And if I don't do that,
I do hot yoga,

3255
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:39,693
which is another form of temperature 
manipulation obviously cause you're 104 

3256
02:16:42,311 --> 02:16:44,950
degrees and you know you're there for 90
minutes,

3257
02:16:44,951 --> 02:16:49,000
sweating it out and that it mean it's 
not as hot in the room,

3258
02:16:49,001 --> 02:16:49,834
but your body absolutely has that same 
feeling that it has inside the sauna 

3259
02:16:53,231 --> 02:16:56,530
where you just let claustrophobic.
I gotta get the fuck out of here.

3260
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:57,770
Yeah,

3261
02:16:57,770 --> 02:16:59,280
I'm going to try it.
I will try.

3262
02:17:02,360 --> 02:17:04,150
I will.
I'm gonna send you this Emoji.

3263
02:17:04,151 --> 02:17:06,490
Like that's how you'll know I'm there 
for them.

3264
02:17:06,491 --> 02:17:08,240
One Sauna,
I'm good.

3265
02:17:08,241 --> 02:17:09,950
I sit in there and I just turn up the 
jams.

3266
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:10,970
Well if you look good,

3267
02:17:11,090 --> 02:17:15,200
the song and just stick with a sauna.
I mean I think they're both really good.

3268
02:17:15,380 --> 02:17:16,180
Yeah.

3269
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:18,790
What if I get in the cold shower after 
the sauna?

3270
02:17:18,791 --> 02:17:19,840
Is that count?
It was this thing.

3271
02:17:19,841 --> 02:17:20,860
I like doing that too.

3272
02:17:21,470 --> 02:17:22,303
Doing that after yoga,
especially in the winter when the water 

3273
02:17:24,051 --> 02:17:24,884
gets real cold.
I like to get in that fucking cold 

3274
02:17:26,271 --> 02:17:27,950
shower and just really large.
Yeah.

3275
02:17:27,951 --> 02:17:28,784
I feel the two of them and you know the 
UFC has that set up to where they have 

3276
02:17:32,961 --> 02:17:36,320
the Jacuzzi right next to the cold bath 
that they got that cold plunge.

3277
02:17:36,321 --> 02:17:39,560
It's like set to below 50 degrees.
You hop in there,

3278
02:17:39,561 --> 02:17:41,990
freeze your ass off and then hop in the 
sauna.

3279
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:43,003
Apparently there's like really good 
benefits to doing that back and forth 

3280
02:17:45,021 --> 02:17:45,854
like that.

3281
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:47,070
Yeah,
it was um,

3282
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:49,930
the last fight out there is,
uh,

3283
02:17:50,250 --> 02:17:53,500
I was sitting in that hot tub and then,
cause I didn't have the sauna,

3284
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:54,460
uh,
hooked up.

3285
02:17:54,461 --> 02:17:55,294
I just wanted to go in the hot tub and,
and then I laid on like the partition 

3286
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:58,713
and I had like one leg dangling in the 
cold pool and one leg dangling and then 

3287
02:18:01,090 --> 02:18:03,430
the water's really good looking,
I'm sure.

3288
02:18:03,770 --> 02:18:06,820
But when you're just starving and dying 
and give no fucks anymore,

3289
02:18:06,821 --> 02:18:07,654
it's just like I'm laying there like 
that Mackenzie dern was laying over 

3290
02:18:10,121 --> 02:18:12,730
there look a little worse than me,
but it's like,

3291
02:18:13,130 --> 02:18:13,963
I guess,
I don't know.

3292
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,410
What did you think?
Would she miss weight by seven pounds?

3293
02:18:16,580 --> 02:18:17,670
Dutch?
It's kind of crazy,

3294
02:18:17,671 --> 02:18:18,180
isn't it?

3295
02:18:18,180 --> 02:18:20,220
It's crazy because she,
like,

3296
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:22,860
I was literally sitting in the locker 
room with her,

3297
02:18:22,890 --> 02:18:27,150
like,
we're giggling at UFC two to 22 like,

3298
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:30,060
because we're both like curvy,
right?

3299
02:18:30,061 --> 02:18:33,810
And we're sitting in the locker room 
laughing about how much that shit ways,

3300
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:34,673
you know,
and it's like,

3301
02:18:34,940 --> 02:18:35,880
well,
can you do about that?

3302
02:18:35,881 --> 02:18:37,730
And even if you could,
do you really want to like,

3303
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:38,573
right.
I mean,

3304
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:40,130
I don't hate it,
you know,

3305
02:18:40,290 --> 02:18:45,180
but sitting in there and I'm like 
laughing about it and,

3306
02:18:45,181 --> 02:18:47,490
and that was what,
what was the date of that?

3307
02:18:47,550 --> 02:18:52,550
March 3rd and then to come down much 
over,

3308
02:18:52,741 --> 02:18:55,530
like she got her fight right away,
announced right away,

3309
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:57,030
you know,
that she was fighting me.

3310
02:18:57,060 --> 02:18:58,740
What was it?
[inaudible] 19th or something.

3311
02:18:59,250 --> 02:19:02,370
And it was just like that,
like when you have that data in mind,

3312
02:19:02,371 --> 02:19:03,450
I mean,
granted,

3313
02:19:03,451 --> 02:19:05,560
it's not me,
it's her,

3314
02:19:05,561 --> 02:19:06,810
it's,
I don't have her body.

3315
02:19:06,811 --> 02:19:08,260
I don't have her problems.
I don't have her life.

3316
02:19:08,261 --> 02:19:08,830
I don't,
it's,

3317
02:19:08,830 --> 02:19:09,750
you know,
not my,

3318
02:19:09,930 --> 02:19:10,763
not doesn't mean anything to me,
but to know you have a fight and it's 

3319
02:19:16,111 --> 02:19:18,870
signed up and it's ready,
like at that point it's maintenance.

3320
02:19:18,910 --> 02:19:19,500
Yeah.
You know,

3321
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:20,333
it's maintenance like that.
That's not even doing anything 

3322
02:19:22,621 --> 02:19:23,670
different.
It's just maintenance.

3323
02:19:23,671 --> 02:19:26,970
But like these weight cuts are harder 
and harder on us.

3324
02:19:27,260 --> 02:19:28,280
We get older.

3325
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,530
I don't know what her body's doing.
I don't know.

3326
02:19:30,590 --> 02:19:31,011
Yeah.
She's,

3327
02:19:31,011 --> 02:19:33,550
I think she's 25.
She's young and I don't,

3328
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:35,330
I don't know.
I don't know what that,

3329
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:36,373
to make 115 pounds asks of her and,
and I don't know if she's on her period 

3330
02:19:39,861 --> 02:19:40,694
or not.
I Dunno if that makes a difference to 

3331
02:19:42,051 --> 02:19:43,580
her with me.
I always,

3332
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:46,880
I always get mine the day of wayins I 
have other,

3333
02:19:46,881 --> 02:19:47,714
I have like three other girls for other 
girls that I know that it's the exact 

3334
02:19:51,021 --> 02:19:54,170
same thing,
like the morning of made way about to go

3335
02:19:54,171 --> 02:19:56,190
downstairs and there's that fucker 
looking at you right then.

3336
02:19:58,330 --> 02:19:59,163
Just like there's,
there's why I couldn't lose it last two 

3337
02:20:00,561 --> 02:20:01,394
pounds sweet.

3338
02:20:01,890 --> 02:20:04,310
The John Crouch about what happened?
Cause uh,

3339
02:20:04,410 --> 02:20:06,960
he asked her to leave the lab.
Oh,

3340
02:20:06,990 --> 02:20:08,410
that was where she was at when you 
asked,

3341
02:20:09,750 --> 02:20:12,090
did she ever say why?
She didn't say why.

3342
02:20:12,390 --> 02:20:16,080
He didn't say why either.
They're both playing it professional.

3343
02:20:17,580 --> 02:20:18,830
I don't know what happened,
but she was

3344
02:20:19,050 --> 02:20:20,420
long time too though,
wasn't she?

3345
02:20:20,421 --> 02:20:21,254
Well like,
cause when I went to go train down 

3346
02:20:22,311 --> 02:20:22,940
there,
she,

3347
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:25,100
she was already,
she was there one in the days.

3348
02:20:25,210 --> 02:20:25,961
Yeah.
I don't know.

3349
02:20:25,961 --> 02:20:28,090
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.

3350
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:32,350
But I know her dad.
He's doesn't he teach in Arizona?

3351
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:34,060
Magnetite I think so.
Yeah.

3352
02:20:34,750 --> 02:20:36,880
I'm hurt.
Jiu Jitsu is fucking nasty though,

3353
02:20:36,881 --> 02:20:37,530
isn't it?

3354
02:20:37,530 --> 02:20:38,820
So gnarly.
Woo.

3355
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:39,571
Yeah,
she's good.

3356
02:20:39,571 --> 02:20:41,310
We competed against each other.
Yeah.

3357
02:20:41,670 --> 02:20:43,380
Yeah.
I was beating her ass.

3358
02:20:43,590 --> 02:20:45,690
Well yeah.
Well it was rough.

3359
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:49,350
It was rough because I,
I it was worlds,

3360
02:20:49,351 --> 02:20:51,630
we were both purple belts.
I think it was the open division.

3361
02:20:51,631 --> 02:20:52,464
So I was like,
I was heavier than her by the next 

3362
02:20:54,121 --> 02:20:56,170
weight class.
And um,

3363
02:20:57,810 --> 02:20:58,643
I went to take her down.
I double leg dural big and then like 

3364
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:04,410
where we landed.
So if this is like the square,

3365
02:21:04,590 --> 02:21:05,423
we landed like right here.
And so they called it out and so they 

3366
02:21:09,001 --> 02:21:10,320
reset us in the middle.
So no points.

3367
02:21:10,340 --> 02:21:11,173
Oh,
so we get in the middle because she's 

3368
02:21:12,841 --> 02:21:13,550
Mckenzie,
Darren,

3369
02:21:13,550 --> 02:21:18,230
because I'm not resilient enough,
so I would,

3370
02:21:18,231 --> 02:21:19,620
they start us again.
I'm like,

3371
02:21:19,621 --> 02:21:20,370
okay,
no,

3372
02:21:20,370 --> 02:21:21,090
did,
I can't,

3373
02:21:21,090 --> 02:21:22,590
don't go near that line.
Right.

3374
02:21:22,591 --> 02:21:25,470
So I go and I shoot another double 
picker up.

3375
02:21:25,500 --> 02:21:27,300
Go take her down again.
Same thing,

3376
02:21:27,301 --> 02:21:28,134
but like,
it's out of bounds again because it was 

3377
02:21:30,871 --> 02:21:32,760
too close because my double is like a 
tackle,

3378
02:21:32,761 --> 02:21:33,540
you know?
Right.

3379
02:21:33,540 --> 02:21:34,560
And then,
um,

3380
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:38,940
so we go back in the middle and we shake
hands and we go.

3381
02:21:39,060 --> 02:21:39,893
So this time I go shoot,
I pick her up and I look at the ref 

3382
02:21:41,731 --> 02:21:42,361
like,
like here.

3383
02:21:42,361 --> 02:21:43,290
Good.
Is this good?

3384
02:21:43,450 --> 02:21:44,190
Good.
Put it down here.

3385
02:21:44,190 --> 02:21:45,990
Yeah.
So put her down,

3386
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:49,590
go to pass her guard.
And I passed.

3387
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:50,930
And then,
um,

3388
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:55,200
I think she had,
I sat back for a straight ankle lock and

3389
02:21:55,201 --> 02:21:57,780
they're like,
and they disqualified me.

3390
02:21:58,020 --> 02:21:59,190
What?
And they're like,

3391
02:21:59,191 --> 02:22:00,300
you can't have an ankle.
And they're like,

3392
02:22:00,301 --> 02:22:02,430
you can't do that as I can't do what?
And they're like,

3393
02:22:02,431 --> 02:22:04,170
you can't do that.
And it's in the rule books.

3394
02:22:04,171 --> 02:22:04,621
I'm like,
okay,

3395
02:22:04,621 --> 02:22:05,970
if I'm going to look in the real rule 
books,

3396
02:22:05,971 --> 02:22:08,220
what am I looking up?
What can't I do?

3397
02:22:08,940 --> 02:22:10,800
Thank you.
Can't you can't do that.

3398
02:22:10,801 --> 02:22:12,150
You need to go,
you're disqualified.

3399
02:22:12,151 --> 02:22:13,830
I'm like,
tell me what I did.

3400
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:17,430
And they said that I reaped the knee but
I like,

3401
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:18,990
I didn't like,
I don't,

3402
02:22:19,050 --> 02:22:20,610
I really don't think I did.
You know?

3403
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:24,880
So you think they were just juke in the 
system to try to get her to win?

3404
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:27,120
She's Brazilian.
I don't know.

3405
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:28,473
I Dunno.
It,

3406
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:31,420
it happens.
It does happen some tournaments.

3407
02:22:31,580 --> 02:22:32,610
Yeah.
And I mean they,

3408
02:22:32,611 --> 02:22:33,650
they,
they sent,

3409
02:22:34,060 --> 02:22:34,893
the thing is,
is like I love ib Jj of tournaments and 

3410
02:22:37,211 --> 02:22:39,220
I want to compete in them for the rest 
of my life.

3411
02:22:39,221 --> 02:22:40,900
Like I,
you know,

3412
02:22:40,901 --> 02:22:41,681
so,
but,

3413
02:22:41,681 --> 02:22:42,550
but yeah,
there is,

3414
02:22:42,580 --> 02:22:44,740
there is some themes that go on there.
Like,

3415
02:22:44,840 --> 02:22:49,270
there's definitely birthrights that gets
you places that like that I would really

3416
02:22:49,271 --> 02:22:51,370
like to have,
but at the same time,

3417
02:22:51,371 --> 02:22:53,140
really no,
I don't want to have been born into,

3418
02:22:53,141 --> 02:22:55,340
I want to make the statement of like 
happier birthright.

3419
02:22:55,360 --> 02:22:56,620
Like I got this,
you know,

3420
02:22:56,830 --> 02:22:59,820
I made it to some pretty bad ass 
tournaments in,

3421
02:22:59,830 --> 02:23:00,641
in,
you know,

3422
02:23:00,641 --> 02:23:01,474
just like fighting the way I fight and 
trying not to give a shit about all of 

3423
02:23:04,991 --> 02:23:07,000
that.
And like I continued to do that.

3424
02:23:07,001 --> 02:23:08,560
I want to do the same,
you know?

3425
02:23:09,010 --> 02:23:10,830
Um,
but uh,

3426
02:23:11,210 --> 02:23:12,970
that was,
that was a rough one for me.

3427
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,410
Like,
I was excited about that tournament.

3428
02:23:14,411 --> 02:23:18,010
I trained hard for that tournament and I
think we were each other's like,

3429
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:20,890
I don't remember what match into the 
tournament.

3430
02:23:20,980 --> 02:23:23,650
It was what to be disqualified.
And I was like,

3431
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:24,230
but

3432
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:26,840
so what did they call specifically 
reaping the need?

3433
02:23:26,841 --> 02:23:28,490
Don't you have to go against the joint?

3434
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:30,980
I don't know.
I don't know.

3435
02:23:30,981 --> 02:23:33,180
Like,
I wish I could draw you a picture.

3436
02:23:33,440 --> 02:23:34,880
Show you a finger bent.
Weird.

3437
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:37,670
Come up with an excuse.
We'll be,

3438
02:23:37,671 --> 02:23:40,970
I mean,
the first two takedowns like we weren't,

3439
02:23:41,510 --> 02:23:42,650
okay.
Maybe your first one,

3440
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:44,960
maybe the first one we were on the line 
out fine.

3441
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:46,273
The second one,
like we hit the ground and then we get 

3442
02:23:48,671 --> 02:23:50,570
it a little so,
but we were in,

3443
02:23:51,380 --> 02:23:53,360
you know,
and then the third one I'm being a Dick,

3444
02:23:53,361 --> 02:23:54,260
you know?
And I'm just like,

3445
02:23:54,261 --> 02:23:54,890
yeah,
yeah,

3446
02:23:54,890 --> 02:23:55,701
here good.
You know?

3447
02:23:55,701 --> 02:23:56,534
And so they're like,
they gave me the points and then I pass 

3448
02:23:58,731 --> 02:23:59,564
and they give me the points and then I 
sit back for that and now I'm 

3449
02:24:01,371 --> 02:24:05,840
disqualified.
Sounds like it is.

3450
02:24:06,620 --> 02:24:08,270
And I like her,
you know what I mean?

3451
02:24:08,271 --> 02:24:11,720
Like I like her,
her dad was at my gym teaching a seminar

3452
02:24:11,721 --> 02:24:14,360
at my gym in Colorado like months 
earlier.

3453
02:24:14,361 --> 02:24:17,930
And so when the match is over and we go 
and we're like standing next to them,

3454
02:24:17,931 --> 02:24:19,700
they're like,
sorry.

3455
02:24:20,490 --> 02:24:21,323
You know,
like,

3456
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:22,193
did you see that so many men on 
instagram of her after one day in 

3457
02:24:25,471 --> 02:24:27,090
Liverpool?
No.

3458
02:24:28,350 --> 02:24:30,870
Do you know people make fun of her 
accent but it's not real?

3459
02:24:30,930 --> 02:24:31,763
Oh,
Brazilian Jujitsu just told me that 

3460
02:24:33,241 --> 02:24:35,280
recently.
She apparently,

3461
02:24:35,730 --> 02:24:36,563
I don't know.
I mean people accents or weird to begin 

3462
02:24:39,091 --> 02:24:39,924
with.
Like why do people talk the way they 

3463
02:24:40,501 --> 02:24:41,334
talk in the first place?
Cause the sound with the people around 

3464
02:24:43,081 --> 02:24:44,190
them.
Geographical.

3465
02:24:44,250 --> 02:24:45,210
Yeah.
I mean it's,

3466
02:24:45,211 --> 02:24:46,044
it's weird,
but there's a video that somebody made 

3467
02:24:47,191 --> 02:24:48,024
of Mckinsey during,
after one day in Liverpool and it's 

3468
02:24:49,801 --> 02:24:53,400
basically her talking,
but Darren tills voice instead.

3469
02:24:55,980 --> 02:24:57,570
It's rough.
It's rough.

3470
02:24:57,571 --> 02:24:59,180
I'm not playing that.
Don't play a JV.

3471
02:24:59,190 --> 02:25:02,880
Don't even pull it up.
I will not do that to her.

3472
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:06,930
But it's pretty funny.
Yeah,

3473
02:25:06,931 --> 02:25:09,270
because I was super confused when I 
interviewed her.

3474
02:25:09,410 --> 02:25:12,030
Um,
when she won in the UFC,

3475
02:25:13,670 --> 02:25:17,810
they wanted a translator and I was like,
what are you talking about?

3476
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:21,570
Like she speaks perfect English.
Like this is really bizarre.

3477
02:25:21,571 --> 02:25:24,730
So George Greer Gel came in with me and 
uh,

3478
02:25:24,760 --> 02:25:26,500
he's like,
just in case she gets messed up anymore,

3479
02:25:26,501 --> 02:25:26,950
it's,
and like,

3480
02:25:26,950 --> 02:25:28,000
I didn't even question it.
I was like,

3481
02:25:28,001 --> 02:25:29,650
okay,
I was confused.

3482
02:25:29,651 --> 02:25:30,430
I'm like,
wait a minute.

3483
02:25:30,430 --> 02:25:33,820
I know she speaks perfect English.
Like this is ridiculous.

3484
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:37,480
Raised in Arizona right now,
but she fucking speaks perfect English.

3485
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:41,250
So I don't know if they were selling it,
you know?

3486
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:43,780
I don't know whose idea it was.
I don't know.

3487
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:45,700
I don't know.
I don't get it.

3488
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:47,740
But the fucking Internet.
Got It.

3489
02:25:47,790 --> 02:25:48,623
Okay.

3490
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:51,633
Maybe

3491
02:25:52,340 --> 02:25:53,630
crazy.
Everybody was like,

3492
02:25:53,631 --> 02:25:56,120
what in the fuck is happening?
I didn't question it.

3493
02:25:56,121 --> 02:25:56,601
I'm like,
look,

3494
02:25:56,601 --> 02:25:58,370
I'm just here to interviewer.
I just want her to,

3495
02:25:58,371 --> 02:25:59,790
I mean,
she wants to speak in Portuguese.

3496
02:25:59,791 --> 02:26:01,790
She wants to speak in English.
I don't give a fuck.

3497
02:26:01,791 --> 02:26:03,800
But I was like,
why do you need a translator?

3498
02:26:04,190 --> 02:26:06,080
Like that's,
that's insane.

3499
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:09,980
I don't know all of that.
I don't know all that either.

3500
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:10,873
You know?
She definitely speaks English really 

3501
02:26:12,351 --> 02:26:13,050
well though.

3502
02:26:13,050 --> 02:26:16,440
Does it?
Is there a benefit to Brazilian?

3503
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:17,131
Well,
yeah.

3504
02:26:17,131 --> 02:26:19,560
I mean obviously that's a huge 
demographic.

3505
02:26:19,561 --> 02:26:20,394
And his sport huge.
Primarily the biggest other than an 

3506
02:26:24,930 --> 02:26:26,020
American American.
Yeah.

3507
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:29,970
But I'm curious if there's like a 
benefit or a marketing.

3508
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,030
Like I said,
there's or something to that would,

3509
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:33,090
that would make that more,

3510
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:37,140
well,
Brazilians have immense national pride,

3511
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:38,433
you know,
and her being a Brazilian and the 

3512
02:26:40,721 --> 02:26:43,940
daughter of a Brazilian Jujitsu legend 
and you know,

3513
02:26:43,941 --> 02:26:46,690
and speaking perfect Portuguese and 
English and I'm just,

3514
02:26:47,110 --> 02:26:49,450
I guess maybe that's the idea behind it.
I don't know.

3515
02:26:49,490 --> 02:26:50,010
She's

3516
02:26:50,010 --> 02:26:50,843
killing it though.
Like technically and with her style and 

3517
02:26:53,790 --> 02:26:57,750
I mean like everything that she brings 
to the table is,

3518
02:26:57,960 --> 02:26:59,430
is already good.
You know?

3519
02:26:59,431 --> 02:27:02,730
It's like don't fuck that up.
Don't effect of with some,

3520
02:27:02,780 --> 02:27:03,613
yeah.
Who knows?

3521
02:27:04,430 --> 02:27:05,201
Yeah.
I don't know.

3522
02:27:05,201 --> 02:27:06,990
You know what?
Sometimes when I get around people,

3523
02:27:06,991 --> 02:27:10,250
like I feel bad because like I try to be
like really empathetic and,

3524
02:27:10,251 --> 02:27:11,084
and when I'm around like foreigners and 
like I will totally slow down my 

3525
02:27:15,931 --> 02:27:16,764
speaking so they will get it to the 
point where sometimes I think I look 

3526
02:27:19,561 --> 02:27:20,890
condescending.
Right.

3527
02:27:20,910 --> 02:27:21,690
You know,
where I'm like,

3528
02:27:21,690 --> 02:27:22,523
I just want this conversation.
Who is easy as possible for you because 

3529
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:28,530
I'm already awkward and like let me help
you out.

3530
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:29,940
You know?
That's a different thing,

3531
02:27:29,970 --> 02:27:30,803
but it's like you remember when Madonna 
had a fake English accent and everybody 

3532
02:27:32,981 --> 02:27:33,720
was like,
pitch,

3533
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:35,700
you're from Brooklyn or wherever the 
fuck you're from,

3534
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:38,580
not from England,
and you can't do that.

3535
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:39,961
Yeah.
I mean,

3536
02:27:39,961 --> 02:27:41,760
depending on who she's around,
I guess.

3537
02:27:41,761 --> 02:27:42,660
I don't know.
Fuck.

3538
02:27:42,750 --> 02:27:43,583
That's the thing,
like if you're around people that have 

3539
02:27:45,930 --> 02:27:46,980
that accent,
you'll,

3540
02:27:46,981 --> 02:27:48,320
you will pick it up.
Yeah.

3541
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:50,830
When I was a kid,
I definitely had a Boston accent,

3542
02:27:50,831 --> 02:27:55,720
but I heard myself talk on tv once when 
I was 19 it was a Boston guy.

3543
02:27:56,810 --> 02:27:58,790
No,
I've got to get rid of that.

3544
02:27:58,820 --> 02:27:59,653
Like,
how did I pick that up so quick and my 

3545
02:28:01,161 --> 02:28:03,410
family's all Minnesota rural,
you know?

3546
02:28:03,411 --> 02:28:04,244
And so when I go home,
I get that and it will stick around for 

3547
02:28:05,691 --> 02:28:07,280
a few weeks for sure.
Especially if you drink.

3548
02:28:07,281 --> 02:28:08,270
Right?
Yeah.

3549
02:28:08,510 --> 02:28:09,710
For sure.
I'm real tired.

3550
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:11,870
Yeah.
Or You have your round.

3551
02:28:11,871 --> 02:28:13,460
All those people.
It's like comforting

3552
02:28:14,430 --> 02:28:16,230
has her fucking strange,
you know,

3553
02:28:16,231 --> 02:28:17,064
they're,
they really are strange that the like 

3554
02:28:18,281 --> 02:28:22,190
specific to regions,
it just shows you how people are,

3555
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:25,420
you know,
southern accents and even like England,

3556
02:28:25,430 --> 02:28:27,560
like you have like,
like very,

3557
02:28:27,561 --> 02:28:28,394
very different like British accents,
which I'm sure to them sounds exactly 

3558
02:28:31,881 --> 02:28:32,661
like,
you know,

3559
02:28:32,661 --> 02:28:36,170
Texas versus versus need work.
You know,

3560
02:28:36,360 --> 02:28:38,060
just the different twain.
Yeah.

3561
02:28:38,061 --> 02:28:42,500
My friend's wife is from Liverpool and 
she was trying to explain scouse to me,

3562
02:28:42,501 --> 02:28:43,334
like the way they talk and Liverpool 
versus the way they would talk and like 

3563
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:49,190
say London and let y'all sounded English
to me.

3564
02:28:49,191 --> 02:28:52,760
You might as well be Australia.
I don't get it.

3565
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:54,980
I get the,
you sound different than me.

3566
02:28:56,090 --> 02:28:57,710
I don't get what's happening though.
I don't,

3567
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:00,860
I don't get the accent until like 
somebody like clue.

3568
02:29:01,290 --> 02:29:05,870
Like Darren tills clearly has like that 
Liverpool accent.

3569
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:08,150
It's so clear,
but I don't,

3570
02:29:08,151 --> 02:29:09,800
I still don't get it.
I don't know what it is.

3571
02:29:10,220 --> 02:29:12,440
You know,
you can say he's from London.

3572
02:29:12,440 --> 02:29:12,891
I'm like,
oh,

3573
02:29:12,891 --> 02:29:13,724
okay,
cool English because English is it like 

3574
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:18,053
that.
Or like whoever was a ringing there had 

3575
02:29:20,061 --> 02:29:20,990
like a list,
right?

3576
02:29:20,991 --> 02:29:21,824
Yes.
And so then that ended up being the 

3577
02:29:24,201 --> 02:29:25,034
people picked up as like,
was it a compliment or just how it 

3578
02:29:26,901 --> 02:29:27,734
happened because that's how things were 
like pronounced when they were being 

3579
02:29:29,991 --> 02:29:30,950
explained.
Like,

3580
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:32,113
I don't know,
maybe there's some kind of like speech 

3581
02:29:33,441 --> 02:29:36,160
impediment that went along with every 
different dialect.

3582
02:29:36,161 --> 02:29:38,400
And I mean that is what it is.
I mean with,

3583
02:29:38,450 --> 02:29:39,370
with Spain,
the,

3584
02:29:39,371 --> 02:29:43,910
the way they pronounce certain words is 
because like some fucking king somewhere

3585
02:29:43,911 --> 02:29:47,030
along the line had a lisp.
Strange,

3586
02:29:47,300 --> 02:29:50,060
strange shit.
Did you know that a place in Brazil that

3587
02:29:50,061 --> 02:29:51,440
has a list also?
I forget.

3588
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:53,570
Really?
Oh,

3589
02:29:53,580 --> 02:29:54,413
I'm not,
I'm sure there must be like different 

3590
02:29:55,131 --> 02:29:56,140
axes in Brazil.
Right?

3591
02:29:56,150 --> 02:29:59,360
Brazil is fucking huge.
I mean definitely different singsong eat

3592
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:00,950
type of tones,
tones.

3593
02:30:00,950 --> 02:30:02,510
I would say more.
Yeah.

3594
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:03,620
Did you ever,
uh,

3595
02:30:03,620 --> 02:30:04,790
train down there?
Yeah,

3596
02:30:04,791 --> 02:30:08,150
I've been down there I think three 
times,

3597
02:30:08,151 --> 02:30:11,030
four times to train to chain in the 
visit.

3598
02:30:11,031 --> 02:30:11,570
I did.
Uh,

3599
02:30:11,570 --> 02:30:14,300
uh,
I wanted big old Jujitsu tournament down

3600
02:30:14,301 --> 02:30:15,890
there before.
Yeah.

3601
02:30:15,891 --> 02:30:18,740
I think it was like Brazilian nationals,
something like that.

3602
02:30:19,010 --> 02:30:19,843
So we,
I would go down like get fully ready to 

3603
02:30:21,861 --> 02:30:24,980
train,
get there the day before and cut because

3604
02:30:24,981 --> 02:30:28,010
once you're there and then compete the 
second day I was there.

3605
02:30:28,011 --> 02:30:30,200
So the rest of it's vacation cause it's 
like once you're there,

3606
02:30:30,201 --> 02:30:33,440
all the food,
all of the like beach and like lazy,

3607
02:30:33,441 --> 02:30:36,220
like there's nothing in me that wants to
work hard as I could do.

3608
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:37,073
All I want to do is just enjoy the music
and the sounds and the people in the 

3609
02:30:40,890 --> 02:30:42,710
know how to cook down there.
Those two.

3610
02:30:42,730 --> 02:30:45,320
Haas Korea's holy shit is brilliant.

3611
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:48,560
Brilliant.
Well you guys have them in San Diego.

3612
02:30:48,561 --> 02:30:50,210
They have them everywhere now.
Thank God.

3613
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:55,660
But a style of cooking is the best.
Those skewers oversight over fire.

3614
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:57,510
That's what I'm talking about.
Meat over fire.

3615
02:30:58,060 --> 02:30:59,280
That's it.
That's it.

3616
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:01,400
And then the little sauces,
like the creations,

3617
02:31:01,401 --> 02:31:04,160
just oil and lime and,
and seasonings.

3618
02:31:04,161 --> 02:31:05,690
So good.
Talking to more,

3619
02:31:05,691 --> 02:31:06,440
you won't make,
wait.

3620
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:08,480
Oh my God.
I'll always make,

3621
02:31:08,481 --> 02:31:09,314
wait,
I'm just a little bit more dead than 

3622
02:31:10,131 --> 02:31:13,790
others.
Why is cap cut off her leg?

3623
02:31:13,820 --> 02:31:17,330
We just did two and a half hours.
Crazy time just flew by.

3624
02:31:17,500 --> 02:31:18,620
Right.
So,

3625
02:31:18,621 --> 02:31:20,190
um,
good luck.

3626
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:22,290
Good luck in.

3627
02:31:22,380 --> 02:31:25,500
I'm looking forward to seeing you fight.
Very excited and I'm glad we finally got

3628
02:31:25,501 --> 02:31:26,460

3629
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:27,810
