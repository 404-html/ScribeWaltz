1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,330
Four three,
two,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,313
one

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,550
eh,
and

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,320
we're live.
This is a bummer of a fight week,

5
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:13,830
but also an awesome fight week.
I'm very excited.

6
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:15,480
Did you see the,
the latest count down?

7
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,171
What does it,
uh,

8
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,550
all access,
what do they call it?

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,750
No embedded.
Embedded.

10
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,040
Yeah.
Try to call it with the name of those.

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,630
They're all the same but all access 
embedded 24 seven.

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,250
That is very good.
I should,

13
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,170
I should remember the name.
It's very good.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,681
They're all,
yeah,

15
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,514
they're on this,
this new one is really good cause it's 

16
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:32,184
got Max Holloway running on a treadmill,
two treadmills over from norma madoff 

17
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,870
who's also running on a treadmill and 
they're fucking very cool to each other.

18
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:40,704
It's very interesting.
It could be thanked him for taking the 

19
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,890
time when she should.
She should.

20
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:44,724
Thanks for taking the fight.
And then they have the same weight 

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,480
coach.
Like Kinda,

22
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,690
yeah,
that's crazy.

23
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:49,524
Lockhart,
right?

24
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,270
[inaudible]

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,463
card is d.
This is lockhart working with both of 

26
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:57,420
them.
So Lockhart was like,

27
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:58,254
Lockhart is legit.
Like he goes over calculations of like 

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,840
how much you weigh,
how much water you're going to take.

29
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:04,674
And he's weighing things out.
It took them an hour and a half to do 

30
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,770
the calculations.
Yeah.

31
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,150
It wasn't like,
hey,

32
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,770
we're going to wing this.
It's like,

33
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:10,971
no,
no,

34
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:11,211
no,
no,

35
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:11,461
no,
no,

36
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:11,910
no,
no.

37
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,460
We're going to do this weight cut 
correctly.

38
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,800
And he's got it down to the day,
you know,

39
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,720
like it's six days to lose.
He think he was one 71 is that,

40
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:22,060
is that the,
I was wondering what,

41
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,003
what did he start at?
Does it one 71 so I think he's got to 

42
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:29,691
lose 16 pounds.
What's crazy is when Max was on my show,

43
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,850
I was talking to him a little bit off it
and this is on record,

44
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:34,380
on let's build anything that he didn't 
say,

45
00:01:34,381 --> 00:01:35,950
but he just goes,
you know,

46
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:37,220
I've,
with the injury,

47
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,620
Jesus credit embedded I think is better 
than that.

48
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,270
UFC,
not UFC,

49
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,810
the HBO ones.
I think it's been 24 seven how dare you,

50
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,240
I think it's better than only four seven
when there's a big fight.

51
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,680
Yeah.
You know,

52
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,070
watching the generals or blah,
I think,

53
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,013
well,
I think in general they're better 

54
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:55,960
because they do more of it.
But a 24 seven they're good.

55
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,360
They're fucking good.
Very good.

56
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:58,590
Liev Schreiber.
Oh,

57
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,240
I'd love that Bro.
Watch her words on that guy.

58
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,350
But I like these better.
Remember I only cat leach driver.

59
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,213
Yeah.
Was like till night hair wingo but it 

60
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,770
was nowhere near as.
Yeah,

61
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,623
it was horrible.
I find this because there's almost no 

62
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:13,500
narration,
right?

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,450
Yeah.
It's almost just,

64
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,540
it tells a story.
Footage.

65
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:16,374
I want to see the footage.
I would have liked the video of when 

66
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,040
they called Max with the fight,
cause from what I heard,

67
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,874
he goes,
it could be that stuff's getting the 

68
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:22,380
world.

69
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,430
Fuck yeah,
let's go.

70
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,110
What?
Just insane.

71
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:25,890
I was like,
oh,

72
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,470
why don't they have a video of that?
But no one knew.

73
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,640
I don't think they knew,
you know,

74
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,430
to to turn the video on.
I don't think Max knew whether they were

75
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:37,080
calling him amazing video of him,
especially if he wins.

76
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,780
This is my thing with Max is I think 
could be,

77
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:42,330
was the toughest fight in the world on 
six days notice.

78
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,193
I'd rather fight anybody else in the 
world and could be one six days because 

79
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,770
this style in just his tenacity,
but with Max win,

80
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:50,604
lose or draw,
whatever happens Saturday night if you 

81
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:55,380
don't respect.
And like him even more after this,

82
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,980
you're a moron,
you're a champions on abroad and like

83
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,880
Max Holloway's on that would be willing 
to take this fight on six days notice.

84
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,240
And also I should say coming off of a 
broken foot.

85
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,133
Correct.
So he had a pull out of a fight with a 

86
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,860
broken foot with Frankie Edgar.
What's just happened?

87
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,550
So I mean,
how healed izzy and then like it said on

88
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,480
my show,
he was saying,

89
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,310
you know,
I've been doing some Jujitsu,

90
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,144
been the swing of things for me,
it's good because I haven't been balls 

91
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,804
deep into training.
I've been just been a little just to 

92
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,640
know getting a light workout,
but it gives me time with my family.

93
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,800
And he goes,
which NGOs,

94
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,210
you know this in camp,
you're present but you're not,

95
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,680
which is true.
And he goes,

96
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,030
you know,
so I'm going through it.

97
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,130
I'm,
I'm with my son in the family,

98
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,720
but I'm thinking about something else.
He goes,

99
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:40,570
so this has been good for me to really 
focus on my family.

100
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,310
That was what,
two weeks ago?

101
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,840
Three weeks ago.
Wow.

102
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,703
So then pay him you're fighting could be
even the reason why he wants to fight 

103
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:47,134
Khabib is cause he thinks could be the 
best pound for pound fighter in the 

104
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,134
world.
Yeah.

105
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,300
And which is nuts because you know when 
you look at it could be dresnick.

106
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,430
It's good.
It's,

107
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:54,971
it's,
it's,

108
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:58,360
it doesn't blow your hair back.
He's 25 and Oh for God's sake it's good.

109
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,700
But it's not like all this crazy,
you know,

110
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,520
big names on his regular.
But you talked,

111
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,680
I was just in San Jose.
John Fitch goes,

112
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,540
dude,
and this is John Fitch.

113
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
Yeah.
You know it could be,

114
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,270
you know,
welterweight goat.

115
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,430
He's fucking not cope.
He's got damn good.

116
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,503
He goes,
I've never seen anyone my lifetime like 

117
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,230
could be.
He goes,

118
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:19,090
I fought GSP in his prime.
He would beat him.

119
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,560
That's how good he is.

120
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,110
DC said he's the pound for pound.
Greatest fighter he's ever seen.

121
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,483
DC said that he had fights with them 
like dcs was the heavyweights 

122
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:29,950
strikeforce champion.
He said,

123
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,671
he goes,
dude,

124
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,650
we got to war.
We go to war war.

125
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,270
Like imagine that DC's a willa,
he's jacked.

126
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,800
I mean DC's got some body fat on him.
He's strong as a fucking ox.

127
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:42,634
You see soak at downtown.
So fun to watch when DC throws Josh 

128
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,150
Barnett through the air when they fought
strikeforce,

129
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,650
you just go,
Jesus,

130
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,430
when we need to handle fight was 
offensive.

131
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,710
That goddamn American,
it was offensive.

132
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,010
He ragdolled Hendo and couldn't be a 
cooler guy like the nicest guy ever.

133
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,540
DC might be the nicest fighter of all 
time.

134
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,900
One of my favorite people here,
Max,

135
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,880
they're up there.
I love them from Isis fighters.

136
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,280
I don't know Max as well as I would 
know.

137
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,113
Do you see,
because I've done so many shows with 

138
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:11,734
them,
but for DC as good as he is to say that 

139
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,080
him and Khabib go to war.
I'm like,

140
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,070
that's crazy to Josh Thompson is the cap
ne Kay said,

141
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,760
you know Ed Ruth Penn state and three 
time national champion freak.

142
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,110
Just aren't doing it.
My main belt door,

143
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,270
complete freak wrestling.
He,

144
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:31,390
I was in San Jose and he,
I did a show with him and I go,

145
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,224
what were you doing?
He goes,

146
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,040
I just came from practice.
Could be second class practice and go,

147
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,920
what was he doing?
He goes,

148
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,390
oh,
just straight wrestling.

149
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:37,751
I said,
uh,

150
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:38,800
who was your wrestling?
He was said,

151
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:39,320
Ruth,
I,

152
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,770
oh my God,
the Penn state like legend.

153
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:42,604
He goes,
yeah man,

154
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,050
how's that go down?
And he's like,

155
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,050
only one of them's gone down.
And it could be like,

156
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,810
what ruth?
And he goes,

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,621
oh,
he goes,

158
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:51,400
Bro,
it,

159
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,390
I've never seen anything like it.
So there's just this legend of five.

160
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,860
They skipped when they tell me,
it scares me like Jesus.

161
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,920
Well,
what do we get to see it in action?

162
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:01,754
When you saw the Barboza fight,
he's walking towards him like a Zombie 

163
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,040
gets a hold of them.
And just rag dolls.

164
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:07,874
I'm just rag dolls.
But this is what's great about this 

165
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,680
fight and that's what makes our sport so
specialists.

166
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,310
Yeah,
I'm super bummed.

167
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,890
I've been in deep depression because 
Ferguson fell out,

168
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,933
and we've talked about this off here,
but our sports so special because what 

169
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,150
Max Holloway has the chance to do 
Saturday night,

170
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,820
if he can beat him,
if he can somehow pull that out.

171
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,770
There's nothing like in professional 
sports.

172
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,170
There's nothing like it.
If Lebron goes out,

173
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,060
the team still goes on.
It's whatever.

174
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,620
If Tom Brady gets hurt,
it sucked,

175
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:36,830
but they still play here.
You know man,

176
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:40,160
Max has a huge chance now are the odds 
stacked against him?

177
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:41,390
Good God.
Are they ever,

178
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,860
there couldn't be a worst matchup for 
him,

179
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,100
but it,
what's the one Achilles heel if there is

180
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:49,430
one for Khabib,
a guy who can strike going backwards.

181
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,130
Max Salaries Pretty fucking good at 
going backwards.

182
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,280
Yeah,
it's,

183
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,500
it's a fascinating fight.
If there was no controversy,

184
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,660
if it wasn't like six day time period 
for hand,

185
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,780
great.
Yeah,

186
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,750
I know.
It's kind of cool.

187
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,860
You don't have to fight.
That's been like,

188
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,440
that was a nate when nate took on connor
and the first,

189
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,880
here's the difference though.
Nate's the bigger guy,

190
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,490
right?
Nate's the bigger guy,

191
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,010
the more seasoned guy there.
So for nate,

192
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:13,761
it's like,
yeah,

193
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,430
it was short notice,
but that's a rough matchup for connor.

194
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,680
Connor.
It should be an underdog in that fight.

195
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,030
They wouldn't find it at the same weight
class.

196
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,520
So that makes a little more sense.
But wait a minute.

197
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:25,400
They do nate.
Nate fights at 55 uh,

198
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:26,900
before that though,
he's fighting at 70,

199
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:27,441
right?
Oh No,

200
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:27,711
no,
no.

201
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,544
He only fought three times at seven.
But he saw that seventies the point he 

202
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,940
fired a college never fought at 70.

203
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,490
Right.
But if con when Carter fought him at 70,

204
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,680
that was Saturday.
Yeah.

205
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,700
[inaudible] 70 pounder.
Right.

206
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:38,600
But I mean,
nate,

207
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,240
when he fought 70 it didn't go well.
I mean,

208
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,080
who did he fight?
He fought Rory Macdonald.

209
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:46,190
70 tough.
Who else did he fight?

210
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,900
We will see if I had 70 his fights at 70
I think wasn't great at,

211
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,753
no,
he didn't lose all of them was in grade 

212
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:53,960
one.
Wasn't great at 70.

213
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:54,860
How,
but the thing is,

214
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,400
he's the bigger man.
He's,

215
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,273
he's a bigger guy.
But if they agreed to fight at one 55 

216
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,920
and he would make the one 55 weight,
100% yes,

217
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:03,754
it's,
there was all this talk about him being 

218
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,320
so much bigger than conor.
Oh,

219
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:07,970
he's bigger for sure.
He's taller,

220
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,610
he's taller,
he's a major,

221
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,483
he's a bigger guy.
It's around heavier when he gets 

222
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,674
heavier,
but when they fight at 55 he makes that 

223
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:15,020
weight.

224
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,853
And Connor makes that weight tough too.
They both struggled to make one 55 it's 

225
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:24,350
a much easier cut for counter at 55 it's
not the hardest cut.

226
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,213
But when you look at the difference 
between how he looks physically when he 

227
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:29,510
fought nate at one 70 and how he looks 
when he's,

228
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,760
you know,
one 45 he was awful.

229
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,900
I was going to say he's on,
Donna can make one 45 nate could nav.

230
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,890
I mean there's,
there's no show me could've made it.

231
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,090
We got his leg ultimate fighter when he 
was killed.

232
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,950
A leg off.
You don't have to like real list.

233
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:44,150
He's not making 40 was very thin during 
the ultimate fighter days.

234
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,880
Remember we have to be a fighter,
right?

235
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,250
So you have to make weight basically 
three times in a row.

236
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,870
Well,
I just think he filled in too.

237
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:52,220
I mean,
he was really young back then.

238
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,650
100% but you have to maintain a lower 
weight.

239
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,790
That's the closest fight to it though.
I agree with that fight.

240
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,970
The same kind of balls that nate has is 
like what?

241
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,240
What?
But Max,

242
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,103
the difference is that like Max has 
taken on a guy that everybody's 

243
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:08,934
avoiding.
No one's been able to solve the riddle 

244
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,114
of Khabib.
No one's even ever even put them in 

245
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,660
jeopardy.
Like he's,

246
00:09:14,661 --> 00:09:18,020
he's like the Johnson hit him.
But that really wasn't in a while.

247
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,863
It was going a bit,
we were talking about that the other 

248
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,753
day.
Who knows what was going on in that 

249
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:23,400
fight because that was a fight where he 
had the same issue,

250
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:26,550
cutting weight that he did when he had 
to pull out of the Ferguson fight.

251
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,830
His body shut down.
Right.

252
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,003
So who knows?
He had that same issue with the Michael 

253
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,010
j.
He might've been severely compromised in

254
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,530
that fight,
even though he beat the fuck out of.

255
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,383
Agree.
The difference between Mcgregor and 

256
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,640
Dheas is the both keep it on the feet 
really,

257
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:39,150
right?
Yeah.

258
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,730
He has a phenomenal boxer comes 
phenomenal striker,

259
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,713
Max Holloway.
Phenomenal striker could be phenomenal 

260
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,500
grappler.
So it's a,

261
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,260
it's even more of a task because could 
be,

262
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:49,720
he was not going to sit there and strike
with him.

263
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,180
That's your one way to win.
Cool.

264
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,760
I'm the best grappler on earth.
Yeah.

265
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,650
He'll entertain it for a little bit,
but if you,

266
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:56,484
if you want you down,
there's literally no one in the world 

267
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,890
from,
I'll say one 55 to one 17 he's not going

268
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:03,630
to take that.
I want to see,

269
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,553
I really want to see him in some 
straight grappling competition here in 

270
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,460
this.
Yeah.

271
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,640
Hearing that about how amazing he is in 
the training room.

272
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,350
I'll tell you what,
from a guy like dc,

273
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,191
I know,
and,

274
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,120
and,
and Fitch,

275
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,600
I mean you're talking about in the hall,
like pioneers of the sport animals.

276
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,770
I want to see him against Woodley 70 I 
think 70 is his natural weight class.

277
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,843
Yeah,
I think he'd probably be a lot 

278
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:25,830
healthier.
Imagine that.

279
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,800
Imagine being stronger and healthcare.
It Woodley and Khabib.

280
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,560
Jesus what?
But Woodley's at different thing man,

281
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,720
you,
you miss you,

282
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:33,554
you fuck up and you,
you leave yourself in a position to get 

283
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,800
hit with one of those nuclear bombs.
Oh knock you out.

284
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,490
Woodley could put people to sleep and he
can grab was acid rap his ass off,

285
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,580
hard to take down and puts people to 
sleep with one shot.

286
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,050
I don't think he gets his due.
And I think the best evidence is the two

287
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:49,884
fights that people point to where they 
say that like Woodley should have done 

288
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:54,510
better.
Those are the Thompson fights.

289
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,660
The end of my,
the my fight.

290
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,320
But Maya,
it never got hurt.

291
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,303
Like he,
he hit my a bunch of times but it was 

292
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:02,580
uneventful cause he was hurt.

293
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,130
Woodley was her early in the first round
with the shoulder.

294
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,680
He fucked his shoulder up.
But honestly,

295
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,170
my the,
we should fight my,

296
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:11,670
if you don't want to go to the ground 
100% but my point is in those two fights

297
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,490
with Thompson Woodley was the one who 
hurt Thompson.

298
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,780
He hurt him that bad in both fights.
Almost stopped him in both fights.

299
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,220
Yeah.
I don't see them ever of again,

300
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,860
but I hear you.
Great fight hard path.

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,180
It was a crazy UFC 200 card and that was
on it.

302
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,410
I wouldn't be mad.
I mean,

303
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:32,130
he's one of the dough as a main event.
I get it.

304
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,590
I get it.
I like twice.

305
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,551
Wow.
Cool.

306
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:35,940
Yeah.
No,

307
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,120
that's a super complicated equation.
Upset,

308
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,730
upset though.
They're just not good dance and the same

309
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:43,500
thing.
If they just said no,

310
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,380
this time it's going to be different.
I'm going to war.

311
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,140
[inaudible]

312
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,540
fuck you.
And then two rounds and you like bastard

313
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,330
is circling each other.
That's like Dana on Ferguson and Khabib.

314
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,164
He's like,
that fights never happened to a fifth 

315
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,120
time not happening.
I'm like,

316
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,980
I get it.
I get it,

317
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,450
man.
It's such a bummer though.

318
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,313
Let's talk business like I don't know 
how many paper views this was going to 

319
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,210
do,
but for the hardcore fans,

320
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,044
this was a big one.
This was a big one because this is the 

321
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:12,910
first time Khabib is finding a guy 
that's super versatile.

322
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,110
They can fight.
Standing up,

323
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:14,944
can knock you out with one shot.
Tough is fuck has incredible endurance 

324
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:21,330
and can grab off his back and the most 
dangerous guy could be will ever face.

325
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,183
Yeah.
Tony Ferguson has the perfect style to 

326
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:28,960
test what was so we could really find 
out where could bebes Zach cause we know

327
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:32,290
we're Tony's at we and we kind of know 
where could bebes at do we?

328
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,363
We kind of do.
We said the Barboza fight in my opinion 

329
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:37,030
was the best example of it.
Dos Santos.

330
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,230
Dot.
Los Angeles was great.

331
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:39,490
It's old school.
Dos Anjos.

332
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,413
That's a dose.
Angeles also compromise to make one 55 

333
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:45,170
right dose Angeles,
they wants 70 different animal.

334
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:46,004
That's a different fucking animal.
That's a totally different piece and 

335
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:49,114
that I think dos Anjos is one of those 
guys where you point to a perfect 

336
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:53,254
example of a guy whose body just was not
allowing him to compete at one 55 

337
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,513
agrees.
He's an,

338
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,770
he's a fucking animal in his mind.
I mean he,

339
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,430
no one works harder than that guy.
You see that guy trained,

340
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,283
but yes,
I have you seen in person [inaudible] 

341
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,210
monster,
however.

342
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,840
And how about he's fighting Colby 
Covington in Brazil and Brazil.

343
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,610
Troy that colby,
good luck.

344
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:13,780
Call me.
Good God.

345
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,550
Security.
Security,

346
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,773
super hard to take down.
Real hard to take down and pour rootle 

347
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,640
leg kicks and I don't know,
he said,

348
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:22,710
well I fucking,
yeah,

349
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,230
what?

350
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,600
90 minute but video he's been doing 
every day,

351
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:26,434
but his legs are gigantic.
Rumpy romp that Brazilian shit or on of 

352
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,060
his just he,
I don't know what squats,

353
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,470
front squats,
dude,

354
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:37,120
I don't know what kind of crazy shit 
he's doing.

355
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,930
I know he did some training in the past 
a lot with nick.

356
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,880
Curse on at a speed of sport.
Nick helped him quite a bit.

357
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,223
Nicks,
you know the Marvin Marinovich a 

358
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,480
disciple and he does all that crazy shit
than marv had bj doing.

359
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,910
He was doing,
he's got a ton of videos online though.

360
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,910
[inaudible] working with Perello.
Jason Parillo.

361
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,990
Yeah.
I don't know.

362
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,890
Is he still Sanchez and I got to think 
EAC.

363
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,470
I remem I remember seeing him at the 
root.

364
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,320
Could Jason Parillo the greatest coach 
of all?

365
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,180
Like he's like,
you're having problems with the career.

366
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:05,014
Come here and just being cyborg.
I mean just these monsters and you know 

367
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:09,400
what?

368
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,233
Good Dude,
great gun and doesn't want the 

369
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:13,540
spotlight.
Zero.

370
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,480
You didn't want to be out on camera.
Doesn't want anything done.

371
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,970
When I was telling him,
I think he's doing a great job,

372
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,110
dude.
Shakes your hand.

373
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,360
Looks you in the eye.
Like he's right there.

374
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,590
He's right there.
Thank you.

375
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,920
He's like write to any,
won't work with just tenure either,

376
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,763
which is what I like.
I like what he did with bisping help 

377
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:30,570
bisbing a lot.
We became world champion.

378
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,050
Yeah.
I mean he's,

379
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,060
he's a fucking great coat.
Back to Khabib.

380
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:34,923
You know who I think,
and I'm not just saying this because 

381
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,713
he's my boy of known for it,
but you knew who I think could be his 

382
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:40,234
Achilles heel.
Who matches up better with them than 

383
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,710
anyone who everyone's overlooking.
Brian Ortega.

384
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,850
Ooh,
that's a good point.

385
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,743
Brian would take is a big dude at 55 
easy weight cut for him and put him on 

386
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,040
the ground on the ground.

387
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,480
He's the most dangerous guy in the world
right now.

388
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,800
Yeah,
I think so too.

389
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,560
I think the way he locks up submissions,
it's very different.

390
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,603
It's like if everybody else is hitting 
it at a seven or an eight or take his 

391
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,960
hit into that 10 where you watching,
you go,

392
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,823
oh,
that's different and you haven't seen 

393
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:06,610
it.
So it could be who he's,

394
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,770
how he's grappled fricking grizzly bears
since he was four.

395
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,950
He and he seen Sabo,
he seen black belt in Jujitsu.

396
00:15:12,951 --> 00:15:15,420
He's seen all this stuff.
You're not going to catch them with oric

397
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,263
take.
It's a little different and he actually 

398
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,920
encourages you to go to the ground and 
he's,

399
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,350
he's dangerous on his feet,
but on the grounds where he thrives.

400
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,650
Isn't it funny how that thing about 
going to the ground?

401
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:26,180
What does a bride says?
Our tag or wrote for the record,

402
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:29,060
Dana called me yesterday to see if I had
stepping against Khabib since Max hadn't

403
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:29,600
responded yet.

404
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,140
I said yes.
Eventually Max replied and gay.

405
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,730
Dana gave him the fight.
If all goes according to plan,

406
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,220
I'll get my turn at both of them.
Ooh,

407
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,383
it's phenomenal.
Fight.

408
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,370
Fine.
Just stylistically I went,

409
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,620
Ooh,
and if I'm could be,

410
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,980
could be goes,
why would I fight?

411
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:43,814
Our tell was phenomenal fighter,
but he didn't have a belt in a big name 

412
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,110
and it's the most dangerous site for 
him,

413
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
I think,
and it's,

414
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,243
it's also mean or tag.
It became a much bigger star with the 

415
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:54,230
Frankie Edgar knockout.
Much bigger star,

416
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,270
but it's a ways to go.
Yeah.

417
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,240
Max Holloway is one of the best fighters
on the planet.

418
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,420
That's a really interesting fight.
Tor or take has got,

419
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,450
there's something about his Jujitsu.
It's like,

420
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:06,284
it's on.
It just ramped up and sharpened down to 

421
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:12,500
like such a,
just a razor's edge man.

422
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,370
When he grabs a hold of stuff you like,
you have very little room to get out,

423
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,443
you know,
and he sets it up from the clinch and 

424
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:19,994
it's a very unconventional and the head 
snap switch like Tony Ferguson and the 

425
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,930
dark jokes where he does he know snap 
city.

426
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,123
However,
why I wanted to see in this ferguson 

427
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:31,480
could be fight with the snap city is 
like Josh Thomson Fitch or like,

428
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,353
oh no,
we've never seen could be because his 

429
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:36,410
neck snapped down ever that it's for 
him.

430
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,490
It's a pride thing.
Grown up where he grew up there.

431
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,910
No one snaps his neck down.
He'd known snapping them down.

432
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,940
It doesn't work.
Well that's Tony Steam.

433
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:47,120
They go watch,
watch.

434
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,090
No one's ever snap at his neck down.
Avar wow.

435
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,360
Yeah.
That's so crazy.

436
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,080
It's like nursing him lose around.
Like why,

437
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,300
what are we doing?
These goddamn legends,

438
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,060
people like this and I'm drinking the 
Koolaid.

439
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,860
I'm drinking it too.
I'm so into this.

440
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,670
Will wear that hat Saturday night.
So yeah.

441
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,310
Damn.
I'm,

442
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,660
I'm fascinated,
I'm fascinated by this fight.

443
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,853
I'm always fascinated when could be 
fights because you're always wondering 

444
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:12,704
like what's the first guy that's going 
to be able to give him something 

445
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:15,470
different?

446
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,550
See,
I look at it different.

447
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:17,930
I look at it like,
all right,

448
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:19,920
I hear all this crazy talk about could 
be,

449
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,840
let's see it.
Like I wanna see,

450
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,610
I wanna see that pound for pound 
greatness out of them.

451
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,473
Let me get it when you don't,
you think you saw it in the Barboza 

452
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,400
fighting?
No.

453
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,710
I think Barboza is one dimensional.
I think,

454
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,360
uh,
I think we did see,

455
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,660
and I think people are taken for granted
how good could be both a grappler is,

456
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:38,120
cause you talked to Frankie talked to 
Eddie Alvarez.

457
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,043
I go,
how hard is it take down Barboza they 

458
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:40,850
go,
oh,

459
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,620
it's damn near impossible.
And Training.

460
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,960
Like we don't get them down very easily 
and they're bad asses.

461
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,500
Right?
So you'll,

462
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,810
what could be did we didn't think he was
gonna be able to do.

463
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,850
And if you look at that third round,
Barboza is like,

464
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,300
he gets taken down and he's like kind of
cage crawling.

465
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,133
You look at his face,
he looks like get me the fuck out of 

466
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,124
here.
Like there's sheer panic and that's the 

467
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:02,340
difference drink could be and the rest 
of these fighters,

468
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,293
that's why it's the worst of fight them 
on short notice because it's not going 

469
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:06,830
to be fast.
You know,

470
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,560
it's not going to be fun for you.
It's a smashing it.

471
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,170
I feel like the brain,
we've seen the pound for pound greatness

472
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,910
in him,
like the potential for it,

473
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,830
but we need to see him against pound for
pound greats.

474
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,650
Well that's how you get get there,
but you have to show up Connor Aldo.

475
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,100
Right,
right,

476
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,933
right.
That quick knockout or DC Gustin Jon 

477
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,451
Jones,
DC,

478
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:28,284
like there are certain times in your 
career where you have the signature 

479
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,100
wins.
He doesn't have a signature win.

480
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,090
Right.
Well,

481
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,190
I think the Barboza is as close as you 
can get.

482
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,220
But Barbara was his lost to a few guys.
He lost it.

483
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:38,070
Tony,
he got darks,

484
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:40,050
choked and plus cowboy.
Yup.

485
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,170
Yup.
But he's also very one dimensional.

486
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,240
Yeah.
Phenomenal on the ground.

487
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,120
He's a good anti wrestler.
His strikings phenomenal,

488
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,750
but overall package and that that is the
difference,

489
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:52,584
right.
Is the really good guys always 

490
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:55,980
threatened takedowns always threatened 
submissions.

491
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,460
He just doesn't do that.
He,

492
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,800
he stands up and he's a specialist 
standup,

493
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,673
but I mean standup is wicked and he's 
got some of the best stand up in the 

494
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:04,580
world for sure.
Uh,

495
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,543
in mma,
I mean Barboza so fast to such a 

496
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,650
wonderboy barboza the write up there 
during till,

497
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,663
yeah.
Darren till in wonderboy is going to be 

498
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:15,480
a mug there.
Fucker.

499
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,890
How about wonder boy?
I saw a quote coming in here we goes,

500
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,960
who's been not that impressive there 
until,

501
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,360
who is he?

502
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,193
I'm like,
did you learn nothing from the cowboy 

503
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:25,020
fight?
Even I learned from that.

504
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,190
I talked to you,
I was like,

505
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:27,390
man,
why would calve we take this,

506
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,373
I don't really know who Darren till is 
and then my inbox is flooded with shit 

507
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,930
and even did until went off on me and I 
look at my like,

508
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,280
oh my God,
this guy's a monster.

509
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,143
He's an animal.
Doesn't have a gorilla tattoo or 

510
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:39,690
something.
Does he?

511
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:40,524
He's got gorillas all over is like uses 
it and his screen name and twitter w 

512
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,880
well,
he's a gorilla.

513
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,960
He's a credible ever pool is a bad 
motherfucker.

514
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,670
Wonderboy who's rehabbing is thumps and 
it's just like,

515
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,440
alright,
if you want this,

516
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,320
and then what happens if,
let's say wonderboy were to win,

517
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,660
which I don't think he is,
unfortunately.

518
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,200
Let's say I don't,
you think I'm on the sales team?

519
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,391
I just,
yeah,

520
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:03,570
I think there's this kind of Darren 
[inaudible] Dick ride a little bit right

521
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:04,500
now.
Ron,

522
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,570
hard Dick Riding on Khabib till there's 
a few guys.

523
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,250
DC always conroy's always brian or 
Tayga.

524
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,370
I did ride mighty mouse for sure.
Yeah,

525
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:18,171
you do Dick,
right?

526
00:20:18,171 --> 00:20:20,520
That guy.
I think he's been that way forever.

527
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,170
I think he's the best.
I mean,

528
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,530
that's fair.
He needs a guy is a challenge him.

529
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,000
Is He fighting?
So hudl again,

530
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,490
who I love,
so Hutto but it's like that.

531
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,160
Do you guys hate fucking money?
That shit's ridiculous.

532
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,540
I mean,
so who knows a beast?

533
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,360
No doubt about it.
And I love what so Hutto did,

534
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,470
uh,
against uh,

535
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,490
Wilson Hayes.
I was like,

536
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:40,170
Holy Shit.
This is like a different,

537
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:41,850
so who does it looks like a karate 
champion.

538
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:42,684
Yeah.
Get all that.

539
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,800
Did you see what mighty mouse did?
You went right through him.

540
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,131
Oh,
you,

541
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:46,900
oh,
you're a black belt.

542
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,150
Cool.
He Jewish on bar and Bar and what he did

543
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:49,970
to,
so who does,

544
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,803
oh,
you like to clinch check these out to 

545
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,740
the Olympics.
That's very cool.

546
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:56,890
Check this knee.
Ouncer needs the body as fat.

547
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,710
I grabbed him once,
just joking around playing.

548
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,930
He hit me in the body with a niece so 
fast.

549
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,840
He was confusing.
It was a confusing.

550
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,400
Where'd that come from?
Like I go,

551
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,293
I go,
I got ya.

552
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,780
He turns out,
hey man,

553
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,730
that's not supposed to go that quick 
like this supposed to be.

554
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,683
I see you move.
I get to think that this might come my 

555
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,140
way.
Here it is.

556
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,063
No,
it was already there different before I 

557
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,520
realized he was doing it.
He's so fucking fast.

558
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,383
Why did,
do we know why the tj fights aren't 

559
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:25,420
going down?
Dude?

560
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:25,900
I don't know.

561
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,900
But that one bums me out that that is a,
that's a fucking gigantic super fight.

562
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,810
Like why wouldn't he take that fight?
Well,

563
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:35,644
first of all,
mighty mouse right now is rehabbing 

564
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,700
shoulder surgery.
So it's going to be a while.

565
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,650
He was doing those,
you know that both thing.

566
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:44,740
They do that flexy thing.
He was doing some of those exercises the

567
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,480
other day on instagram.
I'm looking at him like,

568
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,100
okay,
that's a guy that's got like,

569
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:50,320
he's got some scar tissue to work out.
Like that's not,

570
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,180
that's not healed up.
Did he get surgery?

571
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,200
Yeah,
he got surgery.

572
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,350
So he's out for a little bit and Tj 
probably doesn't want to wait.

573
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,580
I don't know if that's what the case is.
I don't know what the case is.

574
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,500
I mean,
shoulder surgery six months.

575
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,180
I mean,
so you wait three months,

576
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:06,220
then you have a three month camp,
you know?

577
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,170
I mean if they wouldn't announce it yet,
right.

578
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,801
No,
I mean,

579
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,180
I don't even know.
You can't even say that because teaching

580
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:13,790
isn't going to harm.
You might not be able to go if you,

581
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,093
Matt Hume and mighty mouse are about as 
smart as it gets when it comes to 

582
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,234
preparation.
So there's no way they would take that 

583
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:21,664
fight of his shoulder wasn't 100% any 
fight and risk his legacy because he 

584
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:25,294
loses that fight and was like told Ya 
and they wouldn't go hard early to test 

585
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,860
it.
They would let it.

586
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,233
We'll look at what Whitley's been out a 
little bit because of his shoulder he 

587
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,620
got,
yeah,

588
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,270
he was in here like right after he got 
it.

589
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,450
He said he's going to heal up quick.
Yeah,

590
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,700
and he might prp all that.
Yeah.

591
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:43,534
He's going to do all the PRP.
You know this as much different 

592
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,100
therapies.

593
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,550
Cryo I'm sure it was probably still 
takes a while even with all our advanced

594
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:53,440
stem cell,
but not now.

595
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:54,274
He's forced to fight and I,
I see what the UFC is doing where they 

596
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:57,394
do it.
Interim Belt tween Colbian dos Anjos 

597
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,270
where the,
you know,

598
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:02,680
it's an interim belt.
So now woodley,

599
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,370
you literally have to fight the winner 
of this jam.

600
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,850
Have to fight them.
It's a very sneaky,

601
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,080
may have a belt.
What are you going to do?

602
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,310
You want a super fight?
Nope.

603
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,980
This guy's a belt.
I get both sides here.

604
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,670
If it stills Angeles,
Los Angeles Beats Colby dos,

605
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,080
Santos,
lightweight champion,

606
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:19,260
now welterweight champion.
But to me it takes me,

607
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,630
right,
great.

608
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,440
You can have dos Anjos sitting there 
with two belts on shoulders.

609
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,723
I mean,
and then what do you do with Dan until 

610
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:27,340
let's say he,
for whatever reason,

611
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,200
walks through wonderboy,
which is,

612
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,840
you know,
tough to do but say walks through it,

613
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:32,650
which would lead,
you know,

614
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,710
struggled a little bit,
walks through him and one of boys,

615
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:36,544
the number one guy now dead until jumps 
up to number one or is dose antral work 

616
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:40,540
that way?

617
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,790
Because the ratings are fucking screwy,
man.

618
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,253
Sometimes I see a guy who,
a guy and then that guy who he beat is 

619
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,580
still ranked ahead of him there a 
nightmare.

620
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,280
All they are.
All the writings do now.

621
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,610
It almost hurts if you're a guy like 
sean shelby or Dana trying to make these

622
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:57,830
matchups cause guy who's at fourth year,
Hey,

623
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:59,180
wanting to fight 70 he's like,
no,

624
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:00,650
he's seven.
I have nothing to gain from that.

625
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,050
Where before it was like,
Hey,

626
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:04,070
we want you to fight this guy.
He's a name,

627
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:05,450
he's on some fight,
win streak.

628
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,850
We don't know what ranking is,
but we know he's damn good.

629
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,970
So you guys were more willing to take it
now they,

630
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,300
nope,
he's seven.

631
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:12,740
What?
I want a number one.

632
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,870
Exactly.
I need three four you know?

633
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,340
Yeah.
That's weird.

634
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,533
It hurts us.
It's also weird like the UFC could just 

635
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,770
did they just decide who's fighting.

636
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,633
I mean it's the whole thing.
The business is so interesting because 

637
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:28,580
it's like they decide who's fighting.
They decide who's champion.

638
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:29,480
They decide,
Tony,

639
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,890
you're not champion anymore.
I'm going to strip yet.

640
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,770
It's like put it,
I fell.

641
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,340
I don't want this to happen.
Fox Studios,

642
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:39,070
I just do.
I twist my knee,

643
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,510
but he was working for the UFC when he 
fell.

644
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,840
I mean he's doing his,
his obligations,

645
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:47,750
his press obligated.
It's very strange to strip him of a belt

646
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:48,584
when he never lost it.
And here's the longest winning streak 

647
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,103
and then and mean,
but also you have no belt can because 

648
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,740
there's no belt can be what's going to 
take the belt.

649
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:58,574
They're going to make up a belt and then
calm or has the belt at 55 so what do 

650
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:02,210
you do with that belt?
Well,

651
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,250
what they're planning on doing,
I believe,

652
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,830
and now they've kind of let the cat out 
of the bag cause they said it's going to

653
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:08,030
be for the world lightweight title.

654
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,660
They were going to strip connor the 
moment something happened,

655
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,733
like the moment the fight started,
that's when they were gonna Strip 

656
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:15,494
connor.
Because if they'd stripped him 

657
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:18,104
beforehand,
then what happens if Tony doesn't make 

658
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,880
weight or something totally mixed out of
could be,

659
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:25,280
doesn't make weight,
then what the fuck?

660
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:26,930
Do you have a concern then you have 
nothing.

661
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,090
I mean you already stripped him.
We're going to give it back to him.

662
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,380
You gotta give it back to them now if 
you,

663
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,630
so if he wants to fight again now,
he's not the champion anymore.

664
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,380
The fuck kind of Shit is strange.
So they waited and the idea was to wait,

665
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:38,360
but now they're in a desperado 
situation.

666
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,160
Strange Rato belt on the line.
That'll yet fucking April fool's.

667
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,960
April fool's day,
it happens.

668
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,450
I didn't believe a God damn word of it.
Jimmy Smits starts texting me.

669
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:48,410
I'm like,
fuck that dude.

670
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,300
I'm not falling for it.
Jamie texted me.

671
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,440
I'm like,
I'm not falling for it.

672
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,730
You texted me,
you go,

673
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:54,350
Bro,
it's April fools.

674
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:55,280
I'm like,
no,

675
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,660
but Dana,
I sent data,

676
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,663
released a video and he's listening.
I'm sure he likes a good April fool's 

677
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:03,410
joke,
but what he likes more his money and pay

678
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:05,240
per view buys.
You can't honey dick.

679
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,850
The fans are like psych.
It's back on.

680
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,790
People are going to be pissed and it'd 
be biased.

681
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,420
That's a good point.
I didn't buy it.

682
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,850
I still was like,
maybe it's just an elaborate pr scam.

683
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,650
I didn't even tweet about it until the 
next day.

684
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,690
I know I was tweeting about other shed 
people like,

685
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:18,620
what the fuck,
Bro,

686
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,360
this is go down.
You're not even tweeting about.

687
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,440
And like,
I'm not,

688
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,640
I'm not,
I'm not going to do it.

689
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,503
I'm gonna check it out.
I checked with you and then I checked 

690
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:25,940
with,
uh,

691
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,550
Josh Thompson who works closely with,
uh,

692
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,160
could be,
and then boom,

693
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,300
there's my two main guys.

694
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,860
And I went,
all right Ariel,

695
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,210
that's all aerial tweet.
I'm like,

696
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,100
God,
he's like the journalist.

697
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:39,290
I'm a,
I'm an ass clown.

698
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,690
He's a legit journalist.
He is the credibility summit,

699
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,850
Bro.
Is this really goes,

700
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,890
I would never joke around like that,
Brendan.

701
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,050
I'm like,
he's right.

702
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,270
Well,
I went straight to his Jujitsu coach.

703
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:53,160
I called Eddie,
talked to him on the phone.

704
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,710
So an Eddie gave me the full rundown of 
what happened with Tony.

705
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,670
It's like he saw somebody and he turned 
to say hi to somebody,

706
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:05,910
didn't see some wires on the ground,
tripped over some wires,

707
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,953
and just blew his shit out.
And Eddie was on the podcast yesterday 

708
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,870
and Eddie was saying that Tony wanted to
fight or day before yesterday.

709
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,660
Tony wanted to fight,
they wouldn't let him fight.

710
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,860
Yeah.
His,

711
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:19,740
his ligament is torn lcl around the 
bone,

712
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,360
which is rare,
which is hard to do.

713
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,590
I don't want,
where's that one?

714
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,810
Lateral,
lateral whatever.

715
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,880
Collateral Ligament,
some shit.

716
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,440
Anyways.
But do you think,

717
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:28,921
uh,
it would,

718
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:29,131
uh,
if,

719
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:30,810
if,
if it went tripping off that,

720
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:33,600
is that a freak accident or do you think
it would have went during the fight?

721
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,280
It's hard to say.
Oh,

722
00:27:35,281 --> 00:27:36,630
I bet it was a freak accident,
right?

723
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,360
To associate lcl.
Yeah.

724
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,140
I mean,
the way they said it,

725
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:43,140
but first of all with Dana said was very
savage.

726
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,340
What'd he say?
Dana said,

727
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:46,380
uh,
he wears her sunglasses in doors.

728
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,660
That should happen to everybody that 
wears sunglasses indoors.

729
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,780
That's the letter that the light have 
your glory,

730
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:55,614
David quote.
Cause there's only two types of people 

731
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:59,430
that wear sunglasses indoors.
Blind people and assholes.

732
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,260
It's true.
It's so true.

733
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,420
It's so joe are those weird thing man,
especially at night.

734
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:09,330
Like what are you doing so hard to see?
What is this?

735
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:11,970
What are you doing?
I've seen a guy in a club when I used to

736
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:12,804
go to clubs,
he does the glass on and then people 

737
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:14,634
walk laid,
lift them up to look around and put it 

738
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:16,234
back down and you can't see shit.
The biggest tools wear glasses sis to 

739
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:23,280
fights who wear sunglasses and they sit 
there with her fucking sunglasses.

740
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:25,020
Not like,
especially celebrities that do that.

741
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,610
It's like flurries do it.
It's like get it,

742
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:29,520
get a grip however we meet.
That's like when you know you fucked up,

743
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:30,354
you got two famous,
you have to wear sunglasses at a fight 

744
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,120
that sit in the front row.

745
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,400
It's Sunglass and your boys are just 
like,

746
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:36,211
no,
I like it man.

747
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:37,050
Yeah.
Where those indoor.

748
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:37,884
That makes complete sense.
It same if you were like a peacock coat 

749
00:28:40,231 --> 00:28:43,390
and your boys like that's all good.
I'm gonna Start Doing podcasts like dude

750
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,950

That stresses me out.

751
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,570
Sam trip,
we did a podcast like this.

752
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,433
Did you say something?
What did you say something to them like 

753
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,800
what are we doing?
And I put mine on.

754
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,660
I put mine on and we've done it before 
with the sunglasses with NASA outfits.

755
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,740
That's hilarious.
Deleted.

756
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,763
Did our put,
did the fighter and the kid with 

757
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:01,951
sunglasses.
I don't.

758
00:29:01,951 --> 00:29:02,784
I go,
Bro,

759
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,380
you got to take the sunglasses off.
He goes,

760
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,850
my future's too bright.
I went,

761
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,680
Oh fuck mine too.
And the calendars.

762
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,540
Shit.
I'd have my sunglasses.

763
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,800
Yeah.
It's a weird thing.

764
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,620
Sunglasses.
That's a hilarious quote by Dana though.

765
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:17,701
Yeah.
Hilarious.

766
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:18,534
Hilarious.
And especially considering how much 

767
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:22,470
money he's losing on the team.
Can you imagine,

768
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,650
can you imagine getting a call that 
close and be like,

769
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,260
what?
What keeps happening?

770
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,140
It keeps happening.
It keeps happening.

771
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,350
Does it happen to this Mac?
Tim's typing a bunch of time.

772
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,820
Lemme may God's like you morons.
I'm trying to do your favor.

773
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,860
Who was the most recent one where that 
happened?

774
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,020
Where cyborg stepped in last minute.
This close.

775
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,370
Yeah.
So the last one,

776
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,750
Cyborg stepped in.
Who?

777
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,460
Oh,
that was Max Holloway Holloway.

778
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,390
But then there was the Ferguson won with
Khabib where Khabib's liver shutdown.

779
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,760
They had to take him to the fucking 
hospital.

780
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:56,594
It was a bummer.
That was a bummer because this happened 

781
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,550
a ton of times though.
It was the worst one.

782
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:05,260
Jon Jones do ufc 200 dc mayor the the 
right,

783
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,370
literally the day before.

784
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,320
You're like,
what?

785
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,470
But I would if that's better for the UFC
shitty business either way,

786
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:13,390
but is it better for the UFC because 
people,

787
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:14,224
we've always seen the hype or a bought 
in and then like the next day like what 

788
00:30:17,261 --> 00:30:18,660
the f?
Where's John like,

789
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,960
oh yeah,
you didn't hear that.

790
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,823
Like does that help them more or does 
this week at least that can promote a 

791
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,054
little bit with Max Holloway,
you could promote a little bit with Max 

792
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,400
Holloway and it's an interesting fight.
It's a very interesting fight.

793
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,760
Yeah.
There's a lot of those men that happened

794
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:33,850
to you.
Like what?

795
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,590
Which one was the Jon Jones dc one.
You'll see 200 and that will,

796
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,180
what was the,
the thing that John did,

797
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:43,300
which one was that?
Remember that the coq one B,

798
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,550
I think there's a coke.
Coke was,

799
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,170
he goes,
this was Dick Pills.

800
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,580
You remember these?
He was like,

801
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:49,550
hey,
we got strip.

802
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,020
We had to pull them from the card and 
then DC financial and Silva.

803
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,973
That's right on like founders,
Anderson and then DC didn't when fans 

804
00:30:57,461 --> 00:31:00,040
that cause he just kinda yeah.
Yeah.

805
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,650
He just wants to fight.
He just wrestled him in his whatever.

806
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,500
It's still one the front kicked him in 
the gut too and I think you heard him.

807
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:06,370
He has messed up.

808
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,080
Yeah.
But it happened in sports.

809
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:10,914
This,
this is what I think makes fighting so 

810
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:13,450
great.
So great.

811
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:14,284
Max says opportunity that no one else in
the world in sports can have and then 

812
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,480
you know,
then look at Canelo triple g in,

813
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,450
in combat sports.
This is what we deal with.

814
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,310
Yeah.
Canela it's a biggest fight of the year.

815
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,413
Biggest fight ever wants to see the 
rematch of the year and then tainted 

816
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:30,340
meat.
Do you buy the tainted me?

817
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,300
Absolutely not,
sir.

818
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,300
I've had many Tacos in Mexico and I am 
not swole.

819
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,193
Yeah,
but you're not getting tested for trace 

820
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,950
amounts of clenbuterol you don't know.

821
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,603
Maybe I have to go and Snitch,
come to my house just for the fuck of 

822
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,190
it.
And just to dream.

823
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,710
I'm still in the testing protocol.
Interesting.

824
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,010
No,
I,

825
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,761
yeah,
maybe,

826
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:50,710
I don't know,
but I would see some sort of change.

827
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,810
But,
or even triple g's camp goes,

828
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,640
uh,
last fight he was on it.

829
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:56,600
What else is new now?
Why didn't you,

830
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,510
why do you think they said that?
He,

831
00:31:58,511 --> 00:31:59,500
I don't know.
I'm sure.

832
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,393
Listen,
I'm sure Gonad he's been in there with 

833
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:03,670
what?
Over full 500 people now.

834
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,504
400 people.
And you just said in his experience he 

835
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:10,330
can tell who's on pds and who's not.
And he thought Canelo was,

836
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,720
do you buy that?
I do cause that a fighter as a fighter.

837
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:18,940
This guys I fought who I assumed were 
okay,

838
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:20,890
but what about Woodlin?
A guy like Woodley,

839
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:23,590
he has tremendous genetic.
He's always been like that.

840
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,000
Always been like that.
But so it was canela no,

841
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,700
you,
you look at it.

842
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:30,010
He's gotten pretty swollen now.
He's getting older though.

843
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,260
So it could be that too.
He's just as you get older you,

844
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:34,840
but I'm more size.
Well the big one was manny.

845
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,670
Manny was the one that everybody was 
always accusing.

846
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,050
And Man,
he was the first,

847
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,520
I mean manny went up eight weight 
classes and kept his knockout piece,

848
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,440
fighting as a little boy and then just 
was like crazy.

849
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,270
I mean,
and kept the knockout power.

850
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,550
True.
And most people thought that man,

851
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,480
he was on ped.
Correct.

852
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,493
And then they thought that man,
he got off pds when he fought Juan 

853
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,470
Manuel Marquez and he got starched.
But he,

854
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,980
there's two,
there's two side of the story there.

855
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:00,680
He got off PDS and also found Jesus 
Christ.

856
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,510
So he stopped going to the Strip clubs.

857
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,553
He stopped hanging out with girls,
but he stopped having fun and then got 

858
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,600
serious about Jesus and got knocked the 
fuck out.

859
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,160
Yeah.
Jesus saw Jesus.

860
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:11,660
And that Jesus is like,
listen,

861
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,300
if you want to be a savage,
you got to live like a savage.

862
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,250
He's like,
I'm not even advising this man.

863
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,210
Just do your thing.
Can I go take them steroids?

864
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:20,721
It's like,
listen,

865
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:22,160
I made steroids.
Okay.

866
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,530
Yeah,
it's,

867
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,400
I'm Cara God that wheat grass ain't get 
help your son.

868
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,290
Yeah,
that's good for you,

869
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,570
but you need good.
But you need this too.

870
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,220
It depends on what you are.
I mean,

871
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:33,650
if you want to be 147 pound knockout 
artist,

872
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,230
let me,
but Marquez was no,

873
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,800
a stranger to the,
uh,

874
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,450
just getting supplements.
No,

875
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,161
no,
no,

876
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:40,581
no,
no,

877
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:40,971
no,
no,

878
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:41,511
no,
no,

879
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:42,344
no.
Well his,

880
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,440
they had the same strength and 
conditioning coach.

881
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,453
When manny found Jesus,
his old strength and conditioning coach 

882
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:53,270
went over to the dark,
wet matt and Mel Marcus.

883
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:55,090
He's always on the dark state on the 
dark side.

884
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,860
That dude was always in the dark.
What was he going now?

885
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,900
Hey Bill.
Alex.

886
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:00,321
Alex.
Oh,

887
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,550
Riza.
Yes.

888
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:02,750
Good call brother.
Yeah,

889
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:03,710
he knows his shit,
man.

890
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,843
He knows his shit and I don't know 
whether or not he'd got anybody on pdds 

891
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:08,880
or they're just blaming him now.
He knows his shit.

892
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,210
It's a strength and conditioning coach.
That guy.

893
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:10,970
Very,
very good.

894
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,380
I would have worked with them if I was 
fighting.

895
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,840
I saw the stuff that he was doing with 
wine.

896
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,900
My Mom Marquez.
I was like,

897
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:15,734
this guy is,
he's super legit and he brings those 

898
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:19,700
guys up to like modern levels are 
correct.

899
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,700
Not The old school shit.
It's some of the old school shit too.

900
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,620
To this day.
I think chopping wood,

901
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,170
that's all legit man.
Sledge hammers on tires.

902
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:29,350
I think it was good and I agree.
I think it's good to add in.

903
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,193
I think dead lifts all that stuff,
but I think you mix that with the new 

904
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:34,940
wave of technology.
Now you got some,

905
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:35,771
well,
what,

906
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:38,690
what I was saying about nick curse on 
and that Marvin Marinovich method,

907
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:40,250
it's all,
it's playas man.

908
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:42,560
Everything's like junk box jumps and 
movement.

909
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,850
Yeah,
left right,

910
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:44,271
left,
right,

911
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:45,104
left,
right.

912
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,220
You know,
curse on sits on.

913
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:49,100
Very interesting to me when I said like,
what do you think fighters are missing?

914
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:51,440
Most like strength condition wants to 
that foot strength.

915
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,990
That makes sense.
Totally makes sense.

916
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,090
You know who's,
who's been on that ball since God,

917
00:34:56,091 --> 00:34:58,630
since I've known him as Lauren Landau,
who I worked with in Denver.

918
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,710
Now,
he just got the Gig as the,

919
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,230
he's the head condition coach of the 
Denver Broncos.

920
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,203
Wow.
But he was making us work out barefoot 

921
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:09,700
for Avar even as football players.
Steve Maxwell was always on that too.

922
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,530
I was kettlebell workout.
So those guys who it's like,

923
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:13,341
oh,
this is all new.

924
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:16,150
And then you talked to like a lauren or 
that Max will gather.

925
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,050
Uh,
we've been doing this for like 20 years.

926
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,880
You guys are just now finding out about 
it.

927
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,560
Well,
so many people,

928
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,423
you know,
you see so many people working out with 

929
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:27,800
like high thick ass running shoes that 
are all spongy on the bottom.

930
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,693
Yeah.
It'd be one of them.

931
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,250
Yeah.
A lot of people do bad.

932
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,850
But you're not training for a fight 
right now.

933
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,990
No.
No.

934
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,420
But if you were,
you tried to optimize everything,

935
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:36,290
wouldn't you?
Yeah,

936
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,410
I used to wear those five a finger.

937
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,240
I would wear those to run.
I'd wear those on the track had,

938
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,083
were those during most of my stuff.
So now you just wear regular running 

939
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:47,070
shoes for comfort,
regular running shoes.

940
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:50,030
And then w I had a knee problem.
I was putting so many miles on it.

941
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,060
Now I'm on a bike.
I got,

942
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,340
I got one this pelotons so those are 
dope.

943
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:56,010
But it's been good.
Those are good because it's,

944
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,620
you could play along and go along with 
the class.

945
00:35:58,621 --> 00:35:59,251
Yeah,
it's cool.

946
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:01,290
I'll show if it's the answer do every 
day,

947
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,340
but I like you.
I need,

948
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:03,750
I need to mix it up man.
I'm getting,

949
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:06,810
I'm just bored as fuck with working out.
So that co bike,

950
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,060
those are dope.
I want to get one of those in the crib.

951
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,460
Got Our bags.
But I like to waking up cause my mondays

952
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,690
and Tuesdays are a nightmare.

953
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,773
I have to be on set at 7:00
AM so I'm waking up at like five just 

954
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:17,880
doing that Pelton for an hour if that 
I'm off.

955
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:18,721
Oh that's good.
Yeah.

956
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:21,750
We're before I'd have to try and go to 
the gym or I was missing my workouts.

957
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:22,830
It drives me nuts,
dude.

958
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:25,890
He helped to start the day with a sweat 
and then I get going.

959
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,880
You know what?
Kick him on.

960
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:27,803
The versaclimber dues are a nightmare.
I went to the gym the other day and I 

961
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:34,440
did 150 meter sprint.
At the end of the workout,

962
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:37,150
the trainer had me do 150 meter sprint 
on their first climb.

963
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,970
You feel like passing out?
Holy Shit.

964
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:40,650
It's hard.
Holy Shit.

965
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:43,200
When you get off man,
like you're barely allowed them before.

966
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,900
Yeah,
but I haven't been doing it now.

967
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,860
I'm getting one in here now.
I May.

968
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:49,800
It might be the toughest thing as far as
cardio wise again,

969
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,753
Loren landow,
you still have even as football players 

970
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,670
all the time,
and I was like,

971
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:55,650
what the fuck are we doing man?

972
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,240
This is awful.
Is by far.

973
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,790
He'd have these circuits and it always 
end on that.

974
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,140
I remember everyone,
if he's like,

975
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:02,850
here's your circuit,
and then on versa,

976
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,370
some of the best athletes in the world 
just like,

977
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,990
oh my God,
man,

978
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,260
what are we doing?
Yeah,

979
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,560
but that's what they do at this,
this gym that I've been working at,

980
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,660
he likes you to do a circuit and the 
circuit,

981
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:14,880
you get on the versaclimber and you 
sprint and it's,

982
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:17,220
you know how much time to get to 150 
meters.

983
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,160
I've been doing a rose with my trainer.
Oh yeah,

984
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:21,110
I do that too.
I do wrote,

985
00:37:21,111 --> 00:37:23,010
we get a thousand meter row and I'm 
like,

986
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:25,320
what's a good time?
So we looked up the top times.

987
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,633
I'm like,
I think I'm top 300 in the world right 

988
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:29,040
now.
A bit,

989
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,050
you know,
I got to do some work.

990
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,811
There was a big,
yeah,

991
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:35,040
there's big difference between top 300 
and then the top hundred.

992
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,551
Yeah,
but dude,

993
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,770
you're top 300 in the world with a row.
With a rail.

994
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:38,430
Yeah,
look it up.

995
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,010
That's pretty fucking sweet.
It's all right.

996
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,480
I mean,
it's a row machine.

997
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,820
I'm the top 85 million.
I mean,

998
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,170
no,
you're the hold up.

999
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,550
You're the,
hold on,

1000
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,600
hold on.
Let's just,

1001
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,330
I that that was the humble brag,
but let's just be serious there.

1002
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,030
You're the,
you're the hardest kicker ever.

1003
00:37:54,031 --> 00:37:56,100
On that Goddamn UFC machine.
Well,

1004
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:57,780
I call it the Francis Machine.
Well,

1005
00:37:57,781 --> 00:37:58,614
I is a video of me doing 152 right.
Right now you only see the one that me 

1006
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,940
kicking it and with my jeans on and that
what got to one 35 stretchy jeans?

1007
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,650
Yeah,
barbell jeans.

1008
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,350
Basically.
PDS.

1009
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,720
PDS,
like sweatpants,

1010
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,640
man.
So I'm dude burned me,

1011
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,340
burned me from the audience and he goes,
hey man,

1012
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,050
how long did it take you to paint on 
those genes?

1013
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,430
And I went,
oh my goodness sir.

1014
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,360
He just scorched me.
Theo bunk did me dirty,

1015
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,100
brought weird clown on each other.
We'd clowning each other.

1016
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,240
I said,
you look like an extra from the waterboy

1017
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,660
setting.
He goes,

1018
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,020
he goes,
no,

1019
00:38:32,021 --> 00:38:33,550
fuck.
I'm like,

1020
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,740
he goes,
Bro,

1021
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,980
you like you,

1022
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,130
you look like you work at Nordstrom's 
rack and you're a mechanic.

1023
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,820
Like fuck.
He talking about,

1024
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,800
he's so good.
He's on thing.

1025
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,540
But that fucking pants,
man,

1026
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,070
these pants are the shit.
These are different.

1027
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:51,310
These right now I have on there similar,
they're called Mott and bow is a no,

1028
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:53,500
those are good.
Those are like legit jeans.

1029
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,110
They'd like more feel like jeans where 
the barbell jeans,

1030
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,090
like they look like jeans to touch them 
and I go,

1031
00:38:58,091 --> 00:38:59,050
hey,
what's going on here?

1032
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,630
Like sweat,
sweat pants on Sun.

1033
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,150
No,
those are,

1034
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,983
that's in a good company to Jacob.
But just so bind you up a little bit 

1035
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:06,910
more if you were trying to kick somebody
a little bit more.

1036
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,100
So what did you do though?
Record setting.

1037
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:11,260
Kick barbell jeans.
This is the,

1038
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,180
I did the record on.
This is the record one.

1039
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,210
That dos Anjos rump.
Let's see,

1040
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:19,240
you saw my hill running man.
My ass is way bigger.

1041
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,920
A lot of people have been complimenting 
me on it.

1042
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,550
Nothing wrong with a knife like that fat
belly though.

1043
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,220
I'm so fat right now.
You are not fat for me.

1044
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,383
One 52.

1045
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,370
And what's the hardest?
I'm definitely fatter than I usually am.

1046
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,330
I been cheating on my died way too much.
I hear you man sheet and wait.

1047
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:39,340
You might.
Well it's also,

1048
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:41,860
I can't,
there's certain things I can't do in the

1049
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:45,310
gym right now and I got this man,
this dildo that I got here.

1050
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,740
This is for,
uh,

1051
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,350
you know,
I've Golfer's elbow.

1052
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,560
I have this tendonitis on how this 
thing,

1053
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,480
fuck dude,
I've never had tendonitis before.

1054
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:56,261
Have you ever had it?
Yeah.

1055
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,730
Not Fun.
It takes forever.

1056
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,920
Forever.
Like way more than a muscle.

1057
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,850
I got PRP,
I got regena keen,

1058
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:06,250
I got stem cells.
I had a bunch of shots.

1059
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,920
This,
this Dildo I'm holding.

1060
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,790
This helped me more than any of them.
Two weeks in two weeks.

1061
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:13,624
This things helping dry needling.
It did seem like it should have fixed 

1062
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:17,230
everything.
What did the dry needling,

1063
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,980
oh,
let me do that too.

1064
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,780
I had dry needling where they used 
electricity and these zapped it.

1065
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,920
Pollster to do nothing for me.
It didn't help.

1066
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,020
This helped.
This is cheap.

1067
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,710
You buy it on Amazon.
It's called a theraband.

1068
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,500
And what do you do with it?
And my friend Brian told me about this.

1069
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,461
Callan,
no,

1070
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:36,761
no,
no.

1071
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:39,790
Brian from um,
I'll give you his last name.

1072
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,340
He's vinny shoreman,
his buddy from um,

1073
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,590
Fontana,
California.

1074
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,630
I think.
What does this his thing?

1075
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:49,930
Double Deuce Moitai is that his,
uh,

1076
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,430
his place here?
Hold on.

1077
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:52,390
Sorry.
It's a great shirt.

1078
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:53,224
By the way.
Jamie,

1079
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Brian Doppler and Brian is a great Muay 
Thai coach himself.

1080
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,730
So when he do,
he had,

1081
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,920
he had a issue and he told me this is 
the thing that fixed him.

1082
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,280
You take it,
you hold it out like this right in front

1083
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:06,860
of you,
right?

1084
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,040
Then you twist,
this is the arm that's injured,

1085
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:09,963
the bottom arm.

1086
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,320
So you hold out,
you twist it,

1087
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:12,154
what the other one,
and then you hold it straight and then 

1088
00:41:13,661 --> 00:41:14,494
you let it untwist with this arm slowly.
And I've been doing this shit all the 

1089
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:19,210
time.
I do it in my car,

1090
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,253
I take it with me at home,
but I'm twisting the shit out of it and 

1091
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:27,440
then slowly untwisting it with my right 
side to helping out too.

1092
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:28,274
And it makes a big impact.
It makes a big impact because it's 

1093
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:33,590
strengthening it,
strengthening this,

1094
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,350
this little particular area,
but it's also getting a ton of blow.

1095
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,483
You hold it like that,
like palm palm out and then twist it 

1096
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,343
right and now straightened out.
Now unwind it with this hand with the 

1097
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:46,520
injured hand.
There you go.

1098
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,163
Yeah.
And you just do that slow and I'll do 

1099
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:50,924
that for like five,
10 minutes of time and then I'll leave 

1100
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:53,780
it alone.

1101
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,820
Game come back,
game changer.

1102
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,690
All that other dude a lot better.
I mean obviously I've had a lot of other

1103
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:03,300
shit done to it.
Like the Regena keen was like uh,

1104
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,270
might help a month or so ago.
I'm sure it helped,

1105
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:06,104
but that's good.
This once I started doing it almost 

1106
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,460
immediately within a few days.
So you're feeling better basics then?

1107
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,810
Yeah,
but I can't,

1108
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:17,480
there's a lot of shit I can't do.
Like I can't do chin ups right now.

1109
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:20,270
Have been able to do chin ups.
I could do rows,

1110
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,940
but I can't go have you then like 50 
pounds.

1111
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:28,290
Like everything has to be all about 
preserving this little ligament.

1112
00:42:28,431 --> 00:42:30,020
And your trader knows that.
Yeah.

1113
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,460
This is a new trainer.
Yeah.

1114
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,623
Yeah.
As long as they're a good trade as they 

1115
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:35,120
usually know how to adapt.
But even here,

1116
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,013
like when I'm training here,
he can't do it with so much shit I can 

1117
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:39,350
do and can't do anything on the rings.

1118
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,250
No,
no.

1119
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,690
I can throw straight punches,
but no,

1120
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,070
no,
no hooks,

1121
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,210
uppercuts.
But it's getting,

1122
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,380
it's getting much better just in two 
weeks of using this fucking thing.

1123
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,550
Everything.
Thinking about resting it maybe just not

1124
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:51,390
doing amy thing sir.
Mm.

1125
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,880
That's how I got fat.
Well,

1126
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:55,070
you could,
you could still get up.

1127
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,110
You're crazy.
You're crazy.

1128
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,540
For me to stick on a diet,
I have to add to uh,

1129
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,713
have a meal specialist,
like delivering my meals on that guy 

1130
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,540
right now.
I'm usually really good at it,

1131
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,780
but,
but one thing this has done is ramped up

1132
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:10,720
my hill running.
So I've been doing just go,

1133
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,340
oh,
are you the type of dude thought,

1134
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:14,540
well how we see late night.
You're always posting,

1135
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:15,410
you know,
you got that Fedex.

1136
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,460
I would see when Ph vet,
I see when a at night when you come home

1137
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:20,294
from the comedy store,
you always posting like protein and 

1138
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:22,544
veggies.

1139
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,840
Are you really eating that or are you 
like,

1140
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:25,700
there's that and then you have a 
Mcdonald's on the side?

1141
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,550
I'm not saying Donald.
If I cheat,

1142
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:31,640
it's pasta of dude.
That was me last a whole pizza the other

1143
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:33,720
day.
I can give it up buller from,

1144
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,730
it was at a restaurant.
I worked with the,

1145
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,470
with the misses and we ordered some 
other stuff and I said,

1146
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:40,790
let's just get a pizza too.
Right?

1147
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:41,990
That's how it's done.
She's like,

1148
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:42,980
I'm not really into this.
I'm like,

1149
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:44,630
good for her.
That's me,

1150
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:47,180
man.
I walked the whole pizza down eight,

1151
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:49,190
that whole fucking,
I'm so disappointed in myself.

1152
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,050
I had these,
I had these meals,

1153
00:43:51,051 --> 00:43:51,410
man,
I've,

1154
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:53,510
I've been strict on it.
When I'm on the road,

1155
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:56,150
it's fucking tough.
Or when if I might get an sleep,

1156
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:59,630
my buddy crave sugar and carbs,
but I always say,

1157
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:00,800
and I'm like,
I just want,

1158
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:03,200
and then one,
I just can't stop myself.

1159
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,910
It's hard.
And then last night,

1160
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,750
my,
my,

1161
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,260
my son this pasta,
and of course I have to try it.

1162
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,160
I'm gonna make sure it's not poisoned.
And I tried it.

1163
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:10,994
I'm like,
that's fucking way better than my meal 

1164
00:44:12,711 --> 00:44:15,490
that they eat.
So I just fired up some Tortellini.

1165
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,433
It's hard.
It's also hard when you work hard 

1166
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,590
because I wore,
I do a lot of things.

1167
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:25,700
I'm always busy and it's like sometimes 
it just want to go off with food.

1168
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:26,534
Like that's my indulgence.
That's the one thing that I can get 

1169
00:44:28,221 --> 00:44:29,054
loose on men,
but most of the time I'm very strict 

1170
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,920
most of the time.
But it's been hard with this injury,

1171
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,320
it's just because I thought it was going
to be healed by now,

1172
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,970
so it's been frustrating.
The shit out of me.

1173
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,073
There's certain things I want to do.
Like I was on this heavy chin up kick 

1174
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,573
and heavy cleans and presses kick and 
that's probably where I want to do this 

1175
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,223
because I felt some twinges instead of 
just working on it and like letting it 

1176
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:55,860
heal up,
push through it for months.

1177
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:59,310
That's the athlete in you.
That's the idiot in me for months.

1178
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:01,200
I pushed her,
but that's how it works.

1179
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:02,034
When you're an athlete,
I'm sure when you're doing taekwondo or 

1180
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,590
Jujitsu,
you get hurt.

1181
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:05,371
It's not like,
oh,

1182
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:07,980
let me take months off to make this bed.
It's none of that.

1183
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:08,900
Yeah.
That,

1184
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,733
and that's what Eddie said about Tony is
it like Tony when he gets hurt and he's 

1185
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:14,340
like,
whatever I'm hurt just works around it.

1186
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,950
Whatever it is.
He doesn't stop working out ever,

1187
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,390
ever.
Yeah.

1188
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,400
But this is a,
an eyeopener for me.

1189
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,400
This,
this theraband thing is like always keep

1190
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:24,270
searching.
There's,

1191
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:25,104
Oh,
and another thing I have is this other 

1192
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:28,980
thing that I put my fingers in this 
rubber thing and I expand my fingers,

1193
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,990
right?
Because it's very difficult to expand.

1194
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,760
You know,
it's easy to contract.

1195
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:33,594
You're always doing that.
But how much strength do you have this 

1196
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:34,800
way?

1197
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,290
Very little.
It's kind of shine.

1198
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:37,740
Do you ever do it?
Never.

1199
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,700
Never.
Never.

1200
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,610
But this rubber thing is really good and
I think I read,

1201
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,760
I think it was jim still panty who's a 
bodybuilder guy online.

1202
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:47,280
He's got a bunch of supplements and Shit
and uh,

1203
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,750
he's a,
he's also super,

1204
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:50,870
super smart,
educated guy and he,

1205
00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:53,160
he was recommending that for people with
tendonitis.

1206
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,640
There's a lot of different things you 
could do with bands.

1207
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:57,803
And this one,
this is the strongest ones they have to 

1208
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,320
shaking like a dick.
Do you rubber Dick?

1209
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,190
Do you think if you would've went to a 
physio therapy,

1210
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:06,024
they would have shown me all this stuff 
before he injected yourself with all 

1211
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:08,784
these needles and stuff.
I feel like that a lot of it's physiol 

1212
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,610
maybe.
Yeah.

1213
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:12,930
No,
you live,

1214
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:16,020
you learn.
Most of them were just saying ice it and

1215
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:16,440
rest.

1216
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,690
It was like damn the wrath.
Yes,

1217
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:20,880
but the rest of they want,
it's just not what I want to do.

1218
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,110
Yeah,
the ball.

1219
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,973
It's also when your body is so used to 
going hard and then going hard and then 

1220
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:28,920
your body to start.
Okay,

1221
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:32,370
let's find some problems.
Let's go sit still.

1222
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,090
And it's like one,
I'm lazy and they feel like a bitch.

1223
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,870
I know but like I said,
it's increased my butt.

1224
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,704
Donka donk ens.
Aw man to the missus likes it or she 

1225
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:45,930
wants you to tone it down and she's 
happy with it.

1226
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:48,320
No one likes a flat ass.
No one likes vanilla guy.

1227
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,500
Yeah,
no one.

1228
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,930
That might be the worst thing.
You feel flat and I want to grow a small

1229
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:52,764
deck and slap girl wants a flat ass 
cause she knows the guy is not going 

1230
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:55,560
anywhere.
Correct.

1231
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,400
Yeah,
look at it.

1232
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Look at him when it's flat.
Flat Ass fucking shitty.

1233
00:47:01,591 --> 00:47:06,090
Gene loafers on.
Don't see loafer Gucci loafers.

1234
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:06,924
No socks gets tired.
Walking upstairs to imagine if all of a 

1235
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:16,170
sudden you had someone's flat ass and 
then you had to like walk around and you

1236
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:17,220
gotta realize,
Oh my God,

1237
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:20,370
it's so hard to walk up hills.
How to get around,

1238
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,150
get around flat out carrying up the 
grocery bags up the stairs.

1239
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:27,120
That's out.
How about when you you,

1240
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,940
I've seen it where it might one of the 
easiest muscles to build.

1241
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:34,810
Like there's some girls with flat asses.
Then you see them on instagram.

1242
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:35,644
These instagram models who do like dead 
lifts or something and then just over 

1243
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:41,890
time boehm that ash just grows like a 
tomato.

1244
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,700
If they really are motivated,
you can get your ass to grow.

1245
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:49,690
Little Winnie,
little fucking little of that for sure.

1246
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,310
There's a lot of that going on with 
girls,

1247
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:51,660
man.

1248
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,310
There is when straws,
what we're talking about folks who don't

1249
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:56,320
know what when I wasn't referring to 
Winnie the Pooh,

1250
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,780
I'm talking about when Straw.
Yeah.

1251
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,820
A lot of those fitness girls are doing 
steroids.

1252
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,960
They just do a little bit,
just a little bit,

1253
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,990
just a little bit changes in Maranhoa 
bit.

1254
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:07,240
The jaw.
You look at the shoulders,

1255
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,120
they get badly,
need time to anytime counts.

1256
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:10,954
He's a rip curl,
use steroids and literally everything 

1257
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,450
stare writes my God damn Bro.
That shit though.

1258
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:17,523
They keep it.
That's what's weird to keep the manly 

1259
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:20,014
parts like the,
like they don't just keep the muscles 

1260
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,910
when they get off the shit.
If their face is still hard.

1261
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,773
Yeah,
they're structured like their face 

1262
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:28,690
structure's a little different.
As a lady who lives in my neighborhood,

1263
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:29,524
she used to be a big Ole Miss Olympia 
and see her walking around and it's 

1264
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:34,030
weird.
She's,

1265
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,860
she's,
she's looks like a man,

1266
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,190
not just in her face,
but in her,

1267
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,540
her,
the way she carries herself everything.

1268
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:41,374
Right.
So like,

1269
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,600
you know,
I mean that sounds weird to say,

1270
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,160
but there's a certain masculine quality 
that the,

1271
00:48:47,161 --> 00:48:47,994
the people,
the women that take massive amounts of 

1272
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:51,490
steroids,
they develop.

1273
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,620
They just develop the,
they looked different.

1274
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:54,640
They will,
they're wider.

1275
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,733
Yeah.
They don't look like they're going to 

1276
00:48:56,921 --> 00:49:00,280
take care of you.
You know what I'm saying?

1277
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,900
I don't,
I'm not attracted to that.

1278
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,570
I don't know.
Listen to each other.

1279
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,450
Sweet.
That I can be the best moms.

1280
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,450
What I'm saying,
it's like it's not,

1281
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,411
that's a,
that's a,

1282
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:16,240
that's even bad.
But it's,

1283
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,030
but if you want that,
I'll stop those.

1284
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:22,150
Career woman will be mad at you.
Like if you want a soft,

1285
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,610
if you want a soft,
sweet,

1286
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,473
caring woman who likes to cut on,
it's going to be a good mom and it's 

1287
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:31,630
just sweet to be around.
You mean the opposite of us?

1288
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,693
Yeah,
yeah,

1289
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:33,993
yeah.
But a lot of career women will get mad 

1290
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:36,280
at you.
I know.

1291
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:36,821
Like,
Oh,

1292
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:37,511
is that true?
Do you want,

1293
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:39,170
do you want a woman to just can't take 
care of her salary?

1294
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,500
You don't want it to be equal.
No.

1295
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,820
Badge.
I Day Brian Callahan.

1296
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,130
I'm good.
I talked to week,

1297
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,520
I'm Brian.
If I wanted that.

1298
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:47,290
Well that equals stuff.
It's like equal.

1299
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:48,124
How?
How's how?

1300
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,780
Oh,
you just can't date your equal.

1301
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,880
You Go,
you go date some cartoon.

1302
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:52,810
Like all right.
Okay.

1303
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:54,790
But they want to be a woman in some 
respect.

1304
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:55,720
Right.
They don't want to be an equal,

1305
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:56,554
they're not claiming they're like,
is strong as you or as funny as you or 

1306
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:04,950
is know as much about pussy.
The good thing,

1307
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,640
where are you equal?
You're not an equal,

1308
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:07,451
you're a woman.
You're just,

1309
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:08,380
uh,
you're just,

1310
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,300
uh,
an aggressive,

1311
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,700
successful,
powerful woman,

1312
00:50:12,701 --> 00:50:14,230
but cause you,
but you're not a man.

1313
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,180
Like if you were an equal,
I'd be gay.

1314
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,320
Correct.
Would be two dudes like high five and in

1315
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,800
buttfuck game together,
that's fine.

1316
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:24,540
That's cool.
But like this whole one,

1317
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:27,290
an equal like why do we have,
why are we playing math games?

1318
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,060
Yeah.
Why can't we just be chill?

1319
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,580
Can we just like each other?
Why do we have to be equal?

1320
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,560
What is that?
I don't know.

1321
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:37,400
It's weird.
Women I have run from it.

1322
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,610
He so successful.
Who,

1323
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,453
who,
who was it who said there can only be 

1324
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:42,440
one headshot and household and we heard 
that.

1325
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:43,723
That's good though.
You can only have one head shot in the 

1326
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:45,764
household.
It's not going to work out if you both 

1327
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:47,624
want to be famous.
You know,

1328
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,550
George Harrison once said,
he said,

1329
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,020
um,
he said,

1330
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,200
all I need from a woman is to be 
attracted to her.

1331
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:57,400
Everything else I get from a man,
it's a great quote.

1332
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:59,480
Wow.
We're going to get shit for that.

1333
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,160
Well,
what do you say that I didn't say it.

1334
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:02,690
No,
I would never say that.

1335
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,060
I would not either.
I would,

1336
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,220
I knew with any knew all equal,
I mean equal,

1337
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,173
right.
Equal pay the rent a bitch and I need 

1338
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:10,364
someone who calls me on my shit and 
yells at me all the time and throws 

1339
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:14,540
things out and even makes fun of me.

1340
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,160
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1341
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:15,993
yeah,
yeah.

1342
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,010
That's what I want.
That's exactly what just comes home with

1343
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:21,020
a six vacuum rips a huge fart.
Okay.

1344
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:24,320
This female bodybuilder,
candice Armstrong steroid habit made her

1345
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:26,630
grow a penis and facial hair.
Whoa,

1346
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,040
that's,
she's a dude.

1347
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,121
Well.
Sure.

1348
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:31,670
That's real.
She's on that Gold's gym.

1349
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,810
Dial.
What?

1350
00:51:33,811 --> 00:51:36,050
See the Dick?
Come on.

1351
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,640
Whoa.
Oh Wow.

1352
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:39,080
Yeah.
See she turned into a man.

1353
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,600
Oh Wow.
And the heavy whitehead.

1354
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:43,910
That's a giant white.
So white must've.

1355
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,390
They must've put makeup on her too.
How are they letting that whitehead go?

1356
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,770
That staff,
why wouldn't they cover that up to she's

1357
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,130
so jack later.
Her hands.

1358
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,570
Oh my God.
Look at her arms to,

1359
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:57,050
she should say's that's a dude.
That's a dude.

1360
00:51:57,051 --> 00:51:58,070
Come on.
Is this a joke?

1361
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,570
It was my be a judge like criss angel.
She doesn't even look like that.

1362
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:03,703
Yeah,
but w the sides of her hands looks 

1363
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,810
proportionate to it.
She doesn't look like a girl that ships.

1364
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,590
There's nothing feminine about that 
woman.

1365
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,210
Look at her back.
Holy Shit.

1366
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,010
Look at those backpacks.
Sure,

1367
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,290
sure.
Oh my God.

1368
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,000
That's photo shoot.
That's a dude with a nice set of here.

1369
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:23,660
Well,
some girls can be jacked and muscular,

1370
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,380
but still look like a woman like felice 
herrick.

1371
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,730
Do you see felice herricks?
She's fighting this odd.

1372
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,620
Oh,
she's bought it up.

1373
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,500
But you see the picture of her do a 
double biceps from the back.

1374
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,600
Some pictures she did at the UFC.
Preston,

1375
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:40,610
you like Cha tractive young lady.
There's a few who are jacked.

1376
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:42,170
He would attract.
She's jacked,

1377
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,350
but she's Jack like a woman.
She Jack like a woman who lifts weights.

1378
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:46,091
Yeah.
It doesn't look great.

1379
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:46,731
Official.
No.

1380
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:49,070
This lady that we just saw.
Yeah,

1381
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,930
that's a good picture.

1382
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:53,150
But that's just her looking fit.
There's a,

1383
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:55,550
there's a picture of her.
Just Google,

1384
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,180
like her image double bicep or something
like that.

1385
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,260
She's a lady.
She's not tracking that lady.

1386
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,100
See it,
but she shreds city Sun.

1387
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:07,580
That's a shredded fit woman.
But there's that looks like a woman,

1388
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,533
like look at her arms.
It looks like a powerful woman's arm 

1389
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:13,340
who's in shape.
His balls as shit and shape is fuck.

1390
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,570
But that other lady that didn't 
[inaudible] I didn't mean in shaping the

1391
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,810
balls.
Get Shit online.

1392
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,480
She's a tank fire shop.
He said balls.

1393
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,980
Yeah,
we can't fire for your own thing.

1394
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,900
If they fire you from showtime,
you'll,

1395
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:31,950
it'll be like they use the force against
themselves would just make you stronger.

1396
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,980
I do see a lot of crazy shit though.
He could do that show on your own.

1397
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:37,770
You can do all or anything like that you
could do on your own.

1398
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:38,903
Yeah.
I think it's great that you're on 

1399
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:41,160
showtime.
It's a fun show too.

1400
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,470
Yeah.
What I like about it is you're being you

1401
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,510
on that show.
Yes,

1402
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,930
I see you on that show.
I'm like,

1403
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,610
oh,
they let him be himself.

1404
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,010
Like you say about your silly shit 
laughing.

1405
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:51,420
There's a lot of cracking ops.
Yeah,

1406
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,090
I have fun.
They let me do my thing.

1407
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,200
The first one,
it was like,

1408
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,240
there's a lot of teleprompter and I was 
like,

1409
00:53:56,241 --> 00:53:57,500
God,
that's really not my thing yet.

1410
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,360
Let me go.
And they listen to me.

1411
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,070
That's the great thing about showtime.
They listened to me,

1412
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,390
but the fans like,
man,

1413
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:05,580
this isn't why we listened to Brendan to
be another fricking sports show.

1414
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:08,240
Like you gotta let them go.
And then literally they all were like,

1415
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,141
all right,
here you go,

1416
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:10,370
man.
Here's your point.

1417
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:11,300
Do what you want to do.
I'm like,

1418
00:54:11,301 --> 00:54:12,134
really?
But then they edit it so I don't get in 

1419
00:54:13,581 --> 00:54:16,100
trouble.
Like,

1420
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:21,101
oh my God,
which is why they're showtime and um,

1421
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,513
what I do,

1422
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,700
well that means this were we we talked 
about the other day with Eve Edwards.

1423
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:28,200
He was in here.
That was,

1424
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,153
that's one of those things like,
and I was saying when you talk as much 

1425
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:33,420
as we talk,
we bought,

1426
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:35,100
I talked too much.
You talk too much.

1427
00:54:35,101 --> 00:54:36,060
We talked too much.
Yes.

1428
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,610
When you talk too much shit comes out of
your mouth.

1429
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:39,444
You guys step in some shit and then 
you're scrambling and trying to like 

1430
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:43,410
make it

1431
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,243
since Joe [inaudible] I can't,
I didn't listen to the podcast with 

1432
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,150
these.
I like these,

1433
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:49,984
we don't know each other that well.
The thing that bothers me about this is 

1434
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:53,763
I couldn't even tell you the point I was
trying to make as soon as I give us $1 

1435
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,503
million.
Tell us the point you're trying to make 

1436
00:54:59,111 --> 00:55:00,220
money.
I forget.

1437
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:01,054
I remember had Kevin Leon and then I 
remember before that I was 20 minutes 

1438
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,134
deep and explain why think dc the 
greatest of all time as a beside you as 

1439
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:10,750
a commentator,
why is the future of the sport?

1440
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,913
And then before that show,
me and Brian were talking about 

1441
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:15,124
something with race and men and women 
and somehow that entered my brain and I 

1442
00:55:20,411 --> 00:55:22,840
have no animosity toward it this way.
It does make sense.

1443
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,080
I have no animosity towards UFC tonight.
Two of my favorite shows.

1444
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:28,300
I've worked with Karen Bryant for over 
10 years.

1445
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,150
She's a good friend.
Woodley DC,

1446
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,350
Kenny Florence,
good friend.

1447
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:33,910
Bisping's a good buddy.
Uh,

1448
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,070
I don't know,
ease.

1449
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,870
I work with the team on UFC light.
I love those guys.

1450
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:40,540
I just had Jimmy Smith in and on my show
who works,

1451
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:41,620
you know,
there it does,

1452
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:42,454
it makes zero sense.
And then I was in Saint Louis and I 

1453
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,800
started to get texts from so involved in
that show.

1454
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:49,450
I won't say their name and he goes,
hey man,

1455
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,280
some people are upset here about what he
said.

1456
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:51,911
And I'm like,
what?

1457
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:53,230
I see.
I can even tell you what I said.

1458
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,050
And he tells me like what?
And then Chin goes,

1459
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:56,884
hey man,
I'm seeing online about some of the 

1460
00:55:57,671 --> 00:55:59,830
stuff you should I edit it out?
No,

1461
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,450
we never do that again.
Don't edit.

1462
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,190
Let me deal with it.
Let me see what I say.

1463
00:56:03,191 --> 00:56:04,330
Cause that makes me look even worse.

1464
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,163
If you cut it out,
it looks like I was saying something 

1465
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,710
that I wasn't meant to say.
And uh,

1466
00:56:08,711 --> 00:56:09,544
then you know,
eve's was upset and then me and eve's 

1467
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,420
texts back and forth again.
I don't know him.

1468
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,150
Brian works with them.
A little bit uncertain stuff for help or

1469
00:56:16,151 --> 00:56:18,520
something like that for shows where 
we've tried to do,

1470
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,310
which is great.
Everyone should talk to Brian,

1471
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,430
you know,
if you're friends with them.

1472
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,860
And then,
um,

1473
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:27,550
I sent you a text says number from Brian
and I thought it was over squashed.

1474
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,480
And then,
uh,

1475
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:29,314
I was doing pr for my,
below the belt show in New York and 

1476
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:32,890
someone brought it up.
I'm like,

1477
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:33,790
oh man.
Again,

1478
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,110
I went and I met,
no offense,

1479
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,870
I come up with about 10 hours of content
a week.

1480
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,090
I can tell you what I was saying.
I messed up.

1481
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,340
Um,
whoever had problems with it,

1482
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:44,800
if it's Eve Edwards,
um,

1483
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,693
that's his own insecurities,
which is so stupid because I couldn't 

1484
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:50,470
tell you what he should be insecure 
about.

1485
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,453
That makes sense.
And then as soon as I get done that I 

1486
00:56:53,311 --> 00:56:54,070
interview,
I get texted,

1487
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:54,970
my brother is this,
he goes,

1488
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,520
you're an idiot.
You resurface that story.

1489
00:56:57,521 --> 00:56:58,660
I'm like,
oh my God.

1490
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,540
And so I texted him again and then comes
on here,

1491
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,520
right.
And then I haven't listened to it.

1492
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,630
And then,
uh,

1493
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:08,270
you know,
I texted,

1494
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,010
he's like,
dude,

1495
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,590
I don't want to keep going through this.
I meant zero fence.

1496
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:15,100
I've texted Karen Bryant,
DC Woodley,

1497
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:19,150
literally anyone you'll see tonight,
I this business,

1498
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:20,130
especially in entertainment,
you know,

1499
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:23,290
better anyone,
it's impossible to be successful in this

1500
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,060
business.
It's a fucking monster.

1501
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,340
I'm,
I'm willing to help them out.

1502
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:28,540
I want the help.
You know what I'm saying?

1503
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:30,520
I,
I don't want to criticize people.

1504
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:32,740
That's not what I do.
That's not what I signed up for this.

1505
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:36,920
I just got caught on a path when you 
started talking about,

1506
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,670
yeah,
and then one of the things that we do,

1507
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,340
the best part about it is there's no 
script.

1508
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,130
The best and the worst.
It's the worst because I could deal with

1509
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:46,930
this.
Sometimes he goes haywire.

1510
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,470
Yeah,
but it ain't go haywire.

1511
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,230
My biggest issue is,
is whenever someone was hurt by my words

1512
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:56,020
or,
or does it upset by something I said,

1513
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,340
then I'm like,
I again,

1514
00:57:57,341 --> 00:58:00,370
I don't know Eve's that well at all,
but I lost sleep over.

1515
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:01,600
I'm like,
oh my God,

1516
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:03,490
what am I doing?
I have respect for him.

1517
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:04,324
He's a pioneer at one 55 again,
I love all the people you've seen 

1518
00:58:06,671 --> 00:58:08,380
tonight and I've watched the show all 
the Goddamn time there.

1519
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,200
My friend just went to 0 million cents 
duck and you,

1520
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:13,450
you tried to just make sense of your 
words.

1521
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,220
It makes no sense.
I Apologize Steve.

1522
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,780
It's,
it's all good.

1523
00:58:16,781 --> 00:58:17,614
I told him,
open door policy ones come on the show 

1524
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:21,540
we can talk about on there,
but I put my foot in my mouth and I hate

1525
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:24,010
to tell you it's right and happen again.
I wish I could say it's not,

1526
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:24,844
it's probably happening again.
It's part of what makes it fun is that 

1527
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:31,510
you are really working without a filter.
Working without a net.

1528
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,040
You're just,
you're trying to have fun.

1529
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,240
So yeah,
I mean that's,

1530
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:37,080
sometimes you just take some swings and 
you miss things.

1531
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,320
I,
I came to ball,

1532
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:40,163
I was trying to hit,
I came to tell you I was taking swings 

1533
00:58:41,531 --> 00:58:42,101
at balls.
I was,

1534
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:45,490
even though it was hitting.
So sometimes that shit happens,

1535
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:46,630
but it happens.

1536
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,610
Yeah.
It's just one of those things.

1537
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,893
I mean,
I've done it a hundred times in this 

1538
00:58:50,471 --> 00:58:51,940
podcast,
said some shit and I'm,

1539
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:53,930
I was like,
what the fuck did I even say that for?

1540
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,710
I don't even know what was going on in 
my mind.

1541
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,350
And sometimes like when you're trying to
form a sentence,

1542
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:00,490
like right now I'm trying to form a 
sentence,

1543
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:00,851
right?
Like,

1544
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:02,860
sometimes while you're thinking about 
it,

1545
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,300
you're like,
this isn't going so good.

1546
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,670
I know.
Let me try to make it sound better.

1547
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,430
All right,
let me try to see if I could rescue this

1548
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,530
for the people that are listening and 
make some sense.

1549
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,170
And then it just makes it more clout and
more,

1550
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,390
fuck.
It's hard for people to fall.

1551
00:59:16,391 --> 00:59:17,270
And you was like,
oh my God,

1552
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:19,810
I speak for a living,
have ever been on stage.

1553
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:24,320
He was going through my set and I was,
I've been doing it so much lately.

1554
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,750
All be in the middle of it.
And in my mind,

1555
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:27,584
I'm fat forward to already the next bit.
And I'm thinking about that bit while 

1556
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:33,040
I'm doing this.
One of you had done that or am I curious

1557
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,520
about that?
I know cause I'm not,

1558
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:35,760
I'm not present.
Don't do that.

1559
00:59:35,761 --> 00:59:40,761
And you know what happened is I missed I
s I skipped over a part that was new and

1560
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,130
I thought it was gonna be a home run.
I skipped over it.

1561
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,680
Yeah.
And I went back and because I record it,

1562
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:46,461
right.
And,

1563
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,294
um,
and I didn't realize I was doing the 

1564
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,220
moment.
And I listen,

1565
00:59:49,221 --> 00:59:50,780
I go,
oh my God.

1566
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,300
And I remember in my head going,
dude,

1567
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,090
you're here on third.
You're in first base.

1568
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,880
You're looking at third already.
You Miss Second Pace.

1569
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,470
You're not even,
you're not even the moment.

1570
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,640
That's hard because there's like a,
you never know how you should think when

1571
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:05,480
you're on stage.

1572
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,850
You're doing the bit and you're just 
trying to perform the bit,

1573
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:09,380
right?
And if it's going well,

1574
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:10,370
then you start thinking,
okay,

1575
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:13,160
this is going well.
What am I going to lead into next?

1576
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:16,400
But while you're still talking about 
originally you can't do that.

1577
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:17,870
I know.
Have you done that before though?

1578
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,713
My ap?
Yeah.

1579
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,670
No,
I've definitely done it.

1580
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,400
He was so disappointed in myself,
man.

1581
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,323
The big thing about comedy,
one of the big things is the audience 

1582
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:29,600
has to know that you are honestly 
thinking about that subject.

1583
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:30,583
Like even if you've talked about it a 
hundred times when you're talking about 

1584
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:37,190
it that day in front of those people 
they want,

1585
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,290
they,
they're hearing it for the first time.

1586
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:41,720
They want you to be tuned into that 
subject.

1587
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,700
100% of present.
Yeah,

1588
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:45,260
if you're not,
they can sense it.

1589
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:46,970
I know.
I was so disappointed.

1590
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,740
I've never done it before.
And it was,

1591
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:49,663
it was very strange too because,
and this is what hurts me about the eve 

1592
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,730
Edward situation is the guys I looked up
to yourself,

1593
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,220
Gary Shandling,
like they always help people,

1594
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,720
man.
You don't put anyone down.

1595
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,613
They always help people.
And I don't have the same platform you 

1596
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:04,910
guys have,
but I like to think one day I will.

1597
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,740
And I want to help people like you guys 
help people.

1598
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:11,060
Like there's the 60 degrees of 
separation and you look at all the lives

1599
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:12,600
you've touched and Garry shandling,
it's,

1600
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,960
it's insane.
That's so inspirational to me.

1601
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,880
And I was watching the Garry shandling 
doc.

1602
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:17,571
I went,
man,

1603
01:01:17,571 --> 01:01:18,404
that's so cool.
And that's why this Edwards situations 

1604
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:21,770
fucking me up.
Cause I'm like,

1605
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:22,760
damn man,
it's not,

1606
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,730
I don't want to hurt anyone.
But with back to the comedy,

1607
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,120
I was so excited because the garry 
shandling stuff,

1608
01:01:28,121 --> 01:01:29,810
when they,
whenever they Kay Shanley,

1609
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,540
whenever they show comedy store stuff,
it's just,

1610
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:33,680
I'm so into it,
man.

1611
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,280
He was talking about the comedy store 
and I got super inspired and I was like,

1612
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:38,114
let's do this.
I'm never been more pumped to hit the 

1613
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:40,670
stage.
And then that happened.

1614
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,300
I was so disappointed.
You're,

1615
01:01:42,301 --> 01:01:43,540
you're still getting it.
I mean,

1616
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,460
think about like how long you've been 
doing standup.

1617
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:47,040
He'd been doing it less than two years.
Yeah.

1618
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,080
This is a thing that's going to come up 
and it's like,

1619
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:51,711
you know,
it's like,

1620
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:53,300
uh,
like when you're,

1621
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,190
you know,
you're doing a certain move and you'll,

1622
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:56,730
you'll leave yourself open for an arm 
bar,

1623
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,111
you know,
like,

1624
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,120
how the fuck am I still doing that?
It's just,

1625
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,150
you just have to submit it into your 
head.

1626
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:04,490
It's a craft,
you know what I mean?

1627
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:05,060
You're,
you're,

1628
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,690
you got a great work ethic and you're 
funny dude,

1629
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:09,583
and you're,
you're very good at going off the cuff 

1630
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,103
and you're impulsive.
Like those are all great qualities for 

1631
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:15,464
comedy.
And you also doing the work and to 

1632
01:02:17,031 --> 01:02:19,680
involve like you're listening to tapes,

1633
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,050
you going over notes,
you're doing things.

1634
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:24,930
A lot of comics don't do,
cause a lot of comics are fucking lazy.

1635
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:27,690
Like I've had conversations with dudes 
and like,

1636
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:30,930
Hey,
you did a fucking special last August or

1637
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:33,330
last October and you're already 
recording another one.

1638
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,081
And I'm like,
yeah,

1639
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:36,090
I work,
I fucking work.

1640
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:40,740
Like I really work.
Like I get home from a comedy store,

1641
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,810
I'll get home,
it's 1230 at night.

1642
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:45,390
I'll just sit in front of the fucking 
TV.

1643
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:49,260
I'll put something on just for 
background and I pull out the laptop and

1644
01:02:49,261 --> 01:02:51,730
I start writing when he come back from 
the semester.

1645
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,400
Right.
I go over,

1646
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:55,250
I go over subjects,
I'll put a,

1647
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,870
I mean sometimes it just have something 
in the background just for a visual.

1648
01:02:57,871 --> 01:03:00,270
I just like to be stimulated by 
something back.

1649
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:02,910
Or sometimes I'll just sit by myself at 
my desk.

1650
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,833
Just nothing,
just nothing but that fucking screen 

1651
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,330
staring at it.

1652
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:10,950
And when I do that every two or three 
days I'll come up with a great line.

1653
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,270
Yep.
Every two or three days,

1654
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,620
which is nuts.
What's his nuts,

1655
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,000
which is a lot of work.
Yeah.

1656
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:19,020
And cause usually I'll come home late at
night,

1657
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,200
I'll just take one little hit to sit 
down and go over the is give those ideas

1658
01:03:25,111 --> 01:03:27,030
their time.
You're the stuff you already have.

1659
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:30,300
Give those ideas their time.
And then maybe I have a new idea,

1660
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,250
maybe of a new idea.
I'll flesh that out too.

1661
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,200
And then I'll come back and look at that
again tomorrow night.

1662
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:35,034
And then I have a whole list.
I started using this program called 

1663
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:39,440
scrivener.
You ever heard of scrivener ipad?

1664
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:42,300
Uh,
well you can use it on Mac.

1665
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:44,463
Um,
it'll work on an ipad or you could use 

1666
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,410
it on a windows too.
Um,

1667
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,590
I've been writing on windows I write on.

1668
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,530
I liked that.
I like actual paper,

1669
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,230
uh,
papers.

1670
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,073
Good.
But I can't write with my hands as fast 

1671
01:03:56,641 --> 01:04:00,090
as I can type the phone version.
Oh,

1672
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:02,010
they've got a phone version two.
Is that for Android as well?

1673
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,130
It says features for Ios.
So what exactly do you do with this job?

1674
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:07,470
Um,
well this one is,

1675
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,110
this is different show the corkboard 
thing,

1676
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,240
the corkboard things.
Interesting.

1677
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,641
Um,
what,

1678
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:16,660
what they do is just see if you could 
yeah,

1679
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,850
right there.
Pull that up.

1680
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,430
So they have it like this.
This is like,

1681
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,770
you could do it in different colors.
So you gotta have different,

1682
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:26,420
each one of those things.
Those little windows can be like a box.

1683
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,273
Oh,
that's cool that you know that that 

1684
01:04:28,591 --> 01:04:30,670
doesn't look like a cork board.
But sometimes you can,

1685
01:04:30,671 --> 01:04:31,504
you could change the background and shit
and make it actually look like a cork 

1686
01:04:33,851 --> 01:04:34,380
board.

1687
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,213
But what it is is basically a board,
a bulletin board where you've taken an 

1688
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:39,654
index card and you put it up there in 
the index card has the subject that's 

1689
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:45,150
sweet.
So do that in real life too.

1690
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:49,140
I have a real cork board and I put index
cards on the Cork Board.

1691
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,620
Like if I'm doing like Vegan cat,
I'll do that bit.

1692
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:57,120
I'll put it up right there that says I 
can't wait for that one.

1693
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,133
And I put all these different things on 
the cork board and then I'll look at 

1694
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:05,760
them and I'll pick one and then I'll do 
it if it really,

1695
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:08,850
all these different things.
It's just about making the time,

1696
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,540
making the,
putting the focus.

1697
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:11,723
That's what you do and that's why you're
getting better so quick and all these 

1698
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:15,810
are the guys like,
what the fuck?

1699
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:18,670
Here's where we're doing an hour.
What the fuck he touring the road.

1700
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,400
He works,
he listens to those recordings.

1701
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:23,200
Nobody listens to the recordings,
man.

1702
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,880
They record them and they never listened
to them.

1703
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,800
I listen.
You gotta listen half too.

1704
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:28,180
It sucks to hear your voice,
right?

1705
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,080
It's not good.
They're the worst.

1706
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,001
That's what it looks like.
Oh,

1707
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:33,970
that's sweet man.
So it's set up like that.

1708
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,190
I like,
we're literally looks like,

1709
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,770
so I have that on my laptop and so I 
come home,

1710
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,673
I'll,
I'll pause to open a card and I'll pick 

1711
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:42,334
a subject and I'll start going and if 
something else comes to mind while I'm 

1712
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:46,684
on that,
I'll just start talking about that and 

1713
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,110
just keep going.
It's all just about opening up the flood

1714
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:52,780
gates,
but really just about giving,

1715
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:56,200
giving everything more time,
giving everything more,

1716
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,210
more attention,
your focus,

1717
01:05:58,270 --> 01:05:59,103
you know,
and not just skimming through it and 

1718
01:05:59,851 --> 01:06:00,684
it's over done.
What's good is a moment like this where 

1719
01:06:02,561 --> 01:06:03,394
you fucked up and you were thinking 
about one bit while you're thinking 

1720
01:06:04,781 --> 01:06:06,640
about another,
now you know that that can happen.

1721
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,080
Yup.
So that's like a lesson.

1722
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,880
So just look at it as a good thing.
Like now you're set,

1723
01:06:10,881 --> 01:06:14,020
we'll be stronger because of that.
Whenever I have a bad set,

1724
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,390
the one good thing that it says to me,
it's like,

1725
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,400
okay,
I know how bad that feels.

1726
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:24,270
I know where I went wrong.
I know it live comedy man live is crazy.

1727
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:26,560
It's just,
there's so many factors.

1728
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:28,960
It's so,
it's so loose and wild.

1729
01:06:28,961 --> 01:06:31,300
It's just,
it's a crazy way to perform.

1730
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,190
You know?
And sometimes it doesn't go right,

1731
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:34,610
but purest way to perform.
Yeah.

1732
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:35,550
Yeah.
I mean,

1733
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:36,383
but everyone I know like as far as who's
just the tip of the spear as French 

1734
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:43,330
comedy,
like you bur Deleah went,

1735
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,910
there's one thing in common.
All you guys work,

1736
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:47,470
man.
Gotta work relentless.

1737
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,990
Constantly.
Got to be doing sets all the time.

1738
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,550
You know,
I'll do sets three,

1739
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:53,140
four nights a week,
um,

1740
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,480
at the,
at the least a good week.

1741
01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:57,910
I'll do five,
like wrapping up from my special,

1742
01:06:57,911 --> 01:07:00,910
I'll do five and your specialty.
Yeah.

1743
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,080
Yeah.
It,

1744
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:03,430
uh,
Wilbur Boston.

1745
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:04,210
Yeah.
Hell yeah.

1746
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:06,070
20th and 21st can't wait man.

1747
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,970
Great.
Is that room the best?

1748
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,200
That room is crazy.
Right?

1749
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:15,310
And for me that yet I highlight that one
like as far as lifetime achievements,

1750
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:16,144
the Wilbur for a guy like me to sell it,
the Wilbert Wyatt and then you open and 

1751
01:07:19,121 --> 01:07:21,490
we kept it a secret.
I'm a chatty cathy.

1752
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,620
I was so proud of myself.
That was great.

1753
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,150
That was great.
Good Beth man.

1754
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:27,820
Well also that place is like three 
comedy clubs.

1755
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:28,960
Yes.
It's like there.

1756
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:32,080
Everyone's so close to you,
even though it's like 1100 people,

1757
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:33,310
1200 people,
whatever it is.

1758
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,293
They're stacked up so close to you.
It's like 500 on the bottom and then 

1759
01:07:37,901 --> 01:07:38,734
yeah.
You know what it's like that in the 

1760
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:41,460
fight world is the poems.
Yeah.

1761
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:43,000
When I thought Roy,
I was like,

1762
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:44,950
God,
get off of me man.

1763
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,480
Get out of town.
I didn't like it.

1764
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:47,890
The palms was great.
Yeah,

1765
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:49,120
pumps is great.
They're not doing it anymore,

1766
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:50,530
right?
No,

1767
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,720
I think doesn't Lorenzo on the palms 
now?

1768
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,060
Didn't they buy the palms?
Yeah,

1769
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:54,933
they did.
Yeah.

1770
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:58,090
Hashtag Bolan taken over.
Yeah,

1771
01:07:58,091 --> 01:08:00,370
because the 27 casinos just isn't 
enough.

1772
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,110
Like now let's keep it going.
Yeah.

1773
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:05,050
They own all those station casinos.
Those fuckers are everywhere.

1774
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:09,730
Stayed at Olin,
don't I stayed at,

1775
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,820
they made me stay at that Palestinian 
casino when I was getting,

1776
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:14,470
before I went in on the ultimate 
fighter,

1777
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,270
the worst whole diversity

1778
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,640
of my life.
Really the worst.

1779
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:18,710
The worst.
Hands down.

1780
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:22,580
I've never seen the hotel.
Now at the time is under construction is

1781
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:25,250
off the strip and of course there's a 
hooker.

1782
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:26,084
Been smacked around the other room.
I've told this story when I thought 

1783
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:29,300
there was,
I was going to be a captain,

1784
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:31,100
save a hoe and they get pulled out a 
gun.

1785
01:08:31,101 --> 01:08:33,110
I ran my underwear almost got kicked off
the ultimate fighter.

1786
01:08:33,111 --> 01:08:34,280
I've told this story on here,
I think,

1787
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,700
but that's power station casino guy 
pulled a gun on you.

1788
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,200
Well,
uh,

1789
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,840
it was the night before,
uh,

1790
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,230
the ultimate fighter,
right?

1791
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,093
Sorry if you've already heard this.
It was the night for the ultimate 

1792
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:45,030
fighter.
And they,

1793
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:48,350
they put all the fighters in there and 
they tell you the production staff goes,

1794
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:51,320
do not leave this room.
If you leave this room,

1795
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:53,450
you will be kicked off the show before 
even begins.

1796
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,760
You're not allowed to leave this room.
We're taking your phone.

1797
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,430
Everything all you have is what you 
bring in the house.

1798
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,080
Do not leave this room.
We'll bring you food,

1799
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:01,100
any food you want,
call down.

1800
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,263
So I called had myself Nice Caesar Salad
Cause I worried about my finger on the 

1801
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:06,650
ultimate fighter and the next day and 
uh,

1802
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:07,484
I finally fall asleep and I hear this 
arguing next door and the walls are 

1803
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:13,040
paper thin.
It's pallet station for God sakes.

1804
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,780
And I hear this guy in this girl arguing
like it's waking me up.

1805
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,623
I'm like,
what the fuck?

1806
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:22,220
And then she's just going off and I hear
him slap the piss out of her.

1807
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,900
Oh,
I'm like hard.

1808
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,020
And then there I hear keep going and him
hit her again.

1809
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:28,000
I'm like,
Aye man.

1810
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:28,993
So I'm like fuck this.
So I get up in my underoos to like stop 

1811
01:09:32,361 --> 01:09:34,940
this because I just thought it was a 
regular dude hitting a girl.

1812
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:35,810
I'm like,
I'm not flying.

1813
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,080
I'm not cool with that man.
I get up and salt,

1814
01:09:38,081 --> 01:09:40,280
I get on my door and I hear another do 
go,

1815
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,840
Nah man,
Nah man,

1816
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:43,520
fuck this bitch.
I'm going to shoot her.

1817
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:45,290
And I hear a gun clock,
Amal.

1818
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:48,380
Uh,
definitely not going in there now.

1819
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:50,240
Fuck that noise.
And I'm like,

1820
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:51,350
God,
it's so quiet.

1821
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:52,430
I'm like,
I don't want him to hear me.

1822
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:57,550
So I'm army calling my undies the door 
cause I'm afraid fucking gunfire.

1823
01:09:58,121 --> 01:10:01,160
It's going to go off.
I get to my door and I hear him go,

1824
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,380
hold up dog.
Hold up someone's next door.

1825
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,030
I'm like,
Oh shit.

1826
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,013
So you'll see that,
I'm sure there's video of this power 

1827
01:10:07,321 --> 01:10:08,154
station,
me just booking down the hallway and I 

1828
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:13,160
run to the casino and the,
the staff was like,

1829
01:10:13,161 --> 01:10:15,140
game when something,
they see me go running by and went to go

1830
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:18,770
get security or underwear in my 
underwear and I went to go get security.

1831
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,170
But all the production staff saw me and 
they're like,

1832
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:23,550
what the fuck is shop doing?
So I told,

1833
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:24,413
I'm the k,
some girls are about to get shot next 

1834
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:27,110
door.
I don't know what's going on.

1835
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,320
But she was hip before.
There's two dudes in there and there's a

1836
01:10:30,321 --> 01:10:32,930
lady in my room,
two 13 and like,

1837
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:34,370
all right,
so you'll show us.

1838
01:10:34,371 --> 01:10:36,360
So I go up there,
I'm not there,

1839
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,690
it's there.
And then they just,

1840
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,040
they go,
go to your room.

1841
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,230
But I'm in my room,
like look and see what's going on.

1842
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:43,183
And like a whole crew of them go in 
fucking the girl starts defending the 

1843
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,530
dude attacks.
Security.

1844
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,513
They have to taste the dude,
the other guy who was going to shoot 

1845
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:52,394
her,
they put in handcuffs and it's too 

1846
01:10:53,481 --> 01:10:54,291
large,
you know,

1847
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,150
black dudes.
And I'm like,

1848
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:56,984
I'm like fuck this.
So they bring me down the hallway cause 

1849
01:10:58,341 --> 01:11:00,080
just in case is going down,
they're bringing down the hallway,

1850
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,900
but I'm like this with the crew and I 
hear the guy go,

1851
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:07,430
I see you white boy fucking snitch.
We'll be back and we'll ah,

1852
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:08,750
so that,
and I was like,

1853
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:12,230
can I get another room that I know that 
there's no more rooms?

1854
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,070
I'm like,
well they know where I'm staying,

1855
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,500
man.
I'm supposed to start a show tomorrow.

1856
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:17,820
Like what this is.
I mean,

1857
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:20,190
what do you want us to do?
And like anything else.

1858
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:23,640
And I had to stay and I got zero zero 
winks of sleep,

1859
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:27,780
literally zero Shiro Mesh.
I was so scared.

1860
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:29,850
And that's more than when they knocked 
as like,

1861
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:30,361
yes,
yes,

1862
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:31,230
I'm here.
I'm here.

1863
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,790
Put me in the ultimate fighter house.
Yeah,

1864
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:35,760
that guy got out of jail like quick or 
guarantee.

1865
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:38,460
Oh for flapping up and it,
she was a prostitute.

1866
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:40,830
I did not know that,
but still eat the pimp.

1867
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,410
It was a pimp and a prostitute.
She then some John is in that.

1868
01:11:43,411 --> 01:11:44,910
She's a woman.
She's a woman.

1869
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:47,280
She's my equal.
She's your equal.

1870
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,260
She's my equal.
I like how are you?

1871
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:50,580
Thank you.
Think you're a feminist.

1872
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,223
Ah Man.
That's where I can turn this into that 

1873
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,770
stuff and as a joke,
that's just showing your belly.

1874
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,750
I know,
man.

1875
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,590
This whole me too movement and it's,
I dunno.

1876
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,300
It's a tricky situation.
It is.

1877
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:10,890
You think is going to bounce back.
I think the game's changed for forever.

1878
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,630
I do.
I think if you're a creep,

1879
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:15,630
you can get sought out and found out.
However,

1880
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,553
I think men in power and position and if
there's an attractive young lady in the 

1881
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:23,100
office or the studio,
there's,

1882
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:25,640
this is always to be the dynamic because
I think there's,

1883
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,470
I think there's some attractive young 
ladies out there who are like,

1884
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,660
I don't have a problem with it.
They did?

1885
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,530
Yeah.
Okay.

1886
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:32,790
Yeah.
He's an attractive dude.

1887
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,790
Just happens to have some power and get 
me a movies whenever,

1888
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:37,740
but actually like him,
you know,

1889
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:39,930
I'm not being forced to do this.
Well there's,

1890
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:43,230
there's a new option now.
It's almost like a new element is in the

1891
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:43,650
game.

1892
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,483
Like if you're playing a game and then 
all of sudden someone found like a new 

1893
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:46,914
magic power,
you can end careers now if you are like 

1894
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:51,623
a woman who was sexually abused by a guy
like Harvey Weinstein used to just have 

1895
01:12:55,021 --> 01:12:57,210
to take it.
Now you have a new power,

1896
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:58,830
which is all about.
However,

1897
01:12:58,831 --> 01:12:59,664
some will take advantage of that power 
and pull that card when it's not real 

1898
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,080
and dudes are losing their jobs.
Like,

1899
01:13:04,081 --> 01:13:05,400
whoa.
Yeah.

1900
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,840
There's people that are crazy,
like,

1901
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:07,703
look,
that video that we were watching before 

1902
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:10,920
the podcast today,
or that lady was shot up youtube,

1903
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:14,160
we're watching her,
her online videos,

1904
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:15,750
one of the worst youtube videos I've 
ever seen.

1905
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:19,530
She's fucking nuts and there's going to 
be people like that and there's going to

1906
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:22,470
be people like that that take advantage 
of the me too movement.

1907
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,060
It's just,
it's just going to be,

1908
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,720
I mean,
there's no way you can deny that there's

1909
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:29,430
just a part of human nature that's with 
anything though,

1910
01:13:29,431 --> 01:13:29,820
right?

1911
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:33,720
Yeah.
But ultimately where it's going to shift

1912
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:34,554
as people have to be nicer to each other
and they can't get away with shit like 

1913
01:13:36,901 --> 01:13:37,734
that,
and that's what Weinstein was doing was 

1914
01:13:40,171 --> 01:13:42,610
nothing but crime.
It's just crying.

1915
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:43,453
He's a bad dude.
He's a bad dude and I'm glad that 

1916
01:13:44,851 --> 01:13:45,600
happened.
Yeah,

1917
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,433
I really am.
I'm glad he got sought out and he's 

1918
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,860
scrutiny should be screwed.
You imagine being a chicken,

1919
01:13:49,861 --> 01:13:52,290
you have to suck that fat guy's Dick nor
to getting a movie.

1920
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:54,450
Hey Harvey,
he's there amy way.

1921
01:13:54,451 --> 01:13:56,510
You could just look a little more 
attractive now.

1922
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,373
Do you have to be so hideous?
There's nothing you can do at this 

1923
01:13:58,891 --> 01:13:59,724
point.
They would have to cut chunks of his 

1924
01:14:00,781 --> 01:14:02,640
face and pull it back to kids.
The money.

1925
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,670
He's got this blah,
blah.

1926
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:07,260
What about the Diet?
But it's part of the whole thing,

1927
01:14:07,261 --> 01:14:08,910
right?
It's like he's a glutton.

1928
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:10,950
Would girls complain if you look like 
Brad Pitt though?

1929
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:12,580
Tony Hinchcliffe

1930
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:13,480
has a bit.
Oh,

1931
01:14:13,481 --> 01:14:15,780
it doesn't want to.
I want to tell you that bit.

1932
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:17,630
I wasn't trying to screw us on these 
bit.

1933
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,080
He doesn't use that as an example,
but it's a great bit.

1934
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:22,210
You have to see it.
I don't want to even paraphrase you give

1935
01:14:22,211 --> 01:14:22,801
it away.
No,

1936
01:14:22,801 --> 01:14:22,991
no,
no,

1937
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:23,680
no,
you didn't.

1938
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,800
It's a great bit.
It actually involves a Louis C.

1939
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,990
K it's a great,
I love it.

1940
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,040
It's really fucking funny.
Tony's brilliant.

1941
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,053
I don't want to tell you where it goes 
because it goes even crazier off and 

1942
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,200
I'll see it.
Are you gonna see him tonight?

1943
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:36,190
Uh,
yeah.

1944
01:14:36,191 --> 01:14:37,400
He's at the store.
I'm at the store to him.

1945
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:40,540
I heard or I took them on the road with 
me this past week.

1946
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:43,930
He's killing her and murder and he 
murdered them in Nashville.

1947
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:46,510
Murdered,
murdered him in Charlotte.

1948
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,270
A lot of,
a lot of rednecks.

1949
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:49,540
Ackland Woo.
Really?

1950
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:52,900
Tony had to go to war because gluck 
heckling Tony.

1951
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:55,230
I mean,
he's a writer for the roast for guts.

1952
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,090
He's so witty.
I fucked up one time.

1953
01:14:58,091 --> 01:15:00,940
It had let my shield down.
It's telling him I almost started crying

1954
01:15:00,941 --> 01:15:03,370
and comedy central and I just feel as 
neck gets stiff,

1955
01:15:03,371 --> 01:15:05,620
he goes and right away I'm like,
oh,

1956
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:09,070
Harry coms.
And then he was like,

1957
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:10,003
you almost cried and comedy central and 
then just roasted me for basically the 

1958
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:13,410
rest of the shell.
Why would you,

1959
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:14,920
why did you almost crying comedy 
central?

1960
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,790
Just cause it's full circle for Gallic 
Miyubi on county central doing stand up.

1961
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:19,743
You know,
it was just a special night for me and 

1962
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:22,030
I,
and during this,

1963
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:22,893
the story that I tell,
I talked about how I realize that's 

1964
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,823
never become UFC champ.
But being on comedy central and a Judd 

1965
01:15:28,511 --> 01:15:29,920
apatow towns,
when the books I've read,

1966
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:30,850
when a super,
you know,

1967
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:33,480
concern and comedy and that day at 
[inaudible],

1968
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:36,050
my show that night did comedy central,
I don't know,

1969
01:15:36,051 --> 01:15:36,884
it just hit me in that moment was on 
stage at a strip club where they shoot 

1970
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:41,440
it and I don't know,
I got emotional.

1971
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,273
I was like,
do you need to get your shit together 

1972
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:44,560
man?
You gotta get your shit together,

1973
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:46,190
you're happy.
I was happy.

1974
01:15:46,191 --> 01:15:49,280
I as emotional man.
And then it said that on the pockets,

1975
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:51,590
feel close,
Nico,

1976
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:53,740
Nico.
And I was like,

1977
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:55,540
Oh fuck.
He's like,

1978
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:59,710
this isn't comedy central in 2010 and 
just went nuts man.

1979
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,341
Well,
Hey Ange,

1980
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:02,170
because I've always had a thing with 
comedy central.

1981
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:05,530
Yeah.
For whatever's gonna burn his side about

1982
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:07,600
them.
Like they didn't appreciate him.

1983
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:11,080
He's a very underrated guy man.
Like right now he's still to this day,

1984
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:13,060
he's right now he's underrated.
I agree.

1985
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,820
And I think with your show and we were,
he was closed I think.

1986
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:16,810
Got,
yeah,

1987
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:20,470
I mean he's a monster in our show.
The most underrated guy who I,

1988
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:22,750
who should be sent out theaters just 
feel Vaughn,

1989
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:26,210
well we were talking about that before 
too.

1990
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:28,480
Has got,
he hit a stride,

1991
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:32,290
like within the last year he had a 
stride where he just like,

1992
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:34,230
sometimes you'll see dudes,
they,

1993
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,083
they're doing really well and then for 
whatever reason they figure something 

1994
01:16:38,021 --> 01:16:39,840
out and they take it to the next 
breakthrough.

1995
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,330
And that's worth Theo is right now he's 
just,

1996
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:45,430
he's,
and he's a unique guy.

1997
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:48,400
Like his comedy is so unique.
Like it wouldn't work with anybody.

1998
01:16:48,401 --> 01:16:49,234
You don't see it anywhere else.
It's us telling me sometimes I'll watch 

1999
01:16:51,671 --> 01:16:52,504
other comedians and I'll go,
I can see how they came up with that 

2000
01:16:54,461 --> 01:16:55,720
idea.
And I watched the,

2001
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:56,521
I'm like,
what the fuck?

2002
01:16:56,521 --> 01:16:58,150
What the fuck you smoking?
Yeah.

2003
01:16:58,151 --> 01:16:59,950
Where are you coming up?
Where were you raised?

2004
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:05,770
How old?
How's that race?

2005
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:08,470
By a fucking pack of crocodiles in New 
Orleans.

2006
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:12,340
Did you come up with this?
Yeah,

2007
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,273
he's,
but even just hanging around with him 

2008
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:17,930
like offstage.
He's just a weird dude.

2009
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:18,823
Oh Bro.
He pulled up at the store yesterday and 

2010
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:22,160
you just got a new car.
I don't,

2011
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,420
I won't say the car.
Nice car.

2012
01:17:23,421 --> 01:17:25,010
We'd like it.
And uh,

2013
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:25,881
he,
I go,

2014
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:27,620
dude,
you're killing it man.

2015
01:17:27,621 --> 01:17:28,790
That your car is.
Yeah.

2016
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:31,400
And he has some homosexual.
Bumped into the back.

2017
01:17:31,401 --> 01:17:33,770
Can Be there.
Why is he a homosexual?

2018
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:34,760
He's like,
cause he was,

2019
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:35,760
I'm like,
all right.

2020
01:17:35,761 --> 01:17:36,591
It just happened.
Yeah,

2021
01:17:36,591 --> 01:17:36,950
it's,
yeah.

2022
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:39,860
He's like just having a big,
he's just so hilarious,

2023
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:41,090
man.
Yeah,

2024
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:43,640
there's a lot of good guys right now.
I was talking about,

2025
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:44,503
uh,
watching that garry shandling stuff and 

2026
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:50,210
doing all the stuff.
Judd's document's Jet Aptos documentary.

2027
01:17:50,211 --> 01:17:50,690
It's brilliant.

2028
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:53,450
On his process and stuff like that.
I got emotional on that as well.

2029
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,580
I don't know if guys know this,
obviously I'm a complete bitch.

2030
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:56,653
Uh,
but guess Shannon talks about how his 

2031
01:17:58,251 --> 01:17:59,084
goal through going through everything 
was to get on the tonight show and then 

2032
01:18:01,321 --> 01:18:03,470
he does it and he walks backstage and 
kills it.

2033
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:04,304
Right?
But that was his goal and he starts 

2034
01:18:05,241 --> 01:18:07,170
crying.
He falls in a Bob Sag,

2035
01:18:07,171 --> 01:18:08,210
it's arms starts crying.
Right?

2036
01:18:08,211 --> 01:18:09,044
Cause that was his goal.
But he's talking about the comedy store 

2037
01:18:10,341 --> 01:18:12,170
and like he's talking about all the big 
names there.

2038
01:18:12,171 --> 01:18:13,100
And I was thinking,
God,

2039
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:13,934
that must've been cool to be involved in
that back then around all this big 

2040
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,420
names.
I was talking to Brian,

2041
01:18:17,421 --> 01:18:18,650
Brian Goes,
man,

2042
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:19,484
right now the comedy store,
some would argue it's better and we 

2043
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:22,911
think about it.
I'm like,

2044
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:23,721
God,
it is.

2045
01:18:23,721 --> 01:18:26,870
When you think about all the fucking 
just legends,

2046
01:18:26,871 --> 01:18:27,704
man,
you [inaudible] you got married and got 

2047
01:18:29,841 --> 01:18:30,350
delete.

2048
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:33,170
I mean just the list goes on and on and 
on.

2049
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:34,040
I'm like,
oh my God,

2050
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,260
it's bad man.
It's a crazy time.

2051
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:37,453
It's certainly the best time at the 
store in terms of like the amount of 

2052
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:43,010
time that I've been there and I started 
going there in [inaudible] 94.

2053
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,200
It's a long time.
It's a long ass time.

2054
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:47,630
So in 24 years that I've been going 
there,

2055
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:50,570
it's better now than ever before.
But when you think about it,

2056
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:52,400
I mean obviously there's the seller in 
New York,

2057
01:18:52,401 --> 01:18:53,234
but as far as like on a give,
you go there on a Tuesday night and 

2058
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,220
Wednesday night,
I mean it's fricking,

2059
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,120
yeah,
they're very similar.

2060
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,650
They're very similar in a way.
Um,

2061
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:02,603
but,
and they're also very similar in that 

2062
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:06,920
they become big tourist traps to like 
comedy store.

2063
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:07,754
People take vacations for comedy,
they do comedy vacations and they fly 

2064
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:13,700
from Australia,
getting a lot of people from Australia.

2065
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:15,320
But because you know,
if you show up,

2066
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,850
uh,
you're going to see bill burr,

2067
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:17,684
Rogan,
Mark Baron and delete in the same night 

2068
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:22,550
almost every week.
One of us is there sounds at least,

2069
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:24,290
unless someone's on tour,
so it's off.

2070
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,153
Yeah.
Yeah.

2071
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,900
I in a lot of times you are on tour.
Um,

2072
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:32,450
but shit on any given Tuesday,
Dave Chappelle might stop it.

2073
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,190
Correct.
And then Chris Rock's rock,

2074
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,920
maybe Louis don't make us come back 
there.

2075
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:42,040
I hope he does.
I'm going to lose people like come on,

2076
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:46,760
come on.
You like people watching you beat off.

2077
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:48,620
I mean this is worth shit.
Come on.

2078
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,580
Yeah.
Just need someone to come up.

2079
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,950
Someone has to do some much more 
horrible,

2080
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:55,993
you know,
calen shooting his special I think in 

2081
01:19:57,711 --> 01:19:58,544
July.
No,

2082
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:00,980
he is through uh,
some,

2083
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:01,963
I forget who's who's shooting it,
but definitely not as buddy works for 

2084
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:06,270
espn this time.
So they're doing it right there.

2085
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:07,980
He's doing it right time.
But I,

2086
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,960
they're gonna go out there and try and 
sell it,

2087
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:10,794
but he's ready to go.
I just hope it works out for count as 

2088
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:15,510
far as Netflix or showtime or somewhere 
you got to land somewhere,

2089
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:17,520
you know.
Is he going to sell it and then bring it

2090
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:18,450
somewhere?
Is that the move?

2091
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:20,850
I think so.
I don't want to misquote Brian,

2092
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:22,020
but I'm,
I'm most positive,

2093
01:20:22,021 --> 01:20:22,854
but he has someone who I think he shot 
[inaudible] girls and a bunch of other 

2094
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:28,140
guys stuff like it's someone who knows 
what the hell they're doing.

2095
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,590
Where's he going to do it?
Uh,

2096
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:31,550
I think Chicago.
Ooh,

2097
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,030
Chicago in July.
Yeah.

2098
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:37,350
That's a good spot.
I'm there for the UFC in June.

2099
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:41,190
I'm doing the Chicago theater.
June 7th or some shit.

2100
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,090
I love Chicago.
Whew.

2101
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,300
That sounds,
I did Chicago theater.

2102
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,493
Chicago.
Yeah.

2103
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:47,773
Yeah.
It's great.

2104
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,770
It's beautiful.
Beautiful place to,

2105
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,510
yeah.
Chicago's awesome man.

2106
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:54,420
Doesn't get enough love to weird place,
right?

2107
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:55,273
It does it not get enough love.
I feel like everyone fucking loves 

2108
01:20:56,971 --> 01:20:57,804
Chicago.
Their pizza people won't shut up about 

2109
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:00,900
not really pizza.
It's casserole.

2110
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,790
It's a casserole.
Correct.

2111
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,710
Yeah.
It's like a wrap calling that a peanut.

2112
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,420
That's not a pizza.
If you took large,

2113
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:08,550
thick square,
that would be a casserole.

2114
01:21:08,551 --> 01:21:09,384
And I come from,
have you ever hamburger and you roll it 

2115
01:21:11,311 --> 01:21:13,290
up in a Tortilla?
Is that still a hamburger?

2116
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,730
No.
That's the Tortilla.

2117
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,410
And I rap.
That's a Burrito.

2118
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:20,220
But just proteins.
That's lettuce.

2119
01:21:20,620 --> 01:21:22,320
We call that out.
Let us Taco.

2120
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,420
That's a lettuce wrap.
Chinese food place,

2121
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:26,323
chicken,
chicken,

2122
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:29,460
Sasha wrapped.
See the differences the way you make it.

2123
01:21:29,461 --> 01:21:30,450
It's rolled up.
Look,

2124
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:33,660
you could take a piece of pizza and 
flatten it out and fold it over,

2125
01:21:33,661 --> 01:21:36,240
over and over again,
and then it'll become folded pizza.

2126
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:38,790
But if it starts out folded,
what are you selling me?

2127
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,240
It's a cal zone.
Yeah,

2128
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:42,690
he me a Goddamn cal zone.
I love the cows.

2129
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:44,063
I'm a fan.
I'm a fan of cows on how to get thick 

2130
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:48,660
piece of pizza from a basic casserole 
from Chicago though.

2131
01:21:48,930 --> 01:21:50,040
Yeah.
Oh yes.

2132
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,510
You've ever had though.
Very good.

2133
01:21:51,511 --> 01:21:53,230
The best you've ever had.
What did,

2134
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,083
where's the place we go to?
So what is it called you or Donna is 

2135
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:00,330
that one might've been,
you know who makes a nice square piece?

2136
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,890
Is King's in New York or have you ever 
heard of a Ah,

2137
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:04,880
fuck it.
I'm getting it.

2138
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,753
The artichoke pizza in New York.
Artichoke P it's called artichoke pizza 

2139
01:22:09,241 --> 01:22:11,400
of Dev ripped pants to get in there.
No Sir.

2140
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:14,580
No Sir.
People kept telling me go there.

2141
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:16,530
When I was in New York working with 
showtime,

2142
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,930
I tried one slice,
you know postmates,

2143
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:22,050
postmates what makes me fat now?
Because I made posts,

2144
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,230
get food,
drops it off to your hotel room.

2145
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:28,110
So I get done after a long day of pr,
I'm like,

2146
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,300
pizza be great.
So I get two slices.

2147
01:22:30,301 --> 01:22:31,230
I'm like,
next night.

2148
01:22:31,231 --> 01:22:31,921
I'm like,
fuck,

2149
01:22:31,921 --> 01:22:33,720
that was delicious.
I see.

2150
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:34,350
No,
my gut,

2151
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:38,910
I fucking love handles and a kitchen.
Isn't it weird how like when you tired,

2152
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:41,610
you want carbs,
wants sugar and carbs.

2153
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,460
I wonder why.
I think it's like my willpower is weak.

2154
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:45,803
Yeah.
Like I want like I never fuck with egg 

2155
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:50,430
mcmuffins or mcgriddles my mouse water.

2156
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,480
But if I'm at the airport and I'm on a 
fucking 7:00

2157
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,680
AM flight,
you and I working together.

2158
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:58,583
I never eat that shit.
You and I it together so good for the 

2159
01:23:01,141 --> 01:23:02,850
brief moment it was in my mouth,
dude.

2160
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:03,900
You know what I was thinking?
I'm like,

2161
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,770
God love him.
Be Grill,

2162
01:23:05,771 --> 01:23:06,604
but I don't wanna be judged right now.
I'm going to wait to see if he goes to 

2163
01:23:08,681 --> 01:23:09,514
that fucking weird place on the 
breakfast spot on the right or is he 

2164
01:23:13,181 --> 01:23:14,860
getting going to Mcdonald's and we 
started leaning over there.

2165
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:18,490
I went and I want to be,
I wouldn't be mad at egg mcmuffin.

2166
01:23:18,491 --> 01:23:19,540
And you've looked at,
yeah,

2167
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:20,710
fuck this.
Let's do this.

2168
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,130
Yes.
I ate before I saw you guys.

2169
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:24,964
I thought you would skip it.
You want to be the guy who pulls the 

2170
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:29,260
trigger.
You don't wanna be judged,

2171
01:23:29,261 --> 01:23:30,130
man.
Yeah,

2172
01:23:30,131 --> 01:23:32,380
most of the time I'm going to not pull 
the trigger,

2173
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:35,020
but it's,
I feel like that's part of the thing.

2174
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,870
It's like pulling that trigger every now
and then for the fuck of it.

2175
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:39,820
I have some fun.
Get chicken and waffles.

2176
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:43,160
Go to Roscoe's,
go to Roscoe's in slatter.

2177
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,070
That motherfucker with maple syrup and 
butter.

2178
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,110
You just can't do it every day.
You can't do it every day,

2179
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:49,300
but you do it one day a week.
I agree.

2180
01:23:49,301 --> 01:23:51,130
Rock his,
his instagram,

2181
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:56,170
like those pictures of him meeting 
stacks and stacks of pancakes.

2182
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:57,310
Definitely a photo shoot.
Yeah,

2183
01:23:57,311 --> 01:23:58,780
I hear you.
You Ain't you and all that.

2184
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:00,660
So you think so?
No,

2185
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,340
that's definitely so a giant.
You don't think he eats all that shit?

2186
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:04,191
Yeah,
he's not a judge.

2187
01:24:04,191 --> 01:24:04,901
I mean he,
he,

2188
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:06,580
he,
he's on different supplements than I am.

2189
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:08,460
We're both very similar size,
different supplements,

2190
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:10,870
different supplements,
supplements,

2191
01:24:10,871 --> 01:24:13,750
Supplement pays and they come from south
of the border.

2192
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:19,100
I'm sure he's eating the same 
[inaudible] you ain't the same tacos and

2193
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:22,960
you see he came out and he has 
depression.

2194
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,360
I think he's,
it's football thing,

2195
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:26,440
man.
I think.

2196
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:28,360
Um,
and then also pro wrestling,

2197
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,730
all that slamming.
I like getting slammed around.

2198
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,070
This is my take on this,
I think.

2199
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,860
I mean you,
I'm sure you've dealt with depression,

2200
01:24:35,861 --> 01:24:37,170
right?
Do you have bummer days,

2201
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,200
Jamie?
Haft bummer days,

2202
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:39,430
right?
Shit happens.

2203
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:40,443
I think there's a difference between 
having a depression period in your life 

2204
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:45,370
or event in your life.
And then,

2205
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:47,470
you know,
you're normally a happy dude and there's

2206
01:24:47,471 --> 01:24:50,410
people with severe depression who has to
be medicated.

2207
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,161
There's this scale.
Yeah.

2208
01:24:51,161 --> 01:24:53,730
And he's not on that scale.
Now he's on that scale.

2209
01:24:53,731 --> 01:24:54,700
Makes News.
Cause he goes,

2210
01:24:54,701 --> 01:24:56,200
Hey,
I've been sad to before.

2211
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:57,011
Like,
yes.

2212
01:24:57,011 --> 01:24:59,530
Rocket Sat.
Two different sad.

2213
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:01,390
We're not talking about you should fear 
depressed here.

2214
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:02,231
You know what I'm saying?
Right.

2215
01:25:02,231 --> 01:25:04,750
He was talking about his mom was Ari 
Shaffir depressed out.

2216
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:07,130
Mike Royko.
His mom walked into traffic and I'm,

2217
01:25:07,131 --> 01:25:08,500
and I'm not throwing shade at Ari.

2218
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:09,573
We've talked about already having 
depression before and he takes 

2219
01:25:10,691 --> 01:25:11,524
medication.
That's why I said that he doesn't 

2220
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:12,994
anymore.
He's off medication and he's Hilarious 

2221
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:16,770
magically.
Oh,

2222
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:17,311
weird.
Yeah.

2223
01:25:17,311 --> 01:25:20,070
He's a phenomenal comic and successful 
and he's not depressed.

2224
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:21,963
Also,
he got off propecia callen calls pull 

2225
01:25:24,361 --> 01:25:25,194
shan.
I counseled taking propecia like their 

2226
01:25:26,291 --> 01:25:28,330
skittles and he's the happiest man I 
know.

2227
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,210
Yeah.
But it's not necessarily like universal.

2228
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,810
Like some people can take penicillin and
they don't have a problem.

2229
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,880
Other people are allergic to it.
Yeah.

2230
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:40,030
But I think it's a rare case where he'd 
take propecia and get depressed.

2231
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:40,953
Oh.
Think is are rare.

2232
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,810
I bet if you look at the studies and 
this come from countless,

2233
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:47,080
I mean this is bro Science.
Calvin just wants that hair,

2234
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:49,030
wants to keep that hair so bad.
I'll do anything.

2235
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:51,530
You know what?
I think you should go.

2236
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,430
Well.
Good fat one red one.

2237
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:57,870
Yes.
Just go crazy so I can yank it off and I

2238
01:25:57,871 --> 01:26:00,880
want to wear a wig so bad like one of 
those,

2239
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:04,490
those mesh net ones,
just like the Lebron sprayed

2240
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,620
on look almost looks like a Pittsburgh 
steeler helmet.

2241
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:08,390
Ron Still doing that?
Yeah,

2242
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:10,340
kind of.
Yeah,

2243
01:26:10,341 --> 01:26:11,960
definitely.
You just got to let it go.

2244
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,823
Question on this though.
Wouldn't you take from Kesha because 

2245
01:26:15,681 --> 01:26:16,514
you're a little depressed because your 
hair's falling out and if it didn't 

2246
01:26:18,411 --> 01:26:20,600
work,
you're going to stay correct.

2247
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,640
A little depressed.
So fucks with your Dick game.

2248
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,230
Yeah,
maybe.

2249
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:25,064
But I think what they're saying is like 
suicidal depression that there's 

2250
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,353
something about the dht inhibitor 
dihydrotestosterone which is derivative 

2251
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:37,400
of testosterone is what causes you to 
have your hair fall out.

2252
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:42,730
The dht inhibiting factors in propecia 
with some people it adds to it.

2253
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,610
It's a low percentage.
So I'm pretty sure might be

2254
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:48,440
the study this comes from,
which I just,

2255
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:50,840
I would google,
it might've been more than one study was

2256
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,490
in 2012 and it was only 61 men.
Oh the only did 61 minute.

2257
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:59,570
How many got depressed,
said a 61 man who formerly use propecia,

2258
01:26:59,571 --> 01:27:00,404
who experienced more than three months 
of sexual side effects and had no 

2259
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:05,030
history of depression,
sexual problems of any sort.

2260
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:06,860
Yeah.
I don't know,

2261
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:07,693
Dude.
If I'm losing my hair and my Dick won't 

2262
01:27:08,841 --> 01:27:10,660
get up and I'd be depressed too.
Yeah.

2263
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:11,623
Do stock take.
And then also you've got to figure out 

2264
01:27:13,121 --> 01:27:13,954
like what's happening in your love life.
If you're depressed and your Dick 

2265
01:27:17,661 --> 01:27:18,770
doesn't work.
Correct.

2266
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,753
But also up philosophy,
if you had a nine to five job you hate 

2267
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:26,030
and that pay the bills and then you got 
family drama,

2268
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,073
11% of those,
I guess 11% of the 61 which would be 

2269
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:30,980
what?
Six of them,

2270
01:27:30,981 --> 01:27:34,520
five or six had mild symptoms,
symptoms of depression.

2271
01:27:34,521 --> 01:27:37,400
28 had moderate and 36 had severe.

2272
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:40,490
Whoa.
36 had severe.

2273
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:42,350
Uh,
I mean,

2274
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:43,880
so that's also then when you're asking 
them,

2275
01:27:43,881 --> 01:27:44,870
so it's like,
what is the step?

2276
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,990
What was the study on a second?
Did you say 61 people?

2277
01:27:47,991 --> 01:27:51,540
36% percent had severe depression.

2278
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:55,680
I found that 44% of the men had 
experienced thoughts of suicide.

2279
01:27:55,790 --> 01:27:56,623
Hold on.
I'm already hold on Jesus Christ to 4% 

2280
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,000
right.
But that's what I'm also going in.

2281
01:28:01,001 --> 01:28:02,710
Like what were they,
would they just ask them like,

2282
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:04,690
have you ever thought of it because 
you're like,

2283
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,460
well,
did they call it the scientific study?

2284
01:28:06,461 --> 01:28:08,670
I'm sure there's some sort of protocol 
they have to follow.

2285
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,633
Let me understand this though.
66 people were randomly out of how many 

2286
01:28:14,171 --> 01:28:15,190
people took it,
right?

2287
01:28:15,191 --> 01:28:15,660
It says

2288
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:18,660
the Journal of Clinical Psych,
psychiatric psychiatry,

2289
01:28:18,661 --> 01:28:20,970
I'm sorry,
study included 61 men.

2290
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:21,910
That's what it,

2291
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:24,580
so what does that like 28 dudes wanted 
to kill themselves.

2292
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,910
That's fucking crazy.
That property show.

2293
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:29,550
Fuck that.
I just don't ball jude.

2294
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:33,550
Ari said it like it was like almost 
instant and he never put the two of them

2295
01:28:33,551 --> 01:28:34,384
together.
Never put the dough in depression with 

2296
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:39,060
the,
with the suicidal thoughts like it,

2297
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:41,020
all of it came like white when he got 
out.

2298
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,741
I'm like,
you know,

2299
01:28:41,741 --> 01:28:46,390
he had had some issues in the past with 
being depressed after breakups.

2300
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:48,190
Normal Shit.
Like everybody has it.

2301
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:50,170
But it wasn't,
that's not the case.

2302
01:28:50,171 --> 01:28:51,310
I know want to kill me.
He didn't know.

2303
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:54,760
He didn't,
Ari's kind of a stoic dude.

2304
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:58,510
He's very proud and he doesn't talk a 
lot about stuff.

2305
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,583
And so it took like me and him hanging 
where he like wasn't talking and I was 

2306
01:29:03,631 --> 01:29:04,464
like,
okay,

2307
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,630
what's a matter?
And he's like,

2308
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:07,980
dude,
it's just hard.

2309
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:11,010
It's hard to just not kill myself.
He said that to you?

2310
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,900
And I went blind.
Yeah.

2311
01:29:12,901 --> 01:29:15,300
So we were playing pool at my house and 
I was like,

2312
01:29:15,301 --> 01:29:16,350
what?
I go,

2313
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,080
what's going on?
So he starts telling me,

2314
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:20,143
um,
they put him on medication and the 

2315
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:22,554
medication didn't work and then they put
him on another medication and then that 

2316
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:26,250
didn't work.
And you know,

2317
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:28,710
he's with Sag,
it's Sag Aftra insurance,

2318
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:31,470
not the best insurance.
And he's like,

2319
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:33,060
I don't know what to do.
Um,

2320
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:34,103
and I'm like,
okay,

2321
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:37,200
this is one of my best friends.
And he's reaching out.

2322
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:37,950
I'm like,
Hey,

2323
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:39,060
saints,
up for a reason.

2324
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,190
And I don't have any experience with 
that.

2325
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:44,610
I mean,
I've had some bomber moments in my life,

2326
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:46,050
but I would never say that I was 
depressed.

2327
01:29:46,051 --> 01:29:46,884
I'm,
I'm pretty,

2328
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,930
pretty happy birthday and depressed 
though.

2329
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,320
Yes.
If that bad moments,

2330
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:51,670
but I'm not,
I'm not,

2331
01:29:51,671 --> 01:29:53,220
I've never gone through depression.

2332
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:54,990
I've never been down for like six 
months.

2333
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:56,880
Couldn't get out of bed or thought about
suicide.

2334
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:58,170
No,
this is a scale of that shit.

2335
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,440
He was,
he was on,

2336
01:30:00,441 --> 01:30:02,840
uh,
the dark end of this game.

2337
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:05,280
That's what he was thinking about 
killing himself and trying to,

2338
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,670
trying to not do it.
So,

2339
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:09,504
um,
I just started making some phone calls 

2340
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:12,390
and I found,
um,

2341
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:16,680
my business manager found the best 
psychiatrist,

2342
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,720
like you said,
like this guy is a wizard.

2343
01:30:18,721 --> 01:30:20,670
He's dealt with a bunch of my clients 
before.

2344
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,530
He's,
he's helped out a lot.

2345
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:24,683
It was very expensive.
So I just paid for it not to say yes to 

2346
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:28,530
life.
I just told Paul No,

2347
01:30:28,531 --> 01:30:29,760
I mean,
I'm thinking about it that way.

2348
01:30:29,761 --> 01:30:30,600
I mean,
for Ari,

2349
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:32,550
he couldn't afford it at all.
So I always like,

2350
01:30:32,551 --> 01:30:33,780
yeah,
I'm sure a great option.

2351
01:30:33,781 --> 01:30:34,540
I can't afford this.

2352
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:35,373
Yeah.
You know,

2353
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:39,770
he was getting by,
I'm winning poker tournament and getting

2354
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,530
the occasional commercial goes this 
quite a few years ago.

2355
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:46,620
I want to say like 2000,
I dunno,

2356
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:50,790
it was quite a few years ago,
2004 some shit like that.

2357
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,230
I Dunno,
I don't remember when it was.

2358
01:30:52,231 --> 01:30:53,064
Sure.
But it was far enough back where 

2359
01:30:54,871 --> 01:30:56,700
[inaudible] was really struggling as a 
comedian.

2360
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,863
I mean he's,
I used talked about this publicly or 

2361
01:30:58,990 --> 01:30:59,900
otherwise I wouldn't talk.
No,

2362
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:00,753
that's why,
that's why I brought it up that he's 

2363
01:31:01,621 --> 01:31:03,070
talked about it publicly.
I'm not Erin,

2364
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:06,840
he's lane dirty laundry out then I love 
art.

2365
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,880
I mean,
I don't know what caused it.

2366
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:12,210
If it was that I can't stop coughing 
today.

2367
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:16,170
Like my,
my kids are sick as fuck my youngest one

2368
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:17,640
and everyone gets it.
Yeah.

2369
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:20,520
Um,
he just,

2370
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:22,770
his career wasn't going well cause he 
was,

2371
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:24,990
you know,
it was just getting the ballroom really.

2372
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:26,363
But I really think it was the pro show.
He don't you think he was the perfect 

2373
01:31:28,741 --> 01:31:29,574
storm propecia career?
Who knows what's going on with his girl 

2374
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,670
and then it's just this fucking perfect 
storm.

2375
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:38,640
The propecia is making you even more 
depressed.

2376
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:39,420
They're like,
dude,

2377
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:42,210
I'll think about killing myself.
What the fuck is going on right now?

2378
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:43,750
But anyway,
darts.

2379
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:46,440
So he pulled out of it,
got off the prepuce show,

2380
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:50,280
um,
and then his career took the fuck off.

2381
01:31:50,281 --> 01:31:51,930
Right.
He got on good medication,

2382
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,560
whatever the medication,
his new psychiatrist got him on,

2383
01:31:55,620 --> 01:32:00,370
worked like a charm and like he was 
better in like couple months,

2384
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,353
a couple months.
He was like back to Ari fucking around 

2385
01:32:03,221 --> 01:32:05,530
laughing.
Then oddly enough,

2386
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,920
when it started working really well for 
him,

2387
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:11,350
then his career started taking off.
Right.

2388
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,550
Of course.
That's how it works.

2389
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:14,830
I'm a standup,
started taking off his career,

2390
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:16,810
started taking off,
he became happier,

2391
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:21,870
got off the propecia and then weaned 
himself off the drugs and now he's good.

2392
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,710
Now he's good.
Yeah.

2393
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:26,950
That was great to see.
But he smokes a lot of weed and I always

2394
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:27,784
wonder like,
is that how much of that is self 

2395
01:32:28,571 --> 01:32:29,404
medicating?
Yep.

2396
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:31,900
But it's okay.
But you smoke a ton of weed.

2397
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:33,520
It's not a self medicating though,
right?

2398
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:34,503
No,
I like it.

2399
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:37,020
I just liked doing it.
Then you're not a doctor.

2400
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:38,860
It makes you,
it makes you vulnerable.

2401
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:41,260
It makes you think about shit.
It makes you nervous.

2402
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:42,303
Like she like makes you pause and you 
don't just take things for granted when 

2403
01:32:45,251 --> 01:32:46,810
you get high,
you start thinking about,

2404
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:48,340
my problem is I smoked the other night.

2405
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:50,620
I couldn't sleep in US thinking about a 
lot of things.

2406
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:55,570
And then I got this thought in my head 
cause it's some weird shit man.

2407
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,620
Let's talk to him.
Uh,

2408
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:57,341
uh,
thing.

2409
01:32:57,341 --> 01:32:59,380
I was telling calendars that hate when 
my,

2410
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:03,250
when I think like this,
but I was in San Jose and I saw this mom

2411
01:33:03,251 --> 01:33:06,670
with two homeless kids and that,
and um,

2412
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:07,563
I was at the store and I was going to 
buy an expensive sweater and I felt so 

2413
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:11,584
guilty.
So when he got cash and gave this mom 

2414
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:17,170
bunch of cash and uh,
she started crying and I'm like,

2415
01:33:17,171 --> 01:33:18,004
fuck man.
And there's like this weird die around 

2416
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:22,840
the kids.
And the kid was about my son's age,

2417
01:33:22,841 --> 01:33:24,610
about two sitting there,
this little girl.

2418
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:26,260
And I thought,
I thought,

2419
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:27,303
I dunno why I had this random thought 
once he grabbed her by the lake and 

2420
01:33:29,141 --> 01:33:30,070
spiked on the ground.

2421
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,570
I don't know why.
I know,

2422
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:33,560
I know.
And then I didn't,

2423
01:33:33,561 --> 01:33:36,130
and I gave her the cash felt better 
because more people around like no one's

2424
01:33:36,131 --> 01:33:36,964
gonna let that happen to a kid.
And so that whole night fucked up at it 

2425
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,060
and its own reach out to him.
Like,

2426
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:41,260
dude,
that's her side hustle.

2427
01:33:41,261 --> 01:33:42,880
She does that all the time.
She's actually not,

2428
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:44,830
we've seen her like raise those kids on 
the street.

2429
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:46,960
She gets picked up by a husband.
It's a shitty deal.

2430
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:47,711
So I'm like,
all right,

2431
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:49,330
that's fine.
Then I smoked weed,

2432
01:33:49,331 --> 01:33:50,164
right.
And I'm,

2433
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:52,900
I'm laying in bed and then I had this 
visual,

2434
01:33:52,901 --> 01:33:54,820
so don't do that to my son.
I go to sleep.

2435
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,830
I felt sick to my stomach.
I know,

2436
01:33:57,831 --> 01:33:59,100
it's weird.
Like sometimes we'd,

2437
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,943
I can think if I think about a bid,
I think that some are good on this cool 

2438
01:34:02,141 --> 01:34:02,770
road.

2439
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:06,760
But then if that creeps in there and 
then it's like it kept coming up.

2440
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:09,130
It was so visual and I was like sick to 
my stomach.

2441
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:10,623
I mean it's,
my son woke up at five and I fucking 

2442
01:34:11,891 --> 01:34:12,724
beeline to his room and just like 
squeeze the fuck em for the rest of the 

2443
01:34:14,981 --> 01:34:16,930
morning.
It's hard,

2444
01:34:16,931 --> 01:34:21,310
man.
Nobody knows how much you love a person,

2445
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,160
how much you can love a person until you
have a kid.

2446
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,930
Correct.
Once you one says that,

2447
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:28,330
everyone says that and I'm like,
okay,

2448
01:34:28,331 --> 01:34:29,164
okay everyone.
I know you told me that Brian till 

2449
01:34:30,371 --> 01:34:33,310
everyone told me this,
but then once you have a kid it's like,

2450
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:34,653
I don't know man.
It's just a different animal where now 

2451
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:39,790
like I,
when I see the shootings,

2452
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,350
when I see,
you know the,

2453
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:42,184
the,
the nuclear war talk with North Korea 

2454
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:44,344
and Russia,
I think God and I see that a lot of 

2455
01:34:47,051 --> 01:34:49,030
negativity on social media,
stuff like that.

2456
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:49,863
I'm like,
the world is such a kind of a fucked up 

2457
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:54,070
place if you want to look into that 
stuff and when to have a kid.

2458
01:34:54,071 --> 01:34:55,510
I think about him like,
God,

2459
01:34:55,511 --> 01:34:56,344
man,
what's it going to be like when he's 

2460
01:34:57,471 --> 01:34:58,304
like 16 or 18 like what kind of world is
going to be when he's 18 of I think too 

2461
01:35:01,671 --> 01:35:03,950
hard about it.
That's when I'll get depressed.

2462
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,810
Well,
I think the world's going to be okay.

2463
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,793
I mean for sure.
I don't mean to bring this part just 

2464
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:09,320
down Obama.
No,

2465
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,180
but horrible things are going to happen 
no matter what.

2466
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,130
Correct.
But you know,

2467
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,560
it changes who you are.
When you have a kid,

2468
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:16,513
it really does.
You're or you're a piece of shit or 

2469
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:23,090
you're sociopath and he's such.
Just if you're around the kid enough,

2470
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:25,610
it changes who you are.
And if you're not around the kid,

2471
01:35:25,611 --> 01:35:26,444
it changes who you are because then you 
realize you're not around the kid and 

2472
01:35:28,141 --> 01:35:31,250
that that's going to take a piece out of
who you think you are.

2473
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:32,181
But you know what?
If,

2474
01:35:32,181 --> 01:35:33,014
if you,
if you and we have friends who aren't 

2475
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:37,040
great dads or whatever and you could see
it in their kids.

2476
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:38,081
I can I,
and I'm,

2477
01:35:38,081 --> 01:35:41,090
I'm not up psychologists or I'm some 
expert in parenting,

2478
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,240
but if I go to a person's house and I 
see the way the kids treat the pants,

2479
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:45,800
I go,
you're not around enough man.

2480
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:47,150
I can,
I promise you.

2481
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:49,780
I can tell my son doesn't act like that.
Yeah.

2482
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:51,590
Cause one thing that you can call me 
whenever you want,

2483
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:53,390
whenever you want.
One thing I am is a beast of a dad.

2484
01:35:53,391 --> 01:35:55,490
I know that.
I don't know if I'm get comic.

2485
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:58,370
I don't know if I was a good fighter.
I don't know if from good podcasts are,

2486
01:35:58,371 --> 01:35:59,204
that's all up for debate.
One thing I know is I'm a fucking good 

2487
01:36:01,701 --> 01:36:03,500
dad man.
Good for you man.

2488
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,910
That's a,
it's a very,

2489
01:36:04,911 --> 01:36:05,661
very,
very,

2490
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:10,040
very important quality and that quality,
when your kid becomes an adult,

2491
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:13,760
that's going to be just a major factor 
in how you get along.

2492
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:14,660
You know,
I give you,

2493
01:36:14,661 --> 01:36:19,280
I mean even parents,
I know friends had had bad relationships

2494
01:36:19,281 --> 01:36:21,440
with their parents when they live with 
them and then once they got out,

2495
01:36:21,441 --> 01:36:23,900
their parents were nice to them,
but the parents were shitty to them when

2496
01:36:23,901 --> 01:36:26,380
they were kids and they always hold it 
against a whole always.

2497
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:28,310
They always have that shit in the back 
of their head like,

2498
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,440
why were you a dick when I was 12 you 
know that,

2499
01:36:30,441 --> 01:36:32,050
that,
that shit is always in their head.

2500
01:36:32,051 --> 01:36:34,130
It's like that Avatar horse when you're 
young,

2501
01:36:34,131 --> 01:36:36,650
you,
you mixed together and if you don't make

2502
01:36:36,651 --> 01:36:38,140
together when you're young it,
yeah.

2503
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:40,400
And I was talking to someone,
a therapist,

2504
01:36:40,401 --> 01:36:41,234
they're saying,
I think it's from like til they're 

2505
01:36:42,801 --> 01:36:43,610
three.

2506
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:45,420
If you don't make that connection.
Yeah.

2507
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:46,341
When,
when you're like,

2508
01:36:46,341 --> 01:36:47,240
oh,
when they're for like,

2509
01:36:47,241 --> 01:36:48,074
oh,
I'll do it now it's almost too late 

2510
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,690
because they already developed these,
this,

2511
01:36:50,691 --> 01:36:52,490
these brain pathways were like,
Nope,

2512
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:55,850
my dad's an ass and there's really 
nothing can do to fix it.

2513
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:57,350
Yeah,
man.

2514
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,270
I went to the movies yesterday with my 
kid,

2515
01:36:59,690 --> 01:37:02,690
my movie.
We went to see the Romeo and Juliet.

2516
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,430
Oh yeah.
What is it?

2517
01:37:04,431 --> 01:37:05,730
A sherlock gnomes.
Yeah,

2518
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,550
that's true.
Like no cute little movie.

2519
01:37:07,551 --> 01:37:08,530
Yeah.
But you know,

2520
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,460
we went to that Synopsis Place,
but you know,

2521
01:37:10,461 --> 01:37:12,170
you lean back,
you know those things.

2522
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:12,981
Yeah.
Seats,

2523
01:37:12,981 --> 01:37:14,870
lean back,
good food and you take the uh,

2524
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:15,704
the seat rest down and she just,
my seven year old just snuggles with me 

2525
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,020
best.
They're snuggling watching a movie.

2526
01:37:21,021 --> 01:37:22,160
I'm like,
I couldn't be happier.

2527
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:23,930
I don't want to see the stupid fucking 
movie.

2528
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:24,890
No,
but I don't care.

2529
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:29,030
She wants to so I couldn't be happier.
I sat there and watched us.

2530
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:31,500
Silly knows shit movie.
Yeah.

2531
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:35,840
She just a little snuggle bunny.
I've watched her last baby nine times by

2532
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:37,390
not a bad mood.
And like a week though,

2533
01:37:37,391 --> 01:37:38,630
that's pretty funny movie.
I'm boss.

2534
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,750
Baby's great alcohol with the voice.
I watched like nine times,

2535
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:44,180
but my son whenever watch,
he snuggled that when he,

2536
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:45,710
when usually this is why I want a 
daughter.

2537
01:37:45,711 --> 01:37:46,544
That's why I'm jealous you have 
daughters because daughters loved their 

2538
01:37:48,141 --> 01:37:49,610
dads.
My son.

2539
01:37:49,611 --> 01:37:53,360
I'm like,
you little traitor mommy,

2540
01:37:53,361 --> 01:37:53,931
mommy.
Like,

2541
01:37:53,931 --> 01:37:55,740
dude,
it's me every morning.

2542
01:37:55,741 --> 01:37:56,080
Your car

2543
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,130
for your mom are like that too.
And a lot of ways it's just,

2544
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:00,313
you got to accept the fact that the mom 
is not just the soft sweet woman in the 

2545
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:08,214
house,
but she's also the person who made them 

2546
01:38:09,841 --> 01:38:13,710
in the her body and there's chemicals 
connect out of her body.

2547
01:38:13,711 --> 01:38:14,900
Man.
There's no,

2548
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:18,300
like I had to deal with my wife.
Like I'm not naming any kids.

2549
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:19,650
I go,
I got veto power.

2550
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:21,480
I go,
but you do way more work.

2551
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:24,750
Like it's way harder to make the person 
I go.

2552
01:38:24,751 --> 01:38:26,730
As long as you try to call the kid 
applesauce or something.

2553
01:38:26,731 --> 01:38:27,810
Fucking stupid.
Yeah.

2554
01:38:28,590 --> 01:38:30,780
You know,
I just don't feel like it's,

2555
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:33,120
it's not even proposition.
Oh,

2556
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:36,200
I did this fucker.
We're going to do anyways.

2557
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:39,300
But now we all deal with this.
See,

2558
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,930
you got a bonus.
You get a bonus overtime for you.

2559
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:43,823
It is kinda crazy though,
that sex is how you make people I know 

2560
01:38:47,371 --> 01:38:48,204
and everybody wants,
just wants to fuck all the time and you 

2561
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:52,440
want to fuck a bunch of people.
A lot of people don't want kids.

2562
01:38:52,441 --> 01:38:53,250
No.
Hell No.

2563
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:55,380
You know,
who opened my eyes like in a big way,

2564
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:58,230
uh,
in a podcast recently that's really been

2565
01:38:58,231 --> 01:39:00,660
making me think a lot about this is Bret
Weinstein.

2566
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,570
He's the,
the professor that gotten that.

2567
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:04,590
Do you know that?
You know,

2568
01:39:04,591 --> 01:39:07,860
he is controversy with the Evergreen 
universities and all that,

2569
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:11,370
and they were taking the day,
it wasn't a pronoun thing.

2570
01:39:11,371 --> 01:39:14,100
It was the day of absence.
They wanted all the white people to stay

2571
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:14,701
home.
And he's like,

2572
01:39:14,701 --> 01:39:16,090
that's racist.
Yeah.

2573
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,880
Anyway,
he was on,

2574
01:39:17,881 --> 01:39:20,730
you said there's two different things 
that men are attracted to.

2575
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:21,893
They're attracted to a woman that they 
think would be a great companion and a 

2576
01:39:26,491 --> 01:39:27,420
great mother.

2577
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:31,050
And like someone who,
he said there's a difference between hot

2578
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,310
and beautiful.
Correct.

2579
01:39:32,311 --> 01:39:33,144
Like some women are beautiful and like 
they're loving you want to be around 

2580
01:39:35,671 --> 01:39:36,840
them.
It goes,

2581
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:37,674
but then there's other women who are 
just hot and in males that very 

2582
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:45,570
receptive woman who doesn't require any 
commitment,

2583
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:46,703
was an opportunity for men to spread 
their seed with someone who they didn't 

2584
01:39:50,011 --> 01:39:51,660
have to be around for.
Wow.

2585
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:52,613
Yeah.
So there's literally like a programming 

2586
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:54,954
in a man's mind.
So you see a girl with big giant tits 

2587
01:39:58,141 --> 01:39:58,974
and a little waist and a fat ass hanging
out of her shorts and she's got sloppy 

2588
01:40:01,681 --> 01:40:03,660
makeup on and she looks at you and 
you're like,

2589
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:04,540
oh,
okay,

2590
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,140
let's do this.
But that's what that is.

2591
01:40:07,141 --> 01:40:09,040
It's not like live with her.
You let,

2592
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:09,943
you're not saying,
I would like to start a relationship 

2593
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:11,431
with you.
It's like,

2594
01:40:11,431 --> 01:40:12,264
no,
I want to shoot my load into you and 

2595
01:40:13,411 --> 01:40:16,800
then you raise my kid when I'm nowhere 
near you because it's an opportunity for

2596
01:40:16,801 --> 01:40:18,240
my dna to propagate.

2597
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:20,430
Wow.
So much sense.

2598
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:23,370
It makes so much sense.
I literally never considered it until he

2599
01:40:23,371 --> 01:40:24,720
brought it up on the podcast.
I went,

2600
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,770
oh Duh,
me neither.

2601
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,580
I just thought she's hot.
She's just hot,

2602
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:32,400
dirty in a dirty way.
Why she so attracted to that?

2603
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:34,710
Why is she so dirty?
I told my girl,

2604
01:40:34,711 --> 01:40:35,730
Joe,
I told my girl Joe,

2605
01:40:35,731 --> 01:40:36,564
probably four weeks into it,
five weeks we were getting serious and 

2606
01:40:39,661 --> 01:40:40,494
she got this job offer to go to Miami.
She was talking about career and stuff 

2607
01:40:42,661 --> 01:40:43,710
like that and I went,
no,

2608
01:40:43,711 --> 01:40:44,544
that's all cool.
It's all I know one's career first more 

2609
01:40:45,961 --> 01:40:47,010
than me.
However,

2610
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:47,611
uh,
you know,

2611
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:49,230
you're put on the search to be a mom,
right?

2612
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:51,390
Like you're going to be such a beast of 
a mom.

2613
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:54,190
I guarantee you,
because I saw her interact with Callan's

2614
01:40:54,191 --> 01:40:55,024
kids.
I can guarantee you that you might be 

2615
01:40:57,281 --> 01:41:00,490
the greatest host in the world,
but you're going to be the best mom I've

2616
01:41:00,491 --> 01:41:01,180
ever seen.

2617
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,110
And then she's like,
really?

2618
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:04,840
I'm like,
I guarantee you fucking Bam Bam.

2619
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,273
Well that's just those qualities.
They can see it's something and when 

2620
01:41:08,471 --> 01:41:10,810
someone's not,
when someone's a bad mom,

2621
01:41:10,811 --> 01:41:13,750
it's such a depressed man.
Nothing worse.

2622
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:15,273
So depressing to be around women.
I was like really short with her kids 

2623
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:19,840
and Shitty with them and like,
oh well even as a kid,

2624
01:41:19,841 --> 01:41:22,750
if I had friends who like talked back to
the parents are mean to their parents.

2625
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:24,610
Oh God,
what's wrong with you?

2626
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,810
If I was dating a girl,
she'd like bad mouth,

2627
01:41:26,811 --> 01:41:28,790
their mom.
Like what's wrong with you girl?

2628
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:30,850
And the hard thing is that pattern hard 
to break.

2629
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:31,803
It's hard to break.
Those kids may very well have that same 

2630
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:37,630
kind of behavior towards their kids.
Like when they become adults,

2631
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,333
it's a hard pattern to break.
Sometimes you need the right person in 

2632
01:41:40,931 --> 01:41:41,764
your life.

2633
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,900
It's like a good person in your life 
that you,

2634
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,600
you know,
a wife or husband or whoever it is.

2635
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,580
You know when you,
you match up with that person,

2636
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:52,510
like it changes who you are too.
That's what I always say that one of the

2637
01:41:52,511 --> 01:41:56,020
most important things about um,
community,

2638
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:57,490
like your community of friends.
Yeah.

2639
01:41:57,670 --> 01:42:00,850
It's when you have good friends,
those people change you.

2640
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:05,110
Like you react.
Like everyone is your tribe.

2641
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:09,520
You react like everyone's your friends,
so you want good for them.

2642
01:42:09,521 --> 01:42:10,990
You love them,
you care about them.

2643
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:11,943
They change who you are.
They change if they inspire you or they 

2644
01:42:14,621 --> 01:42:15,454
like it.
Whether they inspire you with being 

2645
01:42:16,241 --> 01:42:18,850
smart or their kindness or their 
ambition,

2646
01:42:18,851 --> 01:42:22,270
whatever it is that we're on.
We're not individuals.

2647
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:26,140
We're a piece of a community always.
And that community,

2648
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:28,120
even if it's a small community that you 
call a family,

2649
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:31,870
that piece is dependent upon who you do 
that piece with.

2650
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:32,883
A,
you might be an amazing dad with the 

2651
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:37,090
right woman,
but with the wrong woman,

2652
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,073
you might be so frustrated with the 
relationship that you're not as good at 

2653
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,073
data right now.
There might be chaos going on all the 

2654
01:42:43,661 --> 01:42:44,494
time.
You might be situations you put the kid 

2655
01:42:46,061 --> 01:42:46,894
in when you're yelling and screaming at 
each other of the kitchen and see all 

2656
01:42:49,061 --> 01:42:49,894
these different factors that are 
dependent upon your relationship with 

2657
01:42:52,961 --> 01:42:53,794
this other person.
And they changed you and you change 

2658
01:42:55,701 --> 01:42:56,534
them.
Like you might be the wrong person for 

2659
01:42:57,491 --> 01:42:58,324
them.
They might be super cool and calm with 

2660
01:43:00,041 --> 01:43:01,420
someone else,
but with you,

2661
01:43:01,421 --> 01:43:02,530
they just,
it's just not a mitch.

2662
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:05,860
It doesn't hit buttons.
It's like a woman saying to you,

2663
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:06,551
uh,
you know,

2664
01:43:06,551 --> 01:43:08,000
you don't want an equal like,
well,

2665
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,060
I don't want this.
I don't want this.

2666
01:43:10,061 --> 01:43:10,960
No,
I don't want this.

2667
01:43:10,961 --> 01:43:12,580
You might be right,
but I know for sure.

2668
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:13,630
I don't want that.
You're threatened.

2669
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:15,370
You threatened by a strong woman.
No,

2670
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:16,720
I'm threatened by you.
You're just,

2671
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:17,613
you're aggressive for no reason.
Who the fuck has ever said that you 

2672
01:43:19,490 --> 01:43:21,700
threatened by strong man to try and by 
strong man.

2673
01:43:21,701 --> 01:43:25,030
Like it's like what?
Shut up cause he was he calling yourself

2674
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:26,470
a strong man.
Get the fuck Outta here.

2675
01:43:26,471 --> 01:43:31,110
Any guy who calls himself a strong man 
like that job most likely's up pitch.

2676
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:33,500
Most likely.
It's just trying to prop himself.

2677
01:43:33,770 --> 01:43:36,880
And I feel the same way about women who 
say that women who were like,

2678
01:43:36,881 --> 01:43:38,050
you know,
you're scared of a strong woman.

2679
01:43:38,051 --> 01:43:41,100
Like okay,
am I really or are you a cocked?

2680
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:42,730
Yup.
Oh are you a call?

2681
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:47,420
Just a raging cause this talk,
this sounds like this guy can't talk.

2682
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:49,480
And again,
super uncomfortable.

2683
01:43:49,481 --> 01:43:52,250
I don't know what got us to this,
but whatever I did

2684
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:53,960
please,
I'll apologize.

2685
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,480
But I also feel like in,
in,

2686
01:43:55,481 --> 01:43:59,950
in this community of friends that were 
talking about if you are a shit father,

2687
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,260
it would show elsewhere in your life 
around us.

2688
01:44:03,261 --> 01:44:07,160
Or if we're at the comedy store,
we're a restaurant or in your,

2689
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:08,143
in your social media,
it's going to come out one way or 

2690
01:44:09,531 --> 01:44:10,364
another.
You know,

2691
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,680
tough to be in that group.
You know the expression,

2692
01:44:12,681 --> 01:44:14,300
how you do one thing is how you do 
everything.

2693
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:16,050
Yes.
Yeah,

2694
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:18,560
yeah.
I think there's something to that.

2695
01:44:18,561 --> 01:44:19,394
I mean obviously there's people that are
really good at one thing and then suck 

2696
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:22,280
at other things.
So it's not a,

2697
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:25,070
it's not always a hundred percent 
correct.

2698
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:27,470
But you know,
if you're a shitty dad,

2699
01:44:27,471 --> 01:44:29,540
you're going to be a shitty friend.
I agree.

2700
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,250
And if you're a shitty friend,
you're probably going to be shitty.

2701
01:44:31,251 --> 01:44:32,900
Dad and I,
and I say this too,

2702
01:44:32,901 --> 01:44:37,040
with like with due to our shitty debt 
dads,

2703
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:37,610
it's like,
right.

2704
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,520
If you're willing to do that to your,
literally your connect to this person,

2705
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:41,331
chemically,
they're,

2706
01:44:41,331 --> 01:44:44,030
they're made of your DNA.
If you're on a treat him like that.

2707
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:47,330
When the going gets rough for me,
where the fuck are you going to be?

2708
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:48,950
Right.
There's no way I want you to my foxhole.

2709
01:44:49,850 --> 01:44:51,350
Yeah,
that's big man.

2710
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:54,410
And then people that don't,
they don't understand that.

2711
01:44:54,411 --> 01:44:55,820
They understand what they're doing 
wrong.

2712
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,460
That's rough too.
And the Bummer,

2713
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:01,820
the people that can't see it and you try
to explain it to them and they can't see

2714
01:45:01,821 --> 01:45:02,654
it.
The one thing people will put up with 

2715
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:05,990
though,
as in I would never do this,

2716
01:45:05,991 --> 01:45:07,760
but if you give someone parenting 
advice,

2717
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:08,960
just doesn't,
there's just,

2718
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,190
there's certain things you can't talk 
about.

2719
01:45:10,191 --> 01:45:12,530
Usually politics,
religion and parenting.

2720
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:13,483
The only way I think parenting advice 
works ever is if you talk about one 

2721
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:18,944
great thing that you found that you do 
with your kid without criticizing none 

2722
01:45:21,621 --> 01:45:23,050
other pests,
you could,

2723
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:23,913
you could give them advice but not give 
them advice by like you can relay your 

2724
01:45:27,231 --> 01:45:31,940
personal positive experiences and either
they take it or they don't.

2725
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:33,260
But as soon as you start saying,
hey man,

2726
01:45:33,261 --> 01:45:35,090
I see how you talk to your son and 
you're like,

2727
01:45:35,091 --> 01:45:38,870
what?
What the fuck did you say to your son is

2728
01:45:38,871 --> 01:45:39,441
uh,
you know,

2729
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:42,010
he's an individual man.
You treat her like an object.

2730
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:42,853
Like fuck,
I don't fucking treat my son like all 

2731
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:46,740
the time came over.
He's not even listening.

2732
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:48,360
What you said you,
you're all ramping up.

2733
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,880
My son was one and a half at the time 
and I was taken to this,

2734
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:54,860
this play area and he,
you know,

2735
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:55,753
he did not express himself and everyone 
was older and you'd hit kids and he's a 

2736
01:45:58,401 --> 01:45:59,234
big kid.
He's a 99% tile for size and all that 

2737
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:02,564
stuff and he would hit kids and the the 
place where I was taking him in 

2738
01:46:06,981 --> 01:46:07,814
Brentwood knew I was a former fighter.
One of the guys who works front desk as 

2739
01:46:10,761 --> 01:46:11,480
a fan.

2740
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:15,320
I've talked mma with them and they took 
me to the side and said,

2741
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:16,573
you know,
we got a bit of a problem because tiger 

2742
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:22,760
is hitting kids and we think it's in 
direct correlation of you let them watch

2743
01:46:22,761 --> 01:46:26,030
fights and from,
I just started laughing,

2744
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:28,120
you guys are silly as fuck.
Hey,

2745
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:29,600
I'm never bring them back.
B.

2746
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:34,100
He's one and a half.
Everyone else in their s three I mean,

2747
01:46:34,101 --> 01:46:34,934
yeah,
he cold cock that kid with a left hook 

2748
01:46:35,841 --> 01:46:37,260
and I'm proud of,
I'm proud of,

2749
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:39,320
I could took his toy.
However,

2750
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,880
it's just,
this is what kids do.

2751
01:46:40,881 --> 01:46:42,530
They hit man.
It's nothing that we,

2752
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:43,461
and I tell him,
no,

2753
01:46:43,461 --> 01:46:45,920
I'm staying on top of my helicopter.
The parent the fuck out of him when he's

2754
01:46:45,921 --> 01:46:47,000
in there,
but these,

2755
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:50,210
these one and a half there were,
are older and have,

2756
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:52,170
trust me,
he's not watching UFC.

2757
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:56,490
It's not has nothing to do the side.
This lady was like that.

2758
01:46:56,491 --> 01:46:59,540
You have F C or whatever you're getting 
into.

2759
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:00,570
I was like,
oh my God,

2760
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:04,890
this is some Brentwood shit lady.
There's a lot of shit right now.

2761
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:05,760
All right,
yellow,

2762
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:06,780
yellow,
meet dirt.

2763
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:08,190
If they hit each other,
they hate each other.

2764
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:09,053
We're concerned that you are constantly 
reaffirming his gender without him 

2765
01:47:12,601 --> 01:47:16,470
choosing were concerned.
Some,

2766
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:19,410
I was reading something about some lady 
on a three year old trans kid.

2767
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:20,760
I'm like,
oh my God,

2768
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:24,930
how about are you sure?
Are you positive and not just a kid.

2769
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,651
You're three.
Oh,

2770
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:27,150
you mean the how?
He's into cars this week.

2771
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:28,220
Next week.
I mean trolls.

2772
01:47:28,221 --> 01:47:30,300
They want to chop his dick off while 
they were like,

2773
01:47:30,301 --> 01:47:33,630
this article was like really super 
positive about it.

2774
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:37,350
Ah,
bringing the kid to therapy and shit and

2775
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:41,310
aiding his transition.
My keys fucking three in this.

2776
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:43,050
I just read this like two days ago.
I was like,

2777
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:45,510
this is so nuts.
There's so much that it's going on right

2778
01:47:45,511 --> 01:47:48,120
now and I want to be a transformed when 
us three you don't see my dad,

2779
01:47:48,121 --> 01:47:52,500
Pun fucking mechanical arms on me.
Imagine if I was three arms on me.

2780
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:56,640
I'm 19 like what the Fuck Dad?
Why am I a robot now?

2781
01:47:56,730 --> 01:47:57,563
Well,
when you were three told you want to be 

2782
01:47:58,291 --> 01:48:01,170
a robot,
it's the same shit is the same shit.

2783
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,820
It's crazy.
It's insane.

2784
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:03,683
It's so weird.
It's so weird that people are just 

2785
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,900
openly jumping into this and it's these 
weirdo super,

2786
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:10,763
you know,
ideological progressive people that 

2787
01:48:12,571 --> 01:48:13,404
just,
they're locked into this idea that it's 

2788
01:48:14,671 --> 01:48:15,504
amazing to have a trans kid and the kid 
shows any sign whatsoever of being 

2789
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,910
inclining to be female or inclined to be
mailed.

2790
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:23,790
They're pushing it.
I'm like,

2791
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:26,040
Oh God,
I feel like it's actually bad.

2792
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:27,503
Well,
it's also very dangerous because they 

2793
01:48:28,321 --> 01:48:30,090
start wanting to fuck with the kids 
hormones.

2794
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:31,223
Like you got to let the child develop.
There's no real science and what the 

2795
01:48:34,501 --> 01:48:36,800
fuck happens when you put hormone 
blockers new,

2796
01:48:36,801 --> 01:48:38,940
a three year old and try to transition 
them into a girl,

2797
01:48:38,941 --> 01:48:41,940
but also the real doctors,
you know what the hell they're doing.

2798
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:43,860
They're not going to inject that kid 
with hormones.

2799
01:48:43,861 --> 01:48:44,700
So you can say,
listen,

2800
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:48,590
if you want to do this when you're 1819 
even then it's a little too early,

2801
01:48:48,591 --> 01:48:51,210
but when you're 21 which is again,
it's too early.

2802
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,313
The,
and I've seen this on some of the 

2803
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:55,880
bullshit reality TV shows that much,
but these legit doctoral,

2804
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:59,100
then I'm willing to help you out.
But before then get out of here.

2805
01:48:59,130 --> 01:48:59,731
No,
get out.

2806
01:48:59,731 --> 01:49:00,564
Let's see where yet.
When you're 16th there's a market for 

2807
01:49:02,221 --> 01:49:04,560
it,
which is a cruel thing to say in a weird

2808
01:49:04,561 --> 01:49:05,460
way to describe it.

2809
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:06,640
Here's the problem,
John.

2810
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:07,980
We were talking about,
you know,

2811
01:49:07,981 --> 01:49:10,470
on the spectrum,
for some of those kids,

2812
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,690
they do feel like they're trapped in a 
woman's body.

2813
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:14,760
You know what,
and I feel for them that must suck to go

2814
01:49:14,761 --> 01:49:17,580
through high school and all that.
But isn't that the exception?

2815
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,833
You know what I'm saying?
Like is that kit the exception that 

2816
01:49:20,401 --> 01:49:23,130
feels like,
and they should have access to it.

2817
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:24,840
How could you do that with a three year 
old?

2818
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:25,351
I know.
I mean,

2819
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:26,580
how do you know?
I mean,

2820
01:49:26,581 --> 01:49:30,240
you just don't and anybody says he do.
Your crazy people change.

2821
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,253
You change when hormones get entered 
into your body and maybe you won't be 

2822
01:49:33,181 --> 01:49:36,420
the most masculine man in the world and 
maybe you will turn into a woman someday

2823
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:37,523
maybe,
but give yourself a goddamn chance to 

2824
01:49:40,081 --> 01:49:42,420
just exist.
Do you see the high school wrestler?

2825
01:49:42,930 --> 01:49:44,490
Yes.
The girl just beaten up.

2826
01:49:44,491 --> 01:49:46,320
Right.
And that had been then she waves at test

2827
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:48,080
booze like a motherfucker.

2828
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:49,413
I know it's not fair.
She should be able to out to russel boy 

2829
01:49:51,361 --> 01:49:53,950
or he should be allowed to wrestle boys,
you know,

2830
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:55,330
but you know,
whatever man.

2831
01:49:55,331 --> 01:49:55,961
It's crazy.
You're,

2832
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:58,690
you're taking a high school girl and 
you're filling her up with testosterone,

2833
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:01,270
with injections.
What?

2834
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:02,403
It's nuts.
And then you're allowing you to wrestle 

2835
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:06,760
girls that aren't on testosterone.
It's fucking cheating.

2836
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:07,803
Okay.
If she was just a girl and she wasn't 

2837
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:11,073
like trying to transition into a man and
they found out that she was winning the 

2838
01:50:14,291 --> 01:50:16,810
state championship as a woman or as a 
girl,

2839
01:50:16,811 --> 01:50:20,080
rather by taking steroids,
they would take it away from it.

2840
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:22,270
She would say she's cheating.
They'd be,

2841
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:26,140
there'd be an uproar.
Do not let her wrestle.

2842
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,720
Yes.
Not let her wrestling with the law.

2843
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,501
Why?
Because if they go,

2844
01:50:29,501 --> 01:50:33,790
we can't wrestle with the boys and I'll 
just can't rest that all the rest of the

2845
01:50:33,791 --> 01:50:35,530
boys more don't wrestle.

2846
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:37,630
I would say she,
that's what she wants.

2847
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:39,780
What's the rest of the boys?
She,

2848
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:44,050
they,
they're these zero reserves.

2849
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:45,850
Um,
yeah,

2850
01:50:45,851 --> 01:50:46,601
I,
I think it,

2851
01:50:46,601 --> 01:50:47,021
hey,
if you,

2852
01:50:47,021 --> 01:50:51,220
if you're going to choose to go that 
path of this transitioning to a female,

2853
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:52,383
then you give up your right to wrestle 
because we don't have a division for 

2854
01:50:54,431 --> 01:50:56,480
that vet and get and we don't have 
enough wrestling.

2855
01:50:56,590 --> 01:51:00,370
She's transitioning to he and it's just,
it's not fair.

2856
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,780
It was,
if it was the other way,

2857
01:51:01,781 --> 01:51:06,130
it would be more fair because like if 
you're a man and you're transitioning to

2858
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:06,964
be a woman and they make you wrestle men
while you're going to be at a 

2859
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:10,504
disadvantage because you are taking 
hormone blockers or you're getting 

2860
01:51:13,451 --> 01:51:15,190
castrated,
you're losing your test to goals,

2861
01:51:15,191 --> 01:51:16,810
your whatever,
whatever it is,

2862
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,360
you are at a disadvantage.
You that aspect.

2863
01:51:19,361 --> 01:51:21,970
Yeah.
He's at a disadvantage now transitioning

2864
01:51:21,971 --> 01:51:22,804
to,
I mean he's added a massive advantage 

2865
01:51:24,431 --> 01:51:26,500
right now,
transitioning to a man there.

2866
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:27,333
He's on steroids.
You're got up the kids on steroids on 

2867
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:30,513
100% and probably a lot of them probably
a lot of it because they're trying to 

2868
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,990
turn him into a man.
Correct.

2869
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:35,843
It's all nuts,
but I know like where was this 30 years 

2870
01:51:37,331 --> 01:51:39,460
ago?
It was it just like a silent epidemic.

2871
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:40,990
There's everyone just under cover.
It was like,

2872
01:51:40,991 --> 01:51:42,010
God,
I feel like a woman.

2873
01:51:42,011 --> 01:51:43,630
You know.
There was a few of those.

2874
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:45,970
There was like that one guy,
Renee Richards,

2875
01:51:45,971 --> 01:51:50,050
that the tennis player that wound up 
transitioning.

2876
01:51:50,051 --> 01:51:50,884
He was a terrible male tennis player,
transitioned to a female tennis player 

2877
01:51:53,981 --> 01:51:54,814
and start dominating Joanna man.
That's the plot of Joanna man tennis 

2878
01:51:58,301 --> 01:51:59,680
addition.
Now that movie,

2879
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:00,920
No,
it was do you want him?

2880
01:52:00,921 --> 01:52:03,850
I want a man was the guy who couldn't,
he get suspended from like the Lakers,

2881
01:52:03,851 --> 01:52:05,680
the fake Lakers in the movie.
So he's like,

2882
01:52:05,681 --> 01:52:06,760
God,
I want to play basketball.

2883
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:09,920
So like you could make the women's team.
He just wore a wig and put tvs on us.

2884
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:11,950
Started dunking on bitches.
Well,

2885
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:12,843
that does happen today.
There was a guy who was ready for this 

2886
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:20,050
50 years old.
He was six foot four or five,

2887
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:25,530
played women's college basketball 
because he played as a man,

2888
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:29,420
but now he's not a man anymore.
Now this fool is a fucking war.

2889
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:32,860
He's a fool.
If you went past and you're 50 years old

2890
01:52:32,861 --> 01:52:35,510
and you're pretending to be a college 
girl and be like,

2891
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:36,443
I'm in a fantasy where out my fantasy 
and she's a giant and she's swatting 

2892
01:52:40,331 --> 01:52:42,940
basketballs out of people's hands.
There's Joanna man.

2893
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:46,940
Yeah.
See if you could find the guy who played

2894
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:50,750
it was 50 type in 50 year old 
transsexual man,

2895
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:55,250
transsexual plays,
women's college bath in America.

2896
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:56,270
Yeah.
In America.

2897
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:57,133
Well,
here's the thing.

2898
01:52:57,650 --> 01:52:58,483
Imagine if your kid is on a team with 
that person and that person takes your 

2899
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:07,370
kids scholarship,
takes your kids.

2900
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:10,960
Look at that right there.
Fit your old aw,

2901
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:11,893
seriously.
Gi Yak jacked and got 50 year old knows 

2902
01:53:15,951 --> 01:53:20,200
on him and became a college basketball 
player at fucking Mike.

2903
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,120
Get the fuck out of here.
52 excuse me.

2904
01:53:23,121 --> 01:53:25,850
Gabriel Ludwig.
52.

2905
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:27,013
Okay.
Two years old than me goes to college 

2906
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:30,770
and she ball.
Uh,

2907
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,890
I think she played as a man.
Look at that size difference.

2908
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:38,480
Now imagine your kid is competing 
against her and it can't get a shot off.

2909
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:41,060
Can't get a Shaquille o'neal and it's 
just bullshit.

2910
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:43,610
It's like if Shaquille o'neal was 
playing on that other team,

2911
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:47,390
if Shaquille o'neal transition to be a 
woman decided to go back to college,

2912
01:53:47,630 --> 01:53:50,630
this college would let her play as a 
woman.

2913
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:52,340
That's Shaquille o'neal.
I was a woman.

2914
01:53:52,370 --> 01:53:54,830
What colleges?
That douche bag university.

2915
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,020
I Dunno.
I don't want to,

2916
01:53:57,021 --> 01:54:00,200
I don't want to give him any press.
Press makes me sick.

2917
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:06,530
I mean that's a giant man with tits.
It's straight nonsense.

2918
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:07,573
It's straight nonsense.
This is where she get ballplayers as 

2919
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:10,283
the,
this is where progressiveness goes down 

2920
01:54:12,590 --> 01:54:15,650
the rabbit hole.
What does it mission college.

2921
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:17,180
That's probably a juco.
Huh?

2922
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:19,850
I don't know what it is but it gets,
it could suck it.

2923
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:24,520
It can suck a nonexisting.
Interesting thing.

2924
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:27,140
She played college basketball for 30 
years ago as a man.

2925
01:54:27,141 --> 01:54:29,090
I said how does she still have 
eligibility?

2926
01:54:29,091 --> 01:54:30,590
Cause she's a woman now.
That's what I said.

2927
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:32,600
Transition.
They let her,

2928
01:54:32,630 --> 01:54:36,050
they let her transition and when you're 
transitioning you go back.

2929
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:38,510
Now you're a woman.
You don't have a history of playing as a

2930
01:54:38,511 --> 01:54:39,344
woman,
so now you're allowed to play again for 

2931
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:42,630
five more years of college too.

2932
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:44,480
I feel like a lot more.
Can I ask you got to do this?

2933
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,840
There's a few that would do it.
Oh hundred percent.

2934
01:54:47,841 --> 01:54:49,490
Oh Dana White was joking around about 
that.

2935
01:54:49,491 --> 01:54:51,320
Like I know a few guys that could be a 
world champion.

2936
01:54:51,321 --> 01:54:53,480
They'd cut their dick off.
There's a few guys,

2937
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,760
there are some guys who by all means 
this there,

2938
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:56,683
it's crazy to even suggest,
but so is walking into youtube shooting 

2939
01:55:00,951 --> 01:55:03,050
a bunch of people and then shooting 
yourself in the chest.

2940
01:55:03,170 --> 01:55:06,200
That's crazy suggest too,
that people fucking mind.

2941
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:07,730
That bitch was definitely out of her 
mind.

2942
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,450
And also if you saw youtube videos,
no one or you made no fucking money,

2943
01:55:11,451 --> 01:55:14,120
Lee,
those videos were terrible.

2944
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:16,610
Well there's something wrong with that 
ladies brain.

2945
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:18,090
How about her dad goes,
uh,

2946
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:20,150
warned the police.
I can get any to check her out.

2947
01:55:20,151 --> 01:55:21,440
She didn't do something bad to youtube.

2948
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,820
There's some,
some issues here,

2949
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:26,660
but if you're a cop and they did find 
her the night before at 2:00

2950
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:28,880
AM cause she went missing,
they found her and they're like,

2951
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:29,733
yeah,
she doesn't seem like she's gonna hurt 

2952
01:55:30,081 --> 01:55:32,210
herself or anyone else.
I don't know what you want us to do.

2953
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:33,560
Like we found her,
she's sick,

2954
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:34,403
she's good.
She's sleeping in her car until someone 

2955
01:55:35,541 --> 01:55:38,180
does something.
It's so hard to do anything about it.

2956
01:55:38,330 --> 01:55:39,770
Like they,
they um,

2957
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:43,380
they sent that one college kid,
they're sending him back.

2958
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,760
They found,
uh,

2959
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,170
his roommates.
I was,

2960
01:55:46,171 --> 01:55:47,004
we were talking about it yesterday.
His roommates were talking about and 

2961
01:55:48,581 --> 01:55:52,320
there were seriously worried about him.
He had a bleached his hair blonde,

2962
01:55:52,321 --> 01:55:55,500
started stockpiling ammunition,
bought an assault,

2963
01:55:55,501 --> 01:56:00,501
gone and then the cops came to visit 
them and after the cops left,

2964
01:56:00,571 --> 01:56:02,730
he went out and bought another ar and 
they're like,

2965
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:03,420
okay,
okay.

2966
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,530
That's it.
We got it.

2967
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:06,810
We gotta do something about this.
His roommates are freaking out.

2968
01:56:06,811 --> 01:56:08,220
Like people are freaking out being 
around the guy.

2969
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:09,203
And they sent him back on a technicality
because he wasn't going to school cause 

2970
01:56:12,721 --> 01:56:15,300
he stopped going to class.
It's what can you do a student visa?

2971
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:17,610
What they do?
They deported him.

2972
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:18,833
Oh really?
Yeah.

2973
01:56:18,870 --> 01:56:19,800
Oh perfect.
Yeah.

2974
01:56:19,801 --> 01:56:21,540
And they said,
we think we prevented the tragedy.

2975
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:22,590
I love that.
Yeah,

2976
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:24,510
that's exactly what they should do.
However,

2977
01:56:24,511 --> 01:56:25,344
would this lady,
let's say they stopped at two in the 

2978
01:56:26,491 --> 01:56:29,430
morning,
she's in a car and the Dad,

2979
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:32,130
the dad who you know,
she came from,

2980
01:56:32,131 --> 01:56:33,600
his seat goes,
listen,

2981
01:56:33,601 --> 01:56:34,434
she,
she,

2982
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:37,140
she's gonna do something bad.
We think we've seen signs,

2983
01:56:37,141 --> 01:56:40,320
we've known her since she was a day old.
You guys should do something about it.

2984
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:41,940
I don't think you should go out.

2985
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,440
We talked to her,
it seems all right.

2986
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:45,620
Maybe take her in for the night too 
though.

2987
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:46,903
Talk to the therapist.
But if she doesn't do anything and then 

2988
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:49,434
she does like you people are so 
unpredictable and get those eyebrows in 

2989
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:55,530
class or in jail for that video of her 
doing those squats and the jumps,

2990
01:56:55,531 --> 01:56:56,364
that workout video,
hairball of those eyes crazy that she's 

2991
01:56:59,251 --> 01:57:00,084
not there.
She was a different plant horror movie 

2992
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,460
and then,
but then,

2993
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:03,353
and then she's mad.
She's not getting fricking revenue from 

2994
01:57:05,311 --> 01:57:07,920
the Youtube and youtube like ah,
your videos suck lady.

2995
01:57:07,921 --> 01:57:09,610
We have nothing to do.
You're crazy.

2996
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:10,493
You didn't come up in the open mic 
circuit so you don't have a phd in 

2997
01:57:13,051 --> 01:57:15,880
Psychos.
Like he,

2998
01:57:16,290 --> 01:57:17,123
Tony Hinchcliffe,
all these dudes that have been in the 

2999
01:57:19,201 --> 01:57:24,201
grind like I remember a long time ago,
but they're fucking crazy people.

3000
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:26,513
There's a certain amount of open micros 
who think that they're really funny and 

3001
01:57:29,161 --> 01:57:29,994
they can't get work and they're angry 
about it and they're really fucking 

3002
01:57:31,831 --> 01:57:34,590
crazy and killed Tony when I've been in 
like two or three times.

3003
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:36,960
Perfect example.
Kill Tony is a primary example.

3004
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:39,210
You go there and you're like,
what in the fuck am I watching?

3005
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:40,253
And if someone tries to tell that person
like maybe you should connect more with 

3006
01:57:42,361 --> 01:57:43,760
the crop.
I connect the neck,

3007
01:57:43,820 --> 01:57:46,320
don't get mad.
This is my best bit.

3008
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:47,280
These pitcher,
good bits.

3009
01:57:47,281 --> 01:57:48,001
And the people were like,
what?

3010
01:57:48,001 --> 01:57:49,530
And the Tony told one guy like,
dude,

3011
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:50,400
you're bombing.
It was,

3012
01:57:50,401 --> 01:57:51,930
they were laughing.
They're laughing.

3013
01:57:51,931 --> 01:57:52,764
They laugh at you until he goes,
they're laughing cause you're fucking 

3014
01:57:54,811 --> 01:57:57,000
terrible and we're making faces behind.
He goes,

3015
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:57,983
that's laughing.
You don't know what the fuck you're 

3016
01:57:58,831 --> 01:57:59,820
talking about.
Tony was like,

3017
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:01,440
get off the stage.
He's like,

3018
01:58:01,441 --> 01:58:02,130
make me,
it's like,

3019
01:58:02,130 --> 01:58:04,350
oh my God,
boy.

3020
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:07,050
Yeah,
but you see,

3021
01:58:07,051 --> 01:58:07,884
you see that too on American idol.
There'll be some crazy dude like my mom 

3022
01:58:10,741 --> 01:58:12,360
thinks I'm the best,
you know the best things.

3023
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:13,193
Lionel Richie and they get up and it 
just completely bomb and then they talk 

3024
01:58:16,151 --> 01:58:19,500
shit to the experts.
You guys just don't know what you want.

3025
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,020
Well you have to look at people as a 
whole.

3026
01:58:22,050 --> 01:58:24,810
Right now if you look at people as a 
whole like physically,

3027
01:58:24,990 --> 01:58:25,823
right?
There's people that are built like you 

3028
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:28,590
and there's people that have built like 
vern troyer.

3029
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:30,630
That's just a fact.
It's just,

3030
01:58:30,770 --> 01:58:31,770
it's tough.
It's tough.

3031
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:32,670
It's tough.
It's does.

3032
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:36,300
It's also brilliant mind.
But my point is it's come on seven.

3033
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:38,400
It's a roll of the dice.
That's the same thing with everything.

3034
01:58:38,490 --> 01:58:40,170
It's the same thing with your mind as 
well.

3035
01:58:40,171 --> 01:58:43,090
It just is.
The mine varies widely.

3036
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:44,133
It varies racially.
It varies interracially it varies age 

3037
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:49,013
wise.
Like you can have a 50 year old black 

3038
01:58:51,731 --> 01:58:52,564
guy that's a smart guy you ever met in 
your life and you're going to have a 50 

3039
01:58:55,241 --> 01:58:58,720
year old white guy who is a fucking 
moron and you're going to have a 50 year

3040
01:58:58,721 --> 01:58:59,554
old woman who was out of her fucking 
mind and you're going to have a 50 year 

3041
01:59:02,531 --> 01:59:04,650
old woman who's a brilliant,
you know,

3042
01:59:04,990 --> 01:59:07,150
physicist and you're going to have 
everything you have,

3043
01:59:07,151 --> 01:59:07,984
every combination,
every combination of smart and stupid 

3044
01:59:10,601 --> 01:59:13,660
and,
and the tall and thin people vary.

3045
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:17,080
But they also vary with how crazy they 
are.

3046
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:17,943
But also that's a variable.
I think some people are crazy and then 

3047
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:22,090
they find a passion.
They run with it.

3048
01:59:22,091 --> 01:59:22,924
Maybe it's music comedy,
but then some of those crazy people who 

3049
01:59:26,711 --> 01:59:29,440
are different than the others in high 
school get made fun of,

3050
01:59:29,441 --> 01:59:32,380
get bullied and then that craziness 
turns into darkness.

3051
01:59:32,410 --> 01:59:35,980
And then they get ahold of Ak 47 then 
that's when you get the mass shootings.

3052
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:36,843
Oh yeah.
Cause there's experiences with those 

3053
01:59:38,141 --> 01:59:38,974
crazy people and maybe they turned the 
right direction and they do something 

3054
01:59:41,141 --> 01:59:42,250
great.
Write great songs,

3055
01:59:42,251 --> 01:59:43,084
come up with a great bid or come up with
a great tv show or that person gets 

3056
01:59:45,671 --> 01:59:47,920
bullied so bad the direction they go.
It's dark,

3057
01:59:47,921 --> 01:59:48,754
it's fun.
Hundred percent crazy mind does crazy 

3058
01:59:50,801 --> 01:59:51,461
stuff.
Yeah,

3059
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:52,294
so 100% physical abuse,
sexual abuse along with that 

3060
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:56,343
medications.
Sure medications could do it and every 

3061
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:00,940
single mass shooters on medications.

3062
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:03,940
But when you look at the combination of 
all the different factors,

3063
02:00:03,941 --> 02:00:04,774
it's like when you see that lady crying 
in her car at two o'clock in the 

3064
02:00:07,421 --> 02:00:08,201
morning,
you're a cop.

3065
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:09,520
You don't know what to do.
What do you,

3066
02:00:09,521 --> 02:00:11,080
what do you think you think she's going 
to like?

3067
02:00:11,081 --> 02:00:13,780
I knew when I looked at her that she was
going to go on to youtube and shoot that

3068
02:00:13,781 --> 02:00:14,860
place up.
Now there's no way.

3069
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:15,993
There's no way.
Nope.

3070
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:17,740
But how close cruise kids,
same thing.

3071
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,753
They came to see him two years before 
they decided he wasn't a threat and the 

3072
02:00:21,731 --> 02:00:24,550
people like the FBI's and competent know
24 months later.

3073
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:27,070
First of all,
he probably got fucking crazier,

3074
02:00:27,170 --> 02:00:28,870
crazy,
right in 24 months.

3075
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:31,630
His mom wound up dying like six months 
before that,

3076
02:00:31,631 --> 02:00:32,464
so that probably fucked him up too.
There's probably a whole host of 

3077
02:00:34,211 --> 02:00:35,170
factors,
but events.

3078
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:36,760
Right.
But he never did it before.

3079
02:00:36,761 --> 02:00:40,370
How the fuck can you predict these 
random shooters?

3080
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:44,080
I don't know what you're going to do.
The only thing with the Youtube thing is

3081
02:00:44,081 --> 02:00:45,430
if the dad goes,
listen,

3082
02:00:45,431 --> 02:00:49,240
my daughter's can do something crazy and
they find her near the Youtube,

3083
02:00:49,590 --> 02:00:51,550
uh,
northern California offices.

3084
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:53,300
We should at least take her in for the 
night.

3085
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:55,950
Talk to her,
and that's the leash.

3086
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:59,530
You're not going to lose anything.
Taxpayers be happy to pay for a night in

3087
02:00:59,531 --> 02:00:59,971
there.
You know,

3088
02:00:59,971 --> 02:01:00,820
it's all,
it's all good.

3089
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:01,841
Yeah.
I mean,

3090
02:01:01,841 --> 02:01:03,520
I don't know if that would do it though.
You know?

3091
02:01:03,521 --> 02:01:06,430
It's like that lady just seemed fucking 
nuts,

3092
02:01:06,431 --> 02:01:08,050
man.
Someone saw and said,

3093
02:01:08,051 --> 02:01:09,790
uh,
someone posted it and said,

3094
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:14,970
be ready to never sleep again.
That'd be didn't.

3095
02:01:14,971 --> 02:01:17,110
It's given me that much faith.
He,

3096
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:17,621
I went,
oh,

3097
02:01:17,621 --> 02:01:19,220
she's bat shit crazy.
Yeah.

3098
02:01:19,250 --> 02:01:24,120
Like super duper batshit crazy.
Youtube was out for because they,

3099
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:25,083
she was,
her views were lowering one video 

3100
02:01:26,951 --> 02:01:28,720
though.
She had 45 views.

3101
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:30,910
It's like,
come on man.

3102
02:01:30,911 --> 02:01:32,200
It's fucking bananas,
man.

3103
02:01:32,201 --> 02:01:34,090
I'm sure they pull her youtube page by 
now.

3104
02:01:34,091 --> 02:01:35,170
Jamie.
Yeah.

3105
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:37,930
And how if you're going to go out,
you right.

3106
02:01:37,931 --> 02:01:40,190
Most people do it to the head.
She shot herself

3107
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:45,190
in the chest.
That's dot savage.

3108
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:48,030
That's dark.
That's a dark way to go.

3109
02:01:49,130 --> 02:01:52,200
Other people have done that.
I guess people that knew they were brain

3110
02:01:52,201 --> 02:01:54,120
was going to get,
say I did that.

3111
02:01:54,121 --> 02:01:55,560
Shot himself in the chest because he 
goes,

3112
02:01:55,561 --> 02:01:57,390
I want you to stay in my brain because 
it's not good.

3113
02:01:58,490 --> 02:02:00,100
Fuck.
Yeah.

3114
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:02,060
I can't feel good.
No,

3115
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:03,450
I feel like the brain people.
Yeah.

3116
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:04,700
We went dark.
We can we talk.

3117
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:05,534
We got to bring it back.
We've gotten dark this pocket to bring 

3118
02:02:06,591 --> 02:02:08,060
it back.
Let's bring it home.

3119
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:09,440
Let's bring him home in a positive 
thing.

3120
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:12,410
But you don't stop roles.
That's a fight.

3121
02:02:12,411 --> 02:02:14,000
No,
it's talking about you on a rose.

3122
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,010
Hey,
Jamie.

3123
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:17,480
Tele homeboys got to watch the Monitor.
All right.

3124
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:19,130
Yeah.
Um,

3125
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:19,993
yeah.
Talk rose talking about it's being 

3126
02:02:21,051 --> 02:02:22,070
overshadowed.
Yeah,

3127
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:23,900
it has been overshadowed.
It's a crazy one,

3128
02:02:23,901 --> 02:02:24,734
right?
It's because nobody expected it to go 

3129
02:02:26,121 --> 02:02:30,220
down the way it did in the first one,
you know,

3130
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:32,970
not at all.
And the rematch you on is on weight.

3131
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:36,110
She's way lighter.
She was one 22 last week,

3132
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:38,420
you know,
so she's just a few pounds away.

3133
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:42,320
Here's my problem with this fight.
And I hit,

3134
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:43,553
I might,
I might stop making pigs that said on a 

3135
02:02:44,751 --> 02:02:46,880
podcast yesterday.
It doesn't make me feel good when I pick

3136
02:02:46,881 --> 02:02:48,410
against people.
It doesn't make me feel good.

3137
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:49,603
I feel like I have to do it.
A lot of people don't do pigs and they 

3138
02:02:51,921 --> 02:02:53,870
come to me for pigs.
What do you think's gonna Happen?

3139
02:02:55,950 --> 02:02:57,840
Uh,
for a long time I thought,

3140
02:02:57,870 --> 02:02:59,010
oof.
Rose Rose,

3141
02:02:59,011 --> 02:03:01,260
she's a monster.
And I know rose right from Denver.

3142
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:03,930
She landed that left Hook and trevor 
teaches that.

3143
02:03:03,931 --> 02:03:06,330
And Pat Barry teaches that and that's 
exactly what to do.

3144
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:08,790
Amazing fight.
I bet they fight,

3145
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:09,930
you know,
three or four times.

3146
02:03:10,230 --> 02:03:11,063
But if they do a rematch,
which they should give you on the 

3147
02:03:12,851 --> 02:03:13,684
immediate rematch,
rose me a little bit of trouble cause 

3148
02:03:15,391 --> 02:03:18,600
you ana is a fucking machine.
Here's the caveat to that.

3149
02:03:18,810 --> 02:03:20,820
When I see you on a do interviews and 
she goes,

3150
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:23,070
it was my nutritionist.
It was this person,

3151
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:24,450
it was this,
it was this.

3152
02:03:24,630 --> 02:03:27,420
She never once has she owned it and 
taking credibility.

3153
02:03:27,421 --> 02:03:28,254
I will.
That's not the way a world champion 

3154
02:03:29,541 --> 02:03:31,480
speaks.
That's not the way it all.

3155
02:03:31,481 --> 02:03:33,930
Someone talks and when I see a bunch of 
excuse,

3156
02:03:33,931 --> 02:03:35,040
they go,
Oh shit,

3157
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:37,350
you have a hole in your boat and your 
cut.

3158
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:40,590
You're masking it with duct tape and 
you're trying to get back to this point.

3159
02:03:41,070 --> 02:03:42,560
You're just math.
You're not solving that.

3160
02:03:42,561 --> 02:03:46,440
Actually patching that up and so you're 
susceptible again and now you,

3161
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:49,800
you're talking like that never happened.
It was a fluke.

3162
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:50,833
Yeah.
Rose is pretty fucking good and if you 

3163
02:03:51,931 --> 02:03:52,764
don't respect her again,
you think it's your nutritionist is why 

3164
02:03:54,631 --> 02:03:56,490
he left that fight.
You're probably gonna lose again.

3165
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:58,690
You might be right.
He might be right.

3166
02:03:58,691 --> 02:03:59,524
It's only thing that bothers me.
I think you on is one of the greatest 

3167
02:04:00,751 --> 02:04:02,250
games of all time with the greatest 
fighters,

3168
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:03,960
but it's just when I see them like,
oh,

3169
02:04:03,961 --> 02:04:04,830
you're,
you're just going,

3170
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:06,450
you're going about the wrong way.
And she goes,

3171
02:04:06,630 --> 02:04:08,430
you know,
I even talked to Rhonda and you know,

3172
02:04:08,431 --> 02:04:09,810
she said she had to wait,
come like,

3173
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:13,170
no one's dealt with loss is worse than 
Rhonda.

3174
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:16,380
You don't want to preface that.
You don't want to reference that at all.

3175
02:04:16,490 --> 02:04:18,140
Right.
I don't want to see that out of you,

3176
02:04:18,141 --> 02:04:20,280
Ana.
She has so much more work to do.

3177
02:04:20,820 --> 02:04:21,660
Yeah.
Well,

3178
02:04:21,720 --> 02:04:22,553
it's also,
you want to had a long career in Moy 

3179
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:26,370
Tai,
a long career.

3180
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,880
You know,
like a lot of fights.

3181
02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:28,680
Yeah.
Tons.

3182
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:30,930
Lot of kickboxing,
sparring,

3183
02:04:30,931 --> 02:04:34,530
a lot of MMA sparring.
Sometimes your changes goes,

3184
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:36,091
I mean,
this is a,

3185
02:04:36,091 --> 02:04:38,130
this is a real,
sometimes you change,

3186
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,610
just go.
You didn't get the Chin thing too.

3187
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:41,250
I don't know.
I don't know.

3188
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:43,080
I see.
I think it's too early to call for that,

3189
02:04:43,081 --> 02:04:45,690
especially at that weight class.
I think for her it was more,

3190
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:46,583
she just wasn't being respectful of rose
or thought she was gonna walk through 

3191
02:04:49,201 --> 02:04:52,230
and all the shit talking and she was 
doing and rose is a different animal.

3192
02:04:52,231 --> 02:04:54,210
She,
she reminds me of Brian or take a little

3193
02:04:54,211 --> 02:04:55,044
bit where she's very dangerous on,
on conventional and the certain spots 

3194
02:04:58,951 --> 02:04:59,784
you can't train for.
So she's that type of animal with 

3195
02:05:01,890 --> 02:05:04,350
similar Brian Ortega.
But with Yolanda,

3196
02:05:04,750 --> 02:05:08,070
if a gun to my head,
I'd say you ana winds by decision.

3197
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:11,610
But again,
I hate bacon.

3198
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:13,290
Pigs makes me feel badly.
Yeah,

3199
02:05:13,291 --> 02:05:17,520
making picks is tough man because you 
know you're going to piss people off and

3200
02:05:17,521 --> 02:05:19,160
you know,
oh we're fucking rooting against.

3201
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:20,360
But that's,
no,

3202
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:24,000
you have to look at the analysis of it 
before the fight.

3203
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:26,250
I thought rose was in trouble.
I'm like,

3204
02:05:26,280 --> 02:05:27,113
you want is very hard to take down.
Her Stanhope is world class and I think 

3205
02:05:29,881 --> 02:05:30,714
she's,
she could very well pick rows apart and 

3206
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:33,420
you know,
and,

3207
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:34,253
and crack or she's coming in.
But when she hit her with that left and 

3208
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:38,154
she hit her before that and hurt her,
but when she hit her with that left 

3209
02:05:40,801 --> 02:05:41,341
hook,
I was like,

3210
02:05:41,341 --> 02:05:42,900
Gee,
explosive too.

3211
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:48,200
She looks good man.
And rose like a on the embedded rose was

3212
02:05:48,451 --> 02:05:53,451
a pat barry takes a giant box of tennis 
balls and throws tennis balls at her and

3213
02:05:53,761 --> 02:05:55,770
she's popping tennis balls in the air 
and she,

3214
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:59,300
she looks fucking solid and rose to her 
ceilings.

3215
02:05:59,310 --> 02:06:00,143
We're just seeing it.
She is so much room for growth to show 

3216
02:06:01,741 --> 02:06:06,240
young and pat and she trev around her 
and now forever people are like,

3217
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:07,590
you're going to be world champion.

3218
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:10,560
And when everyone tells,
coaches tell fives all the time,

3219
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:11,820
but what actually happens?
You Go,

3220
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:14,580
Oh shit,
they're not bullshitting.

3221
02:06:14,610 --> 02:06:15,443
They're not just saying this.
And I think it when she actually 

3222
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:18,113
believes it.
Now you're dealing with different thug 

3223
02:06:19,351 --> 02:06:21,150
rose.
You're dealing with different Yolanda,

3224
02:06:21,230 --> 02:06:22,063
you,
Ana doesn't think she's the greatest 

3225
02:06:23,071 --> 02:06:26,310
gift to the MMA world.
So that con combination,

3226
02:06:26,311 --> 02:06:28,860
it's such a fascinating and fight and no
one's talking about it.

3227
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:29,783
Yeah,
well everyone was so caught up in this 

3228
02:06:31,170 --> 02:06:32,003
cancellation and the Ferguson could be 
fight was so huge for the hardcores for 

3229
02:06:36,181 --> 02:06:37,014
sure,
but it's also one of those things where 

3230
02:06:38,730 --> 02:06:39,563
with rose coming into this fight now and
you want to make any excuses for the 

3231
02:06:42,721 --> 02:06:44,220
last fight,
you know,

3232
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:47,800
I'm really interested to see what 
happens when they square off.

3233
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:50,340
I can't wait for that fight.
Each other is yawn again and do the same

3234
02:06:50,341 --> 02:06:53,220
talk and again and roads can reciting 
the Bible.

3235
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:54,480
I don't think she can.
I don't think.

3236
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:57,240
I don't think you'll want to can do the 
same talk and you don't.

3237
02:06:57,241 --> 02:06:58,770
You don't think she goes,
this was a fluke.

3238
02:06:58,771 --> 02:07:00,260
I'm doing the exact same thing.
No.

3239
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:01,133
I think rose going to stare right 
through her fucking soul again and be 

3240
02:07:03,031 --> 02:07:03,840
like,
I'm the champion.

3241
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:04,673
When you talk a gang of shit at someone 
and they just stare right through you 

3242
02:07:07,891 --> 02:07:09,660
and then they merch you in the first 
round.

3243
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:13,230
It's very tough to talk all that shit 
the second time.

3244
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:15,920
It's going to be interesting.
I think that's a sign if you want.

3245
02:07:15,930 --> 02:07:16,763
It isn't respecting rose again.
If she gets up there and start talking 

3246
02:07:19,351 --> 02:07:21,500
that shit.
I would put a ton of money on rose.

3247
02:07:21,910 --> 02:07:23,700
Yeah.
If I see her doing the same things,

3248
02:07:23,701 --> 02:07:24,271
I'm like,
Oh shit.

3249
02:07:24,271 --> 02:07:25,820
You learn nothing.
Go there.

3250
02:07:25,830 --> 02:07:26,760
Nothing.
Well,

3251
02:07:26,761 --> 02:07:29,070
it's whether or not rose can clipper 
again.

3252
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:30,053
If rose charges in and clips or again,
it's also the thing about a striker 

3253
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:36,070
always worried being taken

3254
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:40,480
down is more likely to get hit with a 
shot like Kevin randomly when he knocked

3255
02:07:40,481 --> 02:07:41,314
out Mirko Cro cop.
Same thing like Kevin was the threat as 

3256
02:07:45,011 --> 02:07:45,844
a wrestler.
Leaps in with a left hook and catches 

3257
02:07:47,861 --> 02:07:49,510
him right on the chin.
Knocked him the fuck out.

3258
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:52,960
I think there's a,
there's a real correlation there.

3259
02:07:52,990 --> 02:07:53,823
I wouldn't be surprised if you on a sole
focus on improving her stand up and you 

3260
02:07:57,181 --> 02:07:57,810
know,
it's like God,

3261
02:07:57,810 --> 02:07:59,770
I caught this time.
Just get overwhelmed or to stand up.

3262
02:07:59,771 --> 02:08:00,604
She gets submitted.
She overlooked the submission game of 

3263
02:08:02,231 --> 02:08:04,210
rose,
which is actually rose's best weapon.

3264
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:05,610
That's what I was thinking.
I was thinking bro,

3265
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:08,010
we might see rose throw a flying arm.
Correct.

3266
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:11,050
We might see rose wild shit doesn't care
about being on her back.

3267
02:08:11,170 --> 02:08:13,630
Oh No.
And she's fast.

3268
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:15,730
She,
she goes for shit.

3269
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:18,640
She like,
she's a wild explosive person,

3270
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:19,390
you know?

3271
02:08:19,390 --> 02:08:21,760
And she's a really interesting thinker 
too.

3272
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:23,650
You know.
She had a tough life man.

3273
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:24,503
Yup.
Tough life growing up and develop this 

3274
02:08:26,321 --> 02:08:27,154
very strong mind because controlled 
chaos is what I taught and she's 

3275
02:08:30,101 --> 02:08:31,160
brilliant at.
Yeah.

3276
02:08:31,470 --> 02:08:33,430
I think what else about fascinating 
about this?

3277
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:34,870
Not that fight,
definitely.

3278
02:08:34,910 --> 02:08:35,743
I'm more,
almost more excited for that fight to 

3279
02:08:36,691 --> 02:08:39,940
anything now.
But what's fascinating to me is everyone

3280
02:08:39,941 --> 02:08:41,020
talks about conor Mcgregor,
right?

3281
02:08:41,021 --> 02:08:44,410
Especially when you're talking about one
55 and with connor and Max Holloway.

3282
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:47,450
Connor's never looked back.
Went Back,

3283
02:08:47,451 --> 02:08:48,284
fight that guy back there.
Even though I'm better than the thing 

3284
02:08:49,271 --> 02:08:53,050
that gets caught her out of bed I think 
is the challenge and making history.

3285
02:08:53,170 --> 02:08:56,140
And I think if Khabib or Max where to 
win,

3286
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:58,920
that would be a new challenge and he'd 
be an underdog against,

3287
02:08:58,930 --> 02:09:00,100
could be.
Even with Max Holloway,

3288
02:09:00,101 --> 02:09:00,934
the FT,
you have a history at 55 especially if 

3289
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:03,760
could be where to win.

3290
02:09:03,790 --> 02:09:06,100
I think we see connotate that fight now 
cause he goes,

3291
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:07,420
that's about frown.
Great.

3292
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:10,090
Well I'm the best at moving backwards 
hitting dudes.

3293
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:12,340
I bet you I can beat that guy.
And we see him.

3294
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:15,730
I think we see him take that fight and 
I've never said that before.

3295
02:09:15,731 --> 02:09:16,450
I've,
I've always,

3296
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:18,030
I know Dana said,
oh they're going to fight and rush.

3297
02:09:18,031 --> 02:09:18,500
I'm like,
God,

3298
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:19,333
why would counter fighting him?
And then I think about like when you 

3299
02:09:20,651 --> 02:09:23,350
think of all the challenges and college 
career and what gets them going,

3300
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:25,360
it's not people behind him.
It's always when people go,

3301
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:27,190
that guy's the best of you is cool.
Give me that guy.

3302
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:28,420
Very similar.
Max Holloway.

3303
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:30,730
Mm.
Yeah.

3304
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:34,000
If Max wins for sure they have a 
rematch.

3305
02:09:34,030 --> 02:09:39,030
100% a hundred percent the thing about 
Khabib is you always got a wonder who is

3306
02:09:39,821 --> 02:09:41,950
avoiding him.
There's a difference there.

3307
02:09:42,450 --> 02:09:43,283
It did see the differences.
Max is one of the best fighters on the 

3308
02:09:46,481 --> 02:09:47,680
planet.
No doubt.

3309
02:09:47,710 --> 02:09:50,020
He's one of my top,
one of my top guys.

3310
02:09:50,021 --> 02:09:52,750
Maybe you were just ever top 
featherweight of all time,

3311
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:56,920
but people aren't avoiding him now.
It's like I said,

3312
02:09:56,921 --> 02:09:57,970
can be,
it's a different animal.

3313
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:00,160
They are fine.
Guy Referenced this,

3314
02:10:00,161 --> 02:10:00,994
I said,
I said if you gave me a choice to make 

3315
02:10:02,471 --> 02:10:06,270
the walk against Francis or could be,
I'm cherry picking Francis Cause there's

3316
02:10:06,271 --> 02:10:08,860
a quick death and not the head in the 
third row,

3317
02:10:08,950 --> 02:10:10,420
but it's quick.
It could be,

3318
02:10:10,421 --> 02:10:11,254
but it's like an isis videos can be long
drawn out and to be a fucking nightmare 

3319
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:15,880
that you're not going to forget.
Yeah,

3320
02:10:15,881 --> 02:10:18,850
he's going to beat your body into a 
pulp,

3321
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:21,730
but it the worst is he breaks you where 
it's like,

3322
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:22,713
oh you are good at this.
And people thought you were mentally 

3323
02:10:24,641 --> 02:10:25,474
strong.
Watch this now your entire family and 

3324
02:10:27,401 --> 02:10:28,234
friends going to see how much of a pussy
you are as they bashed your brains in 

3325
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:33,070
round after round,
after round,

3326
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,100
after round.
You see

3327
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:34,933
him break guys too though.
You see like there's something happens 

3328
02:10:37,071 --> 02:10:37,904
to them when they just,
they give in to the inevitability of 

3329
02:10:40,641 --> 02:10:42,380
getting ragdoll.
He's just better.

3330
02:10:42,530 --> 02:10:43,363
Yeah.
Oh the only person that's going to beat 

3331
02:10:44,241 --> 02:10:45,080
him.
It's not a person.

3332
02:10:45,081 --> 02:10:47,000
It's a fucking grizzly bear.
You know?

3333
02:10:47,001 --> 02:10:48,170
It's like,
fuck this man,

3334
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:49,213
and you see you can't see it in their 
eyes where it just changes were just 

3335
02:10:51,771 --> 02:10:52,670
like,
nope.

3336
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:53,533
Not Happening.
How many rounds for four more rounds of 

3337
02:10:55,881 --> 02:10:57,290
this?
This is terrible.

3338
02:10:57,320 --> 02:10:58,153
If he wins and he beats Holloway,
I guarantee you he's calling out 

3339
02:11:01,281 --> 02:11:04,220
mcgregor.
He wants the GSP fight.

3340
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:08,000
Khabib wants GSP.
Holy Shit.

3341
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:09,920
That's what I hear.
Whoa.

3342
02:11:10,730 --> 02:11:13,400
That's the second one.
70 whoa.

3343
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:15,290
What a great fight,
right?

3344
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:17,510
It's a perfect time to do it right now.
Right?

3345
02:11:17,511 --> 02:11:18,344
GSP wins by rear naked,
choke against bisping at one 85 says he 

3346
02:11:21,921 --> 02:11:22,580
doesn't want to fight it.

3347
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:24,200
A five again here,
take your belt,

3348
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:26,550
suck it cs,
GSP.

3349
02:11:26,630 --> 02:11:29,380
Just go suck it.
They can take your time.

3350
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:30,273
Know I told you I'd fight their,
sought to whatever you want to do with 

3351
02:11:31,881 --> 02:11:33,560
that belt.
I'm going to just get to do whatever the

3352
02:11:33,561 --> 02:11:35,240
fuck I want.
I made a couple million bucks row.

3353
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:37,970
I'm gonna kick back for Awhile and now 
you get party.

3354
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:40,130
Oh,
you fancy yourself a grappler.

3355
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:42,860
Just me too.
Let's party.

3356
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:45,590
That's a really interesting,
if I can make a super fight.

3357
02:11:45,591 --> 02:11:47,270
If I was like Dana,
scrooge mcduck,

3358
02:11:47,271 --> 02:11:49,220
there's sin on top.
All these gold coins.

3359
02:11:49,550 --> 02:11:50,840
I call it Ben African.
I'm like,

3360
02:11:50,990 --> 02:11:51,823
Yo,
any interest in fighting Khabib at one 

3361
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:55,730
70 fuck yes.
Fuck.

3362
02:11:55,731 --> 02:11:57,160
What's up bro?
That's what I'm talking about.

3363
02:11:57,161 --> 02:11:58,940
Yes.
Call your boy.

3364
02:11:59,110 --> 02:12:01,250
My boy.
I'm going to tell you blocked calls.

3365
02:12:01,251 --> 02:12:02,960
We call your boy.
You block your call.

3366
02:12:03,410 --> 02:12:06,080
I don't call him,
but I'm sure you collected into him this

3367
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:06,080
weekend.

3368
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:08,330
I want to talk to him this weekend.
That would be the fight,

3369
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:11,390
but you know the thing would have been 
asked her and wins.

3370
02:12:11,391 --> 02:12:13,770
He starts talking Shit Calling Dana.
Perfect.

3371
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:15,410
Fuck you.
Perfect egg head.

3372
02:12:15,411 --> 02:12:17,010
It works.
It sells papers.

3373
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:19,190
It's the bottom line.
Yeah,

3374
02:12:19,191 --> 02:12:21,810
but then you ruin Khabib.
If ben asking,

3375
02:12:21,811 --> 02:12:22,644
it could be,
I think you give Ben ass grin a guy 

3376
02:12:24,890 --> 02:12:26,540
who's a good fighter.
GSP.

3377
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:28,123
Well you haven't seen it.
Most people don't know who ben Askern 

3378
02:12:30,391 --> 02:12:32,900
is.
The problem is he fought in bellator for

3379
02:12:32,901 --> 02:12:36,500
so long and then even when bell tours 
gotten bigger on Spike TV,

3380
02:12:36,740 --> 02:12:38,840
he was off in one FC,
which you have.

3381
02:12:38,841 --> 02:12:41,530
No ones are huge.
Ben Asks from fans now,

3382
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:45,260
but we are hardcore,
like the casual fan has no idea.

3383
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:48,590
Like who is this guy with the curly hair
they're sending to his death,

3384
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:52,910
but we can sell it because he speaks 
well.

3385
02:12:52,910 --> 02:12:55,930
He's a beast on the mind and then you 
pin it,

3386
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:57,650
gets hit an Olympian.
He's never,

3387
02:12:57,670 --> 02:13:01,550
he was undefeated.
Never been hit against Khabib.

3388
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:03,200
Yeah.
And we call it the Cold War,

3389
02:13:03,201 --> 02:13:05,750
I think in the UFC,
particularly me.

3390
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:06,763
Well,
I'm a big Ben,

3391
02:13:06,810 --> 02:13:10,280
her and Dick Rider and Jimmy Smith,
who's also a big Ben Aspirin Dick,

3392
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:11,133
right?
Think we're all Dick,

3393
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:14,090
right?
We could sell the shit out of it.

3394
02:13:14,091 --> 02:13:17,750
I could hype the shit out to be 100% 
honest in the process.

3395
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:21,230
I think he's something special,
I think is grappling is very unusual.

3396
02:13:21,231 --> 02:13:22,064
Very difficult to prepare for.
And if you're going to deal with Khabib 

3397
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:27,980
against a guy who can neutralize his 
stuff,

3398
02:13:27,981 --> 02:13:30,530
and then we see like,
what did we see Khabib on his back?

3399
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:32,340
Ben Ass Grin fucking

3400
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:34,910
would a knee across the belly punching 
Khabib in the face.

3401
02:13:34,911 --> 02:13:35,860
And we're like,
no.

3402
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:37,660
What about Ben asking on this?
Right?

3403
02:13:37,670 --> 02:13:39,460
We can be just doing the ground and 
pound.

3404
02:13:39,461 --> 02:13:40,294
Right.
There's these tray crazy scrambles and 

3405
02:13:43,110 --> 02:13:46,560
the grappling communities can be like,
it would be amazed is terrible.

3406
02:13:46,561 --> 02:13:48,780
Striking good looks on that to Uncle 
Dana.

3407
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:50,380
Uncle [inaudible] for,
for,

3408
02:13:50,381 --> 02:13:50,611
for,
for,

3409
02:13:50,611 --> 02:13:53,580
for fuck you.
He's going to slam that phone down.

3410
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:56,310
Fuck you.
He would have to have,

3411
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:56,851
he's like,
sir,

3412
02:13:56,851 --> 02:13:59,400
I'm trying to finalize cm punk floyd 
here.

3413
02:13:59,690 --> 02:14:02,790
You're talking about Penn Aspirin could 
be how tear you.

3414
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:03,713
He would have to have a good 
relationship with ben asked me and they 

3415
02:14:05,461 --> 02:14:06,380
would have no,
he does not ease.

3416
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:07,370
I disagree.
No,

3417
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:08,670
he doesn't know.
He can go.

3418
02:14:09,140 --> 02:14:11,220
All right.
I'm gonna make money off this kid I have

3419
02:14:11,221 --> 02:14:13,860
for $50 million.
They make money off this kid.

3420
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:14,850
Let me do this.

3421
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:18,240
Don't you think you'd have to put Ben,
ask her in in a UFC fight though against

3422
02:14:18,241 --> 02:14:20,910
some money to show everybody what he's 
capable of.

3423
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:22,620
Nope.
He has all those belts.

3424
02:14:22,621 --> 02:14:25,710
Undefeated Olympian.
We just promo the shit.

3425
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:27,960
He's on embedded.
He's on Uca night.

3426
02:14:28,050 --> 02:14:31,440
He's on below the bellies on jre.
We go on this campaign.

3427
02:14:31,441 --> 02:14:33,630
He's dressed in oak flag.
He's like,

3428
02:14:33,631 --> 02:14:37,980
watch me beat the shit out the pound for
pound grain Russian.

3429
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:39,610
Who else doesn't like Russia?
Raul?

3430
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:42,540
Yeah,
Maca.

3431
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:44,610
Maca.
Great.

3432
02:14:44,670 --> 02:14:45,503
Ooh,
I like it.

3433
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:46,840
It's never happening.
Right?

3434
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,900
That's never happening.
Not what you sold me.

3435
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:51,180
Thank [inaudible].
Just get to listen to this video.

3436
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:53,010
Dana.
Uncle d,

3437
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:55,770
if you just have him fight someone who's
really good,

3438
02:14:56,160 --> 02:15:01,160
like Neil Magni or Carlos condit,
have him as introduction up like fucking

3439
02:15:02,251 --> 02:15:04,590
Kobiashi talk.
Watch that introduction fight.

3440
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:06,480
And who knows?
Nope,

3441
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,770
this is a one shot.

3442
02:15:08,070 --> 02:15:10,710
Hell Mary.
We're selling the fuck out of it.

3443
02:15:12,030 --> 02:15:12,863
I'm interested because then what happens
to be fighting to a mega cros Kinda and 

3444
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:17,770
just like rape some humps on for three 
rounds people.

3445
02:15:17,771 --> 02:15:19,110
If that's sucked,
man.

3446
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:20,093
I know,
but he probably won't be able to do 

3447
02:15:20,461 --> 02:15:21,111
that.
Could beep.

3448
02:15:21,111 --> 02:15:24,150
So you've gotta watch that one.
We missed the boat style is so much more

3449
02:15:24,151 --> 02:15:27,120
suited to one fc because they allow 
those knees to the head on the ground.

3450
02:15:27,121 --> 02:15:29,910
True soccer kicks in,
but they still are soccer kicks in.

3451
02:15:29,911 --> 02:15:32,330
When IFC it,
did they stop it after Brandon Vera?

3452
02:15:32,331 --> 02:15:34,120
Like almost an excuse to dude.
I thought maybe.

3453
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:36,420
I think they still do it.
How about the Roger worked at one.

3454
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:37,283
Oh my God,
your worth to got head kicked by the 

3455
02:15:38,591 --> 02:15:39,424
time about Roger Work does fight and Ben
Henderson this weekend that's flying 

3456
02:15:42,031 --> 02:15:43,440
under the radar.
It is fine.

3457
02:15:43,441 --> 02:15:43,950
Under the word.

3458
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:45,750
Well it's like,
you know,

3459
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:47,273
worked out was the first ever MMA 
fighter on the cover of sports 

3460
02:15:50,071 --> 02:15:51,570
illustrated.
People forget that.

3461
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:52,823
People forgot that back in the day.
Was this like 2000 twoish threeish he 

3462
02:15:56,480 --> 02:15:58,820
was coming up right before that.
I forget who he beat then.

3463
02:15:58,821 --> 02:16:00,540
He was supposed to fight Kenny Florian.
If you remember,

3464
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:02,190
he was like the front cover.
What year was that?

3465
02:16:02,910 --> 02:16:07,910
2004 two nine five no in that too.
Then six dot six six was to say,

3466
02:16:12,390 --> 02:16:13,590
Oh yeah,
here's the head kick.

3467
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:15,930
So the dude uh,
is,

3468
02:16:16,030 --> 02:16:16,863
is already beaten him.
He rag some horses down and look at 

3469
02:16:19,951 --> 02:16:21,660
this.
This is horrible.

3470
02:16:21,780 --> 02:16:22,680
Oh,
I mean,

3471
02:16:22,681 --> 02:16:25,020
that was one of the worst head kicks 
you'll ever see.

3472
02:16:25,850 --> 02:16:26,850
That was horrible.
Let's see.

3473
02:16:26,851 --> 02:16:28,770
I don't want to see that.
I don't want that in my,

3474
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:30,010
that's horrible.

3475
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,510
That one's horrible.
Like that guy was,

3476
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:34,150
he was already hurt and out of it before
that.

3477
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:35,553
Um,
well the average casual adult soccer 

3478
02:16:38,501 --> 02:16:42,460
player can kick a ball with a thousand 
foot pound force.

3479
02:16:42,970 --> 02:16:45,700
The average professional soccer player 
can kick it about 1000,

3480
02:16:45,701 --> 02:16:48,460
200 foot pound force.
My educated guesses,

3481
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:51,550
elite highly trained martial arts 
perform very similar to the professional

3482
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:52,690
segment.
I'll tell you what,

3483
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:53,863
you put somebody down in their hands and
knees and I kick him in the head like 

3484
02:16:55,541 --> 02:16:57,520
that can be a lot more than that.
They're fucked.

3485
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:59,710
He might broken,
killed a guy.

3486
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:00,740
You know,
you don't want to see them.

3487
02:17:00,741 --> 02:17:02,380
You could,
you could kill somebody doing that.

3488
02:17:02,381 --> 02:17:05,290
You literally could snap their neck is 
no doubt about it.

3489
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:06,820
When was that sports illustrated cover 
though,

3490
02:17:06,821 --> 02:17:07,654
Jamie?

3491
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:08,530
Yeah.

3492
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:11,560
Cause you met Roger worked at sports 
illustrated illustrated.

3493
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,180
I want to and it says,
is Emma,

3494
02:17:13,181 --> 02:17:17,140
is the UFC the next emerging sport or is
it just a fad or something like that?

3495
02:17:17,141 --> 02:17:19,510
I want to say 2006.
Two.

3496
02:17:19,511 --> 02:17:21,670
I'm thinking of six.
I think it's post.

3497
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:24,580
Um,
it's post tough.

3498
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:26,440
Yeah.
It's post Stephan Bonner,

3499
02:17:26,441 --> 02:17:28,660
forrest griffin.
And that was 2005,

3500
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:31,240
maybe seven,
maybe seven.

3501
02:17:32,890 --> 02:17:33,160
Okay.

3502
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:35,020
Um,
remember Roger worked,

3503
02:17:35,150 --> 02:17:35,983
he got all that notoriety and then he 
tried big Dick in the UFC when now I 

3504
02:17:40,031 --> 02:17:40,900
want this,
this and this though.

3505
02:17:40,901 --> 02:17:41,734
It cool.
We're going to sit ya and then give you 

3506
02:17:43,541 --> 02:17:45,610
the worst matchup possible.
Here's gray maynard.

3507
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:48,420
Yeah.
May 28th,

3508
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:49,170
2006.
Oh,

3509
02:17:49,170 --> 02:17:52,750
there it goes.
Ah,

3510
02:17:53,020 --> 02:17:55,870
mother.
So we're in the neighborhood.

3511
02:17:55,930 --> 02:17:58,090
They were closed.
So this was a,

3512
02:17:58,180 --> 02:18:00,700
you know Roger where it,
it was like the poster board,

3513
02:18:00,730 --> 02:18:03,970
Handsome Hispanic,
Latino,

3514
02:18:04,330 --> 02:18:05,163
bad motherfucker.
I remember watching her work to beat 

3515
02:18:06,671 --> 02:18:08,390
that dude up.
That punched a chicken.

3516
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:10,720
The face like a guy named sterile in 
Austin,

3517
02:18:10,721 --> 02:18:12,160
Texas.
He's a big football player.

3518
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:13,063
They black sucker,
punched a girl in the face in front of 

3519
02:18:15,881 --> 02:18:16,714
everybody,
dropped her and then Roger where to 

3520
02:18:18,611 --> 02:18:21,160
takes his shirt off and fuck's this dude
up.

3521
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:22,143
There's a scramble.
You see the dude squaring off Roger's 

3522
02:18:23,681 --> 02:18:26,410
way more than him.
Cut to a few seconds later.

3523
02:18:26,411 --> 02:18:28,570
See Roger [inaudible] soccer kicking 
him.

3524
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:30,453
Here it is.

3525
02:18:30,750 --> 02:18:31,170
Okay.

3526
02:18:31,170 --> 02:18:35,430
So Roger is standing back here and this 
guy steps into this girl,

3527
02:18:36,510 --> 02:18:39,390
tmz son.
Did you show the first beginning of it?

3528
02:18:40,710 --> 02:18:41,940
Yeah,
but at the beginning of his,

3529
02:18:41,941 --> 02:18:44,130
when he steps in and punches the girl in
the face.

3530
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:45,813
All right,
the we'll drop the girl go to right to 

3531
02:18:47,071 --> 02:18:47,904
the beginning.
Knocked the girl out right to the 

3532
02:18:48,691 --> 02:18:52,050
beginning.
It doesn't play the whole thing.

3533
02:18:52,110 --> 02:18:54,140
So the guy,
the the guy in the orange shirt,

3534
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:56,820
big ass dude drops a girl.
Female girl face.

3535
02:18:56,821 --> 02:18:58,440
They look were to look at them.

3536
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:00,353
Yeah.

3537
02:19:03,150 --> 02:19:08,150
Good luck colon back talking shit.
He's saying that's a girl man.

3538
02:19:08,281 --> 02:19:10,440
He's so much smaller.
This guy is like fuck you.

3539
02:19:10,441 --> 02:19:11,274
I'll fuck you up to work.
To always had good fashion to just want 

3540
02:19:14,011 --> 02:19:15,990
the other than up there.
There's another video.

3541
02:19:16,010 --> 02:19:19,080
This we hear more volume when I'm 
talking to each other.

3542
02:19:20,310 --> 02:19:21,630
This might be the only one I've ever 
seen.

3543
02:19:21,690 --> 02:19:23,220
Oh there it goes.
Worth to take your shirt off.

3544
02:19:23,221 --> 02:19:27,470
And he's pissed guy who had girl roger 
work done took their off.

3545
02:19:27,510 --> 02:19:30,140
Okay.
We got some titties with a sub.

3546
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:32,870
Roger chases him down.
Well,

3547
02:19:32,871 --> 02:19:34,970
Roger was fast as fuck to that.
Oh yeah.

3548
02:19:34,971 --> 02:19:35,804
No idea what he's doing before he knew 
animal before he knew what that dude's 

3549
02:19:38,241 --> 02:19:39,074
getting punched in the face and at the 
end you see Roger's got to do in the 

3550
02:19:41,661 --> 02:19:43,220
ground sock kicking them.
No,

3551
02:19:43,221 --> 02:19:44,054
it's like,
it's like jumping into the water and 

3552
02:19:45,471 --> 02:19:47,300
there's a crocodile in there.
Before you know it,

3553
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:51,290
we'll get roger.
Boom.

3554
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,910
He's out cold.
You're not.

3555
02:19:52,911 --> 02:19:54,100
And that's justice,
isn't it?

3556
02:19:54,380 --> 02:19:57,740
It needs to be JC.
He's making a Mexican Batman there.

3557
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:59,570
If he kept kicking him,
it had been justice.

3558
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:01,830
I mean it was justice for sure.
But fuck that guy.

3559
02:20:01,831 --> 02:20:04,580
Now some guy's cock sucker punching your
daughter.

3560
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:07,100
Big giant,
250 pound football player.

3561
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:09,540
Sucker punches her daughter killed.
Kill.

3562
02:20:09,730 --> 02:20:11,180
Very hard.
Not Super hard not to pick.

3563
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:12,640
Very lucky he's alive.
Yeah,

3564
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:13,491
very lucky.
He's alive.

3565
02:20:13,491 --> 02:20:17,270
And you probably shouldn't be if he 
doesn't feel remorse for that sucker.

3566
02:20:17,271 --> 02:20:20,480
Punching a girl in the face like that.
It's a special kind of piece of shit.

3567
02:20:20,481 --> 02:20:21,920
Big Dude too.
It's a giant.

3568
02:20:22,390 --> 02:20:23,223
Yeah.
I mean who knows what the fuck is going 

3569
02:20:24,141 --> 02:20:25,700
on in his head.
But then again,

3570
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:26,653
who knows what the fuck is going on with
a lot of football players that have 

3571
02:20:29,091 --> 02:20:30,260
suffered a lot of head trauma.

3572
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:31,690
True.
Or he could just be a bad guy.

3573
02:20:31,770 --> 02:20:33,710
Could be a bad guy maybe is raised 
around that,

3574
02:20:33,711 --> 02:20:37,100
thinks it's okay.
Maybe who knows what the girl did either

3575
02:20:37,110 --> 02:20:37,911
way.
Never.

3576
02:20:37,911 --> 02:20:40,160
Okay to hit a girl fuck like that too.
It's,

3577
02:20:40,161 --> 02:20:43,670
that's a horrible thing to watch.
It's a horrible thing to watch.

3578
02:20:43,671 --> 02:20:44,504
This gets awful.
That guy punching a guy like you is 

3579
02:20:46,611 --> 02:20:49,070
horrible but punching a girl in the 
face.

3580
02:20:49,250 --> 02:20:50,083
Horrible man.
There's a lot of fucking shit of humans 

3581
02:20:51,861 --> 02:20:52,694
out there,
man.

3582
02:20:53,740 --> 02:20:57,110
Sip a real unfortunate part about us,
but keep going.

3583
02:20:57,111 --> 02:20:58,460
Dark Dow.
It's a hard,

3584
02:20:58,461 --> 02:21:00,230
tough not to when you watch something 
like that,

3585
02:21:00,710 --> 02:21:04,400
but the Roger Roger,
their day he did man superhero style.

3586
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:06,410
I bet that guy a bit.
His friends,

3587
02:21:06,411 --> 02:21:07,244
I remember that time yet.
Burke by Roger worked at the and really 

3588
02:21:09,441 --> 02:21:10,274
is tiny thought 155 pounds and your 
giant ass is all juiced up in the God 

3589
02:21:13,831 --> 02:21:16,490
damn weight room every day and you still
got knocked out for hitting a girl.

3590
02:21:16,580 --> 02:21:19,790
Remember that asshole every day.
Ever lived that down?

3591
02:21:19,850 --> 02:21:20,683
Nope.
Even now,

3592
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:22,280
I'm sure people will find them on 
instagram.

3593
02:21:22,281 --> 02:21:23,114
Be like,
Hey rogen,

3594
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:23,973
we're talking mad shit about you man Mir
that we'll never get to live it down if 

3595
02:21:27,021 --> 02:21:29,270
he never went to jail for that.
That's the punishment.

3596
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:31,040
Correct.
He never went to jail for that.

3597
02:21:31,290 --> 02:21:32,870
You supposed to go to jail for that?
Yeah.

3598
02:21:32,930 --> 02:21:33,763
That's supposed to put you in jail for a
long time and hopefully he doesn't have 

3599
02:21:35,931 --> 02:21:36,764
kids.

3600
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:41,150
Stark.
We won't talk again.

3601
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:43,550
Wait,
go dark sometimes.

3602
02:21:45,210 --> 02:21:47,330
What else is on this car this weekend?
Yet?

3603
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:49,620
She has a uh,
anti pedis.

3604
02:21:50,490 --> 02:21:53,490
That's a fun one.
Everybody's dad slept on that fight.

3605
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:55,860
It's another one that's gone under the 
radar.

3606
02:21:56,190 --> 02:21:59,190
She has both pet dies.
Very interesting man.

3607
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:02,760
Jessa man,
he fucking submitted by Neil Dariusz.

3608
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:04,073
He gets your back.
You're Foxville remembered he got 

3609
02:22:05,641 --> 02:22:07,890
submitted by Kevin Lee.
He did,

3610
02:22:07,891 --> 02:22:10,110
but he didn't.
He didn't,

3611
02:22:10,440 --> 02:22:12,060
he didn't get submitted.
The referee stopped it.

3612
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:14,160
I know,
but he was saying he was good.

3613
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:14,750
He look,
he,

3614
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:17,240
he was tightening up his neck.
Yeah.

3615
02:22:17,241 --> 02:22:19,290
It wasn't even that.
You got to let the guy go out.

3616
02:22:19,291 --> 02:22:20,760
I'll come on brother.
100%.

3617
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:22,890
He was felder.
I Quinta.

3618
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:25,580
Whoo,
whoo.

3619
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:26,020
Do

3620
02:22:26,020 --> 02:22:26,853
Cater.
Did you see you might have caner 

3621
02:22:27,720 --> 02:22:32,040
fighting him past monster Calvin cater 
and a [inaudible].

3622
02:22:32,070 --> 02:22:34,020
That's a good fight to go.
Look at the undercard.

3623
02:22:34,021 --> 02:22:37,410
You got bored.
You've got Joe Lozan on quarter.

3624
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:42,440
Calvin cater to a more economy.
That's a great fight.

3625
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:43,690
Fight of the night.
Written all over it.

3626
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:45,240
All over it.
God,

3627
02:22:45,241 --> 02:22:48,420
there's fucking five excellent fights in
that main card.

3628
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:50,610
Like your boy fleets hit or look at your
girl fleets hearing.

3629
02:22:50,990 --> 02:22:55,600
Yeah,
ver versus Carolina voc of Itch.

3630
02:22:56,010 --> 02:22:58,020
And then I'm not even mad at the fight.
Pass.

3631
02:22:58,021 --> 02:22:59,370
Fight the,
uh,

3632
02:22:59,710 --> 02:23:04,110
your boy Bruce Leroy versus low Bob 
who's off the team.

3633
02:23:04,111 --> 02:23:06,750
Connor and then team could beep saw each
other and they got into it.

3634
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:08,490
They thing the other team,
connor,

3635
02:23:08,491 --> 02:23:10,320
and then the team could bebes got 
brilliant to it.

3636
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:11,333
Cause kimmy obviously asked for connor 
when Tony Fur fell out and Dana was 

3637
02:23:14,281 --> 02:23:14,611
like,
come on,

3638
02:23:14,611 --> 02:23:15,360
let's get real.

3639
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:17,570
Yeah,
you can't put that better shot at read.

3640
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:22,800
There's a video supposedly have a Lope 
off calling him a coward and like he was

3641
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:24,750
calling them out and to say it to his 
face.

3642
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:27,480
Oh Wow.
Those guys from uh,

3643
02:23:27,990 --> 02:23:29,880
Pakistan.
This is Dagestan,

3644
02:23:29,881 --> 02:23:30,301
right?
Yeah.

3645
02:23:30,301 --> 02:23:32,970
You know,
people he must've seen get killed shit.

3646
02:23:34,040 --> 02:23:35,880
Now Margaret Madoff,
like mentally,

3647
02:23:35,881 --> 02:23:39,090
he's in a completely different space.
Goddamn Mike can be in color.

3648
02:23:40,430 --> 02:23:42,790
Why don't they have Mike Rodriguez,
Mike and Black and white.

3649
02:23:42,791 --> 02:23:44,630
White.
Is He in Dad's ashes?

3650
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:46,920
This bullshit.
What is this bullshit?

3651
02:23:46,921 --> 02:23:48,630
They didn't even,
it didn't even allow them to flex.

3652
02:23:48,690 --> 02:23:49,523
God Damn Mike.
He's the fucking regular russell shorts 

3653
02:23:52,951 --> 02:23:55,860
on that you get in gym class.
Fuck Mike.

3654
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:58,260
Oh Man.
Oh Joe Lowe's on ons on the car too.

3655
02:23:58,320 --> 02:23:59,840
Mike slow.
Mike Rudd.

3656
02:23:59,970 --> 02:24:02,140
That's not a great nickname.
Uh,

3657
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:03,930
slow Mike.
That's not good.

3658
02:24:04,530 --> 02:24:07,100
That's a trek as fast.
So fast.

3659
02:24:07,101 --> 02:24:08,250
They couldn't get him a color picture.

3660
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:09,750
Um,
light heavyweight,

3661
02:24:09,751 --> 02:24:11,850
look at that one,
two Oh five and one 92.

3662
02:24:11,851 --> 02:24:14,700
What is that?
What's that shit?

3663
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:16,273
This is that real weight?
Is it always not in one nine two one of 

3664
02:24:19,561 --> 02:24:21,210
them is two oh five ones.
One 92.

3665
02:24:21,211 --> 02:24:22,044
That doesn't even make any sense unless 
they're fighting an 85 and they caught 

3666
02:24:25,801 --> 02:24:27,840
them before the wake.
That makes zero sense.

3667
02:24:27,841 --> 02:24:29,940
That makes zero sense.
One guys,

3668
02:24:29,941 --> 02:24:32,570
13 pounds heavier weight class they 
finding,

3669
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:33,433
I mean no,
I know that's,

3670
02:24:33,810 --> 02:24:36,420
that's light heavyweight.
But what is Mike?

3671
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:39,450
Mike Rodriguez with Shane's name for 
black black dye.

3672
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:42,300
Last name Mike or Rodriguez to be Cuban 
maybe.

3673
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:43,710
Um,
his name's Mike though.

3674
02:24:43,711 --> 02:24:45,290
Slowmo Mike.
But um,

3675
02:24:45,460 --> 02:24:46,293
if he just fortunate he had a picture 
cause usually this throw up a shadow if 

3676
02:24:48,961 --> 02:24:50,340
they don't have it right this time 
though.

3677
02:24:50,341 --> 02:24:51,840
You know what?
You're not going to shout out.

3678
02:24:51,841 --> 02:24:52,790
We're going to black and white for him.

3679
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:53,993
We're going to let people know that you 
haven't really fought in the UFC before 

3680
02:24:57,121 --> 02:24:59,340
so it give you,
but we're still getting pictures.

3681
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:03,090
What do you think about Tso and Pedis?
Ah,

3682
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:04,270
man Pedis,
right?

3683
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:06,720
It's just bad streak.
He's on a rough streak.

3684
02:25:06,721 --> 02:25:07,710
He won his last one,
right?

3685
02:25:07,711 --> 02:25:09,830
But then him find a 45 whoever told him,
dude,

3686
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:12,120
that's insane.
So what tell Holloway got his belt.

3687
02:25:12,121 --> 02:25:15,840
But I'm a Kevin Lee Fan,
but I say he did not submit.

3688
02:25:15,841 --> 02:25:18,810
Michael had it.
They should have let him,

3689
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:20,880
they should have let them go out and he 
would have won,

3690
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:23,770
but they didn't and he didn't.
Okay,

3691
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:25,450
well we're in the same boat.
However,

3692
02:25:25,451 --> 02:25:27,610
if it would have kept going on,
he had been choked unconscious.

3693
02:25:27,830 --> 02:25:29,440
Not,
maybe not.

3694
02:25:29,441 --> 02:25:32,790
I've been doing Jujitsu made too long.
Not to know the is like Hicks,

3695
02:25:32,840 --> 02:25:33,760
Gracie,
Hixon,

3696
02:25:33,761 --> 02:25:34,594
Gracie,
let's black belts take his back with 

3697
02:25:35,990 --> 02:25:37,150
full rear naked choke.

3698
02:25:37,150 --> 02:25:37,960
And it's like,
go ahead.

3699
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:38,651
I know.
Crazy.

3700
02:25:38,651 --> 02:25:40,110
Right to chocolates.
That's,

3701
02:25:40,230 --> 02:25:41,940
that's,
you know what Gracie,

3702
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:43,390
we're talking that takes,
and for Gosh Sakes,

3703
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:45,670
that's a,
I love Chia Aza.

3704
02:25:45,730 --> 02:25:50,680
That's a far cry from pigs and Gracie.
But also he went to go tap.

3705
02:25:51,170 --> 02:25:52,790
Have you look at the video,
look at the video.

3706
02:25:52,791 --> 02:25:54,370
He,
he panics a little bit.

3707
02:25:54,430 --> 02:25:55,480
And now he's a,
he's a,

3708
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:56,613
he's a black belt,
I think he said he knows what the fuck 

3709
02:25:58,601 --> 02:25:59,434
he's doing.
He was going hot and trading on his 

3710
02:26:00,461 --> 02:26:01,294
neck.
If you hear him talk about it that he 

3711
02:26:02,291 --> 02:26:03,124
tightened,
he put all his focus on his neck and he 

3712
02:26:04,251 --> 02:26:05,790
let his hands go and it's just 
tightening.

3713
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:07,353
Oh yeah.
You have Kevin Lee who's a fucking 

3714
02:26:08,831 --> 02:26:10,670
anaconda around your neck.
Yep.

3715
02:26:10,690 --> 02:26:12,970
And has previous winds of rear naked 
choke.

3716
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:14,920
I don't buy it.
I agree with you.

3717
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,300
They should have let it go on.

3718
02:26:16,300 --> 02:26:18,370
I think we'd been choked unconscious.
Gotta let it go on.

3719
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:19,233
You have to got to let it go on.
The only worse rest I've seen was the 

3720
02:26:21,521 --> 02:26:22,570
ref in the,
uh,

3721
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:24,960
Joseph Parker fight.
I didn't see the judge.

3722
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:27,520
The Ref would not fucking let these guys
fight.

3723
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:30,010
Anytime he got close,
he jumped in there and push them away.

3724
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:31,750
Hmm.
Who Do you think that favored?

3725
02:26:31,990 --> 02:26:32,823
They,
I think they thought it was going to 

3726
02:26:33,281 --> 02:26:34,900
favor anthony.
Joshua for sure.

3727
02:26:34,901 --> 02:26:37,420
They want him to win,
but actually favored.

3728
02:26:37,570 --> 02:26:39,980
Um,
yeah.

3729
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:41,460
Well,
yeah,

3730
02:26:41,460 --> 02:26:43,150
you agree with the decision?
Yes.

3731
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:44,013
Parker definitely lost,
but I can only agree where people are 

3732
02:26:46,411 --> 02:26:47,244
like,
oh Auntie Joshua look batty an off 

3733
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:48,521
night.
No,

3734
02:26:48,521 --> 02:26:49,354
no,
you morons.

3735
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:50,860
The,
and polly mentioned this,

3736
02:26:50,861 --> 02:26:53,080
the distance they fall in such a high 
level,

3737
02:26:53,081 --> 02:26:55,780
no one got hit and Parker's such a good 
boxer.

3738
02:26:55,960 --> 02:26:58,000
His Jab is so goddamn good.

3739
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:00,790
It was just a battle of straight skill 
man.

3740
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:03,910
And I thought it was so impressive and 
people walk away from gun man,

3741
02:27:03,911 --> 02:27:05,710
Anthony Joshua is not that good.
It man,

3742
02:27:05,711 --> 02:27:07,650
he's better than I thought he can box.
But,

3743
02:27:07,651 --> 02:27:08,484
and I thought,
well it's cause you understand the 

3744
02:27:09,641 --> 02:27:10,474
people that say what?
It's not that good cause he didn't win 

3745
02:27:11,531 --> 02:27:14,450
by spectacular knockouts like Deontay 
wilder.

3746
02:27:14,470 --> 02:27:16,510
Correct.
Wilder.

3747
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:18,130
That's uh,
that's interesting.

3748
02:27:18,190 --> 02:27:22,000
The wilder fight is very interesting 
because while their talks a ton of shit,

3749
02:27:22,330 --> 02:27:24,550
he's exciting.
He's brash,

3750
02:27:24,610 --> 02:27:27,010
he's got serious knockout power.
Crazy.

3751
02:27:27,150 --> 02:27:27,983
He,
he's fun to watch matt and he's like a 

3752
02:27:29,621 --> 02:27:31,480
brash American,
you know,

3753
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:32,830
that's a great,
it's a great fight.

3754
02:27:32,890 --> 02:27:35,510
What are they going to do?
That it was wilder.

3755
02:27:35,511 --> 02:27:36,344
I have to fight somebody first.
It sounds like josh was going to fight 

3756
02:27:39,041 --> 02:27:40,490
someone else.
And wilders going fight song.

3757
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:41,380
Why are they doing that?

3758
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:42,630
That's so stupid.
So stupid.

3759
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:44,350
Dropbox in this.
It's so stupid.

3760
02:27:44,410 --> 02:27:45,243
Well,
they build it up to make this big giant 

3761
02:27:46,451 --> 02:27:48,760
event and when it comes off like,
look,

3762
02:27:48,761 --> 02:27:49,594
it comes off,
it comes off like Pacquiao versus 

3763
02:27:50,861 --> 02:27:53,500
mayweather giant.
It's the number one problem with boxing.

3764
02:27:53,710 --> 02:27:55,420
Give us the matchups.
Everyone wants to see.

3765
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:56,373
That's why the UFC gain so much ground 
because usually day and besides the 

3766
02:27:59,101 --> 02:28:01,660
aspirin and could be usually when 
there's a fight,

3767
02:28:01,690 --> 02:28:02,411
danny goes,
boom,

3768
02:28:02,411 --> 02:28:03,340
there you go.
Super.

3769
02:28:03,341 --> 02:28:04,750
You want to see steep ADC.
Boom.

3770
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:05,410
There you go.
Yup.

3771
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:06,221
Colorado.
Boom.

3772
02:28:06,221 --> 02:28:08,960
There you go.
So we get all the calmer and the Albert.

3773
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:09,813
There you go.
So we get these super fights in boxing 

3774
02:28:11,890 --> 02:28:12,491
like,
no,

3775
02:28:12,491 --> 02:28:13,390
no,
listen,

3776
02:28:13,391 --> 02:28:15,070
we want to do this and this guy's a 
mandatory.

3777
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:18,250
I manage this guy and this guy's PBC 
bucks and sketch show showtime.

3778
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:20,050
So saw this red tape.

3779
02:28:20,650 --> 02:28:23,240
It'd be a phenomenal fight.
It'd be a phenomenal fight.

3780
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:25,550
Phenomenal fight.
It's going to happen.

3781
02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:27,620
I think it happens.
I don't know if happens under this year,

3782
02:28:27,621 --> 02:28:28,454
but I just can't believe triple g and 
Canelo are not going to fight that such 

3783
02:28:33,021 --> 02:28:35,180
a both.
I feel like it's not even,

3784
02:28:35,210 --> 02:28:39,710
I mean what is today date is April 5th 
it's a month away and they haven't even,

3785
02:28:39,770 --> 02:28:41,160
they haven't even put the,
uh,

3786
02:28:41,290 --> 02:28:42,770
the,
the hearing together,

3787
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:44,810
the hearing is like what the 18th 
there's some cml.

3788
02:28:44,811 --> 02:28:46,580
It backed out.
Why did he back out?

3789
02:28:46,670 --> 02:28:47,503
I just don't the,
I think he knew the odds were against 

3790
02:28:49,281 --> 02:28:50,630
him and backed out and then,
you know,

3791
02:28:50,631 --> 02:28:53,530
triple g stills planning on finding May 
5th wow.

3792
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:55,470
Still going to fight.
And I was hoping for,

3793
02:28:55,471 --> 02:28:56,304
is he gonna fight?
I'd love it if he fought Billy Joe 

3794
02:28:57,980 --> 02:28:59,690
Saunders.
But Joe Saunders camp fight till June.

3795
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:00,553
So why triptan cause he has,
he's coming off a hand injury but he's 

3796
02:29:03,141 --> 02:29:04,070
like,
I'm ready in June,

3797
02:29:04,071 --> 02:29:04,904
let's do an in June.

3798
02:29:04,970 --> 02:29:05,803
If I'm cooking,
if I'm triple g I'm not finding May 5th 

3799
02:29:08,140 --> 02:29:12,050
you're going to sell 30 paper views.
If the wind tunnel drops out,

3800
02:29:12,051 --> 02:29:14,570
whoever they replace with,
it's not gonna be a huge name.

3801
02:29:14,571 --> 02:29:16,910
I'm sure it's can be a tough guy.
It's gonna be a worthy opponent.

3802
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:18,180
Can Be tough.
You know,

3803
02:29:18,181 --> 02:29:19,014
it's not gonna make you bank.
You make bank up your paper view just 

3804
02:29:22,791 --> 02:29:25,290
fighting June fight,
fight fucking uh,

3805
02:29:25,310 --> 02:29:26,810
Billy Joe Saunders in June for us.
Yeah,

3806
02:29:26,850 --> 02:29:27,683
but the problem is they don't have the 
date in June when you look at a venue 

3807
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:31,153
like the tee ball mill arena in Vegas,
that motherfucker is booked up for UAA 

3808
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:39,830
in advance except for the mayweather.
Mcgregor fight.

3809
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:41,750
The Mayweather Mcgregor fight.
They found an opening.

3810
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:44,480
I said let's do it because now you're 
dealing with the boxing commission.

3811
02:29:44,510 --> 02:29:45,830
Yeah.
Didn't have to pay.

3812
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:47,810
They have to pay ice cubes.

3813
02:29:47,810 --> 02:29:49,740
Basketball League had a book that they 
had paid.

3814
02:29:49,741 --> 02:29:52,720
Like he's gives basketball league how 
much they want daily,

3815
02:29:52,820 --> 02:29:55,100
how much they have to,
I heard 6 million,

3816
02:29:56,930 --> 02:29:59,150
6 million to w and then they didn't like
the parking lot,

3817
02:29:59,380 --> 02:30:02,360
but it's three on three basketball for 
so ice cube,

3818
02:30:02,361 --> 02:30:06,140
get the fuck out the way.
I'll watch three on three at the rack.

3819
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:08,810
I'm not trying to see these old 
basketball players play three on three.

3820
02:30:08,930 --> 02:30:11,340
Get the fuck out so we can watch 
controverts.

3821
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:15,140
Floyd didn't give us any hassle.
Basketball is three and three league.

3822
02:30:15,470 --> 02:30:16,303
I have a bunch of old like college 
players and some old NBA players and 

3823
02:30:18,771 --> 02:30:20,630
they play a three on three half court 
game.

3824
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:21,993
Put It on TV.
It was like done every week in a 

3825
02:30:23,301 --> 02:30:25,820
different city and like a table,
a four point shot.

3826
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:30,740
It's like if there is a master's leak 
and you could only use your left jab.

3827
02:30:30,740 --> 02:30:34,490
That's what it's like in the UFC for 
sons of bitches.

3828
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:36,320
Karate is back.
New World,

3829
02:30:36,321 --> 02:30:38,510
full contact,
karate combat league kicks off.

3830
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:41,090
Is this with Bas rutten just announced 
today?

3831
02:30:41,091 --> 02:30:41,571
Yeah.
Yeah.

3832
02:30:41,571 --> 02:30:44,510
Bas rutten is the a commentator.
Commentator.

3833
02:30:44,511 --> 02:30:45,344
He's coming on.
He might have something to do with the 

3834
02:30:46,581 --> 02:30:47,414
organization.
Two bosses coming on next week to talk 

3835
02:30:49,401 --> 02:30:50,690
about it.
El Guapo,

3836
02:30:50,790 --> 02:30:51,623
you're the house boss boss too.
They play in a pit or they fight rather 

3837
02:30:54,861 --> 02:30:56,630
in a pit.
It's a shape.

3838
02:30:56,631 --> 02:30:58,010
It's like Sam pick at it,
look at it,

3839
02:30:58,100 --> 02:30:59,300
see it.
I'll bro.

3840
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:01,640
Chuck Norris did this shit and it's the 
way to go,

3841
02:31:01,641 --> 02:31:02,600
man.
Oh yeah.

3842
02:31:02,601 --> 02:31:05,390
Worked out great for chuck.
Look at what did work out great.

3843
02:31:05,420 --> 02:31:08,870
He had a lot of successful shows that 
have a fight booked.

3844
02:31:08,871 --> 02:31:09,704
April 20th wonderboy fight with karate 
pants onto it looks like so they're 

3845
02:31:15,561 --> 02:31:16,394
fighting with little gloves on,
but they're wearing karate pants going 

3846
02:31:19,111 --> 02:31:20,160
to be in the Olympics.
Not this

3847
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,350
exact thing,
but cries and Olympics for the next one.

3848
02:31:22,351 --> 02:31:23,830
God is in the Olympics.
Yeah.

3849
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:25,500
I'll tell you right now,
all these fives better.

3850
02:31:25,501 --> 02:31:26,334
Pray to God.
Wonderboy doesn't get a feather up his 

3851
02:31:27,481 --> 02:31:28,314
ass.
I to join this league or Raymond 

3852
02:31:30,030 --> 02:31:30,863
Daniels.
Yes.

3853
02:31:30,990 --> 02:31:32,100
Worldclass guys.
Oh,

3854
02:31:32,101 --> 02:31:33,840
you're shooting now.
Can you kick to the legs?

3855
02:31:34,960 --> 02:31:38,820
You better be able to kick the legs.
You can fuck it for sure.

3856
02:31:38,821 --> 02:31:43,020
Find a sandpit though.
They should fight in a basketball court.

3857
02:31:43,050 --> 02:31:44,640
Oh God Nah.
Stop that.

3858
02:31:45,510 --> 02:31:46,343
We can't,
I can't say fight in a basketball court 

3859
02:31:48,660 --> 02:31:52,050
period.
Doesn't get too close to the fans.

3860
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:55,410
Don't want you to close three rounds of 
three minutes,

3861
02:31:55,411 --> 02:31:56,244
three minutes.
Offensive techniques scored more highly 

3862
02:31:57,961 --> 02:32:00,240
than counterstrikes.
This is karate is back.

3863
02:32:00,241 --> 02:32:01,074
Approximately 50 million Americans have 
participate in crowded some point in 

3864
02:32:03,661 --> 02:32:04,710
their lives.
And then I,

3865
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:06,930
and then I grew the hall.
You got to stop with that.

3866
02:32:06,930 --> 02:32:08,670
I grew the fuck up.
Then I realized,

3867
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:09,533
oh,
I'm not learning shit that John Claude 

3868
02:32:10,411 --> 02:32:12,930
did in the movies and this isn't fun 
anymore.

3869
02:32:12,990 --> 02:32:13,823
Yeah.
When someone says that approximately 50 

3870
02:32:15,630 --> 02:32:17,640
million Americans have participate in 
karate at some point they're like,

3871
02:32:17,641 --> 02:32:18,474
yeah,
little kids taking fucking karate 

3872
02:32:19,831 --> 02:32:21,540
classes.
My seven year old's awesome man.

3873
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:22,553
Correct?
Yeah,

3874
02:32:22,820 --> 02:32:24,570
that's great.
I was a yellow duck out of here.

3875
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:29,130
The problem with karate is we already 
know about mma and we already know about

3876
02:32:29,131 --> 02:32:29,964
Muy Thai,
but ng Jitsu would I do like is if 

3877
02:32:32,551 --> 02:32:35,940
they're allowed leg kicks and they have 
the small gloves on.

3878
02:32:36,090 --> 02:32:38,550
It's basically like it's a MMA fight,
but I'll stand up.

3879
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:41,160
It's all standing,
but also then I can allow like kicks.

3880
02:32:41,430 --> 02:32:42,990
God,
it got a lot leg kicks.

3881
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:45,233
That's a huge fuck up.
If they know a lot like cake boss just 

3882
02:32:47,650 --> 02:32:48,380
to content or is it not?

3883
02:32:48,380 --> 02:32:49,213
I know it was promoter.
I don't know how I'm going to want to 

3884
02:32:50,461 --> 02:32:52,320
find out next week,
but I would have,

3885
02:32:52,380 --> 02:32:56,310
I would hope that they allow leg kicks.
I don't even like that.

3886
02:32:56,311 --> 02:32:58,840
Gloria doesn't allow elbows.
Straight Cope.

3887
02:32:58,980 --> 02:33:00,900
I agree.
I think that's the sport.

3888
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:02,580
The sport is if you're going to stand 
up,

3889
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:04,410
it should be more time.
I mean that,

3890
02:33:04,411 --> 02:33:06,160
that to me is the sport.
The rules of Morita.

3891
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:07,680
You could throw a wheel kicks in Muay 
Thai,

3892
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:10,260
you get through a flying psychics,
you do whatever the fuck you want,

3893
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:13,470
but you also can do Moitai like knees to
the body,

3894
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:14,333
elbows to the face,
all those super effective close range 

3895
02:33:16,531 --> 02:33:17,364
techniques that glory doesn't allow.
But I think their worry about with the 

3896
02:33:19,741 --> 02:33:21,510
elbows,
guys aren't going to be able to fight,

3897
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:23,180
you know,
close together because they'll both,

3898
02:33:23,181 --> 02:33:24,480
because of the cuts.
However,

3899
02:33:24,481 --> 02:33:26,260
I'd rather deal with that then not allow
it.

3900
02:33:26,260 --> 02:33:28,380
Oh well I don't like the guys fighting 
close together.

3901
02:33:28,381 --> 02:33:29,214
I think that's super dangerous,
but when you have guys fight more than 

3902
02:33:32,101 --> 02:33:34,710
one time and at night,
I think that is fucking crazy.

3903
02:33:34,950 --> 02:33:35,783
When you have guys fight two,
three times a night like Joe Schilling 

3904
02:33:37,321 --> 02:33:41,880
did in the La last man standing event,
that is bananas like you are,

3905
02:33:41,940 --> 02:33:42,773
you're taking a giant chance.
You're hoping that someone doesn't get 

3906
02:33:46,111 --> 02:33:49,080
severely concussed even in a win and 
their first fight and then come back and

3907
02:33:49,081 --> 02:33:50,550
fight in the sense that make it fun 
though,

3908
02:33:50,580 --> 02:33:52,020
like that's kind of the nature of the 
game.

3909
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:54,090
Like what about wrestling?
They can see double a's.

3910
02:33:54,091 --> 02:33:55,950
Those guys,
Russell getting head kicked,

3911
02:33:56,130 --> 02:33:58,350
they're cutting massive way.
They are cutting massive weight,

3912
02:33:58,380 --> 02:34:01,350
but they're not getting head kicked.
Getting getting head kicked in the first

3913
02:34:01,351 --> 02:34:02,184
round and getting up at the count of 
seven and the people on later and 

3914
02:34:04,711 --> 02:34:08,430
fighting and then getting head kicked 
again an hour later.

3915
02:34:08,610 --> 02:34:10,410
It's nuts.
It's crazy.

3916
02:34:10,830 --> 02:34:12,240
I just don't like it.
Just to,

3917
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:17,440
and also you don't get the best guy 
versus the best guy in an even right?

3918
02:34:17,921 --> 02:34:18,040
Like

3919
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,780
if one guy wins by first round,
knock out,

3920
02:34:19,781 --> 02:34:22,290
the other guy has a four round war like 
Joe Schilling doing.

3921
02:34:22,300 --> 02:34:23,910
He fought Simon Marcus,
right?

3922
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:26,230
Crazy fight.
They go to three rounds.

3923
02:34:26,231 --> 02:34:27,064
It's a draw.
They go to the third and Joe had been 

3924
02:34:29,111 --> 02:34:32,930
knocked down I think in that first and 
then Joe's arched them in the fourth.

3925
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:35,350
If you know the sport,
you're like,

3926
02:34:35,351 --> 02:34:36,184
Damn,
look how these guys just get through 

3927
02:34:37,361 --> 02:34:38,194
this.
They've dealt with this and now it's 

3928
02:34:39,341 --> 02:34:40,540
kind of cool,
but,

3929
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:41,493
but we know the repercussions.
Most people don't write well then the 

3930
02:34:43,991 --> 02:34:45,790
UFC should bring back a tournament to 
then.

3931
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,770
I'm not mad at that.
The pride tournaments,

3932
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:50,590
it's so old school it's in.
People are probably going to die because

3933
02:34:50,591 --> 02:34:51,424
God is so good now,
but it's what you sign up for with the 

3934
02:34:53,231 --> 02:34:54,064
problem as if one guy goes through three
rounds of hell and the other guy just 

3935
02:34:57,191 --> 02:35:00,940
lands like a connor straight left hand 
they did on Aldo and wins in 13 seconds.

3936
02:35:00,940 --> 02:35:02,990
It's just not fair.
I know and you know,

3937
02:35:03,580 --> 02:35:04,413
but,
but however that guy pulled off that 13 

3938
02:35:06,311 --> 02:35:08,950
second knock out another guy had a war.
It's true.

3939
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:10,210
It's true.
It's true.

3940
02:35:10,660 --> 02:35:11,770
It's true.
I mean,

3941
02:35:11,771 --> 02:35:12,604
Gloria is the only organization right 
now that's mainstream where you could 

3942
02:35:14,921 --> 02:35:16,760
watch guys fight more than once in the 
night.

3943
02:35:17,020 --> 02:35:18,180
They do it all the time.
Here's the,

3944
02:35:18,181 --> 02:35:19,014
here's the point.
Why do UFC is never going to do it in 

3945
02:35:20,531 --> 02:35:21,580
most sports won't do it.
It's,

3946
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:23,900
it's hard to a,
it's,

3947
02:35:23,901 --> 02:35:27,400
it's a long show b,
it's hard to market that it shouldn't be

3948
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:28,390
sanctioned.
No,

3949
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:30,540
I mean there's a reason why it's not 
your,

3950
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:32,410
you're in the right here.
There's a reminder tonight,

3951
02:35:32,590 --> 02:35:33,423
I play devil's advocate,
but the reason why it's not is because 

3952
02:35:35,250 --> 02:35:36,220
the mass is,
are like,

3953
02:35:36,221 --> 02:35:38,280
well attison it,
we're just saw me get kicked in the face

3954
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:38,950
fighting again.

3955
02:35:38,950 --> 02:35:42,220
They sanctioned and for kickboxing,
but they don't sanction that for MMA.

3956
02:35:42,221 --> 02:35:43,054
Isn't that weird?
Because like last man standing was in 

3957
02:35:45,131 --> 02:35:47,110
la.
We saw that at the fucking forum.

3958
02:35:47,950 --> 02:35:48,783
That was,
uh,

3959
02:35:48,910 --> 02:35:50,620
that was right here.
The whole,

3960
02:35:50,650 --> 02:35:51,483
the whole rules are where the judge,
and we've talked about this before and 

3961
02:35:53,741 --> 02:35:55,670
that's why I was so intrigued about the,
uh,

3962
02:35:55,900 --> 02:35:57,850
Tony First and fight,
and this is why I,

3963
02:35:57,950 --> 02:35:59,890
I did a standup at,
uh,

3964
02:35:59,950 --> 02:36:00,730
this,
uh,

3965
02:36:00,730 --> 02:36:04,360
San Jose Improv and in the front row and
I didn't know that there can be,

3966
02:36:04,361 --> 02:36:07,990
there was all of teammate Kay,
John Fitch Thompson and stuff like that,

3967
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:09,720
and a after the show.
So in,

3968
02:36:09,721 --> 02:36:13,480
in front of them asked me this before 
first and dropped them at Ferguson.

3969
02:36:13,481 --> 02:36:14,314
Could be who's going to win and I I,
it was a toss up for me but because I 

3970
02:36:17,021 --> 02:36:21,100
thought Tony was going to do work off 
his back when he was going to land crazy

3971
02:36:21,101 --> 02:36:21,934
amount of elbows and fucked up could be 
face but because it could be was on top 

3972
02:36:25,091 --> 02:36:25,924
he'd get the wind via decision and I 
said the losers are going to be the 

3973
02:36:28,451 --> 02:36:29,284
judges because they won't know how to 
judge that fight and say that in front 

3974
02:36:31,961 --> 02:36:33,640
of the AK team was awkward.

3975
02:36:34,030 --> 02:36:34,863
Depends upon how it plays out,
but if it plays out the way you 

3976
02:36:37,601 --> 02:36:38,590
described it.
Yeah.

3977
02:36:38,670 --> 02:36:39,503
If,
if Tony is landing big shots from the 

3978
02:36:40,991 --> 02:36:42,790
bottom,
submission threats,

3979
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:43,653
elbows,
his face getting bloody but Khabib's 

3980
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:47,410
doing work on top,
but Tony's still threatened elbows,

3981
02:36:47,411 --> 02:36:48,790
elbows,
this fucking them up.

3982
02:36:48,820 --> 02:36:51,940
It's possible but if could be malls but 
should be real clear.

3983
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:55,780
We don't judge them when we got it to 
see that now and that is a sin.

3984
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:58,310
That's a sin against humanity.
They says we won't.

3985
02:36:58,480 --> 02:36:59,650
This is,
we will never see it.

3986
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:02,110
He said,
he said crazy shit like John Jones never

3987
02:37:02,111 --> 02:37:04,300
be in a main event again.
He said a lot of crazy shit.

3988
02:37:04,301 --> 02:37:05,134
True.
He says this pushing gets a title shot 

3989
02:37:06,881 --> 02:37:09,540
and then someone else does.
I think he's as emotional.

3990
02:37:09,560 --> 02:37:10,810
He's upset.
I'd be pissed too.

3991
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:13,660
But also thinking about money,
he's missed out on that.

3992
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:16,610
That'd be if they tried it again and be 
the fifth time trying to promote this.

3993
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:17,503
Is that also really,
this is the fourth they've dropped out 

3994
02:37:19,420 --> 02:37:20,660
north.
They've tried to make this fight.

3995
02:37:20,661 --> 02:37:21,494
That's in Sean Shelby and Joe Sia was 
trying to make this fight before he 

3996
02:37:23,481 --> 02:37:25,760
retired was the one fight he wanted to 
make it never happen.

3997
02:37:26,170 --> 02:37:27,170
So if you're Dana,
you're like,

3998
02:37:27,171 --> 02:37:28,004
hold up,
how much money have we put in marketing 

3999
02:37:30,260 --> 02:37:33,380
to these fox?
And it just doesn't happen for us.

4000
02:37:33,381 --> 02:37:35,420
We're down.
And that does happen.

4001
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:36,650
You gotta do it.
You know,

4002
02:37:36,651 --> 02:37:37,484
you said that you didn't believe it was 
going to happen until you saw the door 

4003
02:37:39,411 --> 02:37:41,750
bolt and they're standing next to each 
other and here we are.

4004
02:37:41,810 --> 02:37:42,740
Yeah,
you're right.

4005
02:37:43,010 --> 02:37:43,843
It's such a shame.
You're the first person I text when I 

4006
02:37:46,801 --> 02:37:48,750
saw it cause we were talking about how 
sad weepy.

4007
02:37:49,770 --> 02:37:53,240
It's a jet bomber.
But this is the next best thing.

4008
02:37:53,810 --> 02:37:55,460
No,
the next best thing is connor.

4009
02:37:55,850 --> 02:37:57,290
This is the next best.
Next.

4010
02:37:57,420 --> 02:37:58,253
The next.
This the next best thing on a six days' 

4011
02:38:00,201 --> 02:38:01,160
notice.
Yeah.

4012
02:38:01,161 --> 02:38:03,180
You would never get connor on six days 
notice.

4013
02:38:04,580 --> 02:38:07,220
But if connor would have,
connor was scheduled to fight.

4014
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:09,260
See the thing about a connor at this 
stages,

4015
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:11,270
there's no tuneup fights.
It's,

4016
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:13,280
there's never,
it's never going to happen again.

4017
02:38:13,310 --> 02:38:15,440
No.
Like every fight is just giant.

4018
02:38:15,441 --> 02:38:16,274
Only fight where where it'd be a level 
playing field would be nate diaz cause 

4019
02:38:18,501 --> 02:38:21,490
he's been out just as long.
So you're both going to be,

4020
02:38:21,570 --> 02:38:23,810
have a little bit of ring rust.
You're both can be out for a long time.

4021
02:38:23,811 --> 02:38:25,040
You're both going through the same 
thing.

4022
02:38:25,190 --> 02:38:28,010
You fight a guy like Khabib.
Do you think they offered it to nate?

4023
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:32,990
Who Do think they offered it?
So we know they offered it to the Ortega

4024
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:34,190
Ortega.
Eddie Alvarez.

4025
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:36,440
Ann Alvarez had no,
right?

4026
02:38:36,470 --> 02:38:37,700
Yeah.
Why did he say no?

4027
02:38:37,701 --> 02:38:41,360
I'm not sure what shape too.
Oh yeah,

4028
02:38:41,361 --> 02:38:43,010
he's one 90.
He's been doing it too long.

4029
02:38:43,011 --> 02:38:43,844
He said,
he's like,

4030
02:38:43,950 --> 02:38:45,440
I'm not making that son.
He said it.

4031
02:38:45,441 --> 02:38:47,720
I'm all of one night.
I love Alvarez.

4032
02:38:47,750 --> 02:38:51,950
Imagine losing 35 fucking pounds.
How much?

4033
02:38:52,010 --> 02:38:53,900
And if you know,
please say it for everyone,

4034
02:38:53,990 --> 02:38:56,270
how much you think they paid Max 
Holloway to take this site?

4035
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:58,010
Six Day notice.
And they go,

4036
02:38:58,011 --> 02:39:00,200
Bro,
we know you're a champ at one 45.

4037
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:02,730
Here's the offer.
No Way.

4038
02:39:02,731 --> 02:39:03,564
We're just giving you this much.
All I know is what Eddie told me on the 

4039
02:39:06,111 --> 02:39:09,470
podcast about Tony,
you said he was going to make millions.

4040
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:13,340
So if that's what we know,
we got,

4041
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:16,200
assume there's a big paycheck in it for 
Max Holloway.

4042
02:39:16,320 --> 02:39:17,210
I told,
uh,

4043
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:18,750
Brian Goes,
how much you think he's in pain?

4044
02:39:18,751 --> 02:39:19,890
I said,
if I'm Max,

4045
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:21,930
I don't take that fight for under 4 
million.

4046
02:39:22,140 --> 02:39:22,973
I know they're,
they're in a tough position and they 

4047
02:39:24,391 --> 02:39:25,224
need a big name.
And then trying to recoup the paper 

4048
02:39:26,761 --> 02:39:28,770
views.
So I got them backed in a corner.

4049
02:39:28,890 --> 02:39:29,730
I'm on the,
uh,

4050
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:30,753
longest winning streak.
I'm saying 4 million or bust your bold 

4051
02:39:34,021 --> 02:39:38,520
man.
I'd say two till after taxes.

4052
02:39:39,090 --> 02:39:39,923
That's not worth it.
That's fucked that out when you're 

4053
02:39:42,541 --> 02:39:43,780
fighting Khabib.
Ah,

4054
02:39:43,940 --> 02:39:46,800
no.
Ah,

4055
02:39:47,580 --> 02:39:49,620
I need a million for every day.
So six days.

4056
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:50,700
So he,
so you know,

4057
02:39:51,990 --> 02:39:54,330
you know,
Max can submit people,

4058
02:39:54,540 --> 02:39:56,930
but we don't anticipate him.
Surbiton could be.

4059
02:39:57,450 --> 02:39:58,283
It just,
it seems like to be grappling is on a 

4060
02:39:59,911 --> 02:40:00,744
higher level than Max.
It seems like the way Max can win this 

4061
02:40:03,781 --> 02:40:08,670
fight is by pacing because Max is,
even if Max is not in shape,

4062
02:40:08,671 --> 02:40:09,990
he's in phenomenal shape.

4063
02:40:10,170 --> 02:40:11,003
I mean he's just,
he's got an incredible cardio and he 

4064
02:40:14,041 --> 02:40:16,230
really knows how to pace himself very 
well.

4065
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:21,260
Pacing if it's more of a style of fight 
and if it's at his temple to [inaudible]

4066
02:40:22,290 --> 02:40:24,750
watch a tempo and just throws in a 
blender.

4067
02:40:24,790 --> 02:40:26,010
Yeah,
he's so,

4068
02:40:26,011 --> 02:40:28,830
and it's a six day notice and it's a Max
who was taking time off,

4069
02:40:28,831 --> 02:40:29,664
spend time with his family.
So all the chips are stacked against 

4070
02:40:32,101 --> 02:40:33,030
Max,
all of it.

4071
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,250
And it's a weight class above his weight
class.

4072
02:40:35,251 --> 02:40:36,084
It's a Khabib who's a huge one 55.
It's arguably the best grappler in the 

4073
02:40:41,221 --> 02:40:45,300
UFC.
And the other promise,

4074
02:40:45,301 --> 02:40:47,100
he really doesn't attain the standup 
game.

4075
02:40:47,101 --> 02:40:48,510
So your chance of the,
the one,

4076
02:40:48,540 --> 02:40:52,110
the home run shot,
it's even dropped even lower.

4077
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:53,130
That's what I'm saying.
Four mill.

4078
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:55,710
Did you hear what he said about it?
He said,

4079
02:40:55,711 --> 02:40:57,240
thank you for taking fight.

4080
02:40:57,540 --> 02:40:59,160
I don't think you'll ever be the same 
again.

4081
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:01,570
Oh,
I said I have foss.

4082
02:41:01,830 --> 02:41:02,181
I don't think,
oh,

4083
02:41:02,181 --> 02:41:05,130
that'd be the same again.
And he's probably not aligned.

4084
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:09,440
That's a dark thing to say to not just,
Oh my God,

4085
02:41:09,441 --> 02:41:12,170
I would never be the same again.
Uh,

4086
02:41:12,640 --> 02:41:14,280
it breaks my heart did.
We might say,

4087
02:41:14,281 --> 02:41:17,210
hope he's wrong.
And you know what I do if I was in Max's

4088
02:41:17,220 --> 02:41:18,053
corner and if,
and if it's like halfway through that 

4089
02:41:19,771 --> 02:41:21,340
second round and I'm like,
damn,

4090
02:41:21,341 --> 02:41:23,220
maxx looks exhausted.
He's not in shape.

4091
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:24,930
He's just taking a beat and he's so 
tough.

4092
02:41:24,931 --> 02:41:27,090
He's probably the last five rounds.
I've thrown that towel.

4093
02:41:27,210 --> 02:41:28,043
I'm gonna take all the shit for the,
from the fans because I don't want Max 

4094
02:41:30,421 --> 02:41:34,170
dealing with this because this isn't,
this isn't his fight to be honest.

4095
02:41:34,171 --> 02:41:35,550
This is in his fight.
This isn't,

4096
02:41:35,551 --> 02:41:38,280
his path was going to make 4 million 
round hopefully.

4097
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:39,810
And he's gonna be set for life 
financial.

4098
02:41:39,811 --> 02:41:41,550
If he's smart with his money.
However,

4099
02:41:41,790 --> 02:41:44,700
this isn't his path.
We did this to help out the UFC.

4100
02:41:44,760 --> 02:41:46,620
He made bank.
There's a towel.

4101
02:41:46,650 --> 02:41:47,401
Fuck you.
I know you're,

4102
02:41:47,401 --> 02:41:48,234
you're in hate me Max.
We'll talk in Hawaii over bull of a Ahi 

4103
02:41:50,521 --> 02:41:52,540
tuna.
That's not a bad idea.

4104
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:54,860
Well,
if we know we,

4105
02:41:54,930 --> 02:41:55,763
I think with a cubby fight,
one of the things is after the first 

4106
02:41:57,901 --> 02:41:59,550
round,
you kind of know how it's going to go.

4107
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:00,271
Well,
no,

4108
02:42:00,271 --> 02:42:01,104
and split the thing from act two.
If he had 12 weeks and he's in 

4109
02:42:03,211 --> 02:42:07,170
phenomenal shape and he gets taken down 
all a kind of Chad Mendez,

4110
02:42:07,171 --> 02:42:08,880
conor mcgregor when cargo tank,
now we're all like,

4111
02:42:08,881 --> 02:42:11,310
it's just matter of time where mountain 
mount of time you're going to catch him.

4112
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:13,530
But with this could beebs in better 
shape.

4113
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:14,430
He's had more time.

4114
02:42:14,430 --> 02:42:17,520
He's been preparing for a guy who's 
insane cardio shape.

4115
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:21,150
So it's just the odds are so fucked from
act crazy,

4116
02:42:21,570 --> 02:42:24,240
crazy.
Really quite stressed.

4117
02:42:25,620 --> 02:42:29,190
So stressed as I was unexplained myself,
I'm stressed out.

4118
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:31,520
Wow.
It's going to be interesting to me.

4119
02:42:31,530 --> 02:42:33,090
Interesting man.
That's going to be a good one.

4120
02:42:33,210 --> 02:42:35,020
So we were talking before it,
lets wrap this up,

4121
02:42:35,021 --> 02:42:37,560
but before talking about for this,
we want to do a fight companion,

4122
02:42:37,561 --> 02:42:39,990
but there's no fights that were all 
around for a fight companions.

4123
02:42:39,991 --> 02:42:41,820
So let's,
let's do a fight companion.

4124
02:42:42,030 --> 02:42:42,863
Get all the boys in here and put on some
fights during the random night or 

4125
02:42:46,381 --> 02:42:47,214
something like that.
Ran like a fucking Tuesday or some shit 

4126
02:42:49,081 --> 02:42:51,030
and my,
maybe you pizza us.

4127
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:52,193
Yeah,
I'm hearing pizza now and then we'll 

4128
02:42:54,961 --> 02:42:56,100
wait.
We'll save for a cheat meal.

4129
02:42:56,140 --> 02:42:58,050
Well how about neither one was cheat 
until that night.

4130
02:42:58,110 --> 02:42:58,650
Okay.

4131
02:42:58,650 --> 02:42:59,910
Deal.
It's a deal deal.

4132
02:43:00,210 --> 02:43:02,220
I'll get the pizzas.
Let's wrap this bitch up.

4133
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:05,610
Brenda's job.
A big brown breakdown.

4134
02:43:05,640 --> 02:43:07,290
