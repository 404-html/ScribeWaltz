1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,210
Boom,
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,380
Josh Barnett,
youngest,

3
00:00:09,381 --> 00:00:12,620
average UFC heavyweight champion.
Now we're retired,

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,980
retired.
Just,

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,000
um,
I'm a free in the wind.

6
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:17,834
I'm like a Bald Eagle.
I'm just out there riding on that 

7
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:22,280
freedom.
Just America.

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,470
The,
uh,

9
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:28,970
I decided to leave the fold of the UFC 
and a chase,

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,590
my,
my own futures.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,030
Um,
by my own hands.

12
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:36,680
Are you actively competing or going to 
be actively competing?

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,220
There'll be some grappling stuff this 
year,

14
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:40,270
but,
uh,

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,343
I'm figuring by the start of next year 
I'll get back into the MMA circuits 

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,730
mainly because it's just going to take 
some time to set up camps,

17
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,590
managers,
the structure of everything.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,200
I have a proper sparring partners and 
all that.

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,383
And in the meantime,
we were talking about you're doing 

20
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,124
commentary for new Japan pro wrestling 
with Jim Ross and you do it on our 

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,850
access TV,
right?

22
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,420
That's right.
Okay.

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,150
Every Friday night at eight,
uh,

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,830
you can see me sit down and run my mouth
about Raslan.

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,073
Yeah.
We just did a live show up at the cow 

26
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,224
palace in San Francisco,
which they've been having sporadic a 

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,290
wrestling events there,
but it was a,

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,610
it was a big draw in that building in 
like the sixties and seventies I guess.

29
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:22,680
So it's a bit of a historical,

30
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,670
it feels like wrestling pro wrestlers 
and make it a renaissance.

31
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:27,110
It's like making a return.

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,170
Yeah.
I think that um,

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,450
there is a certain audience of a certain
age gap that our age group that has come

34
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:38,050
into flourishing in,
in,

35
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,730
into the Internet and other ways to 
which to go ahead and,

36
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:42,564
and,
and bring wrestling back up there and 

37
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:45,484
show that wrestling,
whether it's the biggest company like 

38
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,100
the wwe all the way to say,
you know,

39
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,460
number two,
it'd be new Japan.

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,970
And then there's all these independent 
companies all over the place that uh,

41
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,810
some of them have quite a decent 
following.

42
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,290
Billy Corgan from smashing pumpkins,
huge wrestling fan.

43
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,950
He owns what is the company that Nwa 
national wrestling alliance.

44
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,860
Yeah.
So he owns Nwa,

45
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,300
Nwa,
the rap group.

46
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,950
It's that too.
You been.

47
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:10,784
That's what I hear when I hear Nwa.
I'm sure there's some attitude involved 

48
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,443
with sure,

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,760
uh,
Nwa,

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,690
speak about the rest of it,
but uh,

51
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,090
um,
Nwa was his,

52
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:27,091
I guess it was a legendary sanctioning 
body and so it wasn't any one particular

53
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,740
company,
but it was a,

54
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,143
a sanctioning body that would then 
oversee certain titles and so if you're 

55
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,364
going to be on this show at this time,
you're going to defend the Nwa 

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,353
Championship.
The NWA commission would get involved 

57
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,184
and,
and they had their specifications as to 

58
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,664
how the title matches would be run and 
whether or not you could lose by 

59
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:49,384
disqualification or not.
Or if you go over the top rope would be 

60
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:54,070
a dq and little stuff like that.
Killer.

61
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,710
Kowalski.
Russell for a killer.

62
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:58,150
Kowalski.
I couldn't tell you.

63
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,950
Do you remember him?
I know the name,

64
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,070
but

65
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,903
I don't really.
I mean when I was a famous famous 

66
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,490
trainer after the fact when I was in 
high school,

67
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,020
probably Uwa guy.
It was an Nwa at.

68
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,863
Yes,
that's right.

69
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,970
Did we talk about that with billy?
I think we did.

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,720
He was like local cable when I was in 
high school.

71
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,190
It was like three days.
Yeah,

72
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,470
like a claw.
He would like grab his own wrist,

73
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,510
grab your hat or like a guy fun eric.
Get his head.

74
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,790
He's got his hand up the claw.
It's like there's some nostalgia to it.

75
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:35,580
That's one of the reasons why I feel 
like it's,

76
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:36,414
it's coming back.
It's like people who liked it as a kid 

77
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,350
or now as adults going back to it as a 
nostalgia,

78
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,511
the Internet,
it's,

79
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:46,260
it's much easier to go out there and put
product out.

80
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,143
Right?
So it makes it more easily disseminated 

81
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:53,460
to any audience might want to see it.
Especially with like a,

82
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,280
um,
you know,

83
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,273
shows that are abroad,
like there's some shows that go on in 

84
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,250
Germany and Austria that will get 
streamed and people get ahold of them.

85
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:03,084
They get to watch them.
So it's not like the tape trading days 

86
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:05,730
of the,
of yesteryear.

87
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,650
Does Jim Ross Hook you up with this 
barbecue sauce?

88
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,500
You know,
he's got some fucking killer barbecue.

89
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,403
Scott.

90
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,760
He's got sauce,
he's got rubs.

91
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,580
He uses.
He's got all kinds of a minute.

92
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,160
A whole Menagerie of all your meat 
fixings.

93
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,820
Is he a pitmaster one of those dudes?
Does he do the whole thing with the wood

94
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:24,654
and smoke with hickory chips and then 
he's got his white oak on the side when 

95
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,970
item guys,
maybe maybe he lost in my mind.

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

97
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:37,290
There's like two types of people that 
use like that barbecue.

98
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,000
There's people like me that you pellet 
grills,

99
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,180
which is infallible,
you know,

100
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,660
he's one of those triggers.
Sure.

101
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
It's easy for the pellets in it does all
the work for you,

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,710
but then there's a serious motherfuckers
chop wood and dry it out and they've got

103
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:50,544
the Coleman

104
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,310
are.
Those are the ones that start with a w,

105
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,303
uh,
the Weber grills that there's just 

106
00:04:57,561 --> 00:04:58,610
nothing to it other than.

107
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh,
those are cattle grills.

108
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,350
Yeah.
Those are for amateurs.

109
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,390
Brow.
The real series dudes.

110
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,210
They get those side pick those side 
smokers.

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,073
Oh sure.
You have the main chamber and then you 

112
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,274
got a little wood box on the side where 
the woods heating up and then the air 

113
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:14,424
goes through and it smokes from this.
That's those people that cook and like 

114
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,690
to 25.
They never let anything.

115
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,460
I throw stuff over over a gas flames.
That's my lead,

116
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,303
I,
I,

117
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,620
I have no

118
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,030
business having any,
any voice in the realm of barbecuing,

119
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,740
but it seems like something you'd be 
interested in.

120
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,630
I love it man.
Who into all things manly.

121
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,540
This is true and I like setting stuff on
fire and then eating it.

122
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,540
But do you still drive a manual 
transmission all around Los Angeles,

123
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,950
which just drove one today?
Yeah Man,

124
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,853
I,

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,273
I've been driving around.
I just got it out of the shop a little 

126
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:49,210
while ago.
My,

127
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,100
I have a 75 formula a firebird,
but instead of doing the ls swap,

128
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,530
which everybody does and I understand 
why,

129
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,100
uh,
it's got a

130
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,350
4:55
pontiac in it that we bought.

131
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:03,140
I had a board 60 out.
It's got forged Pistons.

132
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,010
Uh,
I didn't go with forged rods.

133
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:07,970
I didn't need it I think because,
well no,

134
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,100
actually I did put fours rods and 
Pistons,

135
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,890
but iron heads,
dual quads we look at,

136
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:15,050
at uh,
you know,

137
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:19,940
I don't know if the goal was to just 
make maybe one horsepower per cubic inch

138
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,280
but have well over 500 pound feet of 
torque.

139
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,114
That was the idea,
just and it's an automatic 

140
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,660
unfortunately.
Yeah.

141
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,940
Yeah.
Senator Force with me and we'll gives me

142
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:29,774
crap about that all the time.
She's swapped out because I like just 

143
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,790
being able to drive it.
Cut that third hole,

144
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,450
Sun third hole on the floor,
but the clutch pedal in there.

145
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,280
I'm,
I'm more than down.

146
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,180
But uh,
you know,

147
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,050
hell,
it needs paint.

148
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:46,610
It needs interior done.
So that's the Burt Reynolds car,

149
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:46,940
right?

150
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,391
Was that the,
you know,

151
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,610
that's [inaudible] 77.
Okay.

152
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:51,790
You're a 75 slash 75,
so it's got big,

153
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,624
big circular headlights,
a circular headlights still kind of a 

154
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,770
square round off,
rounded off square for the center Jamie.

155
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,510
And pull it up.
We can pull up 75 firebird.

156
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,790
And the formula has the big Ram air 
scoops on it,

157
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,820
right?
Right.

158
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,590
The,
the,

159
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,950
the two big snorkels that come in with a
tesla.

160
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,220
Dope.
There it is.

161
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,123
Woo.
That's a transient and minds the 

162
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,880
formula.
Ooh,

163
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,003
look at that car.
Like that yellow one on the right or 

164
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:24,890
that a gray one formula.
Oh.

165
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,280
So I've been driving that around quite a
bit and hotchkiss did all the suspension

166
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,290
on it,
will look,

167
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,990
did the brakes.
It stops in a heartbeat.

168
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,180
That's nice.
Magnaflow exhaust,

169
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,370
that's one of the few cars that I liked 
from 75,

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,490
like it feels,
I feel like everything after 71,

171
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,920
it's real risky in a way.

172
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,810
I mean some of the styling lines of 
these mid seventies cars.

173
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:50,570
I kinda like it in the obnoxiousness of 
it all.

174
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,950
But uh,
and you know,

175
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,640
when whatever you get with these as far 
as like.

176
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:59,150
So this car came with a 400,
the one that I bought and uh,

177
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,700
it was like seven and a half to one 
compression.

178
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,000
So it was just a total dog.
People like,

179
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:03,730
Hey,
do burnouts.

180
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,190
I'm like,
I wish that was the year that,

181
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,073
I mean the years where the gas crunch 
was on and they started making these 

182
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,580
cars gas efficient,
right?

183
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:15,440
Well,
are they attempted to in some way,

184
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,520
and not to mention they would,
um,

185
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,460
they started trying to incorporate a 
small dog,

186
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,890
uh,
elements to try and reduce the amount.

187
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:25,724
A small thing,
but they were just highly inefficient 

188
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:28,094
the way they were going about it with 
the air stuff and different processes 

189
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:35,840
that were like things connected to the 
heads and it was bad news.

190
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,213
Yeah.
It was a rough time for America during 

191
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,470
the rare.
The rare times that that is,

192
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:43,101
right?
Yeah.

193
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:45,830
One of the rare times,
it was a rough time for cars,

194
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,970
like from 71 to the eighties all through
the eighties.

195
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:52,070
We just make dog shit.
Cars made some real,

196
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,300
real,
real snoozers.

197
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,090
Pontiac was one of the few that was 
putting together a decent looking car.

198
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:57,924
The firebirds and the Trans Ams and then
of course corvette corvette's still had 

199
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:01,884
some good looking cars in the seventies.
They did and especially because they 

200
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,640
even with the lower horsepower motors 
car,

201
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,680
so you could still get up there and 
hustle even into like 77,

202
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,034
78.
You had the six point six three or the 

203
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,014
400 or the four or three.
I guess by that point in the Pontiac's 

204
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,423
right now,
chicks are turning off their fucking 

205
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,303
radio in mass.
I don't know if any chicks wanted to 

206
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,050
tune in to listen to what I had to say.

207
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,720
Anyway,
you're Josh Barnett,

208
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,980
chicks one here.
What you have to say,

209
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,700
they want to learn the ways of men,
the ways of men they want to learn.

210
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,663
They to.
There's a lot of fake men surrounding 

211
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,840
using signals.
You know,

212
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,500
I have a theory that a,
so not that long ago,

213
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:48,501
I maybe just a handful of years ago,
I finally got like a leather biker style

214
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:51,600
jacket.
And so fonds kind of.

215
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,530
Yeah,
but.

216
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,813
And old ray every time,
but every time I smacked something 

217
00:09:57,811 --> 00:10:00,170
electronic doesn't work better.
So they're.

218
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,070
Yeah,
he had a magic touch pro.

219
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,720
Absolutely.
The ladies loved him.

220
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,903
Yeah.
Yeah.

221
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,420
Keeps her dildos in shape.
But uh,

222
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,130
he uh,
alright.

223
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,063
So I got this jacket and I've always 
wanted one ever since I was a kid and I 

224
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:17,430
went to this store in New York because 
there was no,

225
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,293
there wasn't a location locally where I 
could just try the jackets on and I 

226
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:23,710
didn't want to buy an expensive jacket 
and have to send it back.

227
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,590
All this stuff.
So I was in New York,

228
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,480
went to the store,
found the jacket that fit me,

229
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:28,590
loved it,
bought it,

230
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,180
been wearing the ever living crap out of
it,

231
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,790
taking it all kinds of places.
It's been nasty.

232
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,800
Black metal mosh pits with it on.
I've been all around the world with it.

233
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:40,590
Have been in far eastern Russia.
A leather jacket is made to tell a story

234
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:43,500
eventually at the end of it,
but people will go,

235
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,520
oh,
you know,

236
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,930
do you ride a bike?
I'm like,

237
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,453
no.
The reason why I have this jacket is 

238
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:53,280
because of Mad Max road warrior.
Because when I saw that as a kid,

239
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,620
those jackets looked bad ass and you 
know,

240
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,790
here's the bronze,
the,

241
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,893
the,
the MFP running around in their falcons 

242
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:00,834
just tearing ass and blowing shit up 
wearing these jackets and I want a 

243
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:07,080
jacket like that.
But I started to notice that this jacket

244
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,280
was everywhere.

245
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,780
Everywhere.
Everybody,

246
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:10,614
everybody was making a version of this 
jacket somehow or some way this biker 

247
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:17,190
style jacket guys are wearing it 
everywhere.

248
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,920
Chicks are wearing it everywhere.
And then I'm like,

249
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,370
oh,
that's a weird fashion trend.

250
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:24,690
I didn't really see that comment and 
then as I started to think about it more

251
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:25,524
and more and more,
it seems like there is a attempt within 

252
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:32,610
society to try and present the image of 
toughness,

253
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,290
right?
So from haircuts to jackets to all these

254
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,124
different kinds of things that 
everyone's trying to appear to be tough 

255
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,353
and bad ass all the time without,
but people aren't going out there and 

256
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,030
necessarily risking it like they used 
to.

257
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:50,280
They're not,
they're not in generally taking on these

258
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:53,830
jobs that are dangerous or,
or even just your people want to have

259
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,410
muscle cars but they don't want to work 
on them.

260
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,700
They don't want to.
It's like by having the item,

261
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:03,670
it somehow implies some sort of 
character.

262
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,230
Yes.
Some sort of toughness,

263
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,930
some sort of a rugged element to 
yourself.

264
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:08,340
Like,
you know,

265
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,210
I'm a bad ass.
Like you've gone through it,

266
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,580
right?
No one's checking it.

267
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,414
You're falling off your bike,
going 70 miles an hour and just rolling 

268
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:19,600
and dust yourself off and you'll see all
the,

269
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:20,434
like,
uh,

270
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,293
like the 30 year old Hollywood type 
dudes with the manicured beards and all 

271
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:24,934
that on their Harley's that have all 
been a church turned into choppers and 

272
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,053
like,
okay,

273
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,800
it's like a,
a,

274
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,640
a big show of,
of toughness without,

275
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:37,660
because people aren't going out there 
and living tough lives anymore.

276
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,450
Is it toughness or is it coolness and 
are the same?

277
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,160
It's,
it's,

278
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,993
I think it's a coolness related to the 
idea of being tough and attempt at 

279
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,480
authenticity.

280
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,320
Correct.
And,

281
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,860
uh,
you know,

282
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,840
to use a term masculinity,
right?

283
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,690
And even though,
uh,

284
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,000
a woman that's appearing to be tough,
I mean,

285
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:55,834
you would call it a masculine trait even
though that doesn't mean that they're 

286
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,400
being a man.
She's putting out a signal,

287
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:00,880
right?
Uh,

288
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,713
a chick that,
whereas like a leather jacket and rides 

289
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,380
a bike,
she's putting out a signal like,

290
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,393
you better be a bad motherfucker if you 
want this bitch or I'm going to girls 

291
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,080
into the previous.
Could still apply to the latter.

292
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,913
But,
uh,

293
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,750
it's,
it's like,

294
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:20,980
um,
you know,

295
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:22,380
I'm a bad motherfucker.
All right,

296
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,214
whatever,
whatever vibe you're trying to put out 

297
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:25,600
there.
And then you go and you're like,

298
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,463
well,
okay,

299
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,680
what's bad motherfucker about you?
I don't take no shit.

300
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,970
Yeah,
sure you do paper.

301
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,130
I don't take any shit.
My agent calls me.

302
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:34,090
I tell them to fuck off.

303
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,220
I walked in,
I nailed that audition.

304
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,840
I didn't even have any product in my 
hair.

305
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,120
I don't give a fuck.
You don't know me,

306
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,890
man.
I'm different.

307
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,720
It's just,
it's just a little,

308
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:48,850
it's a casual observation.
It's totally anecdotal,

309
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:51,490
but it just seems like people are 
attempting to try.

310
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:55,840
And it's like things I always tell 
people about looking at human history,

311
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:56,910
I go the,
the,

312
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,753
the issues that we deal with,
the things that affect us or not new 

313
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,310
just in a lot of ways are just more 
magnified there,

314
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,300
especially with social media,
social media,

315
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:11,470
I believe like picks and praise on 
certain elements of our way of being,

316
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:12,500
our process,
uh,

317
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,653
and it.
And it heightens our responses to 

318
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:15,784
certain things.
But it also heightens what we see from 

319
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:21,400
these responses because when somebody 
is,

320
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,380
let's say,
massively insecure,

321
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,010
so social media can really pray,
help play hell on that and make you feel

322
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,090
more insecure,
especially if you're putting,

323
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,193
depending on where you're putting value 
on what you see or what is said about 

324
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:40,390
you or how you are necessarily if you're
comparing yourself to others.

325
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,183
Also,
when you respond to that in some way 

326
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:45,064
through your own social media,
be it by trying to take more grandiose 

327
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:49,890
photos or,
or,

328
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:50,890
or,
I don't know,

329
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,010
whatever sort of

330
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,250
signaling of,
of how to make up for that.

331
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,920
It shines even that much more to 
everybody else.

332
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,063
So what you do get seen as much as you 
see what everybody else does and then 

333
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,370
you're given an option on how do you 
react to that?

334
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,780
Well,
if you're not,

335
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,273
I mean these are the sort of.
You can go back into old books on 

336
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:14,650
philosophy and uh,
you know,

337
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,980
old historical texts,
insecurity is not going anywhere.

338
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:19,814
We're not all that much more different 
from a thousand years of 2000 years of 

339
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:24,944
3000 years.
And the way we react and respond to 

340
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:27,824
things than we are now,
it's just that all these things are 

341
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,093
amplified under the,
the elements of technology that are 

342
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:37,340
around us and how they can affect us and
how much easier it is for the,

343
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,760
for those things to get to us.
Radically amplified.

344
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,540
I mean I see people fighting with people
on Instagram,

345
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,510
you know,
see people fighting with commenters.

346
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,230
If someone posts something and then 
other people shit on them and then they,

347
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,570
they take their posts and comment on 
that and,

348
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,810
and you've got to go,
this is like hours of your day man.

349
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,640
And people just sniping at you for the 
clothes you're wearing or your fake lips

350
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:03,200
or whatever it is,
something right?

351
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:03,870
And you,
you,

352
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,521
you could say,
well,

353
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,354
you know,
you've got the person who's got a WHO's 

354
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:12,101
turned their social media to a very self
absorbed sort of a platform.

355
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:12,920
Right?
A Lot,

356
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,390
a lot.
That's a lot.

357
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,700
And then even in amongst that,
it's like,

358
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:17,990
well,
I mean to a degree,

359
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,140
if it's your social media and you are 
the prime element within it,

360
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,910
of course it would be a bit self 
absorbed,

361
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:26,744
but yeah,
but I think there's more nuance to it 

362
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:29,930
than that.
And it's not just to pick on say,

363
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,143
you know,
the gals that are taking all the sexy 

364
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,950
selfies and all that kind of stuff.

365
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:39,030
There's the dudes that do essentially 
the same equivalent and it's all in you.

366
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,063
Often.
It could be in a response to drive 

367
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:43,760
attention towards themselves,
but what do you,

368
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,860
why do you want that attention in the 
first place?

369
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:46,694
And then of course that's something that
you can't know until you know the 

370
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,130
person.
Exactly.

371
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,690
Well,
a lot of girls make a living off of it.

372
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,710
A 100 percent.
Yeah.

373
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,544
There's a lot of girls that they do like
sponsored tweets or sponsored instagram 

374
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,374
posts at once.
They can get foods are making a living 

375
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:03,890
off of instagram that way for like that 
got famous for girls.

376
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:04,724
It's like girls with big asses and 
there's one girl that I just started 

377
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:10,470
following her whole instagram,
her ass.

378
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,740
That is it,
man.

379
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,690
I was thinking it was a terrible thing 
to think,

380
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,880
but I was thinking if a dog ever came 
over and bit her ass,

381
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:18,530
she'd be out of work.
That's it.

382
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,180
It's fucked up.
She's have an arcane spray of of hugging

383
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:24,860
gels.
Shooting advert should have Kevlar pants

384
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:25,820
on.
Everywhere she goes.

385
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,990
That asks Lloyd's of London.
I have a.

386
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,040
What will you give me per cheek on 
insurance.

387
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,530
I mean she has a tremendous ass,
don't get me wrong,

388
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,423
but it's just weird when there's this 
like one here's body part that 

389
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:42,120
essentially defines your identity like 
this does,

390
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,560
which,
which is weirder that this,

391
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,570
this person with this fantastic 
monumental,

392
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:50,190
epic level ass is out

393
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,023
there taking photos of it and putting it
out there for people to see or that 

394
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,290
people not only continuing to look at it
but more flock to this.

395
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,350
This a religious icon of an ass 
apparently.

396
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,470
Yeah.
Well it doesn't get old apparent.

397
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,210
It never gets old.
No,

398
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,180
not for dudes.
I mean for girls is there like one,

399
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:12,840
but I guess it's abs isn't abs?
Like what is the one body attorney?

400
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,680
Jamie.
Jamie,

401
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,341
yeah.
Hey,

402
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:18,900
tell us about what the rules are.
But for girls it's a wallet.

403
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,060
Look how fat as long as it has an effect
of fat watt.

404
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,530
But uh,
it will also,

405
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,870
it wouldn't be surprised that women in 
terms of that,

406
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,000
that kind of shallow aspect of social 
media in that way could,

407
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,930
could make more impact out of it.
Because even when you look at,

408
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:39,890
say all the men's Mag,
all the women's magazines,

409
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:40,480
all that kind of stuff.

410
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,390
And like women want to look at young 
women,

411
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,973
right?
So women are even driven to look at 

412
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,620
Honda.
We're of course obviously driven to look

413
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:49,100
at hot women.
Well women know about filters to like,

414
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,510
oh this bitch is using filters.
Look at her.

415
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:52,344
That is not what she looks like.
She looks like a cartoon face look at 

416
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:57,630
her face and then they're trying to find
out what filter that was.

417
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,260
It felt a beauty filter.
What Cameron does she use?

418
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,333
Yeah.
If a girl's found out that there was 

419
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:04,194
like one camera that really did it,
it would be every girl would use that 

420
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:09,780
one phone that has that one camera.
Exactly.

421
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,660
Like they nailed it.
I guess they're all pretty good now,

422
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,980
but if there was like one standout phone
that took better selfies,

423
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,870
like that would be the one that they 
used.

424
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,753
Oh,
it would be a marketing avalanche 

425
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,480
towards that demographic for sure.

426
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,640
Your,
your rear phone,

427
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,980
like if you have a phone,
the camera on the back.

428
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,990
It's always more powerful than the 
selfie case.

429
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,340
But the bigger lens and for chicks 
that's fucking bullshit.

430
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,160
Like they need it.
They need to reverse the other way.

431
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,370
I need like multiple lenses.
You can choose which one you need to.

432
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,090
Like I know at my friends look like I 
see them.

433
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,043
I want to see myself selfie sticks.
If there was dudes only dudes on the 

434
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:51,960
planet,
they'd be no selfie sticks.

435
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,790
That shit would've never been invented.
You don't think so?

436
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,070
No.
If we found.

437
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,040
If it was only men and we found a guy 
with a selfie stick,

438
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,680
that would be the guy who fucked like 
hold them down.

439
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,130
This is this.
Did you get injured?

440
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,973
Is this a walking stick?
It's a portable baton in case you get 

441
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:11,010
attacked.
Are you using that to take photos inside

442
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:13,160
of a bear cave because you've got to go 
in.

443
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,930
Do you want to make sure we know where 
the Grizzly is?

444
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,870
Are you a,
you know,

445
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,750
putting that thing around corners,
the score that rabbit is and get it?

446
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,100
Is that what you're doing?
Because if not,

447
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,993
I've got a problem with that.
My arms are short dudes with selfie 

448
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,990
sticks.
That is a dark thing.

449
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,760
There's something about it like holding 
it up.

450
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,790
Hey,
I'm in front of a blah blah blah.

451
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,040
Why is it,
why does that bother you?

452
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,883
It doesn't even make sense,
like why is it okay for me to take a 

453
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:40,224
Selfie with a regular Selfie Lens?
But it's a problem for dude as a selfie 

454
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:45,570
stick.
I don't know.

455
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:49,750
It just seems a bit obnoxious perhaps.
Well,

456
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,643
it seems that way.
I can't say that I have a reason why it 

457
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:54,120
makes sense.
Make me,

458
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,113
hey,
maybe it's simply because we view it as 

459
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:00,010
something that we see women do it more 
and so we,

460
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:03,550
we think that a man is somehow doing 
something well.

461
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,383
It's like mentally,
I don't know if a man gets fillers in 

462
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:06,874
his face.
You ever see like a older dude gets 

463
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,800
fillers in his face and like,
Bro,

464
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,940
I didn't want to pull him aside.
I'm sure I have.

465
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:13,780
Yeah,
you want to go?

466
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:15,610
No,
just don't.

467
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,380
You're going to be wrinkled.
This is just it.

468
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,700
You're 65 years old.
You got to let it go.

469
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,770
It's letting go on its own anyways.
But some,

470
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,100
some gals can kind of pull it off and 
you feel bad for them,

471
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:28,960
but they still are kind of pretty 
political,

472
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,790
you know,
personally myself,

473
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,624
I'm not really all that into the.
Especially manipulating the face like 

474
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:37,590
that for anyone.
I just think that it's,

475
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,410
it's one that the potential for it to go
really badly,

476
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,790
real.
They're into it.

477
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:43,624
Just I think that people.
You don't have to look perfect to be a 

478
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,010
beautiful person.

479
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,290
Yeah.
Yeah,

480
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,124
your personality,
your personality is at least as 

481
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,803
important as the way you look and if 
your personality is such that you need 

482
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:04,780
to shoot plastic in your face in order 
to feel good about yourself.

483
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,980
You know,
I've got to go,

484
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:06,843
Ooh,
like what?

485
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,250
What's happened in their below,
below the surface.

486
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,343
It could be a indicator of something 
more serious that that no matter how 

487
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,540
much filler,
how nice it could look.

488
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,910
Maybe there's still gonna be an issue 
per se.

489
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,433
It's also one of those things just like 
anorexia or bodybuilders that can never 

490
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,000
get big enough where they have body 
dysmorphia,

491
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,040
people don't know what they really look 
like.

492
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,203
Do you?
Do you know about the FIBONACCI 

493
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:30,700
sequence?
The numbers,

494
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:33,520
right?
It's the golden ratio.

495
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,413
It actually applies to facial features.
See if you can find something on that 

496
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,550
now to see documentary on that.
Right,

497
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:40,384
and at the time,
and there was something about symmetry 

498
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,013
and Elizabeth Hurley when they made that
thing was considered one of the most 

499
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:49,050
beautiful women in the world by the 
city,

500
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,920
by the mathematics of it all.
She still wanting them to be.

501
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,730
I don't doubt it that chicks like 88 
years old,

502
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:57,820
she's still hot as fuck.
She's rocking it.

503
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,530
But something about the way your face is
shaped.

504
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,560
Um,
you're,

505
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,413
you're like,
a good example is my friend Ari Shaffir 

506
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,290
already has a thin face in a long nose 
and it all works together.

507
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,830
Like if he had my nose on his face,
it would be like,

508
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:16,960
hey,
the fuck's wrong with your face.

509
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,960
But the ratios of the width of his face 
and the length of his nose,

510
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:23,794
the size of his eyes,
all that stuff somehow or another syncs 

511
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:27,514
up.
So you're saying it's not that any one 

512
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,650
thing,
it's the sum of your parts.

513
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,630
Yes,
it's all those things go together.

514
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:35,760
And if one of them is off,
like say if your hair is golden ratio on

515
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:37,740
the face.
So if you are a,

516
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,860
a black woman and you have white lips,
like a white woman's lips,

517
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:45,350
people are like,
what the fuck is going on?

518
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,370
Is she even whistle?
Right?

519
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:49,850
She's got a large nose or a wide nose.
And you know,

520
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,980
why grow this facial hair?
No,

521
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:55,100
hide my skinny little skinny lips.
I can platelets lips.

522
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,350
You got a viking lips,
bro.

523
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,900
I had been told that this is a.
I've had some girls go,

524
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:00,650
man,
you're.

525
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,440
You're actually in way better kiss for 
than I expected because you have almost.

526
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,820
It seems like you have no lips.
I'm like,

527
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,410
dad,
someone told Kylie Jenner and that's why

528
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:12,080
she got facial stuff.
Yeah,

529
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,600
I was reading that today.
This is what kind of a loser I am.

530
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,180
Fifty year old man with children.
I fucking pay taxes.

531
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:19,490
I got a lot of shit to do.
Meanwhile,

532
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,324
I'm reading some article about why Kylie
Jenner decided to take all the filler 

533
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:24,074
out of her face.
It was a fucking article on my google 

534
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:27,680
feed and I was like,
what is this?

535
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,311
Well,
they know.

536
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:31,130
They know what you're into.
I guess they do.

537
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,890
I don't know how they've got your tagged
science fiction.

538
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,373
How do they know?
They know the inner workings of Joe 

539
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,040
Rogan will.
Filler is a fairly recent thing in human

540
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,140
history.
As long as I've been around earlier with

541
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:42,974
it.
I mean I don't claim to know what's in 

542
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:46,460
it.
What is filler?

543
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,391
Well,
it's okay.

544
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:49,010
Let's facial filler.
Google that.

545
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,150
What's in facial filler sand?
Jb Weld.

546
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,560
Pando gorilla come.
Yeah,

547
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,413
probably depending on what,
how higher grade it is or and there's 

548
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,823
the freshest levels of the gorilla club.
Does it feel like if they touch your 

549
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:06,380
face and you got some shit and then it 
makes your cheeks,

550
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,453
some girls would look.
They got rocked like their cheeks look 

551
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,140
injectable fillers with face.
Oh Jesus.

552
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,333
A hydraulic hyaluronic acid.
Now seeing the college in a hyaluronic 

553
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:19,670
acid are both going to get absorbed into
your system eventually.

554
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,560
I think that's the good part about it is
that it's temporary and then if you just

555
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:29,561
let your body raising scour depressions,
enhancing lips and replacing soft tissue

556
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,760
volume lost your facial injections.
Hm.

557
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,760
Huh?
Enhancing Lips.

558
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,250
Huh?
Get it done.

559
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,113
But that's why it looks weird with girls
when they have big fake lips because of 

560
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:41,480
the golden ratio.

561
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,870
Your face doesn't.
It just doesn't work.

562
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:48,230
Like go back to that article on the 
golden ratio of the face please.

563
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,810
And you'll,
you'll see like they have a.

564
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,973
there's a whole mathematical sort of 
algorithm that they can use to sort of 

565
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,110
explain what is and is not normal.
The,

566
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,030
the shape of your face.
Like look at um,

567
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,790
what the fuck's his name?
Angelina Jolie.

568
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,420
You remember that song?
There was a fucking song.

569
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,840
Someone.
There was a song,

570
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,773
goddammit.
This is like 2002 something like it was 

571
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:23,420
a song was Angelina Jolie got some big 
ass titties.

572
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,570
The name of the song.
It.

573
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,320
Was that a big is that was that.
Was that top 40 amongst me and my stupid

574
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:31,430
fucking friends?
It was,

575
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,620
it was.
It was a funny song.

576
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:35,360
Like the dude who sang it.
Is that,

577
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,920
is that funny sober as well or.
That's a good question and you'd have to

578
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:44,921
ask somebody else.
Those were the years from the.

579
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,540
From 2000 when I was doing fear.
Fact is that it

580
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,200
just stating the obvious is that.

581
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,660
Yes,
it's got some big ass too.

582
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,860
It's,
it's just so stupid.

583
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,840
From 2000 to two,
somewhere around 2007.

584
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:10,880
I think I was high every day.
It's all a blur.

585
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:11,843
It's just driving through a hug.
I was so bored when I was doing fear 

586
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,300
factor that the only way I enjoyed it,
it was high as fuck.

587
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,203
You're enjoying all eating pig anuses 
and people screaming about having a 

588
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,940
centipede on their head and after awhile
it got bored,

589
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,620
got desensitized to it.
It just didn't.

590
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,340
I just can't watch general porn anymore.
Right.

591
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:33,080
It's like if there's not a robot

592
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,080
right in there,
you know,

593
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,580
having sex with a tiger while a midget 
films.

594
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:40,710
It was clearly that stuff does happen.
Right?

595
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:41,544
Like there's a reason why people like 
gag porn is that rule 34 if there's not 

596
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:47,650
a point of it that uh,
it,

597
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,603
it,
it,

598
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,690
if you can think of it,
there's a porn out there and 35 is if it

599
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:53,070
doesn't exist,
that shall be made.

600
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,870
Yeah,
that makes sense.

601
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,510
It's a fortune thing.
Not that I'm unfortunate all the time,

602
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:57,890
but oh,

603
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,390
someone's going to an account.
There's something about like,

604
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:05,330
people getting desensitized that's 
fucking absolutely real.

605
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,140
And that's one of the reasons why like 
in times of war,

606
00:28:09,141 --> 00:28:12,770
people are capable of doing more and 
more awful shit.

607
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,770
It's like you get desensitized,
you get normalized,

608
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,813
like people are very malleable,
you get accustomed to all sorts of 

609
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,410
things,
send it to some of those things.

610
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,820
Don't necessarily stay forever.
They're,

611
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:24,810
they're subjective,
you know,

612
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:25,644
for that,
that time in that moment and plus there 

613
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:29,220
is everything that's going around you.
And,

614
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,063
and if,
if we're all in here and we're saying 

615
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:34,470
we're drinking coffee when you think 
that this is the way to be.

616
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,280
And then other for everyone else are out
and around us and like,

617
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,123
well they're all drinking energy drinks,
energy drinks are actually the best 

618
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:40,704
thing to do.
Uh,

619
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,573
well.
Now there's this other thing that you 

620
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,300
see that perhaps then that bleeds into 
what?

621
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,080
Oh No,
let's do energy drinks instead.

622
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,030
If you go from that to,
you know,

623
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,120
let's drink a grain alcohol,
well maybe not.

624
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,690
Well,
yeah,

625
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,603
I mean sure,
people just imitate their atmosphere 

626
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:55,970
show

627
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,490
and if someone else is,
you know,

628
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,500
God and war and if they take one year,
your,

629
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,280
your teammates and then cut them to 
pieces and send them back to you,

630
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:08,190
then all of a sudden you're going to do 
the same.

631
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,400
And some,
you know,

632
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,010
reprisal.
Yeah.

633
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,890
Yeah.
I used to know a dude who,

634
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:14,724
uh,
he was a mormon and Mormons aren't 

635
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:19,110
allowed to drink coffee.
I thought you were going to go somewhere

636
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:20,460
else.
So I knew he was a mormon.

637
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:21,660
He used to cut people a piece in the 
center.

638
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,580
I know you didn't do any of that.
I don't think.

639
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,463
Well,
I mean,

640
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,520
Mormons,
they're just so friendly.

641
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,560
There's something got to be going on 
underneath.

642
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:28,650
If

643
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,080
somethings there's a trigger that you 
got to find it,

644
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,910
puts a hole in there.
They get a hole in their magic underwear

645
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:35,810
and they're just,
that's it.

646
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,883
But I would fucking place down.
I offered them a cup of coffee and he's 

647
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:39,561
like,
no,

648
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:42,070
I can't drink coffee.
And he had

649
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,690
a fucking.
One of those huge monster energy drink.

650
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,640
Seriously?
Yeah.

651
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,653
He was drinking them all day long to the
point where he was having heart 

652
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:51,490
problems.
He's kidding.

653
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:54,400
Fucking heart palpitations.
He was drinking.

654
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,150
Oh No.
It wasn't,

655
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:55,983
wasn't monsters.
It was rockstars wonder which one has 

656
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,410
more caffeine?
Find out which one.

657
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,360
I think Ryan has more caffeine than a 
monster.

658
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,080
Monster's doable.
Like I drink,

659
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,123
I'll drink a sugar free monster during 
UFC broadcasts at the times I drink 

660
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:10,600
those during the,
uh,

661
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,700
the new Japan shows there for hours.
Yeah.

662
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,550
But the problem is you got to piss 
whatever's in there.

663
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,760
Goes right to your system like that.
Caffeine ain't helping.

664
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,653
Goldberg used to drink those fucking 
things like they were water and he was 

665
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:23,284
always pinging.
Both monster and Rockstar have the same 

666
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:26,014
amount of caffeine per serving,
which is eight 80 milligrams per eight 

667
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:30,070
ounces.
Yeah.

668
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:30,810
But what?

669
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,610
Haiti is not that A.
Wow.

670
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:36,250
That's crazy.
That's our list as being 2:40

671
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,503
at or,
or something around there at the whole 

672
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:43,651
can and monster list as being 1:32.
This is to 70 g whoa.

673
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,800
How these little bad boys or two seven.
Goddammit tate.

674
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,020
He kind of made me jump out of his 
chair.

675
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,950
Case turned tape.
Try to give people heart attacks,

676
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,043
shadowed tait fletcher.
Shout out to take Fletcher and caveman 

677
00:30:57,881 --> 00:30:58,960
coffee.
Yeah.

678
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:01,350
Um,
there's a weird.

679
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,130
People are weird with trends,
right?

680
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,710
Like whatever the fuck happened.
The acid wash jeans.

681
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,813
I was thinking that the other day,
like people used to love acid washed 

682
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:09,874
jeans.
Remember they'd walk around with genes 

683
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:11,644
with all spoiled us all over.
They're kind of making a bit of a 

684
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:14,910
comeback.
Yeah.

685
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,690
Like fanny packs.
Yep.

686
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,500
In the same.
You were ahead of the curve way ahead of

687
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,530
curve.
I never left.

688
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,530
You're basically a late eighties pro 
wrestler.

689
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,630
Yeah.
Right.

690
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,540
Like home cogan.
Like hold Bogan.

691
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,910
Like,
yeah,

692
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,380
right here.
Ladies and gentlemen.

693
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,620
This bitch never left my side.
All leather never left my side.

694
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:33,454
This is real.
It was made from a big horn sheep that 

695
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:35,610
you,
uh,

696
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,250
you tracked down with an Arrow.
I wish I should get one mate.

697
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:40,900
I've got these access deer hides out 
there.

698
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,180
I should get one turn into a fanny pack.
That'd be dope.

699
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,640
Before on it.
Fuck.

700
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:45,474
Yeah.
Right.

701
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,370
Yeah.
I hope you don't get any ticks.

702
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,860
No,
there's no tax on those.

703
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,430
I don't think they have ticks in Hawaii.

704
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,810
But uh,
it's weird,

705
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:56,644
you know.
But that's the thing about paradigms is 

706
00:31:57,431 --> 00:32:01,870
you don't really realize it's when the 
paradigm is over until you're out of it.

707
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,783
Right.
And so we're in a paradigm now of some 

708
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:09,430
sort and it's easy to get lost in that 
and not be able to see outside of it.

709
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,360
What do you think is happening now that 
will be ridiculed in the future?

710
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,480
I'm tough.
I mean,

711
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:17,314
I didn't think that in a lot of ways we 
would end up to where we are at this 

712
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:20,734
point and so many of the social and 
cultural elements and that didn't even 

713
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:29,701
just specifically stay within the u s 
but seemed to be bleeding throughout all

714
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:33,490
of western society and civilization at 
large.

715
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,290
I got one word,
yeezys yeezys.

716
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,010
Yeezys be marked

717
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,010
with that says that's a shoe,
right?

718
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,220
That's just for Jamie.
He loves those fucking things.

719
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,170
He bought me a pair.
I won't wear them.

720
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,140
I told them,
next time I go running in the creeks,

721
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,690
I'm going to wear him.
Jamie loves these God damn thing.

722
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:59,070
So I'm not.
So I'm trying them on.

723
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,740
That's still got the foam thing and 
there bro.

724
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,710
Put them off.
Nope,

725
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,393
come on.
That looks like a sneaker from the 

726
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,213
eighties,
right?

727
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,880
I wouldn't even say that.
What would you say this,

728
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,320
by the way,
you're talking to a real man here.

729
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,630
That's okay.
I understand this.

730
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:19,140
I understand this like the bottom of a.
of a fucking cycle of a form home.

731
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,660
Coleman coolers.
Yeah.

732
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,050
That's just the bottom part.
The ultra.

733
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,650
The ultra.
What is this?

734
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:34,880
Like a glorified fucking water sock.
This is like the thing.

735
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,990
You see some,
some doofus with a those,

736
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:40,700
a frog skin things on his glasses to 
keep from falling.

737
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,030
Always wandering around in the.
You know,

738
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,580
I don't want to get too wet.
So you wouldn't wear those.

739
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,020
No.
Weird.

740
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,480
Here's what I.
where we're at.

741
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:53,120
How manly men were these.
That's right.

742
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,183
Chuck Taylor.
Custom chucks with my logo on the side 

743
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,450
as was drawn by Dan [inaudible] and look
at that.

744
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,730
A skulls and shit like this.
God damn dirty,

745
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:06,980
stinky chuck.
I wear black metal tee shirts.

746
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,150
Look at that.
See that chuck's Goddamn classics.

747
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,780
Jamie,
not this.

748
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,170
What is this a fuck's going on here?
Comfort.

749
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,870
Comfortable trucks while I'm wearing.
I'm like,

750
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,733
damn,
I should probably put these on when no 

751
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:22,004
one's looking.
Goddamn being like you're just wearing 

752
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:27,830
Angelina Jolie's titties,
right?

753
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,340
Big Ass souls.
Yeah.

754
00:34:31,341 --> 00:34:33,880
They look comfortable.
Stop pitcher filters.

755
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,000
I could see jp and some disease.
What's that?

756
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,210
Legacy JP and some yeezys jp?
Yeah,

757
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,280
Jordan Peterson.
Peterson.

758
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,633
Oh yeah.
I could see him wearing some atrocious 

759
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:48,641
sandals and no one's looking man that 
you'd have to talk to them to,

760
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:50,324
to,
to do good.

761
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,330
Take those off with a.
with some wool socks on.

762
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,693
Yeah.
Jamie and I were talking about this the 

763
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:57,644
other day.
You're allowed to wear socks with 

764
00:34:58,551 --> 00:35:02,060
slides.
No slides,

765
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,620
so there's no right.
There's no toe.

766
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,690
You're allowed to.
Who says guys wear them all the time.

767
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,980
Fuck that noise.

768
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,090
The fuck.
Is that about?

769
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,680
I don't know.
It's a thing loud.

770
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,643
No,
it's not allowed guys wear them all the 

771
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:21,740
toe.
Keep your socks out of your sandals.

772
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,470
We were just in Vegas and there was some
basketball thing going on there.

773
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,250
There was a bunch of basketball players.
Okay.

774
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,700
Half of them slides.
Here's the deal with that though,

775
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:32,534
and it's.
I can at least say as an athlete that 

776
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:36,304
maybe they've got the slides on because 
they're going to take those slides off 

777
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:38,040
and

778
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,070
put their basketball shoes right on.
So for them it's like I'm,

779
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,010
I'm,
I'm out of uniform at the moment,

780
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,450
but I'm ready to go to combat basketball
wise at any moment.

781
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:49,890
I don't know.
But in general,

782
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,590
as far as a fashion trend,
fuck that noise.

783
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,580
But it looks ridiculous

784
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,580
amongst like rappers see rappers wearing
those things with socks,

785
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,340
it just looks like he just,
I don't know,

786
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,600
like you've given up.
Yeah,

787
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,030
kind of just wear sweatpants all day 
too.

788
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,893
Like you're a dude with a wife beater 
with your gut hanging out of the bottom 

789
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,590
of it and you just fucking kicking back.

790
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,411
Fuck it.
I don't only.

791
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:14,230
I can't even bend over and tie my shoes 
class for the velcro on my yeezys.

792
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

793
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,570
Don't velcro.
Well,

794
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:20,404
you know,
I guess I guess you don't need a real 

795
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,050
shoe.
If you throw on,

796
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:23,923
you walk out with your socks on and you 
throw on your sliders and get on your 

797
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,740
hoverboard are fucking what your 
electric scooter.

798
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,490
Would you ever drive a tesla?

799
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,280
Uh,
I would drive a tesla,

800
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,020
uh,
but you know,

801
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,640
here's,
I got one of my beefs,

802
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:43,290
not with Tesla's per se in any way,
but I would say we're talking about cars

803
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:44,300
as somebody,
uh,

804
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,170
out and about,
and they'll,

805
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,393
we'll have some conversation and uh,
I'll bring up some car or talking about 

806
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:54,750
something like the dodge now wasn't a 
demon when the hell cat came out.

807
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:55,920
And so like,
Oh yeah,

808
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:58,230
those,
those hellcats I've heard amazing things

809
00:36:58,231 --> 00:36:59,064
about how,
not only is it obviously incredibly 

810
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,750
powerful and fast,
but that they're massively comfortable.

811
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:05,070
You could,
it's a gt car.

812
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:09,560
You could grand tour all over the US and
become free of the whole time and yeah.

813
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,200
And they're like,
oh,

814
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,410
but what about the Tesla?
I'm like,

815
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,740
um,
that's another 40 to $50,000

816
00:37:16,741 --> 00:37:17,970
more.
Oh,

817
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:20,250
it's almost,
I heard it's as fast if not faster.

818
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:21,084
I go,
if I'm paying over 100 fucking thousand 

819
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,970
dollars for a car,
get better,

820
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:27,160
be fast,
it better have all this shit like,

821
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,223
and I would talk about certain other in 
a lot of times it's like my firebird 

822
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:32,850
doesn't cost that much.

823
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,340
Dude,
I don't care if that Tesla winds,

824
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:38,070
you just spent $150,000
on a car.

825
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,630
Okay,
well what if cost wasn't an option?

826
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,600
What if Elon Musk,
if I'm elon musk,

827
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,010
I'm,
well God,

828
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:44,844
I don't think he can not drive a tesla.
He's out there and have a goddamn three 

829
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:49,790
inch exhaust for 70,
you know,

830
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,170
big block I,
Pontiac people are like,

831
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,550
what the fuck?
Yeah,

832
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,040
he probably can't drive anything but 
Tesla and Oh,

833
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,810
what a trap.
Yeah,

834
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,033
for real.
But wish I would rather I would rather 

835
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,363
drive a car.
I don't feel like electric cars have 

836
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,930
soul.
They don't have any.

837
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:08,250
There's nothing that doesn't

838
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,541
the beep.
Boop,

839
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,374
boop,
boop up in the little printer comes out 

840
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:15,220
and I just doesn't do it for me.
Well,

841
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:17,800
they're really cool,
but at the end of the day,

842
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:22,030
the problem,
the problem is it feels good to hear the

843
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:22,864
rumble of it.
Engine to me in the fucking put that 

844
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,420
clutch in and pop that gear.
What does that Elan's to gas cars.

845
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:36,010
He owns a Jag Jag.
That's an old jag.

846
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:41,030
That's a hard top.
It's probably a [inaudible] actually.

847
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,400
Those are amazing.
First love.

848
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,430
Wow.
Oh,

849
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:46,181
it's a roadster.
Okay,

850
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,030
so that top pops off.
Wow.

851
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,580
That's it.

852
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,030
That's shaped man.
Look edible.

853
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,100
What year was that?
Oh yeah,

854
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:55,943
that's

855
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,750
sixties.
Sixty,

856
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:01,960
70,
67 and it's a gorgeous.

857
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,720
So pretty.
Let me see that picture again.

858
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,520
Scroll down.
Oh,

859
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,130
look at that.
Yeah,

860
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:12,790
but there's something about the sound of
combustion engines.

861
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,380
Just.
It's so magnetic.

862
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,510
Teslas are cool.
They're silent.

863
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,670
The that.
I'm sure they're incredibly comfortable.

864
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,780
Oh yeah.
And that pad that they.

865
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,860
Big Ass ipad that you have where your 
navigation screen is,

866
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,694
I mean,
is the shit while you're driving and 

867
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:30,820
that thing and you just ask it to play 
songs and it pulls them up on spotify.

868
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,950
I'm also a little bit

869
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,900
weirded out by the over elect tronic 
element of modern life.

870
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:38,850
I,
I realized the usefulness of it,

871
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:41,190
but I always think about,
you know,

872
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,593
when some shit goes south,
like I can't just fix it and we keep 

873
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:46,374
going or if something goes bad it could 
go bad and a lot of different ways and 

874
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:53,970
there's a chain of command of bad that,
that it's all linked to that it could go

875
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:55,380
to as well.
And so I'm just like,

876
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:56,630
Eh,
just doesn't that.

877
00:39:56,631 --> 00:39:59,330
Plus when you talk about engines,
alright you,

878
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:00,164
you start up your porsche startup event,
you start up an ls motor and then you 

879
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:08,310
started up next to a big block pontiac.
You started up next to a big block.

880
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:10,560
Ford and everything has a different 
feel,

881
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:13,470
a different different cam that's in it 
makes it sound different,

882
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,650
makes it operate different.
The exhaust,

883
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:19,740
it's on everything changes based on all 
kinds of different elements.

884
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:22,140
And so the,
the car even of itself,

885
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,123
not just the exterior of it,
but the internal is make it seem like a 

886
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:26,820
different vehicle.
Yeah,

887
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,683
for sure.
Like have you ever been around Ferrari 

888
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,560
a?
Not a ton,

889
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,000
no,
but I know they have.

890
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,993
They got the salad.
They had their own Aston Martin is 

891
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:42,340
famous for having.
It's a very specific exhaust.

892
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,330
There's sounds that they have.
It's like a celebration.

893
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,613
It's like better not drive it too far 
because it's probably going to break 

894
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,910
before the next 12 minutes.
This is fantastic.

895
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,073
Nothing like it.
The way they sound like I used to love 

896
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:01,960
top gear with Jeremy Clarkson.
Show was the best.

897
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,730
Whoever he punched,
he said,

898
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:06,790
sorry.
The showbread get over it.

899
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:10,480
Fuck is wrong.
BBC conscious slap.

900
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,100
It's what you were talking about 
earlier.

901
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,790
People are pussified there.
Pussified there.

902
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:15,663
They're playing tough.
They're doing a Goddamn car show with a 

903
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:21,850
bunch of men drinking booze.
You guys got in a fight and you got hit.

904
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,030
Take a little settlement.
Move on.

905
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,010
Give them an apology or,
or even just say,

906
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:28,060
Hey,
let me hit you one back.

907
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,420
Fine.
I wish I was there.

908
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,140
And Jeremy,
how much money you got?

909
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,040
What you got in the bank?
Got $70,000,000.

910
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,513
A million people wanting to sort of live
at parents' house for the rest of their 

911
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:41,174
life,
except then it goes from being mom and 

912
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:43,244
dad to them being a state of some sort 
that does all your work for you because 

913
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:46,754
you don't want to have to take the 
responsibility of either winning or 

914
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:50,240
losing that confrontation.
Maybe.

915
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,830
Well,
I think he just got punched.

916
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,590
Was a drunk asshole.
Maybe so.

917
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:58,010
But if it's on Jeremy,
he could just go to me like,

918
00:41:58,011 --> 00:41:59,990
all right dude,
I'm gonna get one on you.

919
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,090
Yeah,
it's and it's even we're done.

920
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,053
Move on with my life.
But what if the guy can fucking crack 

921
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,520
with Paul Dale daily?
Shouldn't have fucking hit him.

922
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:10,720
Then he shouldn't have fucking hit him.
He hit a barrier.

923
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,100
All.
Well,

924
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,830
that's the realm of people that don't 
practice martial arts.

925
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,663
Like how many people get drunk and get 
in fistfights that actually know how to 

926
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:21,050
fight.
It's pretty small.

927
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,270
According to the Internet.
It's real small.

928
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:28,271
He watches the district videos idea what
they're doing.

929
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,620
You know,
they think it's,

930
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:33,320
I'm always amazed at people's,
uh,

931
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,750
overestimation of what they can do with 
their body,

932
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,150
especially in pr and went to pertains to
animals,

933
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,240
like what you would do if an animal's 
coming at you or like,

934
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,223
you know what?
My favorite thing to watch is one of my 

935
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:44,690
favorite things in the last couple of 
weeks.

936
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,733
I got to stop.
I watched fucking running with the 

937
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:49,250
bowls.
Oh Man.

938
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,113
When is that?
Actually this week I think I have a 

939
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:53,840
bunch of friends over there.
They're going to do that.

940
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,670
Call them,
call them,

941
00:42:55,671 --> 00:42:58,350
tell them you love them to get the fuck 
out there.

942
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,190
Don't do it.
Hey,

943
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:01,791
let's,
let's,

944
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:04,100
uh,
let's get this two ton animal.

945
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:08,990
Don't think people understand a how 
strong those things are.

946
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:10,760
And B,
how shitty their body works.

947
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,530
People have this idea that,
come at me,

948
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:13,480
bro.
I'm going to fuck it.

949
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:15,560
Just get it out of the winning.
Just sidestep it.

950
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:16,410
Yeah.
Meanwhile,

951
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,940
you're on these slick beer soaked.
What is this,

952
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:22,200
Jamie?
This is the end of it right now.

953
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,370
The sixth of the 14.
What's happening right now?

954
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,980
I can't believe it.
I've been watching videos.

955
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:32,981
I didn't know it was actually live.
This is so fucking insane.

956
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,350
This is so insane.
People are so insane.

957
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:38,930
What if it gets a beat on you and then 
all of a sudden like A.

958
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,763
Nope.
You're the only one out of this entire 

959
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:43,640
crowd of 500 people right now that it 
wants to Gore.

960
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,171
Oh yeah.
Well,

961
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:47,600
I mean if it finds one that sits still,
it's going have tickets,

962
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:48,434
frustrations out.

963
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,900
And the crazy thing is,
hey,

964
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,803
look how many people were there watching
this and watching these fools running 

965
00:43:53,871 --> 00:43:57,500
around in the middle of this bull fight.
I want to see someone get fucked up by a

966
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,390
bull.
Have you ever watched a bullfight?

967
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,470
Uh,
I have not.

968
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,560
I have seen plenty of clips.
Footage of it.

969
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:04,394
What?
Have you remember watching a bullfight 

970
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,020
yeah.
I'm not interested.

971
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,610
Didn't,
doesn't really do anything for me.

972
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,411
No.
I mean I,

973
00:44:08,411 --> 00:44:11,180
I can up until the point of,
of,

974
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,990
of killing it,
right?

975
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:13,491
I.
Okay.

976
00:44:13,491 --> 00:44:15,050
You want to go out there and dodge a 
bull?

977
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,720
A seems like a bad idea,
but all right.

978
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,300
But then you.
All right.

979
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:22,880
You've already proven that you can 
maneuver yourself out of the way.

980
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,743
No need to spirit and kill it.
It also seems to me that I know it's 

981
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,180
tradition.
I know it comes from a different era.

982
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:32,080
I know I understand that and so I'm not 
going to here and then just like

983
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,083
go railroading bullfighting necessarily.
Position is tradition to know there's a 

984
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:38,310
lot of things that are pretty 
successful.

985
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,860
Yeah,
it was horrific traditions.

986
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,023
It just seems to me to be a a 
bastardization of our relationship with 

987
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,990
animals.
Like even.

988
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,960
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with domesticated animals,

989
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,480
but obviously factory farming is this 
disgusting.

990
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:56,500
It's nasty shit.
Why?

991
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:59,180
Why do it?
And there is no I.

992
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,053
it's possible to have animals that are 
able to live a more natural way of life 

993
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,960
than it is to to jam into a cage and 
force feed them until.

994
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,480
I don't know if it's possible to do it 
the way we've been doing it,

995
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,353
but the real problem is the way we 
expect to be able to just go to Jack in 

996
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,750
the box and get a burger.
Well,

997
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:17,590
we eat too much meat.
Yeah.

998
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,420
In general,
I think that your average person doesn't

999
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:24,930
need to eat nearly as much fucking 
varieties of meat as they do.

1000
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,730
They need,
they definitely need meat in their diet,

1001
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:30,930
I believe on average.
Do you know about the carnivore diet?

1002
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:31,651
Now?
See,

1003
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:33,020
here's the thing.
I've been uh,

1004
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,320
uh,
I heard you talking to Joel,

1005
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:38,630
you've talked a lot about and then 
Jordan Peterson and his,

1006
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,760
his daughter.
Oh,

1007
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,500
I talked about it with Chris Bell First 
who's been on it for,

1008
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,140
I think he's been on it for at least six
months or so,

1009
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:49,974
and he's having radical improvements and
one of the reasons that he's having 

1010
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:56,520
improvements and then Jordan's having 
tremendous results.

1011
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,760
And Jordan's daughter as well is 
arthritis.

1012
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,620
They all have arthritis.
Like Chris Bell has two artificial hips.

1013
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,120
I don't doubt it.
Trying to be that market.

1014
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:07,954
Smelly markers smelly.
Chris Chris's bore Chris Board Bell and 

1015
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:15,240
Chris is the one who produced bigger,
stronger,

1016
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:16,650
faster.
I met Chris.

1017
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:19,560
I've met.
I've actually never met mark the person.

1018
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,650
Chris is a fantastic always guys 
backward baseball cap on.

1019
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,080
Yeah.
They're both fantastic guys and really,

1020
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:29,820
really smart and just Chris has suffered
from serious,

1021
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,550
debilitating arthritis and pain in his 
joints his whole life.

1022
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,403
Having a carnivore diet,
knocked it out for them and that's the 

1023
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:37,654
only thing I was familiar with,
the ketogenic diet and all that kind of 

1024
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:44,931
stuff and and having a higher.
It works for me as well to be honest,

1025
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:45,990
to eat that way.
My,

1026
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,080
my problem is my love affair with 
fucking breads.

1027
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,260
You're out there getting a coffee maybe 
in the morning like,

1028
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,393
damn,
that looks like an amazing croissant 

1029
00:46:54,091 --> 00:46:56,910
right now.
How it looks even better in my face.

1030
00:46:56,911 --> 00:46:59,310
He's like a chocolate croissant.
I do like the chocolate croissants.

1031
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,250
You know who's got the best ones?
Coffee Bean though.

1032
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:04,720
Starbucks ones can suck my dick.
You know what I don't eat.

1033
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:07,020
I don't eat.
I'm a Seattle Guy,

1034
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:08,360
but I don't need starbucks for science.

1035
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,900
You don't know.
They're terrible.

1036
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,760
They used to be okay.
They used to be pretty good.

1037
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,370
You know when they went south and they 
started putting them in plastic bags,

1038
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,413
they give them to you.
They're already sealed up in a plastic 

1039
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:20,310
bag back.
No one's at coffee bean.

1040
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,680
Have way more chocolate in them.
They're thick.

1041
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:24,450
If you're going to go deep,
go deep.

1042
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,740
That's what I say.
I go to the off,

1043
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,910
you know the non chain coffee shops that
that will like a coffee,

1044
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,180
coffee and food and coffee.
Commissary faced down the street here,

1045
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,073
a Russian bakery.
These truck croissants will knock your 

1046
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,390
deck right into the dirt and bet.
Ooh,

1047
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,060
they're thick,
rich and delicious.

1048
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,130
Yeah,
I'll go get her number for them.

1049
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,220
I got good coffee type.
I,

1050
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,310
if I,
if I stick to eating in a more ketogenic

1051
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:52,090
way,
it's,

1052
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,110
I feel better.

1053
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,290
My joints hurt less.
Uh,

1054
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,450
I lose fat easier,
but I still can,

1055
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:00,310
can put on muscle mass.
It's,

1056
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:01,203
it is a better way for me to eat.
And I don't know if there is something 

1057
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:07,000
about our genetic makeups,
say meet you JP.

1058
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,640
We probably have some crossover 
similarity there.

1059
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,613
Yeah.
I don't know if there's anything to do 

1060
00:48:11,381 --> 00:48:12,214
with that.
I just know that it's been useful to me 

1061
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,890
and I've seen it be,
you know,

1062
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,670
that's the way you eat.
I've seen,

1063
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,563
I've heard Jordan talk about his 
daughter and how useful it's been for 

1064
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:22,534
her and as you another one,
I mean she's had her ankle replacement 

1065
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:26,374
or hip replacement.
It's like an autoimmune thing as does 

1066
00:48:28,631 --> 00:48:29,350
he.
It's the same,

1067
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,183
same exact issue.
And an autoimmune issue is also what 

1068
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:37,480
this radical arthritis's.
There's so many people have these issues

1069
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,540
and these are isolated incidences,
you know,

1070
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,140
isolated issues that people have,
but you know,

1071
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,200
I know people that thrive.

1072
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,030
A vegetarian diets.
I have no problem with it.

1073
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,390
Yeah,
a vegetarian is a way to go for a lot of

1074
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:50,890
people that are thinking about being 
vegan.

1075
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:52,780
Don't be scared of eggs,
folks.

1076
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:55,120
Just get eggs are good for you.
Eggs are great for you.

1077
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:55,954
Just every,
all this fucking Peta propaganda where 

1078
00:48:57,821 --> 00:48:59,650
they call them chicken periods.
Look,

1079
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:01,360
if you don't want to kill animals,
I get it.

1080
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:02,194
I get it.
I told her,

1081
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,380
I love animals.
Get free range eggs.

1082
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:06,214
You can get them at the fucking farmer's
market and they have a dark orange yolk 

1083
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:10,863
and they're fucking great for amazing.
And the chickens don't even notice 

1084
00:49:13,301 --> 00:49:14,560
they're gone.
They don't give a fuck.

1085
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:16,240
No chicken is going to have eggs no 
matter what.

1086
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,950
They just lay them,
unless there's a rooster that to,

1087
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,860
uh,
to fertilize it.

1088
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:23,470
They just got to fucking lay eggs.
It's just free food.

1089
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,920
It's like a gift that they give you.
A keystone chickens.

1090
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,313
Fuck,
I had six eggs this morning for 

1091
00:49:30,611 --> 00:49:31,610
breakfast.
They're incredible.

1092
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,900
They're thicker and heavier and it's 
actually good for you.

1093
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,570
And of all things,
one of chickens,

1094
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,673
one of their favorite little snacks.
That's something that they just 

1095
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,980
absolutely love.
Eggs.

1096
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,280
Chickens,
chickens love scrambled eggs.

1097
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,400
Yeah.
You know what they really love?

1098
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,850
They love shells.
They love the shells.

1099
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,133
Shells.
Yeah.

1100
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,580
No,
they love more than that.

1101
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,350
Mice,
mice,

1102
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:54,161
lizard.
Tail.

1103
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,780
Fuck.
Vicious little fuckers.

1104
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:56,614
Yeah.
But you know what they don't fuck with 

1105
00:49:57,251 --> 00:49:58,540
squirrels.
Well,

1106
00:49:58,541 --> 00:49:59,710
they're a little big,
but yeah.

1107
00:49:59,711 --> 00:50:02,830
But they just don't even try like 
squirrels,

1108
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:04,000
like a rat,
you know?

1109
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,980
It's basically a rat.
Everybody loves squirrels.

1110
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,230
Even chickens.
Step bushy tail.

1111
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,730
It's crazy.
That bushy tails all.

1112
00:50:09,731 --> 00:50:14,080
You needed that cute haircut.
Like this little snap and awake and uh,

1113
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,153
yeah.
Yeah.

1114
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,241
Well,
I had a,

1115
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:18,210
I had four chickens and one time,
uh,

1116
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,680
there was a little miniature Chihuahua,
a little chihuahua or a little mini docs

1117
00:50:22,681 --> 00:50:23,514
and maybe are many men.
It was a min pin and it got into the 

1118
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:27,394
yard and ended up in the backyard and 
the four chickens cornered it and 

1119
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,124
wouldn't let it leave and so it's back 
there whining and yelping and 

1120
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:38,960
eventually,
uh,

1121
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,823
my ex at the time went and caught the 
dog and then try to figure out whose it 

1122
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:46,190
was and what have you.
And it turned out it was chipped,

1123
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:50,000
I think in you got given somewhere where
someone could then track them down,

1124
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:51,740
but it was just hilarious that these 
chickens were like,

1125
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:52,640
fuck you,
motherfucker.

1126
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:54,450
You're in the wrong place.
You know else?

1127
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,720
Love squirrels.
My dog.

1128
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,930
That's a different animal all together.
Yeah.

1129
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,280
Marshall,
they hardly ever catch him though.

1130
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:08,480
He got that one.
It was like this sweet golden retriever.

1131
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:10,690
That's kind dog who loves everybody.
Yeah.

1132
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,040
He likes fucking up squirrels too.
Well,

1133
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,950
the problem is the squirrels go into the
chicken coop.

1134
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,510
They'll find a way into the chicken coop
and they steal all the chickens for food

1135
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:18,703
and Marshall just decided to wait 
outside of the chicken coop because he 

1136
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:22,034
knew where the hole was.
I just sit in there and snatched that 

1137
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:28,220
motherfucker and then just with the 
biggest shit eating grin on his face.

1138
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,030
Yeah.
Mrs.

1139
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:29,863
Rogan does not like the squirrels.
She doesn't like the squirrels getting 

1140
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:33,110
into the chicken food.
To me,

1141
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:34,760
I feel like we just buy more chicken 
food,

1142
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,560
poor little squirrels that they're 
hustling.

1143
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,000
It's hard life being a squirrel.
It is just trying to get these,

1144
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,163
you know,
trends trying to get by trying to live 

1145
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:44,180
your life are out there.

1146
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,310
They all have this peer pressure from 
all these other squirrels.

1147
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,900
And then he started smoking young.
Yeah.

1148
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:52,550
They find this sweet spot where all 
these fucking nuts and all this grain is

1149
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,570
like,
this is amazing.

1150
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,400
Yeah.
Squirrel gang.

1151
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:57,860
I can tell when they fucked up though,
they start stealing eggs.

1152
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:58,993
They still stealing eggs.
These cops were trying to roll eggs out 

1153
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:03,770
of the chicken coop.
That's when she got mad.

1154
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:04,670
Yeah.
I,

1155
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,503
I had no idea that squirrels ate eggs 
and then we started finding videos 

1156
00:52:08,481 --> 00:52:09,314
online.
Jamie pulled a bunch of videos of 

1157
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:13,090
squirrels,
role in chicken eggs out of a chamber.

1158
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,400
Heard of that either.
They didn't have the motherfuckers we,

1159
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:17,600
they have.
We have egg boxes.

1160
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,980
They're elevated egg boxes.
Okay.

1161
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:21,110
The egg boxes like two and a half,
three feet off the ground.

1162
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:24,530
Squirrels got up into the egg box,
got the egg,

1163
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,870
chucked it out of the egg box,
lands on the ground.

1164
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:29,000
The getting it in their own egg.
They're clever.

1165
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:32,510
Little fucker's sneaky and they're cute.
So they're like,

1166
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:34,970
I can get away with anything.
They do get away with more.

1167
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:37,790
Like rats must be like,
what in the fuck man,

1168
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,660
this shit.
We were wasting water and yet people get

1169
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,630
fucked.
Just stab as left and right.

1170
00:52:44,631 --> 00:52:45,464
Yeah.
There's no industry for Squirrel killen 

1171
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:47,690
like,
no,

1172
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,640
not really.
Maybe in the deep south.

1173
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:50,474
And that's not an industry out there.
They get their mortgage is paid by 

1174
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:53,474
killing rats.
Like they're driving around in a nice 

1175
00:52:55,161 --> 00:53:00,161
car from killing rats.
Nolan and nobody cared.

1176
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:01,460
Nobody feels bad.
Like,

1177
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:02,390
Oh,
I'm an exterminator.

1178
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,940
We're all racist when it comes to 
certain animals and bugs,

1179
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,100
right?
People collect butterflies.

1180
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,560
Nobody stomp roaches,
everybody stomps,

1181
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:10,440
roaches,
swats,

1182
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,980
mosquitoes,
mosquitoes,

1183
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,430
those things.
They will give you everything.

1184
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,100
Know all kinds of diseases and shaken 
gay fever,

1185
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,250
malaria,
and the only,

1186
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,293
the only part of the mosquitoes life I 
enjoy or think is interesting is when 

1187
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:23,594
their larva and they're these fucking 
vicious little things at these giant 

1188
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:26,260
hook

1189
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:27,093
teeth that will,
can even eat little fish and all that 

1190
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:31,380
kind of stuff.
In the ponds too.

1191
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:35,670
When I first moved to California,
I rented this house in Encino and nobody

1192
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:38,010
lived in it for like a year and a half,
two years,

1193
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:42,150
something like that.
And they had a pool in the backyard that

1194
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:44,250
was just sitting there with Gerald Gamma
Green.

1195
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:50,700
There was schools of mosquito larva 
swimming around like fish.

1196
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,320
I went out into the yard.
I was like,

1197
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:53,940
what the fuck is that?
And the guy was like,

1198
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:54,900
oh,
we'll take care of that.

1199
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:55,940
I go,
what is that?

1200
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,680
That's you poisoned.
She's just pour bleach into it.

1201
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:01,514
Yeah.
Well the first thing you do is you 

1202
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:03,750
bleach it.
Then you've got to drain it.

1203
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,670
You gotta you gotTa,
take all this Goop,

1204
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:06,740
all that shit out.
Yeah.

1205
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,583
You got to drain all that water out.
They had to bring it like a machine and 

1206
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:14,040
then they had a clean all the fucking 
the bottom of the pool.

1207
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:14,874
It was all green and funky.
But the crazy thing is they were moving 

1208
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:19,560
through the water,
like,

1209
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,573
you know,
I see those,

1210
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,520
those big flocks of birds and they all 
move together.

1211
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,150
They were doing that in the water.
There was fucking thousands of them.

1212
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:29,170
It was crazy.
But then they didn't grow legs.

1213
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,313
It would have been a real problem.
It would have been a real problem that 

1214
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:33,910
got out and started flying around.
I would have got fucked.

1215
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,890
Yup.
There's a meme out there and it's,

1216
00:54:36,891 --> 00:54:39,320
I think it's a,
it's a picture,

1217
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
um,
and it's repeated in,

1218
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:42,890
in,
on the bottom as well.

1219
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:47,360
Have a pita billboard and it's got a,
you know,

1220
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,270
these animals all sitting and standing 
in a line and it says,

1221
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:53,420
where do you draw the line between food 
and friends or whatever.

1222
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,793
And then someone else has and they've 
got the same thing down there and it's 

1223
00:54:57,051 --> 00:54:58,680
like a,
you know,

1224
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:03,200
this is normal food.
There's a catastrophic event apocalypse.

1225
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,570
I've seen that,
I've seen that.

1226
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,710
Yeah.
Well,

1227
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:10,500
you know,
being a vegetarian or Vegan is a very.

1228
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:11,423
It's a very first world option.
The reason why people got to this point 

1229
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,293
is because we figured out a way to 
survive eating all the animals around 

1230
00:55:18,871 --> 00:55:19,704
us,
just like they figured out a way to 

1231
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:23,610
survive eating the animals around.
Well I need the argument that Oh,

1232
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,400
well this culture is mostly vegetarian 
revere this or that.

1233
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:27,001
And it's like,
okay,

1234
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:31,470
well it's also highly developed based on
what was available.

1235
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,470
I didn't just say I don't want to hurt 
the animals.

1236
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,210
Well the only people that did is the 
Hindu.

1237
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,360
Hindus are fascinating,
you know,

1238
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:42,540
and there's a lot of speculation as to 
wash the agriculture civilization.

1239
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,393
Yeah.
At certain points in time in comparison 

1240
00:55:44,881 --> 00:55:46,240
to the rest of the world.
Oh yeah.

1241
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:48,480
I mean you go back and read the Bhagavad
Gita.

1242
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,313
I mean they had some really complex 
philosophy and really interesting 

1243
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:54,354
thoughts about the universe.
But a lot of people believe that that 

1244
00:55:56,581 --> 00:55:59,380
was due to psychedelic drugs and one of 
the,

1245
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,693
one of the reasons why they believed 
they had this interesting relationship 

1246
00:56:03,091 --> 00:56:03,924
with cattle but not with lamb was 
because cattle shit would grow magic 

1247
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:13,080
mushrooms on it.
This is because so much is a big part of

1248
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:17,940
the ancient Hindu folklore and their 
religion and their ancient texts,

1249
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:18,774
they talk about Soma and Soma was some 
sort of a psychedelic mixture and they 

1250
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:27,070
don't know exactly what it was,
but they know that Hindus,

1251
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:28,693
the,
um,

1252
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,613
like a lot of the ancient Hindu text,
they deal with some sacraments and they 

1253
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:38,680
know that they were into hash.
And like a lot of the Yogis,

1254
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:40,300
Assad dues,
they're into chillums.

1255
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:44,140
They smoke chillums of Hash.
So they knew they were in the hash,

1256
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,560
but they think that their aversion to 
eating cows may have had something to do

1257
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:53,170
with the fact that these cows would 
shit.

1258
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,003
And then the mushrooms grow other shit.
And then they would eat these mushrooms 

1259
00:56:56,051 --> 00:56:58,510
and have these profound experiences.
And so that these,

1260
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,030
they thought of these cows as conduits 
to God.

1261
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,660
Right?
But then there's also the probably drank

1262
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:05,860
the milk,
you know,

1263
00:57:05,861 --> 00:57:10,030
they probably used them to plow the 
fields to grow their food.

1264
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,200
So it's,
it's real.

1265
00:57:11,201 --> 00:57:14,710
It's interesting because when a,
when a culture has an aversion to eating

1266
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,593
a very specific animal and that specific
animal also is the main source of 

1267
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:23,020
psychedelic mushrooms to,
to ignore that connection seems a little

1268
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:23,840
bit weird.
No,

1269
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,673
I don't think it's arbitrary.
I think it's something that would be 

1270
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:28,870
worth investigating,
right?

1271
00:57:28,871 --> 00:57:30,270
I mean,
why not?

1272
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,820
Worst case scenario come down to you 
have to figure out if something else.

1273
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:36,250
But we'll look at Shiva like,
right.

1274
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,430
You see that picture of Shiva?
The Shiva has his arms,

1275
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,160
six arms and Shiva standing on like a 
little.

1276
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:44,230
It looks like a baby.
And I always,

1277
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:47,020
I am like,
I have a giant bronze Shiva in my house.

1278
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,480
And when I bought it,
the lady said,

1279
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,530
uh,
this,

1280
00:57:50,531 --> 00:57:53,260
uh,
Shiva is standing on ignorance.

1281
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,670
This is what it's supposed to be.
I go,

1282
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,840
I thought ignorance would be way bigger 
than that.

1283
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:01,210
It felt like an ignorance will be like a
dragon.

1284
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,670
That Shiva was like fighting.
It was much larger than him,

1285
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,420
but when you that that thing that she 
was doing,

1286
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,180
that's what happens when you trip your 
balls off.

1287
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,043
Okay.
If you trip balls and you were started 

1288
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,200
moving your arms around,
I would think Josh,

1289
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:17,140
partner,
it's got six on that.

1290
00:58:17,141 --> 00:58:21,880
I mean there's so much of ancient Hindu 
artwork that is a.

1291
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,830
I thought they were just fan in a bad 
fart.

1292
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,960
Could be that.
Could it be that Jesus.

1293
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:27,710
That's what we'll all have a fire around
it.

1294
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,350
Maybe that's what it is.
They're lightened matches,

1295
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,710
but the like ancient Hindu art.
There's.

1296
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:37,210
There's this a iconography.
There's like these iconic imagery,

1297
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,900
this iconic imagery that you see when 
you do psychedelics.

1298
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:41,734
You see a lot of this stuff,
particularly on mushrooms for some 

1299
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:44,614
reason.
You'll see like ancient Hindu and 

1300
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,870
sometimes ancient Egyptian shit too.
I know.

1301
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,580
You know,
you can see.

1302
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:55,970
You'll see a geometric shapes appear out
of and you know,

1303
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,823
to me I'm just like,
well that's just what you see when 

1304
00:58:58,061 --> 00:58:59,800
you're poisoned,
but it's a great.

1305
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,270
It's an interesting way of looking at 
it,

1306
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,360
but it's not poison.
That's the thing about it.

1307
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,233
It's the way it's affecting the way your
visual processing perturbance of your 

1308
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:09,970
visual cortex.
Yeah,

1309
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:12,010
but it's not poisoned.
That's the crazy thing.

1310
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:12,844
It's like the ld 50 of mushrooms.
It's almost impossible to eat yourself 

1311
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:16,384
to death.
Like you'd have to eat your own body 

1312
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:20,380
weight,
like you would get way too stuff.

1313
00:59:20,381 --> 00:59:22,370
Put them inside those fucking 
croissants.

1314
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,920
So Catholic the songs,
now you're talking,

1315
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,460
it might be the move.
So somebody with monster,

1316
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,220
that's a term that has continued to go 
throughout a.

1317
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:33,860
yeah,
it's like a sleeping pill now.

1318
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,053
And then it was also a major element 
within all this Huxley's brave new 

1319
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:39,420
world,
which uh,

1320
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,750
I am.
That was based on that I probably.

1321
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:46,700
So I'm firmly of the belief that what 
we're living in is not a Orwellian,

1322
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:51,580
a potential desktop dystopic future.
We're living in a Huxley version because

1323
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:55,400
Huxley and Orwell was sought from two 
different ways and in orwell was more of

1324
00:59:55,401 --> 00:59:59,110
the,
there would be force and violence and,

1325
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:04,190
and direct suppression of individuals 
and groups and retrain.

1326
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,260
Now there is thought policing and,
and you know,

1327
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,380
even though they call them equity,
diversity,

1328
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:14,480
whatever departments.
I mean,

1329
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:17,630
there are people that are there to,
you know,

1330
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:18,464
they have these cabals that,
that try to force everybody to be in 

1331
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:21,790
line,
but it's,

1332
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:22,623
you know,
they're not necessarily gassing folks 

1333
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:26,450
are beating on them or what have your 
shock therapy.

1334
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:28,243
However,
Huxley's version of how this would all 

1335
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:32,354
go badly was that everybody would be so 
comfortable that there would be so much 

1336
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:41,681
luxury and pleasure and that you would 
just not fight back.

1337
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,273
Yeah.
Anything that they would try to impart 

1338
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,020
upon you though,
the way they would get you to do is just

1339
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,970
make your life even softer and even 
easier.

1340
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,530
Yeah.
Huxley was right in that regard.

1341
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:52,364
And also all there's so little danger in
the world and so little real drama that 

1342
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:00,020
we look for drama.
Of course,

1343
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:00,854
we look forward to all over the place 
we've made the world's going on most of 

1344
01:01:03,981 --> 01:01:04,910
the world.
Very,

1345
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,380
very safe,
especially for,

1346
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:08,960
at least for us in Western first world 
nations.

1347
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,120
There's something that Dave Rubin 
tweeted today,

1348
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:12,640
see if you could find this.
Um,

1349
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:17,770
it's real reason that I don't think so.
Now the mayor of Durham,

1350
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,273
uh,
apparently said something about Jordan 

1351
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,143
Peterson,
that Jordan Peterson is not welcome in 

1352
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:25,994
Durham,
North Carolina because of his 

1353
01:01:28,491 --> 01:01:31,370
transphobic and racist views.
What?

1354
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:32,090
Yeah.
What?

1355
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,230
Let's see.
I can't read.

1356
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:37,730
That man can make that a little larger.
What a fucking misrepresented person.

1357
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:39,950
Jordan Peterson has become just.
Well,

1358
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,993
it's got to be very strange.
We believe that Durham is a place for 

1359
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:45,080
all of us.
Black,

1360
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:45,914
white,
Asian,

1361
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,120
Latin X.
Oh,

1362
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:49,940
I like how you went latinex instead of 
Latino,

1363
01:01:49,941 --> 01:01:52,670
because if you say a lot to next,
it's like Latina,

1364
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:54,860
Latino.
You get all the other Latino's.

1365
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,300
Yeah.
I'm not taking any chances.

1366
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:00,470
Indigenous and mixed race,
Trans and CIS sisters in the real word.

1367
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,850
You're getting crazy.
Mayor.

1368
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,000
Gay and lesbian.
Queer and straight scissor thing.

1369
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,390
Queer to cover all of it anymore.

1370
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,560
I'm always confused by that.
It got very open vague term.

1371
01:02:13,561 --> 01:02:15,710
I mean,
and maybe there is a in there.

1372
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:18,130
Maybe there's some sort of accepted 
standard for what?

1373
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,040
What defines queer versus

1374
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,430
getting an asexual.
Is that all right?

1375
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:26,130
How come you didn't put that in the 
asexual people?

1376
01:02:26,131 --> 01:02:26,964
You should march out now.
They're attack the asexual activist 

1377
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:31,303
lobbies coming from those who seek to 
exclude or deny the humanity of others 

1378
01:02:34,591 --> 01:02:35,424
will find was interesting.
That's an interesting statement that 

1379
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:38,934
people like to make deny the humanity 
like who said that you who's denying 

1380
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:44,340
your humanity even even assholes,
right?

1381
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:45,870
I mean even some of this is just a 
prick.

1382
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:49,620
It's like they can't.
You just heard it and responded to it.

1383
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,690
You're living the life that you want to 
live.

1384
01:02:51,691 --> 01:02:54,720
How can they deny your humanity will 
look at this?

1385
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:55,554
We wish to emphasize that a person's 
right to free speech does not include 

1386
01:02:58,261 --> 01:03:00,900
the right to a platform or an audience.
Well,

1387
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:04,770
here's the thing.
You can't deny that people are listening

1388
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:05,604
to him and enjoy his work,
but if you're gonna make these broad 

1389
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:09,270
statements.

1390
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:12,480
You have to have some sort of evidence 
to back up what you're saying.

1391
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:16,320
I know Jordan Peterson and he's 
definitely not a racist.

1392
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,173
No,
he's definitely not transphobic or 

1393
01:03:18,601 --> 01:03:22,510
homophobic or any of those things.
He was against compelled speech.

1394
01:03:22,550 --> 01:03:25,680
Jesse compelled speech,
state compelled speech,

1395
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:26,543
meaning that there was a bunch of 
different words that they were forcing 

1396
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:34,050
people to use that where these new 
gender pronouns and they were compelling

1397
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,950
and they have human rights councils in 
Canada and he is,

1398
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:39,163
he's a mean.
He's a clinical psychologist and he's 

1399
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:46,521
very well read and he understands like 
Marxism and all the Pid postmodernism in

1400
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:48,444
neo Marxism and its evolution from 
classical Marxism and how it's been 

1401
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:52,374
influenced.
The difference between emphasizing the 

1402
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:58,050
infrastructure over the base.
Just virtue signaling in its worst form.

1403
01:03:58,051 --> 01:03:58,940
I am a,
uh,

1404
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:01,110
very,
very familiar with jps work.

1405
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:04,590
He actually sent me a copy of his book 
through twitter.

1406
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:05,483
Oh,
that's amazing.

1407
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:06,503
Which was fantastic.
But the way I came across Jordan 

1408
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:13,350
Peterson was that as a big fan of nature
and his philosophical writings,

1409
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,393
so I'd go on Youtube to see if I could 
find lectures on nature and in his maps 

1410
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:20,160
of meaning lectures.
And this was before any of the like,

1411
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:23,010
uh,
the issues with BLC 16 really.

1412
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,353
I didn't know about any of that.
I was just listening to Jordan Peterson 

1413
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:29,450
lectures because of him referencing and 
talking about Nisha,

1414
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:32,700
so and then from Nietzsche,
Dostoevsky and all this,

1415
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:33,534
and then it started talk a lot about 
Marxism and communism and postmodernism 

1416
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:42,360
in reference to each other in other ways
and then the [inaudible] stuff.

1417
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:44,190
And then I was living with a Marxist for
awhile.

1418
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,540
So I started.
Are you really?

1419
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,370
Yes.
Oh Jesus.

1420
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,630
Yeah.
It was not fun.

1421
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,493
So.
But at the same time I had to try to 

1422
01:04:50,941 --> 01:04:55,260
understand what the arguments that were 
being made and why.

1423
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,680
And so you got to go research them.
So if someone says,

1424
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,350
oh,
the wage gap,

1425
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:02,191
blah blah blah,
blah,

1426
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:03,024
blah.
And I'm like,

1427
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,223
okay,
well I guess I need to look up the 

1428
01:05:05,011 --> 01:05:07,530
research on what that is.
Then you come back and you go,

1429
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:08,813
oh well that's actually not an apples 
for apples comparison and it's not 70 

1430
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:12,543
percent on the dollar and you just go 
into it and then they just look at you 

1431
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:16,620
and they go,
no.

1432
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:17,890
It's like I,
I read,

1433
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,240
what's your source?
Well,

1434
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:20,074
this thing I read that source,
it doesn't talk about education level 

1435
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,890
job for job hours work like it does.
It doesn't.

1436
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:29,500
I mean no one's saying that things 
couldn't be better.

1437
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,480
It's just different.
Heard this argument before,

1438
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:34,300
when you hear about the wage gap,
the gender wage gap,

1439
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:38,150
it's not the people doing the same job.
That's what's this.

1440
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,063
This is the best way to them.
It's not people doing the same job and 

1441
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:41,884
it's not people working the same hours.
The reason why men make more money as 

1442
01:05:43,811 --> 01:05:44,644
they do different jobs now are those 
jobs more difficult for women to get is 

1443
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:50,710
a real question.
Some of them I imagine they are perhaps.

1444
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:51,544
I mean I never doubt that there is a 
potential sexism or any sort of ism to 

1445
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:58,470
some degree in some sexism coming from 
both sides of the tracks.

1446
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,213
How many women want to be working on a 
fucking oil rig out in the middle of or 

1447
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:07,550
doing pipelines up in a frozen south,
North Dakota or something,

1448
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:08,384
and they did,
and how many of them are physically 

1449
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:14,230
capable of doing the work to which isn't
a woman's fault at all and you can't.

1450
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:16,360
I wouldn't hold it against anybody or.
And if they didn't,

1451
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,253
if they did,
did not want to choose to do that kind 

1452
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:19,924
of employment.

1453
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:21,750
There's nothing wrong with that either.
No.

1454
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,983
You know,
if a woman wanted to go off and make 

1455
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:25,900
artisans soap,
right?

1456
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,393
That motherfucker could make the best 
soap with essential oils that are the 

1457
01:06:30,761 --> 01:06:32,080
best for like,
you know,

1458
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:32,914
like how you use the fence soap stuff.
Like if that was a woman that came and 

1459
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:37,420
created all of that,
that's a valuable,

1460
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:38,703
respectable,
fantastic thing that they just didn't 

1461
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,030
require physical strength anyway.
Don't,

1462
01:06:43,031 --> 01:06:46,150
don't diminish the compliments of 
someone else just because it doesn't fit

1463
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:47,550
what you think is.
Well,

1464
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,393
the problem is when we get into teams,
man mean toxic tribalism is the real 

1465
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:52,204
problem.
The real problem is people getting 

1466
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,630
teams,
whether it's male versus female and this

1467
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,493
mayor of Durham Guarantee,
well it's a lot of this stuff is 

1468
01:06:59,321 --> 01:07:00,154
weaponized.
So most of the stuff about the 

1469
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:03,124
patriarchy,
which I'm also in ingredients with 

1470
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:06,390
Jordan Peterson,
you know,

1471
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,900
that doesn't exist.

1472
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,470
That's not the way that human history 
has has rolled out.

1473
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,830
I don't buy that at all.
Not to end or the wage cap.

1474
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:18,070
These are weaponized things.
They use them in a weaponized way to try

1475
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:18,904
and destroy your,
your argument or your position or your 

1476
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,210
way of being.
It's a weaponized administrator point of

1477
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:27,640
view by saying it's what's your white 
privilege talking?

1478
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,480
Sometimes I get a lot of white privilege
today.

1479
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,240
I'm so white,
a big white,

1480
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:32,763
very,
very white with a red beard from the 

1481
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:37,210
Pacific northwest.
How much?

1482
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:40,540
How much can you get any white?
But if I get any wider,

1483
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:43,960
I'm going to be wearing a fucking 
birkenstocks with socks on.

1484
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:48,980
You should have a tail and a man bun is 
a bowl,

1485
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:50,890
a ponytail.
But,

1486
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:52,530
uh,
it's,

1487
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:53,050
it's,
uh,

1488
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,900
these are,
these terms are used in,

1489
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,620
in,
in conflict.

1490
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,310
Well,
and when,

1491
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:59,250
why wouldn't they be?
Because most of the,

1492
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,970
the source material,
the creation of the,

1493
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:05,860
these sort of ideological viewpoints are
from postmodernist,

1494
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:06,611
neo,
Marxism,

1495
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:09,160
and it's all based on the concept of 
conflict theory.

1496
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:11,890
So there's always going to be an 
oppressor and oppressed.

1497
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:14,410
So if what you are doing is,
uh,

1498
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,070
is trying to

1499
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,660
argue with or even just make your case 
to someone who's an oppressor,

1500
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,180
well it would be weaponized because as 
far as you're concerned,

1501
01:08:23,181 --> 01:08:24,950
everything they do is weaponized against
you.

1502
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:25,853
Right?
So you've already chosen a 

1503
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,690
confrontational position.

1504
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:32,350
There's also a problem with people 
wanting to be.

1505
01:08:32,351 --> 01:08:34,870
Right.
That's human nature.

1506
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:35,733
But I also like,
whether it's someone who's a 

1507
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,320
postmodernist or someone who is a 
staunch conservative,

1508
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:46,620
people go into any discussion with a 
presuppose or they have a preordained or

1509
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,333
are they have a collected group of ideas
that they have attached themselves to 

1510
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,370
and they do not want to let those go.
No,

1511
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,283
and you have yours and I have mine.
It's very difficult for people to just 

1512
01:08:58,481 --> 01:08:59,314
talk and very difficult for people to 
just someone to lay out their their 

1513
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:04,023
position and someone else to lay out 
their position and to people to like 

1514
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:10,210
cordially discuss the merits of each 
position with an open mind.

1515
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,283
It happens so rarely and it's something 
I try so hard to do and it's something 

1516
01:09:16,421 --> 01:09:21,421
that it took me years to cultivate the 
mindset to not,

1517
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:26,260
not have these preexisting conditions,
preexisting ideas or if I do have them,

1518
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:30,430
don't attach myself to them and be ready
to abandon them at any moment.

1519
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:32,530
Like under the,
under new evidence.

1520
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:33,650
Sure.
And it's,

1521
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,660
there's no problem in saying,
okay,

1522
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:40,661
well I believe a new believer B and we 
both believed them to be correct.

1523
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,690
Well,
tell me why I am,

1524
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:49,340
why a is incorrect or better yet.
Tell me why you believe what you believe

1525
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:51,320
and you know,
let me get into some reason.

1526
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:55,400
What are the facts and let's find if 
those facts are real.

1527
01:09:55,401 --> 01:09:56,960
It's right.
And I used to,

1528
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,303
you know,
I'd have these conversations with this 

1529
01:10:00,411 --> 01:10:04,460
person used to that I was living with.
I would say like,

1530
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:05,570
well,
you just always have to be right.

1531
01:10:05,571 --> 01:10:05,871
I go,
no,

1532
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:06,560
no,
no,

1533
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,160
I don't have to be right,
but if you're going to make a claim,

1534
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:11,690
you're going to have to defend your 
argument and I'll defend mind,

1535
01:10:11,691 --> 01:10:12,524
but ultimately I don't care if I'm wrong
because being wrong only means that I 

1536
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:18,530
could then perhaps work towards a way of
being,

1537
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,660
the having the most understanding that I
can have.

1538
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:24,530
We as human beings are wrong so much 
more than we're ever right,

1539
01:10:24,531 --> 01:10:26,570
but by being wrong,
but by making mistakes,

1540
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:31,190
it's like a through martial arts by 
being on the mats and you know,

1541
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,133
God,
I'm going to get this guy's ankle right 

1542
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:33,621
now.
Oh,

1543
01:10:33,621 --> 01:10:35,600
fuck that up.
I fucked that up.

1544
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,580
I got caught up.
Fuck that up.

1545
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,890
You can't get to the point to where 
you're like,

1546
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,840
oh,
this is how you set it up.

1547
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,793
This is the way that you can.
I wasn't securing the knee well enough 

1548
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:46,730
so it was always sliding out of position
and I couldn't,

1549
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:47,863
you know,
keep the leg framed in such a position 

1550
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:52,340
where when I applied my hold,
the pressure went through the joint that

1551
01:10:52,341 --> 01:10:53,920
I needed it to.
Nothing.

1552
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,960
None of that happens until you make 
mistake after mistake,

1553
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:59,460
after mistake after mistake,
and there's nothing wrong with,

1554
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:00,303
with before making a move,
moving forward on something to sit back 

1555
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,840
and to study a little bit and to try and
understand somewhat of the landscape,

1556
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:10,850
but eventually the only thing you could 
do is you just got to go,

1557
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,631
right.
You know,

1558
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:14,190
analysis paralysis through analysis 
isn't gonna help you either.

1559
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:15,723
Well,
I lived a good portion of my life 

1560
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,880
wanting to be right always.
Sure,

1561
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:22,600
and it's a toxic mindset.
It's terrible for you.

1562
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:25,990
It's terrible for you because you don't 
grow and then you have to live in denial

1563
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:26,973
and then you have to always tell 
yourself that you were right and they 

1564
01:11:28,601 --> 01:11:29,434
were wrong.
Even if you get out debated or even if 

1565
01:11:32,171 --> 01:11:34,030
you're faced with new evidence,
you,

1566
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:36,970
you try to ignore that new evidence.
I know the mindset,

1567
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,290
I,
I lived in it for many,

1568
01:11:38,291 --> 01:11:39,124
many good to be in.
It's an easy place to normal and it's 

1569
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,860
hard to.
It's hard to relax yourself.

1570
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:49,120
Just realize that you are not facts.
You are not your ideas,

1571
01:11:49,121 --> 01:11:50,530
your not your opinions,
your,

1572
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:51,403
your you,
and if you attach yourself to these 

1573
01:11:53,111 --> 01:11:55,570
opinions,
these ideas like you're going to,

1574
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:58,090
it's a fucking trap.
Like you have to know what,

1575
01:11:58,091 --> 01:12:00,010
like here's,
here's something I know for a fact,

1576
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:02,470
this wood is hard,
but I've hit this,

1577
01:12:02,471 --> 01:12:03,460
would meet with my knuckles.

1578
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,230
That shit's hard.
If it dropped on you,

1579
01:12:05,231 --> 01:12:08,420
it would hurt.
These are undeniable facts and the.

1580
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:11,170
There's a gang of those that you have in
the world.

1581
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:12,980
There's a gang of undeniable facts.
What I cut down.

1582
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,740
Objectivity.
Yeah.

1583
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,023
Whether or not Marxism can be 
successfully implemented in the large 

1584
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:21,040
scale with a,
a sensitive,

1585
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:24,340
compassionate group of human beings that
all live together.

1586
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:27,250
Who Kenneth,
I don't know.

1587
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:28,560
Doesn't seem to be.
Yeah.

1588
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:29,560
Well,
I don't know though.

1589
01:12:29,561 --> 01:12:30,760
See what I'm saying?
Like this is a,

1590
01:12:30,761 --> 01:12:33,000
this is a comp.
It hasn't been done before.

1591
01:12:33,001 --> 01:12:35,440
A socialism never really worked,
but can it work?

1592
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:36,483
Did the argument that it can't work.
It seems to me that doesn't make any 

1593
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:40,654
sense either.
Like maybe you could work well the 

1594
01:12:42,371 --> 01:12:45,520
argument that it could work is that but,
but see what I'm saying like these are.

1595
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,300
These are like really to think about 
Rod.

1596
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:52,450
Yeah.
Complex nuanced concepts that need to be

1597
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,313
discussed up and down and back and forth
and you also need to look at the weight 

1598
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,070
of human history,
the myriad times it's failed,

1599
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:00,953
right?
And in human history and even in ways 

1600
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:03,864
that,
which is not directly related to say 

1601
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:05,514
Marxism,
but just to look at patterns and trends 

1602
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:12,240
and ways of people of operating and to 
see how okay,

1603
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:13,074
well given a different circumstance,
how would that process work within this 

1604
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:20,010
one or this one or this one or this one.
And then even if you wanted to say,

1605
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,230
well,
if you're like,

1606
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,064
well I don't think Marxism would work 
well you can't say that until you 

1607
01:13:26,071 --> 01:13:28,800
actually study what Marxism is and what 
its principles are.

1608
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:31,320
Because if you don't understand the 
argument,

1609
01:13:31,321 --> 01:13:32,670
and this is like,
you know John,

1610
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:33,563
John Stuart Mill,
you can't just defend your side without 

1611
01:13:37,051 --> 01:13:38,480
knowledge of the other.
Yes.

1612
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:39,383
You have really no opposition to.
Your position isn't any better than 

1613
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:41,990
theirs.

1614
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:43,190
Yeah,
that's a really good point.

1615
01:13:43,191 --> 01:13:44,024
I mean,
I think everybody should do that no 

1616
01:13:44,871 --> 01:13:47,690
matter what you're looking at,
like whatever you're trying to defend,

1617
01:13:47,691 --> 01:13:48,524
look at even even if it's something 
horrible and it's like a racist 

1618
01:13:51,531 --> 01:13:53,510
position,
find out why these people support

1619
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:54,810
so they believe it.
Right?

1620
01:13:54,811 --> 01:13:55,644
And so what?
Why do they believe this racist 

1621
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:57,564
position?
What is it about them that they think 

1622
01:13:58,741 --> 01:14:02,250
gives it validity and you can look at it
and go,

1623
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:05,070
I could see where they could take this 
way too.

1624
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:07,650
It's extreme in that that,
I mean that's nonsensical,

1625
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:09,780
but you see where it started or you can 
see like that.

1626
01:14:09,781 --> 01:14:10,614
That's everything about this is,
is clearly driven by something else and 

1627
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:15,640
not the not what they claim so

1628
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,130
well,
it's also the,

1629
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:18,263
one of the things about society,
so we really have to take into 

1630
01:14:19,861 --> 01:14:21,750
consideration is the momentum of the 
past.

1631
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:22,853
Like there's this country has a unique 
freedom to it because it was literally 

1632
01:14:27,961 --> 01:14:28,794
created by people who decided to get on 
a boat and risk traveling across the 

1633
01:14:32,881 --> 01:14:34,440
ocean to some new land.
Yes,

1634
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,393
it's a country filled with savages like 
crazy people that took wild chances and 

1635
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:40,203
did wild things because of it.
And if you look at the history of this 

1636
01:14:42,601 --> 01:14:45,720
country that's clearly established by 
look at the art,

1637
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,380
look at the music,
look at the things that have come out,

1638
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,233
the comedy,
all of these things that have been 

1639
01:14:49,921 --> 01:14:51,060
created,
the cars,

1640
01:14:51,061 --> 01:14:55,430
all the different things that have come 
out of this one place and this one place

1641
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,273
just happens to be the most recent place
with the least amount of historical 

1642
01:14:59,971 --> 01:15:00,870
baggage.
Yes.

1643
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:03,780
But then you look at the places that 
have the most amount of historic baggage

1644
01:15:03,781 --> 01:15:04,614
like Africa or you know,
some parts of Russia and these are 

1645
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:11,550
places where they have the hardest time 
breaking out of these,

1646
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,430
the weight of the cultural momentum of 
the past.

1647
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:15,321
You know,
it's,

1648
01:15:15,321 --> 01:15:16,154
it's very difficult for people to,
to radically change and established 

1649
01:15:20,131 --> 01:15:22,500
system that has existed for a thousand 
years.

1650
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:23,423
Well that's true,
and if you were to say think about 

1651
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:31,730
communism and the Soviet states in the 
length of what constitutes human history

1652
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,360
is has only been gone for.
It was only,

1653
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:37,830
it was around for a short time and it's 
only been gone for an even shorter time.

1654
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,273
Like come on and it's gone,
but it's still a dictatorship over 

1655
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:43,880
there.
Yeah,

1656
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:47,240
I guess they're trying to that Russia to
cheer about that lady in Iran.

1657
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:51,590
That's she's going to jail that.
Dancing and dancing?

1658
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,700
Yeah.
Oh no,

1659
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,200
the Egyptian girl.
The girl,

1660
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:57,290
the Lebanese girls going to jail for 
she.

1661
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,040
She made a youtube video about getting 
sexually harassed in Egypt.

1662
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:04,250
So they sentenced her to eight years in 
prison.

1663
01:16:04,251 --> 01:16:07,760
She's 22 years old.
Holy Fuck it terrifying.

1664
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:10,090
She's a young 22,
24,

1665
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:10,933
something like that.
She's young and they sentenced her to 

1666
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,140
eight fucking years that the people here

1667
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:18,840
in America or western the Western 
civilization at large.

1668
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:19,703
Just fucking.
They just put on the blinders about 

1669
01:16:22,561 --> 01:16:24,210
stuff like that.
It's like there are places,

1670
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:27,750
and I'm not going to demonize these 
places either,

1671
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,840
but at the same time you as a 22 year 
old could have a complaint and say,

1672
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:35,180
Hey,
I am like,

1673
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,010
you know,
this thing happened and I'm,

1674
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:39,390
this is fucked up,
and all of a sudden they can go,

1675
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:41,040
Huh,
you think that was fucked up,

1676
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:44,100
boom and throw your ass in jail or have 
you executed or whatever.

1677
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:45,450
I mean,
it's like,

1678
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:46,373
okay,
well I guess I don't have the right to 

1679
01:16:47,671 --> 01:16:49,950
express myself.
Whereas you know,

1680
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:53,820
people will show up and bang on doors 
and do all kinds of crazy shit.

1681
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:54,683
When Jordan Peterson comes and does a 
talk and the thing is they're allowed 

1682
01:16:59,161 --> 01:16:59,994
to.
They're allowed to protest what he has 

1683
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:01,614
to say,
counter protests if they want or to 

1684
01:17:03,841 --> 01:17:08,000
express their unhappiness with things 
political and things,

1685
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:09,143
media way.
Anybody can say what they want in terms 

1686
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:16,061
of what makes them unhappy without fear 
of the government silencing you.

1687
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:19,160
Right.
That's a major thing.

1688
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:21,930
It's a major thing and this poor girl in
Iran,

1689
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,823
she's just dancing.
I know people that are always rail 

1690
01:17:24,601 --> 01:17:25,434
against Islam or Islamophobia.
There's so much Islamophobia in this 

1691
01:17:28,711 --> 01:17:29,940
world.
Yeah,

1692
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,380
sure there is.
You're right,

1693
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:32,940
there is.
But you know what else there is,

1694
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:33,893
there's also radical Islam and radical 
Islamic governments that are putting 

1695
01:17:37,381 --> 01:17:39,720
women in jail because they fucking damn 
religious.

1696
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:42,390
And that's happening right now.
It's just resist religious zealots

1697
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:44,040
training.
And while I have,

1698
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:44,903
you know,
people will often get into a 

1699
01:17:46,171 --> 01:17:47,460
conversation about this and they'll 
bring up,

1700
01:17:47,461 --> 01:17:48,900
well what about the Crusades or what 
about this?

1701
01:17:48,901 --> 01:17:49,050
Like,
go,

1702
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:51,240
hold on.
These are all relevant things to.

1703
01:17:51,241 --> 01:17:54,540
And while the Crusades are not nearly as
cut and dry as you think they are,

1704
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,150
in fact,
which two it ended in the fourth crusade

1705
01:17:57,151 --> 01:17:59,190
to two groups went down there,
uh,

1706
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:02,590
and then end up fighting each other.
It's like you're both Christians.

1707
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,810
Yeah,
what the fuck are you thinking?

1708
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,210
But then you had things like the 
inquisition you have,

1709
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:08,220
you've had all kinds of stuff.
And it's like,

1710
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:09,600
yeah,
no,

1711
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:10,160
you,
you,

1712
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,270
you just,
that doesn't erase this.

1713
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,460
And that doesn't,
they don't balance each other out.

1714
01:18:14,461 --> 01:18:15,460
It's just,
it's just.

1715
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,880
And it's because it's one religion and 
not the other.

1716
01:18:18,881 --> 01:18:19,930
It doesn't make,
it's the,

1717
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:21,910
the,
the motivations are the same,

1718
01:18:21,911 --> 01:18:24,060
that kind of comes,
it comes from the same concept.

1719
01:18:24,061 --> 01:18:26,160
Even if it's not technically the same 
religion.

1720
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:28,000
Well,
it reinforces it in my opinion.

1721
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:28,834
I mean the idea that it's not the idea 
that Christianity is so amazing and 

1722
01:18:31,721 --> 01:18:32,554
Islam is so bad.
It's that ideologies force people into 

1723
01:18:35,501 --> 01:18:37,180
very terrible behavior.
They can,

1724
01:18:37,181 --> 01:18:38,410
they can very,
very much.

1725
01:18:38,411 --> 01:18:40,090
And they often do.
Yeah.

1726
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:40,983
I mean,
most of the time it goes bad when you 

1727
01:18:42,731 --> 01:18:46,070
have a powerful,
potent ideology that dominating

1728
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:47,670
well imagine,
okay,

1729
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,533
you had a Christian zealotry and let's 
say Islam and Christianity had swapped 

1730
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:55,253
and Islam had all kinds of reformations 
and different sex break off from it and 

1731
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:01,680
all this and it become more like 
Christianity is in this modern era.

1732
01:19:01,681 --> 01:19:02,514
But Christianity stayed in a more,
a less developed sense and had a more 

1733
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:07,643
rigorous fervin zealotry in terms of 
adherence to doctrines or at least or 

1734
01:19:11,701 --> 01:19:14,160
even a,
um,

1735
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,740
interpretations of doctrines and certain
ways to estimate stocks.

1736
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,593
So,
but within this context of the modern 

1737
01:19:19,951 --> 01:19:21,360
era.
So now you have the Internet.

1738
01:19:21,361 --> 01:19:23,520
So any,
let's say,

1739
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,473
you know,
you only got like a million people in 

1740
01:19:27,331 --> 01:19:28,164
the world that feel this way,
but these million can all connect with 

1741
01:19:29,971 --> 01:19:32,610
each other via social media,
very different electronic ways.

1742
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:33,683
Um,
they can create a weapon where they can 

1743
01:19:36,691 --> 01:19:39,240
weaponize things much easier.
They can coordinate,

1744
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:39,600
they can.

1745
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,433
It's not like the Crusades where you had
to get money from a king and other Gulf 

1746
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:49,230
other monarchs get together.
All these troops get together,

1747
01:19:49,231 --> 01:19:50,064
all these supplies,
marched them all down into the Middle 

1748
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:54,263
East to where you've got the Turks 
waiting for you that they've done the 

1749
01:19:56,101 --> 01:19:56,934
same thing.
And then you guys all meet up on these 

1750
01:19:57,991 --> 01:19:59,560
different points of battle.
The,

1751
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,820
you could literally be at war all over 
the world,

1752
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,650
all day,
every day,

1753
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:09,750
all at the same time because of the 
modern advances of technology.

1754
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:10,703
And not to mention you have firearms,
you have explosive and chemicals and 

1755
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:16,800
things that you can use to your 
disposal.

1756
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,870
It just,
or a truck,

1757
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,550
right?
You didn't have,

1758
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:25,530
you know,
six ton trucks and drive into a crowd.

1759
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:29,310
That's just technology.
It's,

1760
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:30,121
it,
it helps,

1761
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:30,954
it makes our lives better.
But in other ways it can also create 

1762
01:20:34,021 --> 01:20:36,450
calamity for us and it's really their 
tools.

1763
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,740
You know,
social media is a tool.

1764
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:41,910
I think the social media is,
if you were to track mass,

1765
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:46,830
the mass shootings that have happened,
the rise of social media and the rise of

1766
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:48,600
mass shootings would,
would be on a parallel.

1767
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:49,763
I really think that it's social media 
that's increasing the amount that you 

1768
01:20:52,621 --> 01:20:54,270
see with the school shooting and things 
like that.

1769
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:55,800
I think that because they get fame from 
it,

1770
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,083
they get fame or you're able to 
antagonize someone and they can't get 

1771
01:21:00,361 --> 01:21:03,560
away from you much more easily.
The,

1772
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:06,990
the resulting mount using a Nietzschean 
term in terms of,

1773
01:21:06,991 --> 01:21:07,824
uh,
you know,

1774
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:08,913
the resentment,
the resentfulness from seeing other 

1775
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:13,830
people having what you think you deserve
or,

1776
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,903
or doing,
thinking that they somehow are having 

1777
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,600
more of what you think you want that as 
well.

1778
01:21:21,601 --> 01:21:23,100
Why do they get to have it?
And I don't,

1779
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:27,900
or any number of reasons why you can be 
incredibly potently resentful.

1780
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,273
And now you have this thing that's just 
in your life pumping all this kind of 

1781
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:36,420
stuff that you all the time.
And I think that it can affect people in

1782
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:37,254
some really pathologically bad ways and 
now you have technology to also enact 

1783
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:44,550
it.
And if it's not in the end,

1784
01:21:44,551 --> 01:21:47,220
you can also easily make the argument if
it's not a firearm,

1785
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:48,290
it could be something else.
And,

1786
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:52,410
and that's doesn't make it any better.
But I think that the,

1787
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,250
the rise of social media has been,
is,

1788
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,113
is a direct,
a correlator are directly responsible 

1789
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:01,794
for the rise in these school shootings 
and directly responsible or directly 

1790
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:06,323
correlates to it.
I think that there's a correlation 

1791
01:22:07,651 --> 01:22:10,050
there.
I think certainly there's a lot going on

1792
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:12,600
in society.
I think the big factor,

1793
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,820
well there's a lot of factors.
People are alienated,

1794
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,580
yes,
there's terrible child rearing.

1795
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:21,120
People have mental health issues,
people are medicated.

1796
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:23,730
There's the big one is now imagine all 
that with the,

1797
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:25,073
the technology of social media able to 
heighten some of the effects of some of 

1798
01:22:28,891 --> 01:22:33,891
these things or to create.
So someone that feels alienated.

1799
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:38,790
Imagine now not only do you feel 
alienated in the real world,

1800
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:42,030
but then when you're on social media you
want.

1801
01:22:42,031 --> 01:22:43,250
It's not a real,
you know,

1802
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:45,150
it's your body knows it's not the real 
world,

1803
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:48,420
but you could be alienated out there too
and that which alienates you there could

1804
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:52,060
still penetrate and get to you while 
you're out,

1805
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:54,870
what you're away from it.
If people are fucking with you at school

1806
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:56,430
or what have you,
then you're at home,

1807
01:22:56,431 --> 01:22:57,264
you're feeling alienated there and then 
this is continuing to fuck with you 

1808
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:04,170
through social media or other people are
fucking with you on social media.

1809
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:05,004
Let's say you're,
you're playing your video games and 

1810
01:23:06,131 --> 01:23:08,560
people are talking shit because you keep
getting shot and you know,

1811
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:09,394
a battlefield five or whatever and then 
all these things are just compounded 

1812
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:16,160
compounder and while no one knows,
I mean there's,

1813
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,550
I'm sure you wouldn't necessarily know 
that if I say,

1814
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:19,541
oh,
you know,

1815
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:20,374
fuck you knew or something on some video
game that this person is essentially in 

1816
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:26,830
real life being told,
fuck you everyday all day,

1817
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:29,530
feeling like the whole world thinks,
fuck you.

1818
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,310
How would you know that?
But it could be.

1819
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:37,480
Then that person snaps or that person 
has a,

1820
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:38,373
there.
They have a psychological issue that 

1821
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:40,320
they're not.

1822
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,330
I'm sure there's a bunch of factors.
There's a bunch of facts.

1823
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,030
First of all,
does the ability to kill large groups of

1824
01:23:45,031 --> 01:23:45,690
people.
Yes.

1825
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:46,890
Which is unprecedented,
right?

1826
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:47,724
The ability to use assault rifles and 
just fucking semiautomatic guns and go 

1827
01:23:51,081 --> 01:23:55,110
in and kill large groups of people.
The knowledge that if you do do that,

1828
01:23:55,111 --> 01:23:58,080
it'll make a huge splash and giant 
headlines and you'll be.

1829
01:23:58,920 --> 01:23:59,753
You'll be infamous.
The fact that a lot of these people are 

1830
01:24:01,941 --> 01:24:02,774
on disassociative,
so a lot of these people are on like 

1831
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:05,213
serious psych medications that we really
have only been studying the effects on 

1832
01:24:10,231 --> 01:24:12,000
human beings for the past couple of 
decades.

1833
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:17,030
There's not a whole lot of data on long 
term use of these Ssri for 20,

1834
01:24:17,071 --> 01:24:18,000
30,
40 years.

1835
01:24:18,001 --> 01:24:18,834
Right.
So you've got varying people's varying 

1836
01:24:20,971 --> 01:24:21,804
mental illnesses,
varying psychological pressures and 

1837
01:24:24,631 --> 01:24:28,440
stresses and lives that are just beyond 
fucked.

1838
01:24:28,441 --> 01:24:32,210
And then they have access to guns and 
they want people to hurt the way they're

1839
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:33,600
hurting.
There's a lot of them.

1840
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:34,860
There's a lot of factors going on.

1841
01:24:34,910 --> 01:24:35,391
Well,
and you know,

1842
01:24:35,391 --> 01:24:39,290
even if they illegally require the guns,
I mean they still have it.

1843
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:41,540
It doesn't matter what the,
in this case,

1844
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:43,210
what the tool is per se,
but

1845
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:44,590
well,
you know,

1846
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:46,750
I don't think we're meant to,
to understand.

1847
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:51,460
I don't think we understand,
nor are we meant to live in large groups

1848
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,860
of people where we don't know the people
around us.

1849
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:54,694
That's another thing.
I think that is a really new situation 

1850
01:24:57,911 --> 01:25:00,490
for human beings.
Don't they overlook

1851
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,560
the historical significance of the 
population growth,

1852
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:08,590
the population density that has been 
gathering as these we didn't,

1853
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,230
we get into these,
these,

1854
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:12,440
uh,
high density,

1855
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:14,510
civilized,
civilized areas like cities,

1856
01:25:14,511 --> 01:25:17,810
these big cities.
And it changes everything.

1857
01:25:17,970 --> 01:25:18,803
Yeah.
And people are less likely to know that 

1858
01:25:20,611 --> 01:25:21,444
many.
Like if you live in a town of 150 

1859
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:24,920
people,
you probably know 150 people.

1860
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:27,690
If you live in a city of 5 million 
people,

1861
01:25:27,691 --> 01:25:29,760
you probably know 10 people you know,
you know,

1862
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,280
people you work with,
you might know a couple of friends,

1863
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,223
you know,
unless you're like a really social 

1864
01:25:34,441 --> 01:25:35,220
person,
sure.

1865
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:39,360
You probably have a way more limited 
number of people that you actually know.

1866
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:43,740
Then people that have a tight knit,
small town and small community,

1867
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:46,320
but you know those people are obviously 
in your business.

1868
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,550
That's one thing.
Fucking what?

1869
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,490
I know.
Friends that live in small towns.

1870
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:51,390
Fuck man.
There's,

1871
01:25:51,391 --> 01:25:54,390
there's things that come with that too.
A lot of busy bodies.

1872
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:55,243
A lot of people looking over the fence.
I think they had the anal sex last 

1873
01:25:57,930 --> 01:25:58,763
night.
Jesus is going to punish them to that 

1874
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:03,320
next line and storing.
Come through.

1875
01:26:03,321 --> 01:26:04,154
You don't.
Fuck fucking speaking of blood fucking 

1876
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,120
let's talk about Usada.
Yeah.

1877
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:12,860
Without the loop.
Yeah.

1878
01:26:12,861 --> 01:26:13,760
We were,
um,

1879
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:14,643
we,
we started this podcast talking about 

1880
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:19,970
what we had talked about your,
your situation with Brendan Shop.

1881
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:22,910
And I had talked about your situation.
Were you,

1882
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,833
uh,
were you tested positive from a tainted 

1883
01:26:26,901 --> 01:26:30,230
supplement,
like legitimately tested positive from a

1884
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:32,180
tainted supplement?
It,

1885
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,160
you were cleared.
Uh,

1886
01:26:34,161 --> 01:26:36,920
but this whole process was a goat rope.
Yeah,

1887
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:37,783
right.
It took a long time to work out and you 

1888
01:26:40,011 --> 01:26:41,960
didn't feel fairly treated.

1889
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,580
Not In the least it,
it started one way.

1890
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:47,490
Then took a fucking curve.
What happened?

1891
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,440
Well,
so did you take a.

1892
01:26:49,441 --> 01:26:52,770
I took a supplement that had tribulus in
it.

1893
01:26:52,771 --> 01:26:53,604
That's all.
It was.

1894
01:26:54,270 --> 01:26:55,320
Just a Chinese herb.

1895
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:57,740
It's a Chinese herb that stimulates 
testosterone.

1896
01:26:57,741 --> 01:26:58,440
And by the way,

1897
01:26:58,440 --> 01:26:59,600
barely works.
Yeah,

1898
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:00,870
it's not,
it's not,

1899
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:03,420
it's not gonna turn you into superman or
anything.

1900
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,333
If you get more sleep,
it's better for your testosterone 

1901
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:09,550
production than Tribulus.
So it's just tribulus is all it was.

1902
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:14,970
And uh,
they in the supplement itself,

1903
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,033
as it turns out,
was contaminated with a sore arm called 

1904
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:22,260
Asurion.
But when I say contaminated,

1905
01:27:22,261 --> 01:27:26,880
I mean like it had such trace amounts 
that the people that did the lab testing

1906
01:27:26,881 --> 01:27:27,714
on it said,
well,

1907
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:30,330
clearly just contamination because this 
wouldn't help you.

1908
01:27:30,331 --> 01:27:31,980
This wouldn't do anything for you

1909
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,920
and those.
Let's explain how that happens.

1910
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:34,783
A lot of these places,
I know this for a fact because I am one 

1911
01:27:37,431 --> 01:27:38,264
of the owners of on it on it as a third 
party tested company where we get our 

1912
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:43,184
stuff tested by an independent party to 
make sure that there's nothing funky 

1913
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:47,534
with it,
but we've had some issues in the past 

1914
01:27:48,411 --> 01:27:51,830
with stuff being in our.
Our earliest formulations of Alpha brain

1915
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:52,664
and weren't supposed to be in there and 
what it comes from is you buy your 

1916
01:27:55,131 --> 01:27:55,964
ingredients from a company.
That company has these vats that they 

1917
01:27:58,911 --> 01:27:59,744
mix everything in and they don't 
properly cleaned the vats and if they 

1918
01:28:02,601 --> 01:28:05,030
don't properly clean the baths,
you're buying some stuff from China.

1919
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,550
Who knows what they're chucking in 
there.

1920
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:09,680
They got steroids in there,
they got this,

1921
01:28:09,681 --> 01:28:10,514
they got a lot of.
Creatine is tainted with all sorts of 

1922
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:14,480
shit.
A lot of different supplements or tank.

1923
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:18,020
And that's what you saw to thought it 
could have been at first 10 means yes,

1924
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:20,990
it happened to a Yolo Ramiro.

1925
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,460
Yes.
So this stuff is.

1926
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:25,770
Is,
is contaminated.

1927
01:28:25,771 --> 01:28:29,190
Right.
And so you sorta was was testing me.

1928
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:34,510
I had had a fight in September of 2016 
against our Lawsky and then after that I

1929
01:28:36,001 --> 01:28:36,811
was like,
Yo,

1930
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:38,410
I'm just going to take a break for 
awhile.

1931
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:39,323
I'm not fighting for,
I'm going to tour Europe and goof off 

1932
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:42,774
and whatever.
And then when I get back know I don't 

1933
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:44,993
really,
I don't know what I'm going to get back 

1934
01:28:45,631 --> 01:28:48,810
in the ring.
And they're like all right,

1935
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,190
whatever.
And we UFC,

1936
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:52,030
we told them and.
But you saw it,

1937
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:54,600
it would still come around and test and 
it's like okay fine,

1938
01:28:54,601 --> 01:28:55,040
whatever.

1939
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,680
So this is post testing positive.
This is pre.

1940
01:28:57,890 --> 01:28:58,700
Pre.
Okay.

1941
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:01,490
And so you fought our lawsky and you 
said I'm just going to chill awhile.

1942
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,040
Yeah.
And

1943
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:02,873
then one day,
well for one when I'm out there in 

1944
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:08,250
Europe and I let them know like,
Hey,

1945
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:09,084
I'm going fucking where the wind takes 
me in Europe and I don't have a 

1946
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:14,733
whereabouts to fill in because I could 
be on a train moving here and moving 

1947
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:18,234
there,
whatever.

1948
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,250
Which is your prerogative as a human 
being.

1949
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,113
And they,
they know that and yet then they go 

1950
01:29:22,951 --> 01:29:23,784
ahead and sent someone to my fucking 
house to try and test me while I'm in 

1951
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:27,020
Europe and I'm just going,
Whoa,

1952
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:27,993
okay.
Isn't there like an app where you fill 

1953
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:31,530
it as an APP?
But if I'm at work,

1954
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,670
uh,
you have,

1955
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:35,580
you can fill out where you're supposed 
to be ahead of time for the most part.

1956
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,073
So on Tuesday the 16th,
I'm going to be at this place from this 

1957
01:29:41,011 --> 01:29:42,750
time to this time and then,
and then,

1958
01:29:42,751 --> 01:29:43,800
but what is your home base?

1959
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,220
So if we don't go to these places and 
we'll just meet you at your home at some

1960
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:49,350
time or whatever.
He just decided to go to Japan.

1961
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:51,180
You have to tell them,
hey,

1962
01:29:51,181 --> 01:29:53,790
today I'm going to take a train to 
Osaka.

1963
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:54,743
Today I'm going to go to the mountains.
So you have to give them a detailed 

1964
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:59,340
itinerary every day.
Every day.

1965
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,690
Okay.
And so I'm like,

1966
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,880
Fuck Dude,
I'm just trying to be out here living,

1967
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,440
just doing whatever.
I'm not fighting,

1968
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:06,240
but you know,
when I get home,

1969
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:10,080
you test me wherever you want.
You just want to enjoy a vacation,

1970
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:11,430
just travel.
Correct.

1971
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,080
And uh,
they go,

1972
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:14,610
they send someone to my house.
I was like,

1973
01:30:14,611 --> 01:30:15,444
fuck.
All right.

1974
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:16,343
And then there are times where,
so what happens when they send someone 

1975
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:20,370
to your house but you told them you 
weren't there?

1976
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:21,870
Uh,
well for one,

1977
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:23,820
no one told the,
I don't know how,

1978
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:27,420
what mechanical elements within their 
organization,

1979
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:30,450
how that works,
but they sent someone there anyways.

1980
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:33,470
I'm not there.
That a head count.

1981
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:34,343
Does it count?
Because.

1982
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:36,360
Did you tell them that you were going to
be on the road?

1983
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:37,590
I,
we did.

1984
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:41,640
So they still counted that as you not 
being there for a test?

1985
01:30:41,641 --> 01:30:42,474
Yes.
Well that doesn't make any fucking 

1986
01:30:43,831 --> 01:30:45,060
sense.
Well,

1987
01:30:45,061 --> 01:30:47,040
it is what it is.
So uh,

1988
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,980
but wait a minute,
if they're going to give you a strike,

1989
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,020
like don't,
don't.

1990
01:30:52,021 --> 01:30:54,750
They have to follow their protocol and 
their protocols.

1991
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:56,490
You have to inform them of where you're 
going to be.

1992
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,260
Right.
So if you did that,

1993
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,300
you informed them or you're going to be.
Yes.

1994
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,163
They literally told Lewicki and the UFC,
he's not going to be home for almost a 

1995
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,930
month and he's fucking practically 
backpacking all through Europe,

1996
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:14,063
going from place to place to place,
so he's going to be real hard to get 

1997
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:19,350
ahold of.
Good time to take steroids.

1998
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:24,640
You get just fucking get back to the 
gills.

1999
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:29,130
Yeah,
you'll pass if they showed up in Europe,

2000
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:32,970
you did give them your location and you 
told them where you are if they would.

2001
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:35,370
But I was gone.
I didn't feel in any locations.

2002
01:31:35,371 --> 01:31:38,040
I just went wherever I went.
So when you went,

2003
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:40,620
wherever you went and your manager told 
you,

2004
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:41,454
saw that you were in Europe,
they still showed up at your house in 

2005
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:44,880
La.
Okay.

2006
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:46,440
Well that doesn't seem to make any 
sense.

2007
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:48,510
And.
And they give you a strike?

2008
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,190
Yes.
And so I'm like,

2009
01:31:50,191 --> 01:31:53,100
okay,
that's aggravating cowboy strike when he

2010
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:55,800
was at UFC.
So it's stuff like that,

2011
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:59,190
that map and I saw that and I'm like,
well you know what I just did.

2012
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:01,540
I can't fuck around with any of this 
stuff.

2013
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:02,374
I don't want people to use this as some 
sort of a kindling to try and start a 

2014
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:10,490
fire about me and so then I get back 
home and they're,

2015
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:11,710
you know,
test me again,

2016
01:32:11,711 --> 01:32:12,191
like,
all right,

2017
01:32:12,191 --> 01:32:12,760
fine,
whatever.

2018
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,980
And then they test me again and I'm 
like,

2019
01:32:14,981 --> 01:32:16,620
okay,
now you're,

2020
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:20,050
you may just made me late to an audition
as you just showed up out of nowhere.

2021
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:22,600
Cool.
You can do that.

2022
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,850
Like they can just show up and you,
you can't say,

2023
01:32:24,851 --> 01:32:25,684
Hey,
I have an appointment to keep their 

2024
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,290
there.
We even,

2025
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:30,124
if you're not fighting,
like say if you're running out the door 

2026
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:33,964
and you have a business appointment,
how long does it take for them to test 

2027
01:32:35,501 --> 01:32:36,850
you?
A.

2028
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:37,683
Depends on what they're doing,
whether it's blood and urine or just 

2029
01:32:39,731 --> 01:32:40,564
urine.
But with me it's always been blood in 

2030
01:32:41,651 --> 01:32:43,600
urine.
So you can't say,

2031
01:32:43,601 --> 01:32:44,434
hey,
you guys are going to have to come with 

2032
01:32:44,771 --> 01:32:46,050
me because,
uh,

2033
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,940
I got to go to this fucking audition.
You know?

2034
01:32:47,941 --> 01:32:49,060
I don't know.
I didn't try that.

2035
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:50,950
I would say that get in the car,
bitch,

2036
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,940
blah blah blah.

2037
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,190
Well,
how you gonna sit there and have someone

2038
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:55,530
draw blood.
I'm not going to you.

2039
01:32:55,531 --> 01:32:57,070
You guys are gonna have to do it when 
I'm done,

2040
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:00,340
like if you want to keep an eye on me,
come with me the whole way.

2041
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,050
I always took it as they showed up.
It's like,

2042
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:04,300
well here it goes.
That doesn't seem to make any sense.

2043
01:33:04,301 --> 01:33:09,301
If you have previous commitments and you
have to do something they shouldn't have

2044
01:33:09,491 --> 01:33:10,324
like ultimate precedent over your life.
Like they shouldn't be able to just 

2045
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:16,740
decide like showing up randomly as they 
could.

2046
01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:18,790
They could make an argument in some way 
on that.

2047
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:20,950
But if you have a life.
Well in any case.

2048
01:33:20,951 --> 01:33:23,140
So I take this test and I'm like 
alright,

2049
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,550
I'm just going to retire for now.
I got too much shit.

2050
01:33:27,551 --> 01:33:30,220
I gotta do.
I'm not fighting anytime soon.

2051
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:33,520
I've got my new Japan stuff,
I've got auditions,

2052
01:33:33,521 --> 01:33:34,870
I've got all these things.

2053
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:37,450
I'm traveling and I just,
I'm not going to fight.

2054
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:39,400
Right.
So just leave me be.

2055
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,073
And then I'm in Japan and the fucking,
the very last test I took right before 

2056
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:50,050
retiring.
Oh you're flagged.

2057
01:33:50,051 --> 01:33:52,540
I'm like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

2058
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:53,913
Really,
really all these tests over all these 

2059
01:33:57,251 --> 01:34:00,160
years.
Me being the first person to do complete

2060
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:01,053
out of competition or any competition,
random urine and blood testing when I 

2061
01:34:05,741 --> 01:34:09,700
worked with water and the Nevada state 
athletic commission when I fought Travis

2062
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:10,533
Browne,
so no one had ever done actual random 

2063
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:12,934
testing before and there was no usada 
involved in the UFC yet going through 

2064
01:34:16,181 --> 01:34:20,530
why did you do that?
It was something that the NSAC wanted to

2065
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:22,750
see done and I'm like,
fine,

2066
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:23,783
what?
I wanted to see that done because you 

2067
01:34:24,371 --> 01:34:27,730
had tested positive in the past and so I
tested positive before.

2068
01:34:27,731 --> 01:34:29,580
In the past you've taken some stuff 
right?

2069
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:32,170
I tested positive for anabolics in the 
past.

2070
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:33,910
Why?
But I mean the supplement market used to

2071
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:35,730
be way wilder than it used to be.
Well,

2072
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:40,690
and also we'll end the just fighting was
way wild lighting was way while they're.

2073
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:43,770
The supplement industry was way wilder 
back in o two.

2074
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,790
You could still buy all this shit over 
the counter.

2075
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:48,430
That bio for got reclassified the 
steroids.

2076
01:34:48,431 --> 01:34:52,250
I remember I was taking this shit called
Mag tent number 10.

2077
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:57,210
What was the name of the company that 
makes that incorporated incorporated?

2078
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:59,240
That shit.
That shit is all steroids.

2079
01:34:59,590 --> 01:35:01,490
Steroids.
It was steroids.

2080
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:03,150
I 100 percent.
I remember meg 10.

2081
01:35:03,180 --> 01:35:05,430
He came like 10 pounds in six weeks on 
that shit.

2082
01:35:05,431 --> 01:35:07,790
You just get Jack.
But that was all over the counter.

2083
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:08,653
Yeah,
it used to be able to buy a lot of 

2084
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:10,251
stuff.
And by the way,

2085
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:12,840
liver toxicity is probably off the 
charts problems.

2086
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:16,790
A lot of those things that are like 
super bad for her but so real effective.

2087
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,610
They fucking work.
This stuff worked.

2088
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:19,850
But uh,
so,

2089
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:21,620
you know,
there was a whole different era.

2090
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:24,980
And then with California,
you know,

2091
01:35:24,981 --> 01:35:26,870
I,
I had an issue with,

2092
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,793
with a contaminant,
what I believe ultimately to be a 

2093
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:30,674
contamination,
but I didn't take all the steps that I 

2094
01:35:32,451 --> 01:35:33,284
had this time.
And once that whole process was such a 

2095
01:35:36,171 --> 01:35:38,930
motherfuck like this is never gonna 
happen again.

2096
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:39,764
So every supplement lot that I took,
I would always keep bits of it behind 

2097
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,280
for,
until I knew I could get.

2098
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:48,330
I felt there was enough time it expired 
and get rid of it because no one's going

2099
01:35:48,331 --> 01:35:50,450
to come back and test me.
I passed all my tests.

2100
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,970
So.
So once you pass your test,

2101
01:35:52,971 --> 01:35:55,490
you would get rid of the old state.
I don't need to keep those lots that are

2102
01:35:55,491 --> 01:35:58,150
supposed to take only third party 
verified.

2103
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:01,100
That's not what they say necessarily.
They suggested,

2104
01:36:01,101 --> 01:36:03,770
I guess a now,
but I know that,

2105
01:36:03,771 --> 01:36:06,530
uh,
with this brand of Tribulus I had taken,

2106
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,793
I had taken three or four different 
other supplements from the same company 

2107
01:36:11,301 --> 01:36:13,170
and all passed no problem on their 
tests.

2108
01:36:13,171 --> 01:36:14,004
Right?
So it was just some weird contamination 

2109
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:18,310
which does happen again.
Happened at 10 means yes,

2110
01:36:18,311 --> 01:36:20,870
it's happened to several folks as far as
I can tell.

2111
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:22,940
I mean I'm not testing their whole 
product line,

2112
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:23,803
but it just seemed like a fluke and just
such a simple supplement in any case 

2113
01:36:27,201 --> 01:36:30,590
over one ingredient deal.
So then they come back and they're like,

2114
01:36:30,591 --> 01:36:32,030
oh,
you tested positive for this.

2115
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:34,400
And I'm like,
well that ain't fucking possible.

2116
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:37,820
So then I send in some supplements which
I had to pay for,

2117
01:36:37,821 --> 01:36:38,654
to have them tested.
They run them through the testing and 

2118
01:36:40,371 --> 01:36:42,290
then bang,
they find it all right.

2119
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:44,600
There you go.
There's your deal.

2120
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:47,240
Then they went out and bought a brand 
new bottle.

2121
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,590
Unopened.
Same Lot.

2122
01:36:48,950 --> 01:36:51,260
Tested that one,
verify the results.

2123
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:54,320
Same thing.
Test saying it doesn't happen.

2124
01:36:54,321 --> 01:36:55,154
Then Tim means as well.
So then we're in contact with Usada 

2125
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,753
throughout the entirety of this.
So we don't ever break contact with 

2126
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:04,820
Usada.
We have a specific guy and I'm not going

2127
01:37:04,821 --> 01:37:05,654
to throw his name out there or anything,
but we have a guy that we spoke to 

2128
01:37:07,311 --> 01:37:10,880
directly the whole time through my 
manager,

2129
01:37:11,110 --> 01:37:11,943
uh,
speaking with him and I've seen the 

2130
01:37:12,921 --> 01:37:13,754
emails.
And so we're talking about how we know 

2131
01:37:17,001 --> 01:37:19,100
this is a contamination and when,
you know,

2132
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:20,323
when we get done with all this,
why don't we even try to put together 

2133
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:26,300
something,
some promotional stuff,

2134
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:27,163
anything that we can do to try and keep 
athletes from ending up in the same 

2135
01:37:29,151 --> 01:37:29,580
issues.

2136
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:32,390
And we'd like to do whatever we could to
help you guys out with this.

2137
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:33,920
You know,
we're not against you,

2138
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:36,500
we're a,
we don't mind being a part of the system

2139
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:37,843
and we understand why you're here and 
I'm not against them wanting to do drug 

2140
01:37:41,631 --> 01:37:46,400
testing or whatever and try to keep a,
a clean and fair playing field.

2141
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,720
I get the point of it.
Uh,

2142
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,530
so we get the,
the supplements tested,

2143
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:54,850
they test the secondary batch.
They have all their information.

2144
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:55,560
It's like,
all right,

2145
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:59,490
this should be a fucking rock and roll.
And then they got real quiet.

2146
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:01,493
Oh,
okay.

2147
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,850
Now you're not talking to us anymore.
What do you mean?

2148
01:38:05,851 --> 01:38:07,740
Like you would contact him.
They wouldn't respond.

2149
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:09,960
They would take him a week,
two weeks.

2150
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:11,940
And what were they saying when they do 
respond?

2151
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:12,870
Uh,
you know,

2152
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:13,733
I can't entirely remember myself,
but with my manager was in touch with 

2153
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:16,770
them.

2154
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:17,603
And what is the protocol?
If someone tests positive for something 

2155
01:38:19,201 --> 01:38:20,034
that's a tainted Solomon and it's a 
third party supplement and where it's 

2156
01:38:23,671 --> 01:38:25,740
not,
it's not third party verified rather.

2157
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:26,663
Well,
I don't even know if it was third party 

2158
01:38:27,661 --> 01:38:29,310
verified that anything would be any 
different.

2159
01:38:30,530 --> 01:38:31,530
Hmm,
okay.

2160
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:32,364
Well,
if it is third party verified and still 

2161
01:38:34,711 --> 01:38:35,640
is tainted,
yeah,

2162
01:38:35,641 --> 01:38:36,660
that would be an issue,
right?

2163
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:38,270
Yeah.
If you tested positive,

2164
01:38:38,271 --> 01:38:39,990
he tested positive.
If they found the supplement,

2165
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,093
I think the idea about third party 
verified is it's much less likely to be 

2166
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:46,453
addicted.
It doesn't resolve anything and this is 

2167
01:38:48,481 --> 01:38:50,430
coming from someone who's in the 
supplement business.

2168
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:53,160
There's a certain amount of this stuff.
You farm it out.

2169
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:54,383
So far as I know what the deal is.
There's a period of ineligibility sort 

2170
01:38:59,881 --> 01:39:00,714
of or basically what happens is you're 
effectively suspended until this thing 

2171
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:07,430
is all finished out and they tried to 
say that you're not suspended.

2172
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:10,170
There's no suspension,
but that's not true.

2173
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:11,363
Well,
no one's going to book your favorite 

2174
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,880
treats you as you're suspended.
I tried to corner Travis Brown because I

2175
01:39:14,881 --> 01:39:17,370
was training him and they wouldn't let 
me.

2176
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,050
It won't let you.
The corner mission with.

2177
01:39:19,051 --> 01:39:19,960
Let me try.
Yes.

2178
01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:22,160
Okay.
And so they're like,

2179
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:25,200
you're suspended so you can't.
You can't corner,

2180
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,030
but you said you're not suspended.
Yeah,

2181
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:30,540
exactly.
So you're effectively suspended.

2182
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:31,553
You can't work.
You can't even work as a tertiary 

2183
01:39:34,891 --> 01:39:37,310
individually as a,
as a corner man or anything like that.

2184
01:39:37,311 --> 01:39:38,144
He can't be at the event.
And this is after the fact where you 

2185
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:42,804
brought them the supplements.
They independently verified that it was 

2186
01:39:45,661 --> 01:39:46,494
tainted.
Yes.

2187
01:39:46,770 --> 01:39:47,603
And uh,
so then we start talking and throughout 

2188
01:39:50,941 --> 01:39:52,020
the process I said,
look,

2189
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:57,350
I'm not taking a punishment for 
contamination and I'm not even fighting.

2190
01:39:57,391 --> 01:39:59,430
I'm not fighting anytime soon.

2191
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,140
I'm not you.
You can't,

2192
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:03,270
like what you did with means and these 
other people,

2193
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:06,360
you punish them,
you know that there was contamination,

2194
01:40:06,361 --> 01:40:08,070
but you punish them.
Yeah,

2195
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:10,080
they gave them many months.
Yes.

2196
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:14,630
Have a suspension so that they're able 
to compete or make a living during those

2197
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:15,031
months.
And I'm like,

2198
01:40:15,031 --> 01:40:15,870
no,
I'm not dealing.

2199
01:40:15,871 --> 01:40:19,140
I'm not taking that.
That's not acceptable because I'm not,

2200
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:22,230
that's not what's going on here.
Nobody is doping.

2201
01:40:22,231 --> 01:40:25,260
Nobody's trying to cheat the system.
There is no,

2202
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:28,770
I'm not even fighting.
You don't get by punishing me.

2203
01:40:28,771 --> 01:40:29,604
You're trying to let guilt on me.
You're trying to make me out to be some 

2204
01:40:32,971 --> 01:40:35,640
sort of a,
you know,

2205
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:36,503
a guilty party as if I'm trying to be,
have some soreness like I'm not dealing 

2206
01:40:41,611 --> 01:40:42,331
with,
I'm not taking.

2207
01:40:42,331 --> 01:40:44,340
So how did it ultimately get resolved?
Well,

2208
01:40:44,341 --> 01:40:48,060
ultimately what ended up happening is we
had to go to arbitration.

2209
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:49,283
That was all,
it was really left to us because then 

2210
01:40:50,641 --> 01:40:53,270
they started trying to bring up a

2211
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,860
stuff from my past and then weigh that 
against me as well.

2212
01:40:56,861 --> 01:40:57,431
And it's like,
Whoa,

2213
01:40:57,431 --> 01:40:59,410
dude,
you guys weren't even around and now you

2214
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:00,244
get to decide to add to the weight of 
whatever punishment you want to levy 

2215
01:41:04,661 --> 01:41:06,520
against me based on,
uh,

2216
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:09,730
things that didn't involve you.
Great.

2217
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:12,760
What were they talking about?
They're talking about 2011.

2218
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:14,840
No,
2008 they went to.

2219
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:17,890
Yeah.
They tried and they tried to say,

2220
01:41:17,891 --> 01:41:18,551
well,
oh yeah,

2221
01:41:18,551 --> 01:41:20,440
well this happened.
So then therefore,

2222
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:22,630
you know,
now they start talking about two years.

2223
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:25,480
[inaudible] like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

2224
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:26,373
They started talking about suspending 
you for two years for a tainted 

2225
01:41:27,911 --> 01:41:28,780
supplement.
Yes.

2226
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:30,400
Wow.
And I'm just going.

2227
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:32,590
There's no way.
I wouldn't even expect six months.

2228
01:41:32,591 --> 01:41:36,760
You think I'm going to take two years?
And so we go and we inquire on the Arbor

2229
01:41:36,761 --> 01:41:37,594
and I've done.
I did an interview with the guy that we 

2230
01:41:39,221 --> 01:41:40,420
were dealing with through skype.

2231
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:41,260
Uh,
we've,

2232
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:42,093
we've been in touch.
It's just like at some point everything 

2233
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:47,620
turned and changed.
Their tone changed there.

2234
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,280
Even the original penalties,
they were looking to levy increased.

2235
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:52,413
New Shit gets brought in.
It's like they became a completely 

2236
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:59,671
different animal as soon as you know,
there was the evidence of,

2237
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:00,693
of contamination and that I wasn't gonna
I wasn't willing to take punishment for 

2238
01:42:06,491 --> 01:42:07,324
it.
I wasn't.

2239
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:08,950
What do you think their motivation is 
here?

2240
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:11,680
I think that they,
and this is just my opinion,

2241
01:42:11,681 --> 01:42:15,220
I think the way you saw to looks at it 
and it's an easy way to go about it,

2242
01:42:15,221 --> 01:42:18,490
is that the more people they deem,
the more effective they appear.

2243
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:21,500
It's their effect.
Their efficacy is based on punishment,

2244
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:22,443
punishments doled out.
Not necessarily not on lack of 

2245
01:42:24,581 --> 01:42:27,370
punishments at all.
So do you think this is,

2246
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,273
you know,
also remembered by the people that are 

2247
01:42:30,641 --> 01:42:31,474
working there.

2248
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,420
So they arbitrarily get to decide how 
things go about right.

2249
01:42:34,421 --> 01:42:38,080
There's not like a very strict protocol 
that they must follow.

2250
01:42:38,081 --> 01:42:40,340
They're tainted supplements and for this
no,

2251
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:43,560
there is actually quite a bit of a lever
or there,

2252
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:47,260
there is leeway in terms of how they can
enforce and what they can enforce.

2253
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:48,640
So when,
so it's subjective,

2254
01:42:48,641 --> 01:42:50,770
it's up,
there is subjectivity that um,

2255
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:51,910
they,
uh,

2256
01:42:51,970 --> 01:42:52,803
they have a lot of discretion.
There is some outlined elements of 

2257
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:57,700
protocol,
but there is no,

2258
01:42:58,140 --> 01:43:01,690
it is always this or it is always that.
And uh,

2259
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,733
you know,
I didn't begrudge them for a period of 

2260
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:05,553
ineligibility while you're going through
the process of finding out whether this 

2261
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:10,850
is contamination or what have you,
doing any testing.

2262
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:12,880
And that makes sense to me.
That's fine.

2263
01:43:13,070 --> 01:43:17,020
I understand that if this guy supposedly
has something in the system,

2264
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,460
well let's figure out what it is.

2265
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:22,240
And once we have a better idea,
then we can decide about whether you can

2266
01:43:22,241 --> 01:43:23,074
go back into the pool or do this or do 
that or if you're going to leverage any 

2267
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:29,560
punishments makes sense to me.
But in addition to that,

2268
01:43:29,561 --> 01:43:32,020
then tacking on more shit in terms of my
case and I was like,

2269
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:34,690
that's not acceptable.
So we,

2270
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:35,831
we go,
well,

2271
01:43:35,831 --> 01:43:38,560
I guess the only thing left to us as to 
go to arbitration.

2272
01:43:38,950 --> 01:43:41,840
And so my manager spoke with,
um,

2273
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:45,790
when I was working through them to 
arbitration and we said,

2274
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:46,690
okay,
well we'll,

2275
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:48,100
what is that going to take?
Well,

2276
01:43:48,101 --> 01:43:49,900
that's going to cost more money out of 
my pocket.

2277
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:51,310
Um,
you know,

2278
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,153
the arbitration process,
these are guys that they're paid by 

2279
01:43:55,341 --> 01:43:56,174
Usada to do their arbitration.
Like they work for them in a way or 

2280
01:43:59,061 --> 01:44:00,980
they're not,
they don't work under them directly,

2281
01:44:00,981 --> 01:44:01,814
but they are,
they do get paid to be a arbitrator 

2282
01:44:05,430 --> 01:44:05,720
somehow.

2283
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:08,930
There's some something.
So they get contracted by Usada yes.

2284
01:44:09,030 --> 01:44:11,030
And so that was like,
ah,

2285
01:44:11,031 --> 01:44:13,100
I don't necessarily feel the most 
comfortable with that,

2286
01:44:13,101 --> 01:44:17,210
but I can also understand how it's not,
there's probably not an easier way to go

2287
01:44:17,211 --> 01:44:18,320
about it,
but okay,

2288
01:44:18,321 --> 01:44:20,990
I got it.
Then when we,

2289
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:22,263
uh,
then we get notice back from Usada that 

2290
01:44:24,321 --> 01:44:26,540
we have to limit the scope of our 
argument.

2291
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,400
We're like,
Whoa,

2292
01:44:28,401 --> 01:44:29,800
Whoa,
what you,

2293
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,720
you're gonna tell us what we can and 
can't argue in arbitration.

2294
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:37,130
I don't remember what the definitions 
were exactly,

2295
01:44:37,131 --> 01:44:39,110
but it was like,
you can't,

2296
01:44:39,370 --> 01:44:42,050
you know,
you have to keep it within this boundary

2297
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:44,150
and this realm and this.
And I'm like,

2298
01:44:44,210 --> 01:44:45,043
well,
you can't fucking try to say the levy 

2299
01:44:47,721 --> 01:44:48,554
this against me and then you stuff from 
my past and then tell me I can't argue 

2300
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:51,584
my full case.
So they're limiting the amount that you 

2301
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:55,190
could defend yourself as though you're 
saying the,

2302
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:57,590
they were limiting the,
um,

2303
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,300
the range of argument you could make.

2304
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:00,163
What would the argument be that you 
would bring up that they would want to 

2305
01:45:01,851 --> 01:45:04,340
limit?
Uh,

2306
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,233
that's a good question.
I don't know exactly did they define 

2307
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:07,994
that?
They know they had definitions in the 

2308
01:45:09,321 --> 01:45:10,154
emails with,
with back and forth with my manager and 

2309
01:45:12,081 --> 01:45:12,914
he goes,
we'll fuck we because we could argue 

2310
01:45:15,561 --> 01:45:17,210
about,
you know,

2311
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:19,160
this is contamination,
um,

2312
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,600
and,
and go from there.

2313
01:45:20,601 --> 01:45:23,720
But it was something really potentially 
limiting,

2314
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,770
which was weird about how they put it.
You just don't remember what exactly.

2315
01:45:26,771 --> 01:45:28,910
I don't remember all the details,
it's very detail oriented,

2316
01:45:28,911 --> 01:45:33,170
it's legal ease and uh,
and then so we get to the point,

2317
01:45:33,171 --> 01:45:34,490
it's like,
well fuck,

2318
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:38,300
well this doesn't even look like a very,
you know,

2319
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:39,283
this might not even be a,
a useful way of trying to approach this 

2320
01:45:42,411 --> 01:45:46,060
thing and it got down to the wire to 
where,

2321
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:50,120
and we kept pushing it back and pushing 
it back and saying like,

2322
01:45:50,121 --> 01:45:51,940
you know,
we can we get an extension and,

2323
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:54,560
and to try and figure out how the hell 
do we approach this?

2324
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:56,860
And,
and also like how,

2325
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:57,733
how could we approach without having to 
spend money on having lawyers get 

2326
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:02,030
involved.
I mean that's the last thing you want to

2327
01:46:02,031 --> 01:46:04,610
do is get to litigation or you know,
even arbitration,

2328
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:07,170
it's a legal process.
It's complex and it is,

2329
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:08,053
it's,
there's a lot of lawyers love billable 

2330
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:11,593
hours or they do.
And so it gets down to the wire 

2331
01:46:14,361 --> 01:46:18,980
essentially and we,
I just sit back and I go,

2332
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:22,400
I won't accept any ruling if it's a 
punishment at all.

2333
01:46:22,401 --> 01:46:23,960
I don't care what they say,
I'll just be like,

2334
01:46:23,961 --> 01:46:24,970
Nah,
not I,

2335
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:27,020
I don't.
I'm not going to abide by it.

2336
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:29,960
You can't force me to do shit and I 
guess we'll have to cross

2337
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:31,333
position is that if you are accidentally
taking a tainted supplement and also 

2338
01:46:36,171 --> 01:46:40,070
trace amounts that have absolutely zero 
effect on performance,

2339
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:44,510
there's nothing that you're doing by 
accidentally taking that that in any way

2340
01:46:44,511 --> 01:46:46,850
would help you and that's a fact.
That's a proven fact.

2341
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,713
Yes.
So your position is you shouldn't be 

2342
01:46:48,621 --> 01:46:49,770
punished.
Correct.

2343
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:53,450
Then you're out of the year when once 
you.

2344
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:56,040
The time that you've been out.
Here's the thing.

2345
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:57,630
That's enough.
Exactly.

2346
01:46:57,631 --> 01:46:59,850
It's one of them.
You don't need to say,

2347
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:01,110
oh,
well if you.

2348
01:47:01,111 --> 01:47:04,880
If it took six,
if it took seven months to get the.

2349
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:05,743
The,
the information that you needed the 

2350
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:07,261
data,
right?

2351
01:47:07,261 --> 01:47:08,700
To then clarify,
okay,

2352
01:47:08,701 --> 01:47:11,070
well you're not at fault to then say,
oh,

2353
01:47:11,071 --> 01:47:11,904
well we'll suspend you for six months,
but since that six months is already 

2354
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:15,480
past,
it's like we didn't suspend you at all.

2355
01:47:15,820 --> 01:47:16,830
No.
Motherfucker.

2356
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:20,370
When you look into the haunt a at the 
data,

2357
01:47:20,371 --> 01:47:22,680
when you go and look at this case,
it says suspended,

2358
01:47:22,681 --> 01:47:26,430
which means you punished me,
which means I was guilty in some way.

2359
01:47:26,610 --> 01:47:30,030
You said I'm guilty because that's how 
you got to punish me.

2360
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,193
Right.
It's not under investigation or after 

2361
01:47:33,841 --> 01:47:36,800
this litigation has exonerated after.

2362
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:38,480
No,
it's just no.

2363
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:40,390
You still love to punishment in there to
say,

2364
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:42,630
look how we caught this guy and we 
punished them and I'm like,

2365
01:47:42,660 --> 01:47:43,610
I'm not.
I'm not.

2366
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:47,190
I'm not down for that.
And so Hudley enough.

2367
01:47:47,970 --> 01:47:50,150
So I was like on aerials or something 
like that.

2368
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:50,730
I said,
I,

2369
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:53,250
I won't accept.
I don't care what they say.

2370
01:47:53,251 --> 01:47:55,050
I don't care what punishment they try to
levy.

2371
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:55,884
I don't abide by it.
I won't agree to it and I'm done with 

2372
01:47:58,051 --> 01:48:02,220
them.
And then someone from the arbitrary,

2373
01:48:02,260 --> 01:48:03,093
the arbitrators office who we were 
dealing with calls us out of the blue 

2374
01:48:05,671 --> 01:48:06,880
and goes,
so,

2375
01:48:06,950 --> 01:48:09,510
so you still sure you don't want to do 
this.

2376
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:10,403
I'm like,
well.

2377
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:14,070
And my manager goes,
well they said that we have to limit the

2378
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:16,590
scope of argument to this and this and 
we can talk.

2379
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:18,150
And then he goes,
no,

2380
01:48:18,151 --> 01:48:19,320
you don't.
You can talk about,

2381
01:48:19,321 --> 01:48:20,970
you can,
you can bring any argument you want.

2382
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,730
Who is saying this to you?
The arbitrators office.

2383
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,700
And

2384
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:28,350
so who would initially come to you and 
said the elite,

2385
01:48:28,450 --> 01:48:30,940
the scope of your argument Usada.
Okay.

2386
01:48:30,941 --> 01:48:31,774
So you saw to,
was attempting to establish some 

2387
01:48:33,851 --> 01:48:34,684
boundaries for your arguments.
But the people who were the actual 

2388
01:48:38,471 --> 01:48:40,570
arbitrators said that that's not true.

2389
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:41,960
Right?
That's not the case.

2390
01:48:41,961 --> 01:48:42,794
You don't.
It doesn't,

2391
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:45,150
they can't force you to argue in a 
certain.

2392
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,101
Oh,
okay.

2393
01:48:46,101 --> 01:48:49,040
So is it possible that you sought as 
lawyers?

2394
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:50,840
We're trying to.
Here's the thing I've found about,

2395
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:51,770
about lawyers,
like,

2396
01:48:51,980 --> 01:48:52,813
yeah,
for sure they're necessary and that's 

2397
01:48:54,561 --> 01:48:57,560
all well and good and you need them.
But there's a reality,

2398
01:48:57,561 --> 01:48:58,394
and this is something that I had to deal
with recently in doing something with a 

2399
01:49:00,321 --> 01:49:01,154
friend through lawyers where they 
attached a bunch of shit to this deal 

2400
01:49:05,481 --> 01:49:07,970
that wasn't supposed to be in there and 
he didn't even know it was in there.

2401
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,400
And then my lawyer is like,
what the fuck is this?

2402
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:12,650
And so I contact him,
what the fuck is this?

2403
01:49:12,651 --> 01:49:14,090
And he's like,
what the fuck is that?

2404
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:16,280
So he contacts his lawyer is what the 
fuck is this?

2405
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:21,290
And it turns out this is a common thing 
lawyers they want to do with each other.

2406
01:49:21,291 --> 01:49:24,890
Yeah.
We put this in to give you leverage.

2407
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:25,873
I don't think you necessarily want that,
but we're looking out for your best 

2408
01:49:28,701 --> 01:49:29,534
interests.
And so now you have a good negotiation 

2409
01:49:31,971 --> 01:49:35,120
point.
If you just go in with what you want,

2410
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:37,430
then they're going to ask for more than 
that.

2411
01:49:37,431 --> 01:49:38,264
And then you're not in a strong position
because you can't ask for more after 

2412
01:49:40,521 --> 01:49:42,070
you've already established your initial 
position.

2413
01:49:42,071 --> 01:49:42,170
Makes

2414
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:43,930
everything convoluted there.
Gross.

2415
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:45,290
Yes,
I hear you.

2416
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:49,060
But that's the world we live.
Grandfather was tejas world.

2417
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:51,820
Pretty Pretty Fair lawyer.
He was assistant attorney general,

2418
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:54,820
the state of Washington.
He actually wanted me to get into law of

2419
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:55,840
all things,
but I'm like,

2420
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:56,703
Eh,
I think I'd rather beat out my brain's 

2421
01:49:58,710 --> 01:49:59,860
yet.
Seems like,

2422
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:00,940
well,
you haven't beaten them out.

2423
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:02,980
Very impressive with your memory.
So we,

2424
01:50:02,981 --> 01:50:04,690
uh,
we get to.

2425
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:07,360
My manager comes back and he goes,
hey man,

2426
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:10,150
they just contacted me out of nowhere.
And they're like,

2427
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:11,380
well,
if you want to do this,

2428
01:50:11,381 --> 01:50:12,250
you can.
And No,

2429
01:50:12,251 --> 01:50:12,860
you can't,
you,

2430
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:15,370
you can make the argument.
There's no limiting in the scope of your

2431
01:50:15,371 --> 01:50:18,220
argument or anything.
So then it's like,

2432
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:19,780
well,
yeah,

2433
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:21,400
all right,
I'll go for it.

2434
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:22,960
Went to our least.
Yeah,

2435
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:23,803
because at the very least I thought 
maybe I could have some sort of record 

2436
01:50:25,691 --> 01:50:28,420
down of what we talked about,
what was discussed,

2437
01:50:28,421 --> 01:50:29,380
the arguments made.

2438
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:31,000
So in the end,
you know,

2439
01:50:31,001 --> 01:50:32,110
no matter what,
how it came out,

2440
01:50:32,111 --> 01:50:34,360
I can go here,
here's what's legit,

2441
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:35,283
then you can,
you can make your own decision from 

2442
01:50:36,011 --> 01:50:37,960
there.
And so we go in,

2443
01:50:38,020 --> 01:50:39,880
uh,
I brought my legal team.

2444
01:50:39,881 --> 01:50:40,540
They,
he,

2445
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:41,373
they had a,
their lawyer come who was the same guy 

2446
01:50:43,421 --> 01:50:45,460
we were dealing with throughout the 
entire process and,

2447
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:49,200
and they made their argument and we made
ours and you know,

2448
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:50,043
and there,
there are times where I'm sitting back 

2449
01:50:51,071 --> 01:50:52,610
and I go,
you know,

2450
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:54,760
making,
they're making closing arguments,

2451
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:59,560
the lawyers and I'm just sitting there 
listening to the Usada Seigel man,

2452
01:50:59,561 --> 01:51:02,140
he's just pushing the,
he's just moving the goal post.

2453
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:04,660
He's a how so?
Well,

2454
01:51:04,661 --> 01:51:07,600
it's just taking a certain element and 
then trying to,

2455
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:08,843
you know,
you slippery slope arguments and moving 

2456
01:51:09,821 --> 01:51:10,654
the goal posts on things,
but he's just doing anything he can to 

2457
01:51:12,551 --> 01:51:16,300
use rhetoric instead of logos at this 
point because,

2458
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,153
you know,
they're lawyers and they're trying to 

2459
01:51:17,651 --> 01:51:21,490
make their case and trying to find 
impassioned responses when you're saying

2460
01:51:21,491 --> 01:51:22,440
this,
you know,

2461
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:24,100
consider the people listening at home.

2462
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:26,500
Don't really know your case,
don't know the scope.

2463
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:28,900
Okay.
So it's like trying to say that,

2464
01:51:28,901 --> 01:51:29,850
uh,
you know,

2465
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:33,640
find ways at which to move the goal 
posts in terms of.

2466
01:51:33,641 --> 01:51:36,130
So what,
like I said to you earlier,

2467
01:51:36,131 --> 01:51:39,370
I keep batches of all the supplements 
that I take,

2468
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:40,423
especially when I'm in these,
this program and especially after 

2469
01:51:42,731 --> 01:51:46,300
dealing with the cluster fuck that was 
California and it's like,

2470
01:51:46,301 --> 01:51:49,780
well I didn't have anything that I could
bring to you that I could fuck,

2471
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:51,280
you know,
so I'm like,

2472
01:51:51,281 --> 01:51:52,114
this is never happening again.
So I keep everything they go and they 

2473
01:51:55,330 --> 01:51:58,750
test stuff and they find it and I kept 
notes.

2474
01:51:58,751 --> 01:51:59,584
I kept this and it's like,
what more could I have done for you 

2475
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:05,910
guys?
Even if it doesn't matter if there's,

2476
01:52:05,950 --> 01:52:07,990
let's say what they were all third party
tested as well.

2477
01:52:07,991 --> 01:52:08,824
I would still keep batches of the 
supplements and one of the stuff I take 

2478
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:13,780
third party was the issue then.

2479
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:17,140
Well it's just simply,
it's just they kept trying to say that I

2480
01:52:17,141 --> 01:52:20,380
didn't do a good enough job that uh,
did you use the,

2481
01:52:20,381 --> 01:52:21,214
uh,
did you see this thing on supplement 

2482
01:52:24,121 --> 01:52:24,954
form 11?
It's like that came out after the fact 

2483
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:28,870
and yes,
I have seen that.

2484
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:29,763
In fact,
I use all the resources that you 

2485
01:52:31,121 --> 01:52:31,954
provided your global dro,
your other supplement for 11 to check 

2486
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:38,470
against ingredient lists,
supplement names,

2487
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:42,490
company names to make sure none of this 
shit is on the list so that I don't make

2488
01:52:42,491 --> 01:52:45,010
that mistake.
So I use the resources that you give me.

2489
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:46,220
I keep batches

2490
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:48,920
of my supplements so they can be tested 
if need be.

2491
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:52,250
I do what's available to keep from any 
issues.

2492
01:52:52,670 --> 01:52:56,580
And yet they just kept moving the goal 
post on that and trying to say,

2493
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:57,580
well,
but you didn't,

2494
01:52:57,581 --> 01:52:59,330
uh,
you didn't hire a psychic,

2495
01:52:59,450 --> 01:53:01,070
you know,
it's just that kind of shit.

2496
01:53:01,071 --> 01:53:01,551
And I'm like,
well,

2497
01:53:01,551 --> 01:53:04,130
how,
how can this have been any better?

2498
01:53:04,131 --> 01:53:05,870
And not to mention I'm not fighting.

2499
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,750
Right.
So at the end of the day,

2500
01:53:08,751 --> 01:53:10,190
what were they looking for?

2501
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:11,880
Portration?
Uh,

2502
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:16,910
they wanted to levy a punishment against
me and suspend me for years.

2503
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:18,930
And this is Usada.
Yes.

2504
01:53:18,931 --> 01:53:19,764
So you saw to ultimately,
even though they knew that you took a 

2505
01:53:22,021 --> 01:53:25,680
tainted supplement that had no effect 
whatsoever on your performance,

2506
01:53:25,681 --> 01:53:26,514
right?
They still wanted to punish you for two 

2507
01:53:27,601 --> 01:53:29,640
years.
That seems stupid.

2508
01:53:30,210 --> 01:53:32,280
That just seemed stupid.
Now let me,

2509
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:33,233
let me read Jeff Novitsky because 
Novitsky texted me because I told him 

2510
01:53:35,781 --> 01:53:39,750
this was going to go down and his take 
is a little bit different than yours.

2511
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:41,410
I don't imagine it isn't.
All right.

2512
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:42,900
I'm not surprised that it is.

2513
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:44,240
And I,
uh,

2514
01:53:44,241 --> 01:53:46,610
I told you what it was the.
So this is.

2515
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:47,863
I'll just read you what it says.
He said he'll complain about the amount 

2516
01:53:51,141 --> 01:53:53,450
of time that went by with you saw the 
process,

2517
01:53:53,451 --> 01:53:54,284
but he notified us of retirement right 
after the positive sample was collected 

2518
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,753
before a positive was announced.
So he was off in the wind for many 

2519
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:03,433
months and not communicating with Usada 
a big reason the case took so long to 

2520
01:54:07,761 --> 01:54:10,880
resolve to his positive was from a 
tainted supplement,

2521
01:54:10,881 --> 01:54:11,714
but he didn't do the number one thing we
advise to use athletes on UFC athletes 

2522
01:54:15,981 --> 01:54:16,814
on supplements.
He didn't choose a supplement that was 

2523
01:54:18,501 --> 01:54:22,740
third party certified as a banned 
substance free.

2524
01:54:22,741 --> 01:54:24,530
Like on it,
supplements are,

2525
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:25,873
there are literally hundreds of 
certified supplements out there in 

2526
01:54:27,711 --> 01:54:28,544
virtually and virtually ensures no 
issues to a foreign athlete if they 

2527
01:54:33,591 --> 01:54:35,250
stick with those.
Uh,

2528
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:36,343
one other point for Barnett when he was 
unresponsive to case he missed all of 

2529
01:54:40,341 --> 01:54:43,100
his deadlines to file for arbitration.
Uh,

2530
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:46,580
he came to the table later and said he 
wanted to go to arbitration.

2531
01:54:46,581 --> 01:54:47,414
You saw to maiden exclusion and let him,
which ultimately led to his favorable 

2532
01:54:51,021 --> 01:54:51,854
ruling by arbitrator.
Their reasoning was that they wanted to 

2533
01:54:55,101 --> 01:54:58,210
rule in favor of fairness to athlete 
rules.

2534
01:54:58,211 --> 01:55:01,880
Say they didn't have to after time to 
file expired.

2535
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:03,013
Well,
but they're saying it ruled favorably 

2536
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:06,800
towards you ultimately at the end of the
day.

2537
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,410
Yes.
They all live in our favor.

2538
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:11,510
Gobbly goop that the other.
You definitely probably shit.

2539
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:12,493
Like he says that,
oh well he retired and he was in the 

2540
01:55:14,981 --> 01:55:16,200
wind.
You know what my end,

2541
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:17,560
the wind was.
It wasn't even that long.

2542
01:55:17,561 --> 01:55:20,440
I was in Japan for rising with my 
athlete.

2543
01:55:20,441 --> 01:55:22,810
Alicia Garcia wasn't in the fucking 
wind.

2544
01:55:22,811 --> 01:55:24,700
Sounds good though.
Even the wind and the wind

2545
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:29,590
fucking you and that motorcycle jacket.
Yeah,

2546
01:55:29,591 --> 01:55:34,450
I'm dragging a coffin behind me,
like Django through the Nevada

2547
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:35,840
desert.
Somebody pulls you over,

2548
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:40,130
got eight days growth on your face.
You get some days where you sought out.

2549
01:55:40,210 --> 01:55:41,450
We're looking for is broken.
I.

2550
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:43,970
He pissed this cup for me.
I

2551
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:44,940
didn't bring a cup.
Just.

2552
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:46,920
Yeah,
I was in Japan at rising.

2553
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:51,540
You know I wasn't in the wind.
And they in your favor.

2554
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:54,690
The arbitrator arbitrator and what did 
they say?

2555
01:55:54,691 --> 01:55:55,524
This is the same guy.
The arbitrator is the same guy that put 

2556
01:55:58,771 --> 01:56:01,080
together is he's an ICARUS.
He produced ICARUS.

2557
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:04,080
The movie on,
on doping.

2558
01:56:04,110 --> 01:56:04,943
He is,
he's one of the major figures in terms 

2559
01:56:07,381 --> 01:56:08,214
of the world of anti-doping.
So it's one of the guys who worked with 

2560
01:56:11,041 --> 01:56:13,860
Bryan Fogel,
the arbitrator.

2561
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:17,400
Bryan Fogel was the guy who started in 
ICARUS.

2562
01:56:17,510 --> 01:56:21,110
This guy is a perpetrator for water.
Okay.

2563
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:24,090
I'm actually,
why am I doing this?

2564
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:26,880
Either way you look at Jamie can handle,
but it doesn't matter.

2565
01:56:27,620 --> 01:56:31,380
So this guy has the end of the day.
Everything in terms of drug testing,

2566
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:32,900
they really favor.
Yes.

2567
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:33,803
And he said he does it.
He couldn't see any way that I could 

2568
01:56:35,511 --> 01:56:36,344
have done hardly a better job than I was
meticulous with my record keeping that 

2569
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:40,741
uh,
I may,

2570
01:56:40,741 --> 01:56:45,741
I did essentially everything I could in 
the means of a normal person to do.

2571
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:48,660
How is it resolved at the end?
It was a.

2572
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:52,330
The of reprimand reprimand?
Yeah.

2573
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:53,400
What does that,
what do they do?

2574
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:58,590
Richard H dot Richard Mclaren.
Mclaren chief arbitrator?

2575
01:56:58,710 --> 01:57:00,480
Yes.
Okay.

2576
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:04,530
So at the end of the day,
after all this,

2577
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,690
they say they gave you a reprimand.
What does that mean?

2578
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:09,750
It just means like don't do that.
Be careful.

2579
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:10,733
Yeah.
Okay.

2580
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:13,980
That's it.
And this took but no punishment.

2581
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:14,873
Right.
And all that two year shift from Usada 

2582
01:57:16,830 --> 01:57:17,950
was on warranty,
right.

2583
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:20,910
And heavy handed,
heavy handed as hell.

2584
01:57:20,911 --> 01:57:21,744
And,
and junior dos Santos went through the 

2585
01:57:22,561 --> 01:57:25,140
two,
started at at six months.

2586
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:30,420
And then by the time we have both 
supplements tested,

2587
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:33,630
then all of a sudden it starts getting 
weird.

2588
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:34,583
And you know,
this claim by new whiskey that we were 

2589
01:57:36,931 --> 01:57:37,860
out of.
No,

2590
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:40,590
we were always in touch.
Novitsky doesn't work for you.

2591
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:41,970
I know.
This is.

2592
01:57:41,971 --> 01:57:42,804
So what's Kinda funny is new whiskey is 
such a public face on this kind of 

2593
01:57:46,711 --> 01:57:47,544
thing,
but when it comes to actually dealing 

2594
01:57:49,231 --> 01:57:51,360
with Usada,
he's all,

2595
01:57:51,420 --> 01:57:52,253
he's hands up.

2596
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:53,243
I mean he'll come and he'll,
he'll make sure to put something out 

2597
01:57:55,231 --> 01:57:56,064
there in any of the sphere.
But in reality he ain't got a fucking 

2598
01:57:59,011 --> 01:58:00,000
thing to do with any of them.
Okay.

2599
01:58:00,001 --> 01:58:00,834
But in his defense,
he's a UFC employee and it's 

2600
01:58:02,881 --> 01:58:03,714
inappropriate for him to have any 
influence whatsoever on the way they 

2601
01:58:06,091 --> 01:58:07,410
rule things that.
But that's,

2602
01:58:07,430 --> 01:58:08,380
that is,
that is that,

2603
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:11,550
I think that's actually the proper thing
for him to do it in a way.

2604
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:12,790
But I mean it's just,
it's a,

2605
01:58:13,330 --> 01:58:14,250
it's a,
it's it.

2606
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:17,150
The presentation is a bit of a misnomer.
I think so.

2607
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:20,370
Well initially he was responsible for 
the drug testing.

2608
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:21,900
Now he's,
what is he,

2609
01:58:21,901 --> 01:58:25,140
the president of athletes safety and 
wellness bucket.

2610
01:58:25,730 --> 01:58:27,480
They're running the performance 
institute.

2611
01:58:27,481 --> 01:58:28,111
Yeah.
I mean,

2612
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:30,300
what they're,
what they're concentrating on now,

2613
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:31,353
but I'm just saying for Jeff and his 
shirt off that I think they're 

2614
01:58:33,301 --> 01:58:37,880
concentrating more on encouraging 
fighters to train and,

2615
01:58:37,881 --> 01:58:38,714
and,
and fortify their body with nutrition 

2616
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:42,370
directly and giving them education

2617
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:45,250
on how to do this and the Jeff is at the
forefront of that stuff and showing them

2618
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:49,880
how to avoid accidentally taking 
something and definitely have guess

2619
01:58:50,450 --> 01:58:51,283
coming with this is that he is not fully
in the loop with what happened between 

2620
01:58:54,831 --> 01:58:57,590
me and Usada because he's not involved.
Right.

2621
01:58:57,770 --> 01:58:58,603
So some of,
some of what he's saying there is 

2622
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:01,693
incorrect and it's not.
I don't blame him because he's not a 

2623
01:59:04,371 --> 01:59:04,900
part of it.

2624
01:59:04,900 --> 01:59:09,340
So is he misinformed at the very least 
think that they,

2625
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:10,233
they're not being straightforward with 
it sounds to me like they wanted to 

2626
01:59:12,161 --> 01:59:14,510
punish you badly.
They wanted to punish me badly.

2627
01:59:14,530 --> 01:59:16,690
Yeah.
Two years is fucking crazy punishment.

2628
01:59:16,691 --> 01:59:17,524
And also when,
when people get to remember when I'm 

2629
01:59:22,330 --> 01:59:24,880
Nick Diaz was,
uh,

2630
01:59:24,910 --> 01:59:27,730
was being interviewed by all these 
people.

2631
01:59:27,731 --> 01:59:28,564
And then there was that mean lady who 
works at Nevada State Athletic 

2632
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:33,190
Commission and she was grilling him and 
I'm like,

2633
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,280
you were talking about pot here.
You crazy lady.

2634
01:59:36,281 --> 01:59:38,110
Like,
what in the fuck are you doing?

2635
01:59:38,111 --> 01:59:41,350
You're acting like he robbed a bank.
Even if he's not getting in the ring.

2636
01:59:41,351 --> 01:59:42,340
Hi.
And leave him alone.

2637
01:59:42,370 --> 01:59:44,080
Exactly.
And I think he probably did a few times,

2638
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:45,623
I think.
I think in the Gombe fighting he 

2639
01:59:48,290 --> 01:59:49,470
might've been highest was like,
oh,

2640
01:59:49,570 --> 01:59:50,860
I'm bleeding.
Oh my God,

2641
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:53,850
maybe I should choke him right now.
He didn't give a shit fight.

2642
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:57,010
Jon Jones is going through this right 
now.

2643
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:57,873
I don't know where John Jones stands,
but it's been pretty well established 

2644
02:00:00,791 --> 02:00:03,910
that at the very least,
what the numbers,

2645
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:05,860
if you look at the numbers when he was 
tested,

2646
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:07,870
um,
and you know,

2647
02:00:07,871 --> 02:00:08,704
I don't know,
a lot of people like to say that he's a 

2648
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:10,744
cheater.
There's a lot of this going on right 

2649
02:00:11,831 --> 02:00:14,140
now.
Look real clear.

2650
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:18,670
The first test was proven that he took 
tainted Dick Pills.

2651
02:00:18,930 --> 02:00:19,763
Okay.

2652
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:21,203
It was a actually.
So that got brought up to my attention 

2653
02:00:23,521 --> 02:00:26,730
as part of all this because you know,
you sought a felon,

2654
02:00:26,740 --> 02:00:29,850
irrelevant.
The difference between that first one,

2655
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,110
let's say,
and I'm not,

2656
02:00:31,111 --> 02:00:32,670
I don't know about the second shift with
John,

2657
02:00:32,671 --> 02:00:36,450
I don't really follow close on this,
but this came across my plate because he

2658
02:00:36,451 --> 02:00:37,284
had,
he was taking like a liquid cialis and 

2659
02:00:40,921 --> 02:00:45,921
it was from a company that sells sarms 
and peptides and all that.

2660
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:49,440
So it was a company that also sells 
banned substances.

2661
02:00:49,610 --> 02:00:52,380
Right.
And so their argument was that dude,

2662
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:55,700
you're buying or using shit from a place
full of illegal shit.

2663
02:00:55,730 --> 02:00:56,760
You're not supposed to take.

2664
02:00:56,840 --> 02:00:58,530
Definitely a dumb move.
Definitely.

2665
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:02,960
It means God damn prescription for 
Cialis.

2666
02:01:03,230 --> 02:01:04,870
Right?
You don't need to take this phone.

2667
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:06,710
I imagine.
Um,

2668
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:10,080
the second one,
what he took,

2669
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:14,810
he had such a minuscule trace amount 
that he tested negative.

2670
02:01:15,030 --> 02:01:17,690
Then he tested positive,
then he tested negative again.

2671
02:01:17,691 --> 02:01:19,940
And this is something that's supposed to
stay in your system for months.

2672
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:21,133
So this is indicative of someone who's 
not taking something to get into 

2673
02:01:23,601 --> 02:01:25,520
performance,
enhance and benefit from it.

2674
02:01:25,700 --> 02:01:28,010
But rather someone who had something 
that was tainted,

2675
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,373
lab technicians are smart on this shit.
Like the guy who saw the results from 

2676
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:36,940
the first little batch of supplements we
gave me,

2677
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:37,823
he,
he had seen everything and then some 

2678
02:01:39,861 --> 02:01:40,070
under

2679
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,520
the sun and all different levels and 
this guy knew what,

2680
02:01:43,540 --> 02:01:46,070
what constituted contamination and it 
wasn't.

2681
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:46,993
He could tell,
of course they can tell just by the 

2682
02:01:48,411 --> 02:01:49,244
numbers.
Look if you'd taken trace amounts of 

2683
02:01:51,081 --> 02:01:51,914
anything,
it's not gonna do a damn thing to your 

2684
02:01:53,751 --> 02:01:54,584
body in terms of performance enhancing,
but it is going to show up in these 

2685
02:01:56,211 --> 02:01:58,430
tests because these tests are incredibly
thorough.

2686
02:01:58,670 --> 02:01:59,503
Hey Jamie,
Google what's going on with Jon Jones 

2687
02:02:01,491 --> 02:02:03,800
case because particularly after this 
weekend,

2688
02:02:03,801 --> 02:02:05,420
it's very,
very relevant.

2689
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:06,743
You know,
I mean with Brock Lesnar get in there 

2690
02:02:08,721 --> 02:02:09,554
with DC DC becoming the first light 
heavyweight to consecutively hold the 

2691
02:02:13,581 --> 02:02:15,950
light heavyweight championship and the 
heavyweight championship,

2692
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,400
you know,
and a spectacular fight by DC.

2693
02:02:19,401 --> 02:02:23,420
But Jon Jones is always going to be sure
there you cannot,

2694
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:28,580
you can go on and on about the 
extracurricular woes of John Jones.

2695
02:02:28,640 --> 02:02:31,880
Sure.
His capabilities as an athlete,

2696
02:02:31,881 --> 02:02:35,000
his talent is undeniable,
undeniable.

2697
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,840
Look,
whatever the fuck he took Dick Pills,

2698
02:02:38,841 --> 02:02:40,280
where as not making them a better 
fighter.

2699
02:02:40,281 --> 02:02:42,260
He didn't knock dcl because at dick 
pills,

2700
02:02:42,261 --> 02:02:43,350
that's crazy.
No,

2701
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:47,570
it has to do with great skill and 
beautiful left high kick.

2702
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:50,360
That's what it was.
And he recognize that tendency,

2703
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:52,100
you know,
DC knows he has,

2704
02:02:52,101 --> 02:02:53,580
you know,
uh,

2705
02:02:53,900 --> 02:02:58,900
but with this whole Usada process,
it just became an it drug on because w,

2706
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:01,190
you know,
we said to them,

2707
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:04,670
I'm not going to take a punishment.
And they said we won't.

2708
02:03:04,730 --> 02:03:09,440
We're not giving you any option on this.
And so that's negotiation.

2709
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:12,260
What happens with.
One of the things that I've talked about

2710
02:03:12,261 --> 02:03:13,094
when it comes to police officers is that
when you have police officers and you 

2711
02:03:15,811 --> 02:03:16,644
know,
people that are trying to arrest it 

2712
02:03:16,911 --> 02:03:19,310
becomes a game.
And I don't mean a game in terms of it's

2713
02:03:19,311 --> 02:03:20,144
bullshit.
I mean it's a game in terms of one 

2714
02:03:21,351 --> 02:03:24,650
person's trying to win and they're 
trying to get people in a restaurant.

2715
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:28,370
And this is why people plant guns and 
plant drugs trying to win.

2716
02:03:28,730 --> 02:03:31,040
And that's what killed me was that,
to me,

2717
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:33,960
in my opinion,
you sata was trying to win.

2718
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:35,293
It was more important for them to win 
than it was for us to have a clean 

2719
02:03:38,121 --> 02:03:38,954
sport.
This comes back to what we're talking 

2720
02:03:39,921 --> 02:03:40,754
about earlier when it comes to arguments
and discussions that people oftentimes 

2721
02:03:44,091 --> 02:03:46,460
are not really searching for the truth.
They just want to be right?

2722
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:47,713
Yes.
And I've had this argument about 

2723
02:03:48,501 --> 02:03:49,900
bureaucracies in general,
right?

2724
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:51,830
And this goes to,
this isn't just about,

2725
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:52,723
you know,
not Usada and they're bureaucratic 

2726
02:03:53,781 --> 02:03:56,450
elements tie like the government or 
other things.

2727
02:03:56,451 --> 02:03:58,340
So you come and you say,
Oh,

2728
02:03:58,341 --> 02:04:00,870
you fucked up.
And then the bureaucracies go,

2729
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:03,110
shit,
we didn't fuck up.

2730
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:06,470
And they're going to say we didn't fuck 
up to the very.

2731
02:04:06,590 --> 02:04:07,423
They'll take that to the very longest 
lever until either a they'll scape goat 

2732
02:04:10,071 --> 02:04:12,530
someone or be they can figure out a way 
that they didn't.

2733
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:17,690
Because looking,
making a mistake on a bureaucratic level

2734
02:04:17,870 --> 02:04:20,210
makes it seem like,
okay,

2735
02:04:20,211 --> 02:04:21,740
well fuck if we.
And here's the thing.

2736
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:23,870
If you saw to says,
oh,

2737
02:04:23,871 --> 02:04:25,510
you know,
you're not you,

2738
02:04:25,530 --> 02:04:26,363
you didn't,
you're not going to get punished than 

2739
02:04:28,011 --> 02:04:29,780
two means,
and you'll Romero go,

2740
02:04:30,910 --> 02:04:32,660
uh,
why did I get punished?

2741
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:33,980
Or if they,
if you sat down and say,

2742
02:04:34,010 --> 02:04:34,843
Oh,
well,

2743
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:36,630
you know,
that was a miss,

2744
02:04:36,670 --> 02:04:37,950
that,
that was a mistake.

2745
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:40,140
Well,
if that was a mistake,

2746
02:04:40,141 --> 02:04:40,930
well then,
hey,

2747
02:04:40,930 --> 02:04:43,290
I got fucked on that mistake.
You don't take care of me.

2748
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:48,360
So no drug testing is bad,
but too much oversight is also bad.

2749
02:04:48,361 --> 02:04:49,194
I think that a clean sport is okay and 
the idea of the random testing and all 

2750
02:04:53,251 --> 02:04:54,084
is fine,
but you can't do it at the expense of 

2751
02:04:57,691 --> 02:04:58,524
the athletes in that we're in the 
administration of the testing that 

2752
02:05:01,981 --> 02:05:03,690
you're trying to blast them.

2753
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:04,523
Like these three Brazilian guys that 
just got busted over contamination that 

2754
02:05:08,461 --> 02:05:11,840
they traced back to a compounding 
pharmacy when things.

2755
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:13,043
This is just recent.
So you got three different guys in the 

2756
02:05:14,911 --> 02:05:15,744
UFC and they were all getting 
supplements from a compounding pharmacy 

2757
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:20,363
and everything was traced back to it.
It almost seems like you shouldn't take 

2758
02:05:22,771 --> 02:05:24,060
any fucking supplements.
Well,

2759
02:05:24,061 --> 02:05:25,620
that's the other thing is you'll do we,
are,

2760
02:05:25,621 --> 02:05:27,420
we not allowed to take anything,
anything at all?

2761
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,070
Nothing.
No on it.

2762
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:30,570
What are supplements?
What do they do?

2763
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:32,570
They help your performance.
You know what I mean?

2764
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:34,400
Should you take no performance and 
answers?

2765
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:36,570
Should we take nothing?
She just eat food.

2766
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:37,643
I mean,
it's got to be someone out there as 

2767
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:39,093
well.
There's food that will enhance your 

2768
02:05:39,691 --> 02:05:40,950
performance too,
right?

2769
02:05:41,070 --> 02:05:43,310
Like kangaroo meat.
The Frank Mir took it,

2770
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:46,080
take some bad kangaroo meat and oh man,
that kangaroo meat.

2771
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:48,720
You get a good pump on that.
First of all,

2772
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,870
ain't nobody giving steroids to 
Kangaroos.

2773
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:54,120
Kangaroos are fucking everywhere.
Investigation.

2774
02:05:54,121 --> 02:05:57,540
Identify as compounding pharmacies.
The source of tainted supplements behind

2775
02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:01,510
three positive Almeda and Antonio and 
yeah,

2776
02:06:01,670 --> 02:06:03,930
a minotauro.
And here's the weird thing.

2777
02:06:03,931 --> 02:06:07,500
So it comes all the way down to it and 
then they're there.

2778
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:10,020
Highlight on this is.
And you know,

2779
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:12,180
they've,
we put give him a suspension that,

2780
02:06:12,200 --> 02:06:13,033
but at the time has already lapsed so 
they won't actually have to serve any 

2781
02:06:15,171 --> 02:06:15,711
time.
It's like,

2782
02:06:15,711 --> 02:06:19,350
but you just fucking suspended them 
nonetheless.

2783
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:20,910
Yeah.
You didn't have to do that.

2784
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:22,403
So they took seven or eight months or 
whatever for this get cleared up and 

2785
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:28,230
that's unfortunate.
Junior tested positive for a diuretic.

2786
02:06:28,231 --> 02:06:29,760
Is that correct?
That's what it was.

2787
02:06:29,761 --> 02:06:32,220
Which hydrochloric or something?
Either diarrhetic,

2788
02:06:32,221 --> 02:06:33,950
which is crazy because he's a fucking 
heavy one.

2789
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:37,110
Losing any weight junior's not on the 
high side of heavyweight.

2790
02:06:37,111 --> 02:06:37,944
He's not like a to 65 God.
It's kind of way to make the upper 

2791
02:06:40,441 --> 02:06:41,274
limit.
Like he's just trying to keep those 

2792
02:06:41,791 --> 02:06:43,310
wrinkles out of his face.
Just trying to look good.

2793
02:06:43,330 --> 02:06:45,830
Maybe just.
Does diarrhetics make you look good?

2794
02:06:45,831 --> 02:06:46,560
Look,
I don't know.

2795
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,540
I don't think that makes it herself.

2796
02:06:50,910 --> 02:06:53,940
It just pulls all the polls.
All the water on bones.

2797
02:06:53,941 --> 02:06:55,560
Jones,
keep in mind life is a journey.

2798
02:06:55,561 --> 02:06:58,080
Not a race.
God's will for me to be there.

2799
02:06:58,081 --> 02:06:58,891
Blah,
blah,

2800
02:06:58,891 --> 02:06:59,724
blah,
blah.

2801
02:06:59,910 --> 02:07:00,743
Let's not forget.
I'm still the youngest guy in the top 

2802
02:07:01,591 --> 02:07:02,700
five of heavyweight and light 
everywhere.

2803
02:07:02,701 --> 02:07:05,280
Yeah,
he is young.

2804
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:06,840
What does that.
What is unique?

2805
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:10,440
What does that someone's account.
Oh,

2806
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:11,383
is he responding to.
Somebody tweeted that the couple of 

2807
02:07:13,101 --> 02:07:16,680
hours ago.
It's up to a four year old right now.

2808
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:17,873
He remains a provisional suspension of 
wind and the outcome of the situation 

2809
02:07:20,401 --> 02:07:24,570
with Usada after testing positive for 
steroids last July,

2810
02:07:24,571 --> 02:07:26,920
following the Naca one of for me,
um,

2811
02:07:27,120 --> 02:07:30,540
was it a steroid?
A man?

2812
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:31,374
I couldn't tell you.
John faces up to four years suspension 

2813
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:36,490
due to second violation.
Universities anti-doping

2814
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:38,770
Pov is policy,
but obviously young son ever champion.

2815
02:07:39,070 --> 02:07:42,490
But obviously first of all when it says 
second violation,

2816
02:07:42,491 --> 02:07:44,980
the first violation was proven to be 
something tainted.

2817
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:48,160
So he's not.
When you say violation,

2818
02:07:48,161 --> 02:07:51,490
I want,
I want to hear this guy took steroids.

2819
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:52,503
He took steroids because he was trying 
to get a performance enhancing a result 

2820
02:07:55,931 --> 02:07:58,000
from it.
Suspend that guy.

2821
02:07:58,430 --> 02:07:59,740
Don't want to hear,
oh,

2822
02:07:59,741 --> 02:08:00,574
he got toothpaste.
It's from China and had fucking 

2823
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:04,060
something in it.
You remember that too.

2824
02:08:04,061 --> 02:08:04,894
Don't.
You wouldn't have a fucking crazy story 

2825
02:08:05,801 --> 02:08:08,980
about the toothpaste that had some 
poison in it or something that they were

2826
02:08:08,981 --> 02:08:10,560
selling in China.
Now what was that?

2827
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:14,750
Some wild shit.
Who was a toothpaste in China?

2828
02:08:14,760 --> 02:08:17,290
The poison in it.
Vaguely remembering this.

2829
02:08:17,291 --> 02:08:18,880
I just said it just because it sounds 
stupid,

2830
02:08:18,910 --> 02:08:22,540
but it's really just made it up and all 
of a sudden it's true.

2831
02:08:22,570 --> 02:08:25,420
It's probably in the back of my memory 
somewhere that I just.

2832
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:26,353
I hear what you're saying.
The toothpaste the made in China found 

2833
02:08:28,721 --> 02:08:30,510
us.
She'll get her fresh.

2834
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,300
Sure.
Fresh.

2835
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:32,021
Sure.
For this,

2836
02:08:32,021 --> 02:08:34,270
like some people that don't really 
understand English.

2837
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:35,280
Sure.
What?

2838
02:08:35,281 --> 02:08:38,560
What does that mean?
I don't know how she'll very good.

2839
02:08:38,770 --> 02:08:40,180
Shira.
Shelf fresh.

2840
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:44,980
I think it's a Chinese romanization door
in Maine.

2841
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:48,220
They're trying to kill people in.
Oh yeah.

2842
02:08:48,221 --> 02:08:50,460
It's one of those green up there for.
What is it?

2843
02:08:50,461 --> 02:08:51,820
What was in it?
Antifreeze.

2844
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:52,810
Okay,
cool.

2845
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:54,040
Cool.
It's main.

2846
02:08:54,130 --> 02:08:54,963
Look at how cold it gets up there.
Why wouldn't you need people that know 

2847
02:08:57,180 --> 02:08:58,800
that they were doing a good job,
but I don't want to.

2848
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:01,350
Teeth falling out.
Freeze and shattering glass.

2849
02:09:02,330 --> 02:09:06,220
Little propylene glycol.
Oh,

2850
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:10,930
I'm 100 percent for testing.
I'm 100 percent for them stopping people

2851
02:09:10,931 --> 02:09:14,560
from taking performance enhancing drugs,
but this sounds very heavy handed.

2852
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:15,543
It was just an ime.
I had no problem with the system and 

2853
02:09:17,411 --> 02:09:21,070
then this,
the way it unfolded to me,

2854
02:09:21,071 --> 02:09:22,200
it was just like,
this is,

2855
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:23,133
I don't,
I don't need to be fighting multiple 

2856
02:09:24,281 --> 02:09:25,114
fronts.
What I'm just trying to do everything I 

2857
02:09:26,411 --> 02:09:29,110
can to stay as in this as an athlete.
Now,

2858
02:09:29,111 --> 02:09:31,480
when you first started,
I mean you want to UFC heavyweight title

2859
02:09:31,481 --> 02:09:35,290
in 2001 two at 24 years old,
young,

2860
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:36,560
sever.
Um,

2861
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:39,310
when you won,
that meant everybody was on some shit.

2862
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:42,450
It was just,
it was the beginning of the cleanup.

2863
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:43,900
He was everywhere.
And,

2864
02:09:44,010 --> 02:09:46,810
and even then going into the Nevada 
state athletic commission,

2865
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:49,870
previous to that,
before Zuph have bought the UFC,

2866
02:09:50,170 --> 02:09:53,080
the idea of having giant fights in Vegas
was fucking,

2867
02:09:53,110 --> 02:09:55,420
oh,
when it was not a possibility,

2868
02:09:55,421 --> 02:09:56,560
no,
he's not going to happen.

2869
02:09:56,590 --> 02:09:58,060
So,
and even then like,

2870
02:09:58,061 --> 02:10:02,320
uh,
the testing back in 2002,

2871
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:07,460
that wasn't official per se,
it was like she was like,

2872
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:10,620
it was esther over him when he fought 
Brock Lesnar fucked 2002.

2873
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:13,780
How about when we saw the ream when he 
was,

2874
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:16,470
when he was,
when he was ubering,

2875
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:19,480
when he fought Brock Lesnar,
Jesus fucking Christ.

2876
02:10:19,481 --> 02:10:20,314
Damn Comic Book Hero.
If I mean there is not a God damn drug 

2877
02:10:23,981 --> 02:10:26,690
testing agent alive that would have been
grabbing.

2878
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:31,090
He's clearly over $9,000
onto that guy.

2879
02:10:31,150 --> 02:10:33,610
Like get the picture of him on the 
scale.

2880
02:10:33,611 --> 02:10:34,970
Me.
That picture is amazing.

2881
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:36,500
Look at both of them.
Yeah,

2882
02:10:36,501 --> 02:10:41,090
they're both boxes,
but that one hold them down.

2883
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:43,100
Everybody would have been like,
hang on,

2884
02:10:43,101 --> 02:10:44,810
hang on.
What a needle even.

2885
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:47,120
Could you even get a needle in his vein?
Dude,

2886
02:10:47,121 --> 02:10:50,480
he's just pings Benz.
He was so jacked.

2887
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:51,793
This part of me just wishes he would 
leave and go to Japan and go right back 

2888
02:10:54,801 --> 02:10:55,940
to it.
You know,

2889
02:10:55,970 --> 02:10:57,170
just fill them up.

2890
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:02,150
I mean,
look,

2891
02:11:02,151 --> 02:11:04,190
everybody knew what the fuck it was back
then.

2892
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:05,930
I mean,
it's interesting.

2893
02:11:05,931 --> 02:11:09,890
Like brock lesnar being back,
brock lesner is not asking for over him.

2894
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:10,763
Over him was the last guy to really fuck
him up and he wants to fight DC and he 

2895
02:11:14,430 --> 02:11:16,430
over.
He was just not the same guy anymore.

2896
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:17,293
No,
you're not.

2897
02:11:17,370 --> 02:11:21,050
He does not perform at the same level as
he does.

2898
02:11:21,051 --> 02:11:22,040
Still.
Very good.

2899
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:23,840
It's still very dangerous.
Here's the thing.

2900
02:11:23,841 --> 02:11:25,160
Even when he was a two,
oh,

2901
02:11:25,161 --> 02:11:26,000
five pounder,
right.

2902
02:11:26,001 --> 02:11:30,200
And he had a tendency to gas up gas out 
and get,

2903
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:31,910
you know,
be Chiney to a degree,

2904
02:11:31,911 --> 02:11:36,470
but he was always super technical,
highly skilled,

2905
02:11:36,570 --> 02:11:37,403
like I don't think you could overeem.
Him and his brother both are actually 

2906
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:43,160
very good fighters.
Yeah.

2907
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:44,990
And you know,
their struggles.

2908
02:11:44,991 --> 02:11:47,660
I've never been a physical one for the 
most part.

2909
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:48,201
I think,
you know,

2910
02:11:48,201 --> 02:11:50,370
they've had.
And that's a difficulty that,

2911
02:11:50,410 --> 02:11:53,510
that is most common amongst fighters is 
the mental game of it.

2912
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:55,820
Well,
we saw that within Ghana this week.

2913
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:59,390
We've seen the fight,
but I heard it was one for the ages.

2914
02:11:59,570 --> 02:12:00,403
It was one for the ages.
Someone who just let some lions loosen 

2915
02:12:02,631 --> 02:12:03,830
that thing and just like,
okay,

2916
02:12:03,831 --> 02:12:04,664
let's crank this up a bit.
It was the worst heavyweight fight I've 

2917
02:12:06,111 --> 02:12:08,340
ever seen.
It was the worst one in mind,

2918
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:13,360
but it came down to,
it came down to the sea.

2919
02:12:13,910 --> 02:12:17,570
It was the second lowest output fight 
ever.

2920
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:18,733
A demo,
they couldn't even make it the lowest 

2921
02:12:19,881 --> 02:12:22,100
output fight to be number one.
I didn't even get to number one.

2922
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:24,470
Number one,
they failed that failing.

2923
02:12:24,710 --> 02:12:29,710
Jens pulver versus jaw hoke from like a 
fucking ufc 13 or some shit.

2924
02:12:31,540 --> 02:12:36,540
You know what day that fight was,
but that fight was number one with 23 or

2925
02:12:38,361 --> 02:12:39,194
22 strikes landed in three rounds and 
this fight was number two with 23 

2926
02:12:44,091 --> 02:12:45,020
strikes landed.

2927
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:46,340
That's weird,
dude.

2928
02:12:46,341 --> 02:12:48,580
It was insane.
And then overeat.

2929
02:12:48,581 --> 02:12:52,310
I mean Francis go to Francis and Ganos a
instagram.

2930
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:53,233
He released a statement today and his 
statement was essentially that he was 

2931
02:12:56,660 --> 02:12:58,550
over.
He carried the fear.

2932
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:00,530
He said,
I'm not proud of my last performance.

2933
02:13:00,531 --> 02:13:04,100
I have carried my fear from the last 
fight to this one.

2934
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:07,490
I completely understand the frustration.
Anger that has caused my fans,

2935
02:13:07,491 --> 02:13:08,480
coaches,
teammates,

2936
02:13:08,481 --> 02:13:09,314
and family and friends.
Weird that he would have fear from the 

2937
02:13:11,031 --> 02:13:14,870
last time we cut.
Fucking owned wrestle,

2938
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:15,823
but he didn't know he.
He thought he was the man and then he 

2939
02:13:18,891 --> 02:13:22,010
got owned and then won't.
But he's letting everyone down again.

2940
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,770
All I can do now is proved myself and 
make you proud again.

2941
02:13:24,771 --> 02:13:27,530
But look at this picture that he puts up
his swinging on him,

2942
02:13:27,590 --> 02:13:28,560
him,
him connected,

2943
02:13:28,610 --> 02:13:30,050
one punch.
I mean,

2944
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:31,830
that's kind of funny.

2945
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,840
It should've been him with his head 
down,

2946
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:36,270
Francis in the future.
If you're gonna,

2947
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:38,430
if you're gonna post a humble shot.
Look humble.

2948
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:40,880
There's this is like I'm following him.

2949
02:13:40,910 --> 02:13:44,110
I can't say that,
that he doesn't legitimately made.

2950
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:44,953
Maybe he is carrying some kind of fear 
from the last fight in terms of losing 

2951
02:13:48,981 --> 02:13:51,680
the result or is a lot of mind.
Fuck.

2952
02:13:51,681 --> 02:13:54,340
That can go into being a fighter.
But uh,

2953
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:56,200
I think with

2954
02:13:56,320 --> 02:14:00,370
bounced back,
you've been on both sides and you know,

2955
02:14:00,550 --> 02:14:04,390
the first fight back after a kale loss 
or after getting dominated,

2956
02:14:04,391 --> 02:14:05,500
what is that feeling like?

2957
02:14:07,060 --> 02:14:07,893
Oh,
that's a good.

2958
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:11,360
I don't know.
I've been at this shit for so long.

2959
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:13,130
For me it's just like,
all right,

2960
02:14:13,131 --> 02:14:15,890
that was then.
This is now don't make the same mistakes

2961
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:16,973
you've experienced

2962
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:20,220
everything you've been submitted,
you've been knocked out,

2963
02:14:20,221 --> 02:14:22,110
you've knock guys out,
you submitted guys.

2964
02:14:22,111 --> 02:14:22,944
You've won the title.
You beat some of the best guys in the 

2965
02:14:24,571 --> 02:14:26,670
world.
You've had fantastic performances.

2966
02:14:26,671 --> 02:14:28,440
You'd have performances that frustrated 
you,

2967
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:32,230
you've experienced at all you've got in 
your long career.

2968
02:14:32,231 --> 02:14:34,230
I mean,
from being the youngest ever heavyweight

2969
02:14:34,231 --> 02:14:36,900
champion of the world ever.
To.

2970
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:38,220
How old are you now?
40,

2971
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:39,421
42,
dude.

2972
02:14:39,421 --> 02:14:42,150
You fucking seen it all.
You've literally seen it all.

2973
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:44,280
How long do you think you can do?

2974
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:46,000
Uh,
I don't know,

2975
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:49,870
but I'm planning to run it out.
You do also have a lot more in Japan,

2976
02:14:49,871 --> 02:14:51,370
bro.
Keep going.

2977
02:14:51,490 --> 02:14:52,323
I also have this bad habit that need 
cash for 55 Pontiac's don't get built 

2978
02:15:00,281 --> 02:15:04,480
and put into a 75 trans ams firebirds 
for free.

2979
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:05,590
Well,
sometimes they do.

2980
02:15:05,650 --> 02:15:07,320
If you have the time,
that's anything.

2981
02:15:07,360 --> 02:15:10,120
How are you going to work on your car 
when you're off all over the world doing

2982
02:15:10,121 --> 02:15:11,210
all this shit,
right?

2983
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:13,970
Doing seminars and doing pro wrestling 
commentary.

2984
02:15:13,990 --> 02:15:15,820
All my fighters,
I had two guys just fight,

2985
02:15:15,850 --> 02:15:19,810
uh,
last Friday at cxf in Burbank.

2986
02:15:19,990 --> 02:15:21,410
One of them defended his title,
Aga,

2987
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,180
Brian,
the other ones.

2988
02:15:22,180 --> 02:15:24,880
Show him a photo on his fight.
And for people who don't know,

2989
02:15:24,881 --> 02:15:29,320
that's not lucrative to train fighters.
I mean at the very highest level,

2990
02:15:29,321 --> 02:15:31,330
it's barely lucrative.
Barely.

2991
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:32,250
Yeah.
I'm not.

2992
02:15:32,250 --> 02:15:34,120
This isn't a money thing.

2993
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:34,953
This is a passion project training guys 
out of with Jim at the UFC gym in La 

2994
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:42,790
Mirada,
let's use it for a fantastic feat.

2995
02:15:42,850 --> 02:15:45,160
And we get use of all 55,000
square feet.

2996
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:46,173
Oh,
that's nice.

2997
02:15:46,180 --> 02:15:47,850
We also work a lot with,
uh,

2998
02:15:47,890 --> 02:15:51,440
Chad George has a gym called Cmma and 
we'll send them.

2999
02:15:51,450 --> 02:15:55,550
We'll go down there to.
Nice was good comradery between Marotta.

3000
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:58,180
Where's that at?
Like Northern Orange County.

3001
02:15:58,350 --> 02:15:59,230
Okay.
I would say.

3002
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:00,940
Yeah.
Is it like,

3003
02:16:00,941 --> 02:16:03,850
um,
what's it like northern orange?

3004
02:16:03,851 --> 02:16:04,684
It was the border of Orange County where
it's like at that border it's either 

3005
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:08,883
southern,
most la county or northern most orange 

3006
02:16:11,681 --> 02:16:13,120
county.
It's that kind of thing.

3007
02:16:14,130 --> 02:16:16,390
Yeah,
those UFC gyms are fucking bad ass.

3008
02:16:16,510 --> 02:16:18,520
They are great job.
Super Nice.

3009
02:16:18,521 --> 02:16:20,740
And plus they've been an opportunity for
fighters.

3010
02:16:20,741 --> 02:16:25,030
I think cub and bisping also have stakes
in some.

3011
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:26,320
Cj does is.

3012
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:29,110
Well I believe Frankie Edgar does.
Frankie has one in Tom's.

3013
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:31,753
Yeah,
there's a,

3014
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:34,240
there's quite a few of them now.
I mean they're all over the place.

3015
02:16:34,570 --> 02:16:35,403
If you look for a place to hit the heavy
bag and workout and lift weights and 

3016
02:16:37,961 --> 02:16:38,920
martial arts classes,

3017
02:16:39,470 --> 02:16:43,070
cages and maths and all that and so we 
use those facilities.

3018
02:16:43,071 --> 02:16:46,010
They've been really great to us and 
yeah,

3019
02:16:46,011 --> 02:16:48,260
with these,
these kids that I work with and they are

3020
02:16:48,261 --> 02:16:49,094
pretty much kids.
It's just about trying to help people 

3021
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:54,740
achieve work towards the things that 
they want as an athlete,

3022
02:16:54,741 --> 02:16:55,574
but also they're good people that I want
to see them make the most out of their 

3023
02:16:58,611 --> 02:17:00,350
life,
you know,

3024
02:17:00,590 --> 02:17:01,423
so I'm trying to be a person that can be
a positive influence in terms of 

3025
02:17:05,490 --> 02:17:10,250
bringing philosophy and ethics to their 
life and helping them be good people and

3026
02:17:10,370 --> 02:17:13,900
to pass that kind of shit on b,
the ripple in the water that the drop in

3027
02:17:13,910 --> 02:17:14,743
the water that sends ripples out,
that makes a positive effect on other 

3028
02:17:16,791 --> 02:17:17,150
folks.

3029
02:17:17,150 --> 02:17:19,610
Throw you a poet.
What the fuck?

3030
02:17:19,750 --> 02:17:22,370
No Bro.
Just sometimes it just comes to me,

3031
02:17:22,371 --> 02:17:23,204
man.
You should put that on an instagram 

3032
02:17:23,811 --> 02:17:24,644
picture and show your butt because 
that's where a lot of those girls do 

3033
02:17:27,890 --> 02:17:28,690
that,
but,

3034
02:17:28,690 --> 02:17:30,680
and then they have like something about,
you know,

3035
02:17:30,681 --> 02:17:31,514
don't like net negativity into your life
because the ripples of that negativity 

3036
02:17:34,311 --> 02:17:37,580
can infect the people around you and you
don't want that stay positive.

3037
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:42,140
Look on my ass.
Fucking pull up on them on these.

3038
02:17:42,230 --> 02:17:45,110
Look at peach.
Yeah.

3039
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:46,713
Um,
I think that UFC gym is a brilliant 

3040
02:17:48,591 --> 02:17:50,930
thing to brilliant move because if I'm 
like,

3041
02:17:51,050 --> 02:17:54,020
if I see 24 hour fitness and it's right 
next to the UFC gym,

3042
02:17:54,021 --> 02:17:54,650
like,
oh,

3043
02:17:54,650 --> 02:17:56,660
fucking heavy bags.
Everything.

3044
02:17:56,710 --> 02:17:58,400
What the fights are on TV.
Yes.

3045
02:17:58,460 --> 02:17:59,510
Put that on.
They also,

3046
02:17:59,511 --> 02:18:01,880
uh,
at least the one in La Mirada has like a

3047
02:18:01,881 --> 02:18:04,760
whole little section that has astroturf 
down and all that.

3048
02:18:04,930 --> 02:18:05,763
Little with ladders that have been 
painted into it so he can do foot 

3049
02:18:07,761 --> 02:18:08,340
drills.
Oh,

3050
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:11,840
nice.
They've got a sleds and tires and shit.

3051
02:18:11,910 --> 02:18:12,743
You mean.
So you can do other nonconventional 

3052
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:15,520
workouts,
kettlebells.

3053
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:18,040
So they have it really like a real 
strength and condition.

3054
02:18:18,041 --> 02:18:18,741
Yes.
Yes.

3055
02:18:18,741 --> 02:18:20,590
I mean,
you can do really anything.

3056
02:18:20,591 --> 02:18:23,270
They have a whole setup of trx is and 
shit like that shit.

3057
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:24,770
Yeah,
that's bad ass.

3058
02:18:25,190 --> 02:18:25,990
Yeah.
That's,

3059
02:18:25,990 --> 02:18:29,090
I mean that's what you want from a gym 
when you go to a lot of gyms,

3060
02:18:29,091 --> 02:18:31,040
they just don't have that kind of stuff.
You know,

3061
02:18:31,041 --> 02:18:32,660
they have your standard stuff,
you know,

3062
02:18:32,900 --> 02:18:35,330
machines and shake,
you could lift with.

3063
02:18:35,331 --> 02:18:37,100
It's just not,
not quite good enough

3064
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:39,290
that I agree.
And so this gives you that,

3065
02:18:39,291 --> 02:18:40,124
that full spectrum to,
to work in whatever ways you want to 

3066
02:18:43,041 --> 02:18:43,640
just about.

3067
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:45,620
Would you be interested in owning your 
own gym?

3068
02:18:45,630 --> 02:18:47,900
Sometimes I think about it.
I do.

3069
02:18:47,930 --> 02:18:48,950
I wouldn't mind having it,
having

3070
02:18:48,950 --> 02:18:51,050
my own gym,
but it's just such a,

3071
02:18:52,140 --> 02:18:53,840
I don't want to,
burden isn't the right word,

3072
02:18:53,841 --> 02:18:55,670
but there's just a lot of responsibility
that comes with it,

3073
02:18:55,671 --> 02:18:56,504
you know,
the overhead of having a place and 

3074
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:59,740
creating a program,
uh,

3075
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:02,510
and having people manage and run those 
programs.

3076
02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:06,410
And with me being as busy as I am,
um,

3077
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:07,753
I wouldn't want to do anything half ass 
and I also don't want to commit to 

3078
02:19:11,601 --> 02:19:15,200
something and then not be able to put 
into it what I think is necessary.

3079
02:19:15,350 --> 02:19:17,450
You obviously love teaching.
I do.

3080
02:19:17,510 --> 02:19:18,790
I do love to teach.
Yeah.

3081
02:19:18,810 --> 02:19:20,600
I like,
for me,

3082
02:19:20,601 --> 02:19:23,810
it was such a big thing in my life,
the people,

3083
02:19:23,930 --> 02:19:28,190
not just in terms of athletics,
but the people mentored

3084
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,023
me and helped to mold and shape me and 
help give me the tools and sometimes a 

3085
02:19:33,201 --> 02:19:34,034
kick in the ass as needed to,
to move me along in life to get me to 

3086
02:19:36,831 --> 02:19:40,110
where I am today,
to give me not just in terms of what,

3087
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:42,890
what you would argue for is successful 
or not,

3088
02:19:42,891 --> 02:19:46,700
but just to be the person that I am.
And while far from perfect,

3089
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:47,710
uh,
you know,

3090
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:48,553
I can't,
I can't think about exchanging bad 

3091
02:19:53,631 --> 02:19:55,520
moments for different moments in my 
life.

3092
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:58,190
For the fear of that.
I wouldn't be who I am today.

3093
02:19:59,020 --> 02:19:59,853
You know,
a Nietzsche talks about eternal 

3094
02:20:00,711 --> 02:20:03,150
recurrence.
And one of the idea of that is that,

3095
02:20:03,190 --> 02:20:04,880
um,
and your loneliest,

3096
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:07,310
loneliest,
have a demon showed up and it said,

3097
02:20:07,311 --> 02:20:08,144
well,
you're going to live your life in every 

3098
02:20:08,871 --> 02:20:12,980
way as you ever have in every single 
aspect of it.

3099
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:14,091
It's like,
well,

3100
02:20:14,091 --> 02:20:18,050
you have to have to be okay with that.
You have to live a life that,

3101
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:18,933
that,
that's,

3102
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:22,820
that's reasonable,
that you would be fine with doing it all

3103
02:20:22,821 --> 02:20:24,410
over again.
Doing it all over again.

3104
02:20:24,411 --> 02:20:25,244
If you're going to become,
if you're going to be specific 

3105
02:20:26,171 --> 02:20:28,100
specificity,
better like pushing a rock up a hill,

3106
02:20:29,090 --> 02:20:30,890
right?
Whatever mistakes you've made,

3107
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:32,570
they have made you who you are right 
now.

3108
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:33,433
Correct.
As long as it's not catastrophic to the 

3109
02:20:35,091 --> 02:20:35,924
point where you've caused a loss of life
or someone's devastated and destroyed 

3110
02:20:38,901 --> 02:20:40,550
someone else's life,
you hope not.

3111
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:42,280
I hope not.
I mean,

3112
02:20:42,470 --> 02:20:46,640
I know it's interesting thing like that.
There's the concept of reincarnation.

3113
02:20:46,641 --> 02:20:49,040
There's many concepts with one of them 
is the,

3114
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:50,023
one of the most,
a haunting for some people is that you 

3115
02:20:52,641 --> 02:20:53,474
will live your life over again.
Exactly the same way until you get it 

3116
02:20:56,301 --> 02:20:56,810
right.

3117
02:20:56,810 --> 02:20:59,270
I actually heard Leo Gracie talking 
about this once,

3118
02:21:00,050 --> 02:21:01,790
that everything in your life,
every mistake,

3119
02:21:02,030 --> 02:21:04,730
every choice you make,
if you do not do the correct thing,

3120
02:21:04,731 --> 02:21:07,820
he believed that you would have to come 
back again and do it all over again.

3121
02:21:07,821 --> 02:21:10,040
Exactly the same way.
And this is his philosophy,

3122
02:21:10,041 --> 02:21:12,860
the way he lived his life.
That's terrifying for people.

3123
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,920
This idea that somehow or another you're
going almost like you're going to repeat

3124
02:21:15,921 --> 02:21:18,130
high school.
Sure you don't put.

3125
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:21,740
But here's how brutal,
brutal period of my life and my mind to.

3126
02:21:21,980 --> 02:21:22,813
But here's my question.
I think everybody's and the people who 

3127
02:21:25,311 --> 02:21:27,580
it wasn't brutal for those fucking 
people turn up,

3128
02:21:27,660 --> 02:21:32,150
be losers,
stories of that.

3129
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:34,600
The fucking homecoming king in this.
I mean,

3130
02:21:34,601 --> 02:21:36,370
that's like a fucking billy Joel Song.
Yeah,

3131
02:21:36,730 --> 02:21:39,280
the king and the queen of the Prom,
you know,

3132
02:21:39,550 --> 02:21:42,370
that's a scenes from an Italian 
restaurant that's,

3133
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:43,370
that's literally the,

3134
02:21:43,940 --> 02:21:46,040
the premise of that song.
I think it was,

3135
02:21:46,041 --> 02:21:47,240
uh,
it was,

3136
02:21:47,250 --> 02:21:48,170
uh,
um,

3137
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:49,950
a immortal song too.

3138
02:21:50,390 --> 02:21:51,223
Norway brand new and not with the 
populist and the king and the queen of 

3139
02:21:53,861 --> 02:21:57,860
the prom running around with the top 
down and the radio on.

3140
02:21:59,050 --> 02:21:59,883
Nobody looked any finer who is more of a
hit at the parkway diner and we never 

3141
02:22:03,701 --> 02:22:05,800
knew we could walk more than that.
I live.

3142
02:22:05,980 --> 02:22:10,980
Remember that I.
I don't know it as well as you do.

3143
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:13,153
It's a good song.
The idea of living your life over again 

3144
02:22:16,811 --> 02:22:19,510
is terrifying for people though.
The dying alone,

3145
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:22,360
but the living over and over and over 
again for a finisher,

3146
02:22:22,450 --> 02:22:24,130
but,
but why is that?

3147
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:27,690
When living right now,
it's fine for most of us.

3148
02:22:27,860 --> 02:22:29,040
I mean,
unless you're depressed,

3149
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:32,730
unless you depressing life to wreck 
living right now it's like,

3150
02:22:32,731 --> 02:22:33,564
okay,
I'm alive.

3151
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:34,560
I'm here,
I'm doing it.

3152
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:35,423
Sure.
Why scared to do it over and over and 

3153
02:22:36,421 --> 02:22:37,380
over.
We had forever.

3154
02:22:37,650 --> 02:22:41,580
It's a strange thing,
like there's something like the futility

3155
02:22:41,581 --> 02:22:42,414
of it all.
The idea that this is just a repeating 

3156
02:22:44,611 --> 02:22:46,650
cycle that's going to haunt you forever.

3157
02:22:47,050 --> 02:22:47,883
Well,
that would in the idea that there would 

3158
02:22:50,171 --> 02:22:53,470
be nothing that you could do to make any
effect to it.

3159
02:22:54,030 --> 02:22:58,270
I mean to Mifa even,
even still,

3160
02:22:58,271 --> 02:23:00,100
like I couldn't,
me personally,

3161
02:23:00,101 --> 02:23:02,490
I couldn't think of something that in 
terms of like a,

3162
02:23:02,540 --> 02:23:05,500
I want to do something that as a mental 
idea,

3163
02:23:05,501 --> 02:23:07,300
as a,
as a mind game,

3164
02:23:07,301 --> 02:23:08,134
that if I lived my life in a way that I 
could be okay with doing it all over 

3165
02:23:11,681 --> 02:23:13,210
again.
Just exactly the same way.

3166
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:14,413
And here's the other thing.
Would you know that it's gonna happen 

3167
02:23:16,061 --> 02:23:17,200
like that?
How could you.

3168
02:23:18,100 --> 02:23:19,680
Well,
there was a,

3169
02:23:20,060 --> 02:23:20,840
I got,
I,

3170
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:21,673
I wish I could remember who it was.
There was this philosopher who was 

3171
02:23:25,421 --> 02:23:26,254
saying that if you were given the 
ability to absolutely and utterly 

3172
02:23:31,781 --> 02:23:34,930
control your dreams and all aspects and 
elements of it.

3173
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:39,580
And so at first most people would,
would go to sleep and they would turn it

3174
02:23:39,581 --> 02:23:42,040
into every fucking wonderful thing 
they've ever wanted.

3175
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:44,290
They would just be the ultimate winner 
at everything all the time,

3176
02:23:44,291 --> 02:23:45,124
always.
And then they would get tired of that 

3177
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:50,050
and then they would create chaos and 
catastrophe in,

3178
02:23:50,051 --> 02:23:50,511
in,
in,

3179
02:23:50,511 --> 02:23:51,220
in,
you know,

3180
02:23:51,220 --> 02:23:52,053
make probably make everything is 
horrible for themselves and they could 

3181
02:23:54,431 --> 02:23:55,264
possibly do.
And as they're going through these 

3182
02:23:57,131 --> 02:23:57,964
cycles,
ultimately the one thing that you're 

3183
02:24:00,041 --> 02:24:03,190
going to end up wanting in the end is 
that you just don't know what's going to

3184
02:24:03,191 --> 02:24:04,024
happen at all.
Find by knowing everything prior to it 

3185
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:13,090
occurring,
it takes the want to experience it away.

3186
02:24:13,780 --> 02:24:17,320
Cormac McCarthy wrote a,
um,

3187
02:24:17,710 --> 02:24:20,740
how many people,
if they knew the path of their lives,

3188
02:24:20,741 --> 02:24:23,370
which still choose to live it,
woo.

3189
02:24:24,810 --> 02:24:26,760
Well,
there isn't that ultimately expressed by

3190
02:24:26,761 --> 02:24:29,100
fighting,
like fighting is the ultimate expression

3191
02:24:29,101 --> 02:24:29,934
of that.
Because when you step into that cage of 

3192
02:24:31,711 --> 02:24:34,790
it's just you and you're looking at 
another guy who's a,

3193
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:39,800
a legitimate top flight mixed martial 
artists and you really don't know.

3194
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:44,680
I have a theory about fighting and that 
fighting is actually a,

3195
02:24:45,190 --> 02:24:49,270
not the only,
but a great conduit into what I think of

3196
02:24:49,271 --> 02:24:54,271
as the highest point of,
of being as a human being.

3197
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:55,803
That you can enter into this state,
that it's not a place that you can 

3198
02:24:59,771 --> 02:25:01,060
exist.
That all the time,

3199
02:25:01,150 --> 02:25:05,040
like it's just not possible.
But when you breach it,

3200
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:06,223
it is.
If you are so alive and you were at 

3201
02:25:10,870 --> 02:25:14,440
your,
the peak of being at that moment,

3202
02:25:14,920 --> 02:25:15,753
and even though it is,
it is brought on through through being 

3203
02:25:17,831 --> 02:25:20,710
in the the intensity and the stress of 
combat,

3204
02:25:22,270 --> 02:25:26,990
it's as every aspect of your being is 
charged in electric,

3205
02:25:27,010 --> 02:25:27,843
in and living and being,
but it's not a place that you could be 

3206
02:25:30,551 --> 02:25:33,580
at all the time.
You would just be a maniac,

3207
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:34,513
right?
It's not a place that human beings can 

3208
02:25:35,441 --> 02:25:38,710
exist in for more than maybe short 
periods of time.

3209
02:25:39,660 --> 02:25:41,170
Hm.
Well,

3210
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:44,690
your senses have to be insanely 
heightened.

3211
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:46,020
Your,
your you.

3212
02:25:46,050 --> 02:25:48,290
The consequences of your actions are 
grave.

3213
02:25:48,291 --> 02:25:49,124
The only thing that really is elevated 
passed out as war and one of the things 

3214
02:25:52,971 --> 02:25:57,230
that you find about war and Sebastian 
younger wrote about this in his book,

3215
02:25:57,231 --> 02:25:58,064
tribe,
is that the people that experienced it 

3216
02:25:59,511 --> 02:26:02,450
have an incredibly difficult time 
adjusting to regular life.

3217
02:26:02,510 --> 02:26:03,343
Sure,
and they really miss it and want to go 

3218
02:26:04,461 --> 02:26:05,810
back to it because they never felt more.

3219
02:26:06,020 --> 02:26:08,670
I believe that that war is a similar 
place.

3220
02:26:08,671 --> 02:26:13,320
I think that when you are faced with 
death that that is a,

3221
02:26:13,470 --> 02:26:17,040
a conduit to bringing you towards that 
highest point of,

3222
02:26:17,090 --> 02:26:19,170
of being.
And uh,

3223
02:26:20,310 --> 02:26:21,143
yeah,
I suppose it's like that once you get 

3224
02:26:22,981 --> 02:26:26,490
past that point of view,
there is no fear at that level either.

3225
02:26:26,580 --> 02:26:28,290
It is just an,
it is a way.

3226
02:26:28,291 --> 02:26:30,750
It's just an existence you don't 
consider.

3227
02:26:30,751 --> 02:26:31,584
You don't think,
you don't think something isn't this or 

3228
02:26:34,621 --> 02:26:35,454
that.
It just is and it's a place that you 

3229
02:26:39,841 --> 02:26:41,460
can't be forever,
wouldn't,

3230
02:26:41,550 --> 02:26:46,550
it doesn't work that way.
But when you've been there and here just

3231
02:26:46,620 --> 02:26:50,820
out here dealing with petty again,
Internet trolls and dumb shit and people

3232
02:26:50,821 --> 02:26:51,654
doing stuff that,
that cut their nose to spite their face 

3233
02:26:53,371 --> 02:26:54,204
and undermining this and you know,
the fabric of our relationships for no 

3234
02:26:57,181 --> 02:26:58,580
good reason.
It's,

3235
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:00,480
it's tough to,
to sit in,

3236
02:27:00,481 --> 02:27:02,130
exist in this and go fuck,
you know,

3237
02:27:02,131 --> 02:27:06,150
I how,
how do you get back to that other thing,

3238
02:27:06,210 --> 02:27:07,650
this,
this state of purity,

3239
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:13,340
this existence of where these,
none of those things matter anymore.

3240
02:27:14,660 --> 02:27:16,630
I don't know if you can,
I mean you,

3241
02:27:16,640 --> 02:27:17,690
you might have.
I mean,

3242
02:27:17,691 --> 02:27:18,524
look,
we have a certain amount of time on 

3243
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:21,470
this,
on this planet,

3244
02:27:21,471 --> 02:27:22,490
in this life,
right?

3245
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:25,040
You have a 100 years.
If everything goes great,

3246
02:27:25,550 --> 02:27:29,060
you can't really expect to just live in 
that.

3247
02:27:30,440 --> 02:27:35,440
That perfect state of both chaos and and

3248
02:27:40,110 --> 02:27:45,110
chaos and I guess being in the moment 
there's something about something that's

3249
02:27:47,010 --> 02:27:47,843
dangerous and intense and overwhelmingly
filled with anticipation beforehand and 

3250
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:59,980
the preparation is all consuming.
There's very few things in life that are

3251
02:28:00,451 --> 02:28:05,451
the like these big moments like a person
stepping into a cage for a fight and the

3252
02:28:07,381 --> 02:28:11,910
consequences are so grave.
It just for your emotions,

3253
02:28:11,911 --> 02:28:13,300
for your physical health,
this is.

3254
02:28:13,330 --> 02:28:15,990
There's really nothing like it is really
the,

3255
02:28:15,991 --> 02:28:20,991
the to expect that you would find 
something else similar in life and to be

3256
02:28:21,891 --> 02:28:25,700
able to achieve a similar state.
Outside of that it's.

3257
02:28:26,380 --> 02:28:27,213
I don't.
I don't think you ever will because I 

3258
02:28:28,371 --> 02:28:29,204
feel like part of what makes what you do
and what all fighters do so intense and 

3259
02:28:35,931 --> 02:28:40,550
so incredibly enjoyable to watch is that
we all know how much is on the line.

3260
02:28:41,150 --> 02:28:41,983
I think.
I believe I'm 100 percent in agreement 

3261
02:28:44,481 --> 02:28:48,440
with you there and I think race car 
drivers and fighter pilots.

3262
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:53,950
I think people like that also likely 
experienced that state of being as well.

3263
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:55,460
Yeah,
I'm sure.

3264
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:56,750
Yeah.
Fighter pilots.

3265
02:28:56,760 --> 02:28:58,880
It has to be fighter pilots.
Apparently.

3266
02:28:58,881 --> 02:29:01,700
I was reading some story about this,
about wife swapping.

3267
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:03,980
They're like they,
they,

3268
02:29:03,981 --> 02:29:04,814
uh,
they're more inclined to have 

3269
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:09,080
polyamorous relationships.
Really.

3270
02:29:09,110 --> 02:29:09,943
Yeah.
And then the wife swap because the idea 

3271
02:29:12,231 --> 02:29:17,231
was that they know that their life 
easily could be wiped out any day at any

3272
02:29:18,891 --> 02:29:20,750
time.
And the people they care about the most,

3273
02:29:20,751 --> 02:29:24,710
their wife or their girlfriend,
that they want other people to love them

3274
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:25,693
because they might not be.
They're interesting and that they would 

3275
02:29:29,091 --> 02:29:31,070
want the people they care about the 
most.

3276
02:29:31,071 --> 02:29:31,904
I love them because they're thinking in 
a altruistic fashion of doing what they 

3277
02:29:37,131 --> 02:29:37,964
can,
I suppose to help this person that they 

3278
02:29:41,301 --> 02:29:44,120
care so much about continuing to find 
joy in their life.

3279
02:29:44,140 --> 02:29:46,070
Yeah.
Because of their,

3280
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:51,100
their realization that what joy they may
be able to derive from them specifically

3281
02:29:51,531 --> 02:29:54,800
is is always on a thin line of not being
there anymore.

3282
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:58,370
That's fucking intense.
The love someone so much.

3283
02:29:58,371 --> 02:30:02,720
You want other people to fuck them 
because how do I get on that list?

3284
02:30:02,780 --> 02:30:05,710
Well,
it's probably already on there.

3285
02:30:05,720 --> 02:30:06,910
Just got to ask.
I suppose

3286
02:30:07,930 --> 02:30:12,930
the which comes back to the one thing 
that is I think poison in life,

3287
02:30:13,930 --> 02:30:18,670
which is to live a dual life.
Grieve a boring no risk,

3288
02:30:18,671 --> 02:30:20,830
10 or run,
no thrills,

3289
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:22,930
no challenge,
no growth,

3290
02:30:22,960 --> 02:30:24,670
no knowledge,
no learning.

3291
02:30:25,060 --> 02:30:30,060
Just this stagnant bullshit life that is
so prevalent in our society.

3292
02:30:31,061 --> 02:30:31,894
I think it's one of the main problems 
with our world is that we have set up 

3293
02:30:35,141 --> 02:30:39,970
these really safe cities and safe 
societies and cultures,

3294
02:30:39,971 --> 02:30:41,200
which is wonderful.
It's great,

3295
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:42,573
but also we.
We haven't given people the discipline 

3296
02:30:45,041 --> 02:30:50,041
or the structure or the.
The just the framework for living a life

3297
02:30:52,661 --> 02:30:56,070
that's going to satisfy your needs in 
terms of your biological needs.

3298
02:30:56,360 --> 02:30:57,193
Yes.
Psychological and people start 

3299
02:30:59,331 --> 02:31:04,220
determining that totally inane things 
are what their needs are.

3300
02:31:04,690 --> 02:31:06,170
They're difficult to acquire,
right?

3301
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:09,200
You think of Ferrari's going to make you
happy because a Ferrari is hard to get.

3302
02:31:09,210 --> 02:31:11,270
Sure.
Look at it like how much do you cost?

3303
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:13,670
If I just had that man,
I'd be bawling.

3304
02:31:13,671 --> 02:31:15,010
I'd be driving around.
So Rad.

3305
02:31:16,140 --> 02:31:18,270
I'd be bawling.
But then you get that Ferrari.

3306
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:19,860
You like.
This is just a car.

3307
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,520
Yeah,

3308
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:24,300
like unless you just really love cars 
like you could love,

3309
02:31:24,370 --> 02:31:25,203
you know your firebird and you 
appreciate it from a mechanical 

3310
02:31:27,211 --> 02:31:28,770
standpoint.
You want to step back and look at it.

3311
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:30,950
It's enjoyable,
but if you think that the fucking things

3312
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:32,700
going to make you happy,
you're crazy.

3313
02:31:33,320 --> 02:31:34,153
B,
then me being happy with who I am as a 

3314
02:31:37,101 --> 02:31:40,730
person and the life that I'm living,
the firebird can't do,

3315
02:31:40,731 --> 02:31:42,560
can't do that.
There is no item.

3316
02:31:42,820 --> 02:31:43,653
You know,
I have to sit back and all the time and 

3317
02:31:45,111 --> 02:31:46,970
try to think for myself that

3318
02:31:48,610 --> 02:31:50,120
you,
you've,

3319
02:31:50,250 --> 02:31:51,660
I,
I love my library,

3320
02:31:51,661 --> 02:31:54,780
that I have all the books within it.
I love the cars that I have.

3321
02:31:54,781 --> 02:31:58,830
I love the relationships that I have,
but instead of the relationship,

3322
02:31:58,831 --> 02:32:00,930
but just the things and it's like these 
are all great things,

3323
02:32:02,690 --> 02:32:04,790
but if I don't have them,
I'm still me.

3324
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:07,250
I still have everything that I need in 
this world.

3325
02:32:07,880 --> 02:32:12,020
I don't like to think about them being 
lost,

3326
02:32:12,110 --> 02:32:12,943
destroyed.
I certainly hit the idea of it being 

3327
02:32:13,761 --> 02:32:15,230
destroyed because even if it wasn't in 
my hands,

3328
02:32:15,231 --> 02:32:19,040
I'd like them to still exist for others,
but without them.

3329
02:32:19,550 --> 02:32:20,383
I'm no different than who I am now and I
guess that's kind of a thinking of like 

3330
02:32:25,310 --> 02:32:26,150
the Stoics,

3331
02:32:26,670 --> 02:32:27,503
but you've been more defined by your 
accomplishments in your thinking and 

3332
02:32:29,671 --> 02:32:32,090
your philosophy and there's lots of 
things that people

3333
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:33,273
obviously they couldn't know about me 
because it's not the kind of thing that 

3334
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:41,320
is just my who I am.
Right?

3335
02:32:41,321 --> 02:32:44,830
And,
and I don't need someone to know whether

3336
02:32:44,831 --> 02:32:45,664
or not I'm smart or whether or not I 
know this or whether or not I can do 

3337
02:32:47,921 --> 02:32:48,754
that.
It's like I'll do it when I need to do 

3338
02:32:49,841 --> 02:32:50,674
it and I,
I have to try and look to see that I 

3339
02:32:53,291 --> 02:32:54,124
have my own inner peace is based on my 
own self knowledge and knowledge also 

3340
02:32:57,550 --> 02:33:00,130
that I am lacking,
that I can be better,

3341
02:33:00,370 --> 02:33:01,900
that I,
if I want to,

3342
02:33:01,901 --> 02:33:03,580
I can choose to in those days that I 
don't.

3343
02:33:04,060 --> 02:33:04,893
It was a choice not to be better.
It wasn't that I couldn't because even 

3344
02:33:07,391 --> 02:33:08,224
going and failing like we talked about 
before is a worthwhile endeavor because 

3345
02:33:11,201 --> 02:33:15,550
it will move you towards either a 
eventually getting there or be that it's

3346
02:33:15,551 --> 02:33:16,384
not something that's going to be yours,
but you know what it is and you know 

3347
02:33:18,581 --> 02:33:19,414
what it takes to get there and that's a 
different perspective altogether and 

3348
02:33:24,700 --> 02:33:29,700
that is where I feel like that's where I
can be okay in this world and deal in.

3349
02:33:31,870 --> 02:33:32,703
There's all kinds of things that you can
draw your focus and really eat at you 

3350
02:33:36,611 --> 02:33:37,444
and bother you and you're giving weight 
to these things and allowing them to 

3351
02:33:39,911 --> 02:33:43,270
have an effect on you and that's 
natural.

3352
02:33:43,690 --> 02:33:46,090
That's a normal thing and it's easy to 
fall into,

3353
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:50,170
but if you can be okay with.
All right,

3354
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:53,800
if all I'm left with is just me and what
I have,

3355
02:33:53,890 --> 02:33:55,950
if I no longer have anything,
no,

3356
02:33:55,980 --> 02:33:57,460
no more luxuries,
no more this,

3357
02:33:57,461 --> 02:34:00,220
no more that.
Can you be okay with that?

3358
02:34:00,330 --> 02:34:02,050
Do you know what kind of life would you 
make of this?

3359
02:34:02,051 --> 02:34:04,720
And I like to think the same one I have 
now.

3360
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:07,960
You can pick me up here,
take all my shit away,

3361
02:34:08,380 --> 02:34:11,410
throw me some other part of the world,
the third world country,

3362
02:34:12,490 --> 02:34:13,323
and it will be jarring.
It will be difficult and there will be 

3363
02:34:16,001 --> 02:34:20,170
some lament of,
but I will continue to be who I am.

3364
02:34:20,171 --> 02:34:21,004
I will see what is necessary to to 
communicate with others and to continue 

3365
02:34:25,721 --> 02:34:29,920
to propagate this that I'm trying to 
create in me.

3366
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:31,513
Yeah.
I think we're all trying to navigate 

3367
02:34:32,391 --> 02:34:36,230
this really incredibly difficult thing,
which is your just your life.

3368
02:34:36,231 --> 02:34:38,070
You're the emotions,
the,

3369
02:34:38,071 --> 02:34:38,671
the,
the,

3370
02:34:38,671 --> 02:34:39,770
the,
your goals,

3371
02:34:39,771 --> 02:34:41,750
your tasks,
your relationships,

3372
02:34:41,751 --> 02:34:44,360
your,
your dreams and aspirations.

3373
02:34:44,361 --> 02:34:45,194
All these things are just so complicated
in the whole idea of not knowing what 

3374
02:34:50,211 --> 02:34:51,044
the future holds is stressful,
but it's also incredibly rewarding when 

3375
02:34:54,621 --> 02:34:57,680
things work out well and even when they 
don't work out well.

3376
02:34:57,950 --> 02:34:58,783
What's rewarding about that?
As you get the gift of knowing that you 

3377
02:35:01,581 --> 02:35:06,581
fucked up and you get the gift of the 
feeling of fucking up and the horrible,

3378
02:35:07,100 --> 02:35:07,933
just the feeling of failure and to 
understand that that's fuel for you to 

3379
02:35:11,391 --> 02:35:12,224
regroup,
repackage your fucking thoughts and and 

3380
02:35:14,751 --> 02:35:19,751
now move forward with the knowledge of 
the mistakes that you've made and you're

3381
02:35:19,980 --> 02:35:20,813
going to be a better person.

3382
02:35:20,840 --> 02:35:23,600
How can you fuck up if you don't do 
anything?

3383
02:35:23,601 --> 02:35:24,434
If you don't ever do it,
you don't just sit back and you try to 

3384
02:35:27,201 --> 02:35:30,920
lead the simplest,
safest version of a life.

3385
02:35:30,921 --> 02:35:31,754
It's not a life on the line and it's not
a life I can really imagine that anyone 

3386
02:35:34,581 --> 02:35:39,581
can really be truly fulfilled living and
you know,

3387
02:35:39,830 --> 02:35:43,280
things are ultimately incredibly soft on
us.

3388
02:35:43,281 --> 02:35:45,890
I mean,
we have pressures in other ways,

3389
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:46,753
but ultimately most of us are living 
quite comfortable lives with no 

3390
02:35:52,371 --> 02:35:53,204
immediate dangers and no,
no real impetus to put stress on 

3391
02:35:57,051 --> 02:36:00,350
ourselves where it doesn't exist at 
times because let's just say you want to

3392
02:36:00,351 --> 02:36:03,770
learn new language.
There's agitation in terms of,

3393
02:36:03,860 --> 02:36:07,010
of forcing you to have to endure 
something.

3394
02:36:07,011 --> 02:36:09,550
There's some suffering in that and you 
know,

3395
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:12,980
I believe in the Nietzschean concept of 
suffering creates growth.

3396
02:36:13,010 --> 02:36:14,380
You know,
life is suffering.

3397
02:36:14,690 --> 02:36:17,030
Suffering doesn't have to be 
catastrophic.

3398
02:36:17,031 --> 02:36:22,031
It doesn't have to be this sort of thing
that is going to debilitate you,

3399
02:36:22,460 --> 02:36:26,420
but that suffering is needed for you to 
continue to become better,

3400
02:36:26,720 --> 02:36:27,240
for sure.

3401
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:29,130
Everything with exercise,
with learning,

3402
02:36:29,131 --> 02:36:31,050
with everything,
with even relationships,

3403
02:36:31,051 --> 02:36:31,884
learning in relationships that all those
uncomfortable feelings are how you 

3404
02:36:35,910 --> 02:36:36,480
learn.

3405
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:37,860
Yes.
Learning relationships.

3406
02:36:37,870 --> 02:36:40,830
I,
I've always said to two friends of mine,

3407
02:36:40,910 --> 02:36:42,570
you know,
the first time they have like a big blow

3408
02:36:42,571 --> 02:36:45,540
out with something called me up and I'll
fuck,

3409
02:36:45,541 --> 02:36:48,000
you know,
so and so said this and I don't know how

3410
02:36:48,001 --> 02:36:49,970
their Dick ended up there and all this 
stuff.

3411
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:52,650
Look ultimately,
yeah.

3412
02:36:52,651 --> 02:36:54,540
No one wants to get into a row with 
someone,

3413
02:36:54,541 --> 02:36:56,220
especially someone that you really care 
about,

3414
02:36:56,250 --> 02:36:59,370
but if,
if this is an important relationship,

3415
02:36:59,371 --> 02:37:03,990
the only way it becomes a relationship 
that has that deeper lasting meaning and

3416
02:37:03,991 --> 02:37:06,300
that really has any real depth to it at 
all,

3417
02:37:06,660 --> 02:37:07,493
is what you do when you guys are faced 
with adversity that shows you what 

3418
02:37:10,750 --> 02:37:13,470
relationship you have.
Because when things are fun and easy,

3419
02:37:13,740 --> 02:37:15,350
anybody can be a part of it,
right?

3420
02:37:15,380 --> 02:37:16,130
We're all just,
you know,

3421
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:19,220
humping and drinking and going out and 
that's great.

3422
02:37:19,240 --> 02:37:21,070
Fucking wonderful.
But when someone good,

3423
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:25,160
once it's pretty,
it's not bad as a single guy,

3424
02:37:25,161 --> 02:37:26,870
I'm constantly looking for that 
opportunity.

3425
02:37:27,170 --> 02:37:28,003
But ladies,
if you live in a hump and drink and 

3426
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:33,800
drink and drink and hump mainly whiskey 
in coffee,

3427
02:37:33,801 --> 02:37:35,600
but drinking it,
hopping and muscle cars,

3428
02:37:35,601 --> 02:37:37,060
if you're into that,
uh,

3429
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:38,833
but when you get into these,
all of a sudden adversity comes across 

3430
02:37:42,111 --> 02:37:45,110
your doorstep.
How you'd handle that.

3431
02:37:45,590 --> 02:37:48,470
And you know,
whether you're the person who brought it

3432
02:37:48,471 --> 02:37:51,290
or you're the person who's in enduring 
it from the other side.

3433
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:52,633
And if you haven't experienced that in 
your life and also experience it in a 

3434
02:37:55,021 --> 02:37:55,851
relationship,
man,

3435
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:57,230
you might not be ready.
That's true.

3436
02:37:57,231 --> 02:38:00,890
Might not have the tools you need.
You need to do.

3437
02:38:00,891 --> 02:38:01,730
That's difficult,
right?

3438
02:38:01,731 --> 02:38:02,564
It gives you the tools to navigate 
difficult situations and the other 

3439
02:38:04,431 --> 02:38:05,300
aspects of your life.

3440
02:38:05,970 --> 02:38:07,040
Agreed.
Yeah.

3441
02:38:07,130 --> 02:38:10,970
It is the.
The stresses of having to to deal with a

3442
02:38:10,971 --> 02:38:15,170
problem and how you handle that problem 
because there will never be any shortage

3443
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:17,120
of problems,
of difficulties from,

3444
02:38:17,150 --> 02:38:21,610
from great too small and you,
your way of,

3445
02:38:21,660 --> 02:38:24,230
of mitigating those problems and dealing
with them is,

3446
02:38:24,310 --> 02:38:27,150
is so important.
It's.

3447
02:38:27,400 --> 02:38:29,780
It determines how it works out for you.
That's right.

3448
02:38:29,781 --> 02:38:30,614
Bitches.
Josh Barnett dropping knowledge like 

3449
02:38:32,511 --> 02:38:34,550
advertised.
Let's wrap this up.

3450
02:38:34,580 --> 02:38:35,960
Josh.
He's a man.

3451
02:38:36,970 --> 02:38:39,170
We got to do this more often.
We do it like once a year now.

3452
02:38:39,230 --> 02:38:41,100
I would love to come in more often.
I,

3453
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:45,500
I especially would love to even at some 
point like when you've got Brett in here

3454
02:38:45,501 --> 02:38:47,540
and you've got Jordan and all that.
I'm just gonna sit in,

3455
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:49,940
talk on philosophy and something like 
that.

3456
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:51,380
I love the shit out of them.
Do it.

3457
02:38:51,530 --> 02:38:52,640
Let's do it,
Josh Barnett,

3458
02:38:52,641 --> 02:38:53,474
ladies.
Gentlemen.

3459
02:38:53,690 --> 02:38:54,523
Bye everybody.
