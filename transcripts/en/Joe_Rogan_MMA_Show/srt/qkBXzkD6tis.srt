1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,113
Okay.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,980
And we live John,
Donna her.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,410
Thank you very much sir.
Very nice to see you.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,460
It's my pleasure.
Joe.

5
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:14,820
Thank you for having me here.
It's nice to be with a fellow fanny pack

6
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:15,654
proponent as well and a now you have one
of the beautiful higher primate leather 

7
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,360
bags like that.
Huh?

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,140
Joe Rogan has just given me one of the 
most beautiful fanny pics than I've ever

9
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:27,030
seen in my life.
Um,

10
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,650
I wear a very cheap fanny pack and this,
this is a thing of beauty.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,463
I was just telling Joe About my student 
Gordon Ryan was recently given a Gucci 

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,553
Fanny Pack.
It's literally the most beautiful thing 

13
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:44,280
I've ever seen in my life.
When he wears it around me,

14
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:47,460
I get insanely jealous and which you buy
one of those.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,550
It's like an $800 just on the principal.
Just on principle.

16
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,384
I can't buy an $800 fanny pack,
but I could definitely step Gordon Ryan 

17
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:57,660
in the back with a knife and steal it 
from and blamed it on Nicky Ryan.

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,520
I could do that.
Easily blame on his brother.

19
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,710
Absolutely.
Great TV series.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,193
The fanny pack is making a comeback.
It's a slow comeback that a lot of 

21
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:11,160
people are reluctant to join there.
They're scared.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,153
They,
they worry about their position in the 

23
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:16,740
sexual food chain and with good reason,
by the way,

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,633
I don't know why.
I feel like anybody that won't fuck you 

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,660
because you have a fanny pack.
You don't want to fuck them.

26
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,950
They're too much work.
Strong point.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,913
Essentially.
It's always a battle of a appearance 

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,830
versus function.
Yeah.

29
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,750
Um,
fanny,

30
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:31,800
pex cold,
very,

31
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,950
very low on a parents,
but very high on function.

32
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,680
I feel like that one bucks,
the trend.

33
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,230
I think you're right between this and 
the Gucci,

34
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,243
we've got something going on yet.
There's a video that I put up the other 

35
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,190
day of my,
uh,

36
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:48,030
archery game is techno hunt thing,
which is this big crazy elaborate thing.

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,103
I got more comments on the fact that I 
was wearing a fanny pack in the video 

38
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,960
than anything.
Were they positive or negative comments?

39
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,093
Negative.
Yeah,

40
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,740
but that's my experience.
But that's just the internet.

41
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,950
The Internet is,
the Internet is extremely angry.

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,510
That's the first thing you learned about
the Internet.

43
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,460
They you can,
you could literally save a baby's life,

44
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,653
eh,
from and the 80% of the Internet we'll 

45
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,220
call you an asshole for doing so.
It's a,

46
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:16,230
it doesn't matter what you do at the 
Internet is very angry.

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,393
Well,
what the Internet is is it shows what 

48
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,320
people are like when there's no social 
cues.

49
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,154
When they're not in front of you,
they don't have to deal with like 

50
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:25,944
looking you in the eye and what little 
weird little hidden demons of jealousy 

51
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,164
and anger and resentment and it's a 
pretty sad stories in it if that's what 

52
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:37,040
we're really like.
It's a,

53
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,700
it's not looking good for the human 
rights.

54
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,143
The kind of people that comment in 
general and what it shows you is that 

55
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:44,604
99% of what we call human goodness and 
politeness really comes out of fear of 

56
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,374
consequences.
There's a lot of that for sure because 

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,890
there's no consequences when you talk on
the line,

58
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,843
but I think it's the quality of the 
people that are making those kinds of 

59
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:56,544
comments.
Like I would say like if you look at 

60
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:00,220
Youtube comments like Michael Jordan is 
not leaving

61
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,053
youtube comments.
The people that leave Youtube Commons 

62
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:04,444
and bitch and complain about things,
usually everything's not going so 

63
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,654
fantastic in their own life.
But they have this forum now when they 

64
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,030
feel like,
you know,

65
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,320
if there's a video that has 3 million 
downloads,

66
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,640
they also are on that video.
They are at the,

67
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,570
they're there in the comments section.
You go to them,

68
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,390
they're a part of that unqualified.
No one asked him to be there.

69
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,520
Literally all you have to do is make an 
account.

70
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,010
No one has to know anything about your 
education,

71
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,040
the way your mind works,
what you've done with your life,

72
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,050
what mistakes you've made doesn't 
matter.

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,030
You are old.
Fuck 66 and that's your name and you can

74
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,310
say whatever you want and you'll,
your,

75
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,240
your comments are right there with 
everything else.

76
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,953
It's fascinating to watch.
It's very gal tarian but in a lot of 

77
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:50,380
ways it's also,
it's like,

78
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,120
boy,
um,

79
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,440
I don't know if that's the best way

80
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,430
to get your information.
Yeah,

81
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:57,650
I think there's a lot of truth to that.
Yeah.

82
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,840
So John,
um,

83
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,040
you are

84
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,410
one of the most fascinating characters 
in the world of Jujitsu and the world of

85
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,690
martial arts.
And for people who are not aware of your

86
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:12,150
background,
you started out,

87
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,010
correct me if I'm wrong,
you started out,

88
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,830
um,

89
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,663
a philosophy student that's great days 
and you were working as a bouncer and 

90
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:20,980
you were jacked,
right?

91
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,420
You're a power lifter at the time.
Yes.

92
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,710
And you wanted to figure out a way to 
defend yourself.

93
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:26,803
Um,
it wasn't really a question of wanting 

94
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,581
to figure out.
It was,

95
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:29,271
it was,
it was,

96
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,390
um,
uh,

97
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,160
a pretty simple design that I had when I
grew up in New Zealand.

98
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,220
Martial arts was almost entirely based 
around,

99
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,730
uh,
striking pro is,

100
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,090
you'll back me up on this joke.
Um,

101
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,550
we're similar age.
Uh,

102
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,470
when we grew up,
uh,

103
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,313
the,
it's no exaggeration to say that the 

104
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:50,630
study of martial arts in English 
speaking countries,

105
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:51,920
North America,
western Europe,

106
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:55,560
et Cetera,
was absolutely dominated by the striking

107
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,930
odds.
And,

108
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,793
um,
if you ask the average person who was 

109
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:04,040
the best fighter in the world,
they would typically say whoever was the

110
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,380
best boxer in the world.
So in the 1980s,

111
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:08,300
Mike Tyson wasn't just the best boxer in
the world.

112
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:09,134
He was the best fighter in the world.
People always equated prowess and 

113
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:17,230
fighting with the ability to strike.
Um,

114
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,760
I grew up in that time period.

115
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,690
And so,
um,

116
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,140
I grew up doing a study setting,
kickboxing as a,

117
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:24,974
as a teenager in New Zealand.
I came to United States and for the 

118
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:28,424
first time,
there's no wrestling culture in my 

119
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:31,190
country.
New Zealand has no wrestling culture.

120
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,650
It's one of the few countries that has 
no indigenous raceland culture.

121
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,910
There's,
there were,

122
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:37,370
but it was kind of lost in the sands of 
time.

123
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,980
Um,
when I grew up,

124
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,780
wrestling was something I saw once every
four years at the Olympics on TV.

125
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,160
And,
um,

126
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,080
I didn't even associate it with 
fighting,

127
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,660
to be honest with you.
I disorders these strange sport with two

128
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:52,700
guys tackled each other.
And,

129
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:54,350
um,
so I came to the United States and I was

130
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:56,270
working as a bouncer.
Um,

131
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,200
America has much,
much more of a wrestling culture in it.

132
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,670
In,
in New Zealand,

133
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,080
when I grew up,
when you fought,

134
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,520
you were expected to fight with fists.

135
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,353
And if it went to the ground,
the two guys stood up and there was in 

136
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,870
fighting.
You stood up and he fought like a man.

137
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,670
That was the idea.
And,

138
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,960
um,
uh,

139
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,000
in the United States when I was 
bouncing,

140
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,863
I was absolutely shocked and impressed 
by the prowess of judo players and 

141
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:22,340
wrestlers in street fighting,
working as a bounce.

142
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,160
I worked alongside them and I was 
massively impressed.

143
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,170
What year was this?
This is in the early 1990s.

144
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,310
I ride the United States in 1991.
Um,

145
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,500
so I started working late night,
a late 1991,

146
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,240
um,
in New York City.

147
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,520
Um,
New York is a very,

148
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,200
very,
very different city back then.

149
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,580
It's,
it's like,

150
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:41,690
uh,
um,

151
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,093
it's almost like two different cities 
from what it is to be amazing how much 

152
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:46,064
it's checked.
There's a transformation is night and 

153
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,390
day.
It's become like a giant Tgi Fridays now

154
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,320
is,
that's pretty much what I did.

155
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,600
To give you an example.
Uh,

156
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,190
I used to live on West End Avenue on the
upper west side.

157
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,353
When I would come home from working in 
nightclubs at five 30 in the morning to 

158
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:04,184
go to sleep,
there would be large numbers of street 

159
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:13,040
walking prostitutes on my block,
my avenue,

160
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,463
if that,
if you saw even a single street walking 

161
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,583
prostitute,
and that area today would be front page 

162
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:25,250
news of the New York Times,
it would be so shocking,

163
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:26,084
so completely out of people's mouth.
And it would literally just people's 

164
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,990
minds score is the best example.
I'm square is an extreme example because

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,240
times square used to be all CD peep 
shows,

166
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,870
nothing but cd peep shows.
Now it's like Guy Fieri restaurants.

167
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,580
It's all television.
So the transformation is huge.

168
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,010
So that was the New York that I went 
into and uh,

169
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,570
it was a,
it was a violent New York.

170
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,513
Uh,
1991 I believe was the year with the 

171
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,880
highest murder rate in recorded history 
of New York City.

172
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,880
So,
um,

173
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,600
it was a very,
very different New York City.

174
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:01,460
It's not what you see today.
So I came into this environment,

175
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,970
I saw all these people were incredibly 
adept and,

176
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,600
and they were using grant,
linkedin,

177
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:07,250
nick to do to.
So this impressed me a lot.

178
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,713
Um,
at,

179
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,250
uh,
shortly after that time,

180
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,330
uh,
was always working.

181
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,890
Um,
I started to hear,

182
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:15,680
talk about this show,
this ultimate fighting show.

183
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,870
And there was this Brazilian guy who had
beaten everyone.

184
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,580
He was wrestling people and strangling 
them and locking their arms,

185
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:24,590
things like desk,
things that I'd never heard of.

186
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,550
So I,
I,

187
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,520
I'd heard this and um,
uh,

188
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:32,120
one day I was teaching at Columbia 
University in a close friend of mine who

189
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:34,190
was also in the phd program,
came into my office.

190
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,930
It was office hours and he said,
John,

191
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:36,764
you know,
I know you work as a balance them and I 

192
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,100
know,
uh,

193
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,750
you look at night and,
um,

194
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,660
I started doing this,
this martial art,

195
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:49,661
it's called Brazilian Jujitsu and uh,
it's mostly fall on the ground.

196
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:50,744
I remember you said most of the flights 
you get into people who put down on the 

197
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,250
ground and they wrestle.
And,

198
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,084
uh,
I was wondering if you would be 

199
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:58,674
interested in doing it.
And I was like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and 

200
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:03,900
yet I never associated marshawn's with 
Brazil for me,

201
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:04,740
martial arts,
you know,

202
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,700
Japan,
Korea,

203
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,850
Brazil,
like what do they got capital wearing,

204
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,743
you know?
Right.

205
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,190
Who is this guy?
So I'm like Brazilian Jujitsu.

206
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,840
It isn't you to see like Japanese,
like what does it,

207
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,360
isn't it like a contradiction of terms 
like Brazil,

208
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,130
Jujitsu?
Um,

209
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,993
so this,
at the time I was around 230 pounds and 

210
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,413
this guy was,
couldn't be more than 140 and he'd only 

211
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,960
been training two weeks.

212
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,760
So,
um,

213
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,130
he goes to me,
you know,

214
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,403
we go in the ground and,
and we wrestle on the ground and I was 

215
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,534
like,
okay,

216
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,120
let me put you in a headlock and let's 
see what you can do.

217
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,010
So I shut the door of the office,
I cleared out the furniture,

218
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,000
chat support,
get on the ground.

219
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,193
Now.
Um,

220
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,010
I had the only thing I knew how to do on
the ground in those,

221
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:50,160
this was headlock be run.
And I,

222
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:51,040
you know,
I was a strong guy.

223
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,320
It pretty nicely.
Headlock and I'm,

224
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,660
so I grabbed my poor little friend and,
and throttle them with,

225
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:57,494
uh,
uh,

226
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,410
uh,
basically,

227
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,230
uh,
kids get time,

228
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,640
may type headlock.
And um,

229
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,870
uh,
to my shock and horror,

230
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:08,220
he started slipping around behind me and
started holding hotter and hotter.

231
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,054
And then about two minutes when guy,
and I really had no real control over 

232
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:13,530
him and he was starting to get around 
behind me.

233
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,440
Now I didn't know back attacks where I 
had complete naive at the,

234
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,274
on the ground,
but I could feel something bad was 

235
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:18,870
happening.
Someone getting behind you.

236
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,950
It never a good thing in a fight.
And,

237
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:22,020
uh,
I was getting tired,

238
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,240
my arms were getting tired,
I had no control of the guy.

239
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,280
And finally he slept at night to stand 
up and run away.

240
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,050
And I said,
are you kidding me?

241
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,350
I'm twice your size.
You've been training to goddamn weeks.

242
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,030
And,
and if this was a real fight,

243
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:34,380
he would have got away from it.
And I'm tired.

244
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,750
That's not good.
And I was just saying,

245
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,230
if he did this in two weeks,
what could you do?

246
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,850
Some training?
So I was fascinated.

247
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,620
I went down,
um,

248
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,630
got completely destroyed on my first 
day.

249
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,280
Um,
or it was hilarious.

250
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,550
Who was there on this first thing?
Matt Serra was the most,

251
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:51,990
uh,
he was a blue belt at the time.

252
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,400
Um,
so even on that first day you met people

253
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,590
that would become very important in your
life later on.

254
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,983
And I vowed to the moon and the stars 
that I would at least become competent 

255
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,013
and the game I couldn't live with the 
idea that I was incompetent at an 

256
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:10,440
important element of fighting.
I didn't want to be a world champ.

257
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:13,170
I didn't worry.
I just want to be competent and um,

258
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,603
uh,
I believe that would make my bouncing 

259
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:20,580
work significantly easier.
That was absolutely true.

260
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,360
Um,
within a very,

261
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:25,860
very short period of time,
balancing got massively easier for me.

262
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,140
Um,
I've bought,

263
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:28,974
you know,
you always get this cliched Jujitsu 

264
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,610
saves.
Judas was saved my life.

265
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,890
How many people need to hear people say 
that all the time?

266
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,980
Well,
I can think of without any question.

267
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:38,814
There are four times in my life that 
Jujitsu actually did save my life 

268
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,580
balance.

269
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,250
I can say that with complete honesty.
Um,

270
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,950
uh,
it's a cliche for most people.

271
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:46,770
It for me,
it's,

272
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,600
it did happen.
Um,

273
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,900
so it made a massive difference,
but I still saw it as it was interesting

274
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,413
and something I just wanted to gain 
competence in that fundamentally 

275
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:00,850
changed.
This is really,

276
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,730
at that point I wanted to finish my phd 
and become a professor.

277
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:06,220
That's what was my original goal when I 
came to United States.

278
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,730
Um,
but things started to change when,

279
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,863
uh,
the three senior students at the hands 

280
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,234
of Gracie Academy,
he caught all made a met Sarah and hold 

281
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:16,960
Rio.
Gracie all went their separate ways.

282
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,853
They had to go out and start their own 
schools and Hindou was busy fighting 

283
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,600
professionally,
Japan,

284
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,340
so he couldn't be at the academy all the
time.

285
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,530
And he came to and he said,
John,

286
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,390
you're going to have to be a teacher.

287
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,940
Like there's no one else.
And how long have you been Tryna,

288
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,950
uh,
I believe if I go to the,

289
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,933
it was around four years.
I believe I was a purple belt when I 

290
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,810
first started teaching at hands.
Those,

291
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,070
um,
don't quote me on that,

292
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:41,740
but I'll have to go back and check.
But I believe that's,

293
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,140
and why did he come to you?
Um,

294
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,760
probably because he felt sorry for me.
I don't know.

295
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,920
Um,
uh,

296
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,870
I was there a lot and,
um,

297
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,890
I think maybe he saw some enthusiasm 
while you are obsessed.

298
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,270
Right?
And like you were there daily.

299
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,820
Yeah.
That became much more so when I become a

300
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:00,130
teacher because I saw that,
okay,

301
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,353
I'm filling big shoes here.
You must remember all three of those 

302
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:05,830
names that I just mentioned.
All three were world champions.

303
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,300
Okay.
These were good,

304
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,980
good people.
And for that time they were,

305
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,300
they would kill us.

306
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,930
And here I am a phd student.
Now I've got to fill in these shoes.

307
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,610
So I was like,
I've got to get serious about this.

308
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,430
So I made a commitment to,
um,

309
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,010
to becoming the best possible teacher I 
could.

310
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,460
Now you must remember I went in as a 
teacher.

311
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:29,230
That was my first assignment.
And,

312
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,040
um,
so I decided my primary focus in Jujitsu

313
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,080
would be upon teaching.
And uh,

314
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,033
uh,
fortunate I came from an academic 

315
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:38,980
background.
I had many brilliant,

316
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,250
brilliant professors coming through the 
philosophy programs,

317
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,260
both in New Zealand and the United 
States.

318
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,723
Um,
Columbia University had a fantastic PhD 

319
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,430
program.
Uh,

320
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,920
so I was very,
uh,

321
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,950
experience and the art of teaching,
but in an academic context.

322
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,383
And I thought maybe this has given me,
faith has given me this angle where I 

323
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:05,020
can use an academic approach to teaching
in a sports environment.

324
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,783
And that has really become one of the 
patterns of my approach to teaching a 

325
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:11,914
Jujitsu.

326
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,750
So this is,
uh,

327
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,890
in the 90s and you are a purple belt at 
the time.

328
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:23,430
When did you develop this leg lock 
system that has become so legendary?

329
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:24,994
So for people,
for the uninitiated that have never 

330
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,070
heard of you or understand what we're 
talking about here,

331
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,773
for the longest time,
Jujitsu was primarily attacks on the 

332
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:39,520
arms and the neck.
That was pretty much it.

333
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,610
And there were known attacks on the 
legs,

334
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,310
but they were frowned upon.
Yes.

335
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,620
Uh,
something happened you,

336
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:49,600
you got to see some of those techniques 
in mma,

337
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,460
you got to see some heel,
occasionally foot locks.

338
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,870
There's a few guys are lawsky pulled off
a a foot lock in the UFC against Tim.

339
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:59,510
Sylvia has a few guys that were pulling 
these off.

340
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,520
This is pre,
some are Paul Harris,

341
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,103
but you all of a sudden came along with 
this very effective system that there 

342
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:15,860
was rumblings many years ago about this 
where a lot of people were talking about

343
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,820
it and a lot of people were saying that,
you know,

344
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,673
John Danaher has this insane leg lock 
system and then you started developing 

345
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,400
all these chat for people don't know the
top grapplers in the ward.

346
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,233
There's a,
there's a lot of top grapplers in the 

347
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:32,000
world.
Jujitsu is incredibly competitive,

348
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:32,834
but you're recognized as being one of 
the premiere coaches of the most 

349
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,360
promising young people like Gordon Ryan,
who you're talking about before,

350
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,960
who is in Abu Dhabi champion,
Garry Tonin,

351
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,040
Nikki Ryan,
Eddie Cummings.

352
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,023
You have an incredible crew of world 
class strangle artists who are also 

353
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:56,270
known to be some of the very best leg 
lockers in the world.

354
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,840
So what happened?
How did that,

355
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,130
how did that all take place?

356
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,720
Um,
let's go through,

357
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,870
uh,
we should talk about the history of,

358
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,521
Yep.
Let,

359
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:07,400
let,
let Habu you've actually asked about six

360
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,234
different questions.
Sorry.

361
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,520
It's good,
but we can answer them in turn.

362
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,350
So let's go,
let's the first question.

363
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,910
Your first question was a historical 
question.

364
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,030
How,
how did it happen?

365
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,150
Yeah.
Um,

366
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,340
first off,
um,

367
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,750
there was nothing in my early,
uh,

368
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,580
learnings,
uh,

369
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,720
of,
of Jujitsu,

370
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,280
which suggested leg logs.
Nothing.

371
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,270
Okay.
Um,

372
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,290
hinder would teach.
By the way,

373
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,090
I should say my,
my,

374
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,070
my sensei throughout my entire career 
has been hindered.

375
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:32,190
Gracie,
um,

376
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,560
I never left.
He ends up,

377
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,730
he taught me from white belt to black 
belt and I never left as academy.

378
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,593
I'm the only one of his students who 
stayed with them from white belt to 

379
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:42,800
black belt and never left.
Um,

380
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,920
uh,
so hence it would teach leg,

381
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,754
lungs,
but it was taught in always the same 

382
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,390
fashion that everyone else that here's a
move has a fig of auto.

383
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,300
Here's a heel hook,
isn't achilles lock.

384
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,521
Um,
so the,

385
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:56,420
the moves themselves when no one.
Okay.

386
00:16:56,421 --> 00:16:58,370
They,
they were there.

387
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,213
They were in existence.
It wasn't like I invented he hawks or 

388
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:02,690
something like that.
That's the idea.

389
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,970
Um,
but they weren't emphasized.

390
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,390
Um,
uh,

391
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:10,100
very,
very uh,

392
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,150
talented and um,
uh,

393
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,193
uh,
influential figure in my life was a guy 

394
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:19,820
that I only knew for three days.
Now that sounds,

395
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,820
that sounds crazy,
right?

396
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,600
How can you learn something from someone
in three days?

397
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,613
Well,
actually the influence he had occurred 

398
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:26,384
in three minutes.
I'm a big believer in the idea that 

399
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,374
someone can come into your life for a 
very short period of time and have a 

400
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:39,641
massive influence.
I truly believe that in my case it was a

401
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,300
great American graphical dean list.
Dean lister was invited by Matt Serra to

402
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:46,400
come to the Hansa Gracie Academy,
I believe,

403
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,590
don't quote me on this,
but I believe dean was a brown butter at

404
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:48,890
the time.

405
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,760
I'm pretty sure matt was a brown,
but at the time too.

406
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,043
And um,
I bought him in for around three days 

407
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:54,734
and he trained mostly with Matt Serra 
and preparation for a grappling 

408
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:57,300
tournament.
If I,

409
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,680
if I remember correctly now,
Dean was one,

410
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,900
mostly in those days for his Achilles 
lock.

411
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,990
It later on he would become a heel hook 
specialists.

412
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,790
But in those days it was mostly an 
Achilles lock.

413
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,950
And he came to the academy role with 
some people and he did a,

414
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,190
he was doing a logs and getting some 
success.

415
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,470
Um,
you know,

416
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,700
went both ways.
I mean,

417
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:18,360
but um,
uh,

418
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,490
he,
he couldn't really get his stuff to work

419
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:21,324
on Matt Serra.
Matt Serra could get his stuff to work 

420
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:24,030
on him,
but um,

421
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,223
uh,
he was doing something which was 

422
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,833
unusual.
And so I talked with them just briefly 

423
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,690
after clients and I said,
you know,

424
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:31,973
it's interesting what you're doing with 
these achilles lungs cause I don't 

425
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,070
really do that at all.

426
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,720
It's not something I do.
And he said one sentence,

427
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,100
which completely changed my outlook.
He cause why would you ignore 50% of the

428
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,350
human body?
One sentence,

429
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,530
why would you ignore 50% of the human 
body?

430
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,480
And I looked and I was like,
I don't know why,

431
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,673
why would you?
It makes no sense and we never talked 

432
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:02,240
again.
And then he went back to California.

433
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,790
We don't want to become too,
too time adcc champion mostly with Laila

434
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,790
lungs.
Um,

435
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,980
but what Dean gave me was not technique,
didn't show me a single technique,

436
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,080
but he gave me at point of view as you 
give a man a point of view,

437
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,870
you can change them.
Okay,

438
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,550
you can,
we can work from there.

439
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,510
That was the influence.
And uh,

440
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,600
my Sensei Henzel Gracie was an 
extremely,

441
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,420
uh,
liberal minded professor of Jujitsu.

442
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,980
He would let us do whatever we wanted.

443
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,840
Okay.
He wasn't one of those guys,

444
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:34,674
you know,
no one in my academy studying lake 

445
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:36,510
walks.
He was never like that.

446
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,344
He was,
he would allow students to go in any 

447
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,744
direction they wanted,
provided they could prove it was 

448
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:43,720
effective.
Um,

449
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,663
so I started studying leg locks and 
that's where I'm going to come to the 

450
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:50,220
second question,
which you asked,

451
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,760
which is why did lake walls have such a 
bad reputation?

452
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,900
And you'd,
it says curious,

453
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:55,734
right?
We don't think about this way about our 

454
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,363
mugs.
I'm going to run through the main 

455
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:01,740
criticisms and your,
you'll be my witness on this jury.

456
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:03,810
I'm sure you've heard the same criticism
a thousand times.

457
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,950
You would always hear people refer to 
leg locks in the following way first.

458
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,500
The first criticism level too dangerous.
Okay.

459
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,210
If you,
if you allow people to do leg walks,

460
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,880
everyone would be entered in a week and 
units would be impossible.

461
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,220
So that was the first quarter than we 
would always hear.

462
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,010
The second great criticism is they 
didn't work.

463
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,050
Okay.
Um,

464
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
you might be to tap out a white belt 
with a heel hook,

465
00:20:24,001 --> 00:20:25,950
but if you are a world championship 
level,

466
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,440
you never got to tap anybody that didn't
work at high levels.

467
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,723
That by itself,
those two criticisms seemed to go in 

468
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:31,980
opposite directions.
If they're,

469
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,440
if they're really that dangerous but 
they don't work,

470
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,300
how does that,
how do those through Gel,

471
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,134
they are either incredibly dangerous to 
the point where they can't be practice 

472
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,330
or they don't work that they did.
The two arguments contradict each other.

473
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,583
Then you hear other arguments that they 
were positionally unsound that if you 

474
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,100
were in top position

475
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,640
and you went for a leg lock,
you would lose position and that was his

476
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,720
Austin.
Okay.

477
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,613
That's a criticism with no merit because
it that Chris St criticism applies to 

478
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,590
guillotines on bonds,
et cetera.

479
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,310
You can be mounted on someone,
go for an arm lock in the loose position

480
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,500
ended up on bottom,
but no one criticizes ambos.

481
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,073
Um,
so as I went through the reasons why 

482
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:11,530
people criticized leg logging,
none of them really made sense.

483
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,960
So I started asking myself,
well,

484
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,693
often the reasons people give as opposed
to what the real reasons are a very 

485
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:22,840
different.
And the more I thought about it,

486
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,490
the more I thought the real reason 
people donate leg,

487
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:32,491
lungs runs much deeper than that.
Let's understand Jujitsu for what it is.

488
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,260
Jujitsu is a systems based approach to 
fighting.

489
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,773
Okay?
What is the system of Brazilian Jiu 

490
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,233
Jitsu?
While it can be described in a few 

491
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:44,734
different ways,
I'm going to give you one rendition 

492
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,900
which is pretty simple and will resonate
with most of your listeners.

493
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,250
Jujitsu is a system based around four 
distinct steps.

494
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,360
You can add steps,
you can subtract steps,

495
00:21:58,361 --> 00:21:59,194
but the,
the rendition I'm going to give you now 

496
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:02,530
is probably probably the most widely 
known.

497
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,623
Okay.
Let's say a friend of yours asked for 

498
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:07,594
advice on fighting.
He knows you're a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 

499
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,773
expert.
You're a black belt in Brazilian 

500
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,090
Jujitsu.
And he said to me,

501
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,540
Joe Rogan,
tell me I didn't know anything.

502
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,000
I want to fight someone else using your 
procedures.

503
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,530
What are the steps?
It was only just said,

504
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:24,340
what's the system that,
uh,

505
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,203
what is a system that had a spouses?
You're going to see always that step 

506
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:30,940
number one is take your opponent to the 
ground.

507
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,600
Okay?
Why was he,

508
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,010
why do you think the ground is so 
special?

509
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:39,550
Why did rezone Cios who choose the 
ground as step number one of its system,

510
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,713
why do you think,

511
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,520
well,
it all came out of judo,

512
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,443
right?
So Brazilian Jujitsu took the effective 

513
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:49,890
submission techniques of judo and then 
just refine them.

514
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,480
That's these dog.
The reason,

515
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,120
what's the,
what's the mechanical physical reason?

516
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,250
Because you can control someone on the 
ground far better,

517
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,430
right?
You can control people.

518
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,273
Loma Chenko control suite from the 
standing position with angle and 

519
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:01,860
distance is different ways to control 
people.

520
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,470
Yes.
In boxing,

521
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:08,250
if you only are boxing,
but why the ground?

522
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,280
Why did they choose the ground?
What's the mechanical reason?

523
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,123
What happens when you take a human being
to the ground while there's a whole 

524
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:16,620
barrier behind them that you can press 
them against?

525
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,843
What about if you're in bottom position?
While you could use that barrier as 

526
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:21,624
leverage?

527
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,553
True,
but there's something that occurs when 

528
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:26,184
someone goes down to the ground.
It's something big that you may be 

529
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:28,860
missing here.
What am I missing?

530
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:34,770
What's the most explosive event and the 
Olympic Games?

531
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,633
The the event that probably requires 
more transfer of energy and development 

532
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:45,530
of kinetic energy than any other.
There's a bunch you name,

533
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:47,960
but one of them for me is always going 
to be the javelin throw.

534
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,560
The javelin throw involves a full 
powered sprint,

535
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,373
a jump,
a massive explosive tuning of both hips 

536
00:23:58,431 --> 00:23:59,264
and shoulders and a throw.
All the quintessential explosive 

537
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:04,874
elements of the human body are involved 
in the javelin throw probably to a 

538
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:12,410
greater degree than any other Olympic 
event and as a result,

539
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:17,411
people can throw a javelin 80 90 meters.
What would happen if you took those same

540
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:22,700
javelin throwers and made them perform 
the same event on the knees?

541
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,353
Wouldn't be so good.
They probably couldn't throw it more 

542
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:30,440
than 10 meters.
Okay,

543
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,720
and what's changed?
The closer they get to the ground,

544
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,290
the less they can employ explosive 
force.

545
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,190
What's the first thing cowboys do when 
they go to brand is steer.

546
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,110
Take it down.
Yeah.

547
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,510
They lock up into lakes and they put it 
down on the ground.

548
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,210
Nobody tries to brand as standing.
Still,

549
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:51,950
you're going to get killed because it 
can employ explosive dynamic movement to

550
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:54,350
hurt you.
You put them on the ground.

551
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,010
Dynamic explosive movement is massively 
curtailed.

552
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,790
It takes away the single riskiest 
element of fighting,

553
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,330
which is quick dynamic movement that can
generate kinetic energy.

554
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,933
So step number one,
it was going to do it so it was get it 

555
00:25:08,961 --> 00:25:11,360
to the ground.
It's inherently safer.

556
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,530
Less things can go catastrophic.
Lee,

557
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,560
wrong on the ground and in the standing 
position.

558
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,090
What step number two?
Secure.

559
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:24,020
Dominant position control.
Control.

560
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,000
Too vague.
There's many ways to control people.

561
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,310
There's a definite step.
You've just taken the guy down.

562
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,530
What's your first thing and was on 
units?

563
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,373
Yeah.

564
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,190
Well,
the first thing I would try to do is get

565
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:35,080
to a dominant position.
What do you mean by that?

566
00:25:35,081 --> 00:25:38,460
Be My pass to side control.
Try to match it.

567
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,311
You just sounds it.
It right.

568
00:25:39,311 --> 00:25:42,010
Then get past his legs,
his legs.

569
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,880
Why legs are strong.
I carry you around.

570
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,450
You could hold a person in position.
They,

571
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:52,000
they're very good defensively.
They dangerous.

572
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,410
Too dangerous.
Okay.

573
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:55,360
If I end up inside your legs,
if you're a skilled,

574
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:57,090
juicy play can unlock me.
Can Lake Logan,

575
00:25:57,091 --> 00:25:59,470
we can strangle me.
Even if you were an untrained,

576
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:00,580
funny,
you could up kick me.

577
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,473
Right.
Mania man has been knocked out by an 

578
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,590
upkick.
Even an untutored guy conforming up.

579
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,230
Get sure lakes are dangerous.
So step number two is get pasta.

580
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:11,380
Those dangerous lakes.
What state number three?

581
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,470
Go for submission.
No,

582
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,103
he must be a 10th planet backbone.
So I hate to throw that in some rigid 

583
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,460
step number three.
Joe,

584
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:26,170
you're failing on pass.
Okay,

585
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:27,970
I pass the legs.
Well.

586
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,350
Um,
I'm going to try to control.

587
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:32,290
I'm going to try to either a mount or 
like I said,

588
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:35,950
side control.
You're on the right track trying to work

589
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:38,170
your way through a hierarchy of 
positions.

590
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,550
Yes.
You got to go to neon belly.

591
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:42,060
You're going to go so I can draw.
You're going to transition to mount.

592
00:26:42,061 --> 00:26:44,040
You going to transition to ray?
Depending upon

593
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,790
my game.
Yeah.

594
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,623
This is sequence of pins.
Once you get past your opponent's legs 

595
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:52,260
and Jujitsu encourages you to go through
those various pins.

596
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,363
If you look at the sport of Jiu Jitsu,
the pins score different amounts of 

597
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:58,740
points.
Neon belly scores,

598
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:01,500
a certain amount.
Mount position.

599
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,870
School is more ray mountain school is 
more.

600
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,233
Why you have a wonder about then why do 
we score the pins of Jujitsu 

601
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:11,010
differently?
Well,

602
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:14,520
there's more available from rear mount.
Of course you have a,

603
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,460
you can of course,
you can tack the neck.

604
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,650
You can also attack the arms.
You,

605
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:24,651
you have a positional advantage where 
you can't be attacked your,

606
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,613
you're behind them,
so it's one of the most superior 

607
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,840
positions to achieve.
Very good.

608
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,860
What about the Mount Mount?
When the striking involves phenomenal.

609
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,423
Um,
when you just put your finger on it 

610
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:40,674
right there,
Joe,

611
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,170
every one of the pins,
if you did soon,

612
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,050
the value of it is measured by your 
potential to strike your opponent on the

613
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:49,884
ground.

614
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,530
Okay?

615
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,840
That's why their school more your own 
belly scores more.

616
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,833
It's I control because from distance of 
neon belly you can strike with more 

617
00:27:58,221 --> 00:28:00,530
power.
It's inherently unstable,

618
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:02,580
however,
so at scores less than mount,

619
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,080
which is inherently more stable and 
office the same punching platform.

620
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,623
Step number three of Judas who was to 
work your way through a hierarchy of 

621
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:11,444
pins with a pins,
a graded in value according to your 

622
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:18,260
ability to strike with a fixed on the 
ground.

623
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,723
So far,
so far we've got three elements in the 

624
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:24,410
system of Jujitsu.
Step number one,

625
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,110
get to fight down to the ground were 
explosive.

626
00:28:27,111 --> 00:28:30,200
Kinetic energy is less likely to do the 
valid by a dangerous opponent.

627
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,590
Step number two,
get past this dangerous legs.

628
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,963
Step number three,
work your way through this hierarchy of 

629
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:37,874
pins with the pins are understood in 
terms of the potential to harm your 

630
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:45,020
opponent with strikes on the floor.
What step number four?

631
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,520
Step number four is try to secure a 
position where you can submit them.

632
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,590
You've already got the position.
So what's that number four attack with a

633
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:56,240
submission.
Correct.

634
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,690
So we've just described a zoned unit.
So it's a four step system.

635
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,290
It's beautiful,
it's elegant and it's deadly effective.

636
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,680
Step number one,
take the fight to the ground.

637
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,130
Take away the danger of explosive 
kinetic energy.

638
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,830
Step number two,
get past as dangerous lakes.

639
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,053
Step number three,
work your way through a hierarchy of 

640
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:19,334
pins.
Each one graded upon your ability to 

641
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,634
harm your opponent with strikes on the 
ground and set up step number four 

642
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,933
submissions.
And now the question that needs to be 

643
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:32,660
asked with a lake lungs fit into that 
system

644
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,320
and where do they fit in?
They don't allow,

645
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,920
they don't.
They don't.

646
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:44,350
Traditionally leg walks fit into the 
system in only one way.

647
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:46,563
When the system has failed,
when the system's not working and you 

648
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,580
can't take your opponent down,
you can't pass his God.

649
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,833
You can't maintain a dominant position 
and you can't get the regular 

650
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,470
submissions to work.
Fuck it.

651
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,550
Try a leg lock.

652
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,590
Okay.

653
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,770
Yeah.
That's what we're seeing.

654
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,833
Yeah.
Lake logs was seen for generations as a 

655
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,514
signal of failure.
When you couldn't get the system to 

656
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,730
work,
you had to resort to leg logs.

657
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,940
It meant you were a bad,
you did sue player.

658
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,723
He couldn't impose the fundamental 
system of Jujitsu and so you chicken 

659
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:27,550
down and you went to lake lungs.
That's why they were despised.

660
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:28,963
Mm.
That was the real reason why for 

661
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:33,670
generations,
lake logs were dismissed.

662
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,363
You don't think it was because so many 
people were injured by them that they 

663
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:39,790
were absolutely not.
People get injured.

664
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,863
The worst injuries in Jiu Jitsu don't 
come from submission holds the worst 

665
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:43,600
injuries,
injuries,

666
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,430
Jujitsu come from falling bodyweight.
Yeah,

667
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,680
and people jumped.
God,

668
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,960
when people accidentally poorly 
performed takedowns.

669
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,813
That's where you see catastrophic 
injuries send units is we sued career 

670
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:56,980
ending injuries,
the joint locks of missions.

671
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,810
You're out for a week,
two weeks,

672
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,700
you know,
catastrophic injuries.

673
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,093
Um,
as I see it go on Youtube and put in 

674
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,010
God,
Paul gone wrong.

675
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,280
You'll see catastrophic injuries.
You see career ending injuries there.

676
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,740
You're not going to see from Aamaz he'll
hoax,

677
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:13,540
et cetera.
You'll see people getting hurt,

678
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,910
but it's a contact sport you expect 
then.

679
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,860
Okay.
Um,

680
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,710
no,
there's a,

681
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,510
a very simple elegant system.
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

682
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,373
We just saw one rendition of it,
the four step approach and you clearly 

683
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:30,430
see leg locks don't fit comfortably into
that system.

684
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,130
What I did is I tried to find an avenue 
with,

685
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:39,650
I could come in and the results were 
surprising.

686
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,610
The first thing is al forced it.
Rendition of you did.

687
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,444
Sue looked at Jujitsu from top position 
where we took our opponent down to the 

688
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,580
ground and we were on top of them.
But my study,

689
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:53,414
if you did,
so he didn't start from top position 

690
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,543
started from bottom position.
If you look at my students in 

691
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:58,784
competition,
you will notice that around 80% of the 

692
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,563
entries into lake logs come from bottom 
position or with their opponent behind 

693
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:08,820
them.
In other words from water,

694
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,820
supposedly inferior positions.

695
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:17,770
So for me it was never a question of 
losing position when I went for the logs

696
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,690
because I was already underneath my 
opponent.

697
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,950
I started underneath how can I end up on
born by going fairly,

698
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,813
I'm already on board them.
So most of my early work in Lagos was 

699
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,343
how to get into leg and disadvantageous 
positions from underneath or when 

700
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:37,310
someone is behind me.
So I never have felt this problem.

701
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:37,791
Okay,
I'm,

702
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:38,624
I'm,
I'm going to lose position if I go for 

703
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:40,994
like long.
So I could still play a conventional 

704
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:44,720
Jujitsu game and have a very,
very strong leg or can you,

705
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:47,360
that was the first avenue of leg 
locking,

706
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,010
but things became more interesting when 
I got further into the leg lock game and

707
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:57,011
I started to realize that as you add 
lake logs into the game,

708
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,770
you change the very nature of the sport.

709
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,510
If you look at Jujitsu as it's 
ordinarily practiced,

710
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,453
it's a single direction game.
If someone is in front of me and I'm 

711
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:14,614
standing over them,
Jujitsu is all about movement from the 

712
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:22,330
legs towards the head.
I'm supposed to pass the guard,

713
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,913
worked my way up to chase the chase 
contact and get my head next to their 

714
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:29,860
head,
either in front of them or behind them,

715
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,690
either mounted or remounted.
So did you,

716
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:33,524
did so always goes in one direction.
If you were to get stopped or you lose 

717
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:39,550
position,
you just start the process over again.

718
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,623
It's a monodirectional sport.
It always goes from the legs to the 

719
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:46,540
head.
Once you start adding leg walks into the

720
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:47,374
game,
Jujitsu becomes a two directional sport 

721
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:52,030
where you can go from the head down to 
the legs.

722
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:52,923
You can go in both directions.
So if I'm passing someone's guard and I 

723
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,453
simply can't do it,
I can fall back and go back into the 

724
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:00,430
legs.

725
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,310
If I'm site control on someone and they 
start to recompose the god,

726
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:04,144
I can fall back into the legs.
I'm going from the upper body down to 

727
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,444
the lower body.
Traditional chiefs who always goes from 

728
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:11,950
the lower body directionally up to the 
upper body.

729
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,770
So ended up head to head with your 
opponent.

730
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,203
But once you start adding league logs,
did you just see for the first time 

731
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:21,850
becomes a two directional score instead 
of a one directional sport.

732
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,373
And you can play your opponent's 
reactions between the threat of lower 

733
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:31,231
body and upper body in ways it opens up 
submissions so much more easily than the

734
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:32,140
traditional game.

735
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,990
So if I take you back to the moment 
where Dean Lester says to you,

736
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,690
why would you ignore 50% of the human 
body?

737
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:43,910
You go back and think about this and 
what is your next step?

738
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,773
Do you just start looking at students 
and looking at what you're teaching and 

739
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:53,330
analyzing positions and you're,
you're still rolling at the time.

740
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,860
Correct.
Um,

741
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,890
the first thing that I started to look 
at it as,

742
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,910
okay,
who out there is doing a good job of leg

743
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:05,430
walking and the owner starts or was 
everyone went,

744
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:06,264
a lot of people,
what you would see is random success 

745
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,920
with leg,
lungs.

746
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,830
You'd see a guy wins a match.
Here we got wins a match there.

747
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,780
Um,
uh,

748
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,643
most of the imminent leg lock is of that
generation are actually coming out of 

749
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:21,180
Japan.
You'd have people like Romina Sato had a

750
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:22,740
decent,
he'll hook for that time.

751
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,840
I'm an Ra,
I'm an Ra.

752
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,020
That was a little bit preliminary.
The mnr came slightly after solder.

753
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,890
They,
they,

754
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,390
they fought each other and grappling 
matches.

755
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:31,740
A couple of,
one was younger than the other.

756
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,750
Um,
uh,

757
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:34,860
but,
uh,

758
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,940
you know,
they had some success,

759
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:39,280
I believe even soccer finished newton 
with a knee bar.

760
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,250
So the knowledge was there.

761
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,533
Um,
but there was nothing systematic about 

762
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:44,610
it.
There was,

763
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,530
there wasn't,
there weren't people who were coming out

764
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:50,880
and just systematically finishing people
with one move.

765
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,530
Okay.
Um,

766
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,203
uh,
so there wasn't much in terms of people 

767
00:35:56,701 --> 00:36:00,140
to study.
So the first thing I started to ask is,

768
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,901
well,
what is the,

769
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:03,840
what is the nature of leg lock in what,
um,

770
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,210
if it's,
uh,

771
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,490
it seems to have some problems 
associated with it.

772
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,940
It's not as controlling as the 
traditional methods of Jujitsu.

773
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,300
That was the,
really the keyword there.

774
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,143
Control on Cam.
Why do people favor things that rain 

775
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:16,830
naked,
strangled so much?

776
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:17,664
Because it's such a controlling position
where amount as an incredibly 

777
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:22,450
controlling position.
Why do people favor things like cardiac?

778
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,780
Tommy,
the they,

779
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,873
um,
triangle because this too is a very 

780
00:36:26,461 --> 00:36:30,090
inherently controlling position.
All the most high percentage,

781
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,760
uh,
finishing holes in injured,

782
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:36,850
it's who all have control as their 
dominant feature.

783
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,111
Okay?
It's hot.

784
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:39,220
People were going to,
as a result,

785
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,660
one person can continue to use the same 
move that illogically of success,

786
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,010
um,
uh,

787
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:47,200
over time against the wide array of 
opponents.

788
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,160
So everything I,
every question I asked ultimately always

789
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:51,994
came back to control.
And the one thing you would see with 

790
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:58,720
regards to the use of lake logs in the 
late 1990s and early two thousands was a

791
00:36:58,721 --> 00:36:59,740
lack of control.

792
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:06,370
So all of my studies and immediately 
went to the notion of control.

793
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,193
Now there are many forms of leg lock,
but the ones that interest me the most 

794
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,090
always come out of what the Japanese 
call mushy go.

795
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:18,760
Rami,
Asha groms had generic term.

796
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:20,880
It just means tangled legs.
Okay?

797
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,170
There are many different forms of ashy 
growing ashy.

798
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,013
Grameen is a mechanism by which I can 
use to have my legs to control my 

799
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:31,350
opponents legs and hips.

800
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,283
Oops.

801
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,120
When I started to do was make a deep 
study of this notion of ashy grammy.

802
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,743
How am I going to use my legs to control
the real estate between my opponent's 

803
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:45,520
knee and his hips?
Preferably on both sides?

804
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,503
Probably the single biggest cliche that 
you'll hear about Jujitsu is it its 

805
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:51,834
position before submission.
At the time I was primary interest in 

806
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:55,644
the idea of control before submission 
control is a much deeper and wider 

807
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:02,900
concept.
Then the basic points,

808
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:07,070
structure based positional position for 
submission model a of Jujitsu.

809
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,913
It is many ways to control.
People have very little to do with with 

810
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:11,040
position.
For example,

811
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:14,790
ashy rom itself scores nothing and 
Jujitsu but done well.

812
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:17,890
It can control an opponent just as well 
as rare mount can.

813
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,033
So I started to see that there are many 
forms of control that went outside of 

814
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,800
the traditional basic positional 
hierarchy of resigned you to sue Washi.

815
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,743
He was one of them.

816
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Probably the single greatest key in the 
development of my leg lock system.

817
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,583
Again came from a simple realization 
that the greatest mistake that people 

818
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:47,111
had made in lake log work prior to the 
arrival of the squad was it.

819
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:49,774
They made no distinction between the 
mechanism of breaking and the mechanism 

820
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:58,150
of control she go,
Rami was the mechanism of control.

821
00:38:58,990 --> 00:38:59,823
The lock itself,
whether it be a heel hook and Achilles 

822
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:03,320
lock,
a figure for a toe hold.

823
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:08,430
That was the mechanism of braking.
If you watch 99% of the people out there

824
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:12,820
who claim to be experts in leg locking,
they don't distinguish between the two.

825
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,490
They see,
for example,

826
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:20,380
he'll hooking as a single skill.
There's the lock on the legs,

827
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:22,900
the ashy grammy or whatever term they 
use for it,

828
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,510
and the lock itself.
They're not distinguished.

829
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,523
That taught is a single skill.
You can't differentiate the ashy grammy 

830
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:33,250
and the lock and you'll see people 
teaching in this manner.

831
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,863
What I did was to destroy,
only distinguished between the two so 

832
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:38,764
that my students could all hold an ashy 
grammy position and switched from one 

833
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:46,840
now grommet to another and hope people 
for extended periods of time and inhibit

834
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:47,674
movement.
If I can inhibit movement for long 

835
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:53,260
periods of time,
I can break you at will.

836
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,950
I can take my time when I come to break 
you because the control is there.

837
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,300
The control is prime.
To break a second,

838
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,410
the most people is just trolling the 
ashy grameen immediately go for the law.

839
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,303
They don't even have so much.
The ashy grammy is described as part of 

840
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,140
the heel hook.
They don't distinguish between the two.

841
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,790
Once I made that realization in the 
early two thousands,

842
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:20,320
that's when the ball started rolling.
That's when,

843
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,100
um,
uh,

844
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,280
a significant amount of progress was 
made.

845
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,633
Um,
I would say that you'll question was an 

846
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:29,290
interesting one.
Okay.

847
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,450
You had the inside list.
They gave you the insight.

848
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,853
What was the,
what started you going for it was the 

849
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,943
making first a critical distinction 
between control and submission and the 

850
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:39,814
case of leg logging between the 
mechanism of control or Shiga Rami and 

851
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,950
the mechanism a breaking,
which is the lock itself.

852
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,660
In my case,
the hug.

853
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,463
Oh really good example of this is how 
effective it's been implemented by your 

854
00:40:56,011 --> 00:40:56,844
students against real world class 
presents Jiu and competitors who don't 

855
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,403
use these methods like a good one is 
Gordon Ryan versus Cyborg Cyborg who is 

856
00:41:08,521 --> 00:41:12,270
a fucking beast of a man and just a 
physical specimen.

857
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,360
A real freak and is known for his 
Tornado Guard is,

858
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,800
you know,
is no stranger to leg locks,

859
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:24,030
is no stranger to any of the positions 
of Nogi or gay Jujitsu.

860
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,133
But when I watched Gordon wrap him up 
and control him and before he got the 

861
00:41:29,911 --> 00:41:34,340
submission,
you could see Cyborg look befuddled.

862
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,233
Yeah.
He loses the match was over roughly 30 

863
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:39,260
seconds before the submission was 
applied.

864
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,333
Yeah,
he was just trying to figure out a way 

865
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:46,361
out of it and just was no way to go.
Is it terrifying position to be in for a

866
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:50,120
real world class Brazilian jujitsu black
belt,

867
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:53,240
like Cyborg when you watch that,
that match.

868
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,450
I was like,
this is stunning because Gordon is what,

869
00:41:56,451 --> 00:41:57,284
21 years,
which is amazing and Cyborgs in his 

870
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:01,790
thirties.
Right?

871
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,610
I think Cyborg has been a blight belt 
many,

872
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:06,980
many years longer than Gordon is even 
being doing Jujitsu.

873
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,940
He's one of the best guys in the world.
And when you,

874
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,833
you look at how well Gordon Dismantle 
Tim on the ground using the strategy 

875
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:22,130
that you just described it,
just see if we could find that.

876
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:26,900
Actually see if he can find Gordon Ryan 
versus uh,

877
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,640
his,
his actual name is,

878
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:33,650
I believe you pronounce it a brew.
How do you do it's the carto approved.

879
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,540
He caught,
oh,

880
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,510
Cybil.
Abreu.

881
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:36,763
Yeah,
just a lot of cyborgs in the Jiu Jitsu 

882
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:41,120
world.
There's a male Cyborg and MMA.

883
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:45,440
There's a female Cyborg,
I think Cyborg and pitfalls.

884
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,223
So we're watching it here now and you 
see Cyborg who's this fucking tank of a 

885
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:57,560
man and Gordon Ryan who's quite a 
physical specimen himself,

886
00:42:57,561 --> 00:42:59,900
but much younger guy.
It hasn't.

887
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,730
How long has John Gordon Been Doing 
Jujitsu?

888
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:05,230
I believe it's between six and a half 
and seven years total now.

889
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,540
That's fucking crazy.
And,

890
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,320
and immediately he dives under,

891
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,183
gets low

892
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,600
using butterfly guard.
And so his,

893
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,210
what he's trying to do,
um,

894
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,010
Gordon is trying to do what with cyborgs
legs.

895
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,153
Uh,
the first thing that Gordon Ryan needs 

896
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:25,460
to do is establish inside position with 
his feet.

897
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,700
If you,
uh,

898
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,860
probably the single biggest uh,
uh,

899
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,710
starting point for any kind of ashy 
grammy based game.

900
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,050
If you want to remember anything about 
this,

901
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,040
Joe,
remember this,

902
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:39,983
whenever you go into lake lungs,
the person whose feet dominate the 

903
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:46,620
inside position will always dominate the
ashy grammy game.

904
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,870
That's the heuristic that I teach all of
my students called.

905
00:43:48,871 --> 00:43:50,610
And Ryan has just established inside 
position.

906
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,630
Well,
it's just pulled him in,

907
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,703
which is interesting.
Cyborg literally pulled him in with his 

908
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:57,214
feet inside.

909
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,363
You have a Gordon,
his feet were positioned in a way where 

910
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,040
they could own the end up in,
in the inside position.

911
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:04,620
So that's the first thing he's got to 
establish inside position with the feet.

912
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,410
He knows damn well if his feet occupied 
the inside position,

913
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,570
wherever they go,
he's going to get to the,

914
00:44:09,571 --> 00:44:11,370
uh,
the ashy grammy and his opponent.

915
00:44:11,371 --> 00:44:13,470
What about a stop now?
Can we freeze it there?

916
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,410
Pass.
Okay.

917
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,480
Actually,
can you go back a little bit with,

918
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,040
uh,
with overshot to sell at all?

919
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,910
Okay.
Right about here again,

920
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,050
initially there's a battle going on here
for inside foot position.

921
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:32,070
Cyborg is an extremely well trained and 
upon it,

922
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,100
and he's doing a good job of trying to 
backstage it with his left leg.

923
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,293
He knows that if he keeps both of us 
feet on the lefthand side of Gordon 

924
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,253
Ryan's body,
he will be able to prevent his opponent 

925
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:43,860
getting inside position.
So he's doing the right thing.

926
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:45,480
He is doing a good job.
He had cyborgs,

927
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:46,320
not naive.
He's,

928
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,480
as you said before,
he's a multi time world champion.

929
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,470
He's very,
very good.

930
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,590
He's not lake locking someone who 
doesn't understand what's going on.

931
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,410
He knows what Gordon Ryan wants.
Uh,

932
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,450
there's a battle here for inside foot 
position.

933
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,070
Cyborg is doing the right thing.
He's going into a back step.

934
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:02,520
He's going to post his right hand on the
floor and try backstep out.

935
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:05,010
Let's go just a little further forward 
into the video.

936
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:09,480
Got Freeze.
I go back just a fraction.

937
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,233
Just a little more.

938
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,080
Okay.
What is Gordon's right,

939
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:23,830
right foot have uh,
his,

940
00:45:23,831 --> 00:45:26,350
his right foot.
It looks like it's hard to see here,

941
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:28,990
but it looks like he's got,
he's got inside position with one foot.

942
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:30,243
He's got inside position with one foot.
The whole question is what's going to 

943
00:45:32,171 --> 00:45:33,004
happen with cyborgs left leg.
Now we've got a battle between Gordon 

944
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,340
Ryans,
left leg and cyborgs.

945
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,020
Left leg.
Okay.

946
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,350
How the battle goes from here.
We'll come down to one thing.

947
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:47,210
Who Wins that battle?
Okay,

948
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,350
go forward.
Just a little more hook.

949
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,300
Slump right away.
Okay.

950
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:55,540
Colen Ryan just won the battle.
Essentially at this point,

951
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:56,374
the fight is over.

952
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,830
The only question is how long is it 
going to take?

953
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,870
Why am I so confident?
Am I,

954
00:46:04,871 --> 00:46:07,540
am I an asshole?
Am I saying this because I'm an asshole?

955
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08,374
No,
I'm saying cause I know what's 

956
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:09,994
happening.
I gave you one of the keynotes of the 

957
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:14,984
leg walking game already.
I'll say it again because it's so 

958
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:18,094
important.
The man whose feet dominate the inside 

959
00:46:20,621 --> 00:46:24,190
position will always dominate the ashy 
go rami game.

960
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:30,040
Now the second,
whenever you go to a tech,

961
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:30,874
someone's leg,
90% of the resistance on the leg you're 

962
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,980
attacking comes from the other leg.

963
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,570
It's so important.
I'm going to say it to you again.

964
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,420
Whenever I go to a tech,
my opponent's right leg,

965
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,900
90% of the resistance is going to come 
from his left leg.

966
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,933
We talked about control.
The foundational principle of control 

967
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:56,034
and leg logging in.
As a principal I refer to as double 

968
00:46:57,551 --> 00:46:58,384
trouble.
Double trouble is a simple idea that if 

969
00:47:00,911 --> 00:47:05,820
I control both of my opponent's legs,
he no longer has the opportunity.

970
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,880
Use a second leg to defend the first,
so the amount of trouble that you've put

971
00:47:09,881 --> 00:47:12,160
them in is literally doubled in a matter
of seconds.

972
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,700
Gordon Ryan has a hold of Cyborgs,
right leg with his left arm and he has a

973
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,670
hold of cyborgs left leg with his legs.
Why was I so confident that the match is

974
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:30,460
over at this point?
Because of cyborgs.

975
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:35,461
Legs are now controlled by Golden Ryan.
He is just attained double trouble.

976
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,553
Now let's slowly advance the video.
Do you see how cyborgs legs are in a 

977
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,000
straight line?
He's having a very,

978
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:51,940
very hard time holding his base.
Is the con stop.

979
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,860
Uh,
can you go back just a fraction

980
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:00,450
right about here.
Freeze.

981
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:06,620
Okay.
Al Whole approach to Jiu is based around

982
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:07,584
the idea of putting wages around our 
opponent's body so that we can inhibit 

983
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,200
movement.
A wage functions just as,

984
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,273
um,
at doorstopper stops the door from 

985
00:48:15,931 --> 00:48:16,764
moving in a breeze on Cam.
The only thing better than a wage is a 

986
00:48:19,651 --> 00:48:22,800
reinforced wage.
That's where the wage is locked in place

987
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:23,634
by another part of your body.
Golden Ryan currently has inside 

988
00:48:26,881 --> 00:48:30,100
position with the right leg.
He has control of sidewalks,

989
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,953
other leg with his arm.
So both legs have some degree of 

990
00:48:32,941 --> 00:48:33,774
control,
but he's about to massively reinforced 

991
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:40,740
that control by locking a triangle or a 
Sankaku around his opponent's leg.

992
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,813
In order for that to happen,
he's going to have to lift his hips 

993
00:48:42,901 --> 00:48:45,630
slightly off the floor so that he can 
elevate over cyborgs.

994
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,060
Left knee.
Watch the video.

995
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,270
There's the elevation,
there's the lock.

996
00:48:51,271 --> 00:48:52,560
Freeze,
freeze.

997
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,320
Now he's got cyborgs.
Two legs in a straight line.

998
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:56,303
That means cyborgs.
Only mechanism of posting or saving his 

999
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,850
balances,
his left arm,

1000
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:04,050
that's all he's got left at this point.
The fight is done.

1001
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,990
Cyborgs right leg is controlled by 
Golden Ryan's left arm.

1002
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,513
Cyborgs.
Left leg is controlled by a reinforced 

1003
00:49:13,861 --> 00:49:16,210
wage to strength of both Gordon riots.
Uh,

1004
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,243
legs locked up in a triangle.
Cyborgs actually a weight division 

1005
00:49:20,101 --> 00:49:21,510
heavier,
I believe then Gordon,

1006
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,870
but it doesn't matter at this point.
Both hips a controlled.

1007
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:25,883
This is a full state of double trouble.
Both legs controlled and a breaking 

1008
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:34,260
mechanism in place is an asha grammy on 
the leg.

1009
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:35,094
You can break someone from their cyborg 
knows his only method of not being 

1010
00:49:39,331 --> 00:49:42,240
finished is to keep his hips over.
Gordon Ryan's hips.

1011
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,960
So the next battle is how has Gordon 
Ryan going to put sidewalks,

1012
00:49:45,961 --> 00:49:49,950
hips on the ground?
What saving Cyborg is his left hand.

1013
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,430
Let's see how the battle goes.
The battle just got lost.

1014
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,750
The hips went down.
Why was it so easy?

1015
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,180
Stop.
Why was it so easy?

1016
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,970
I don't know.
Tell me.

1017
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,760
Do you see that right knee?
Yes.

1018
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:07,893
That's what pushed him over.
The right knee went into the pocket of 

1019
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,760
cyborgs.
Left hip.

1020
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,853
That made a directionality of force,
was slightly away from the one base of 

1021
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:21,490
support that Cyborg had left,
which was his left hand.

1022
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,310
So he got sat on his hips.
Now go forward.

1023
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:26,144
Just a little

1024
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:33,450
and freeze.
What do you see Joe?

1025
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,130
In what way?
What do you,

1026
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:40,370
what do you want me to look out?
What do you see?

1027
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,800
Both legs are wrapped up but be more 
precise?

1028
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:43,723
Uh,
well he has incredible control with his 

1029
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:46,750
right leg.
Um,

1030
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,773
the way he's got his right leg and his 
left leg triangled he's got the cyborgs 

1031
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:56,530
right foot talk deep under his arm and 
he also has the left foot there as well.

1032
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,170
So he's completely wrapped up with his 
legs and his arms.

1033
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,130
Very good.
Okay,

1034
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,560
let's bring in a few points here.
First,

1035
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,960
if you want to immobilize a human being 
and preventing it from moving,

1036
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:09,800
and what are the best things you can 
ever do is lock their legs together.

1037
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,590
You get a dangerous prisoner with the 
fish.

1038
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:13,390
Can you do handcuff his feet together 
and handcuff him?

1039
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:15,680
Saying hands together and he's no longer
dangerous.

1040
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:16,900
Okay.
He has.

1041
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:19,100
Cyborg is one of the most dangerous 
Judas who plays in the world,

1042
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:20,660
but with the two of his feet slunk 
together,

1043
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,553
he's,
he's effectively neutralized oncom 

1044
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,880
pants.
Most importantly,

1045
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:26,763
we've got a very interesting distinction
here between what we call a primary and 

1046
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:33,740
a secondary leg.
Which leg is the Asha Rami locked up on?

1047
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:41,070
Well,
he's got the left leg is was triangle.

1048
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,120
You to sound it.
That's the,

1049
00:51:42,121 --> 00:51:42,954
yes,
you Rami Lake,

1050
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:48,390
we called it the primary leg.
The ashy go Rami has locked on cyborgs.

1051
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:50,790
Left leg.
That's the primary leg.

1052
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,080
The other leg,
remember our principal of [inaudible],

1053
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,390
90% of all resistance comes from the 
second leg.

1054
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:04,130
The arm controls to secondary leg and 
the legs control the primary leg.

1055
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,233
So the resistance from the secondary leg
is pushing off and trying to separate 

1056
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:10,404
the lock.
This numerous things he could Paul mold 

1057
00:52:11,491 --> 00:52:12,324
with foot.
He could put his foot on the floor and 

1058
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:14,430
turn.
You could invert his body.

1059
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,460
There's a thousand things you could do,
but he's not doing any of them.

1060
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,010
If you control that leg.
Betsy,

1061
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,700
important theme.
So Golden Bar,

1062
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,240
Gordon,
Ryan's up the body.

1063
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:27,900
His left arm controls the secondary leg 
and his lower body,

1064
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,240
the ashy grammy controls the primary 
leg.

1065
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,090
As a result.
What do you think of cyborgs?

1066
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:35,970
Ability to move is fucked.
He's completely nullified.

1067
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,530
Yeah.
Okay,

1068
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,520
let's go a little further.

1069
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,740
Freeze.
Now cyborg is doing.

1070
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:49,860
All he can do.
Movement has been taken away from him,

1071
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,770
so his only option is to fight the 
hands.

1072
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,700
Gordon Ryan understands that he has 
control of the secondary leg,

1073
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,390
but he needs to make a transition to the
primary leg.

1074
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,343
In order to break Cyborg,
he's going to have to release the 

1075
00:53:07,531 --> 00:53:10,890
secondary league.
Now that's a,

1076
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,740
that's a scary thing.
If you release a secondary leg,

1077
00:53:13,741 --> 00:53:15,690
then your opponent cosat defended 
himself again.

1078
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:20,250
So he's got a measure how he releases 
the secondary leg.

1079
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:25,020
So it is a battle for angle here.
Cyborg is battling for the hands,

1080
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,920
but Gordon Ryan hasn't even started the 
hand fight yet.

1081
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,080
He still in the control.
Fine.

1082
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,830
His only interest is in holding the 
position.

1083
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:41,490
Go a little further.
Freeze.

1084
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:45,000
Why did golden switch his right hand to 
the knee?

1085
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,100
Well,
that's the leg that can control,

1086
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,080
or a secondary list.
Secondary Leg,

1087
00:53:52,081 --> 00:53:53,910
which can defend.
Um,

1088
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:54,803
I would imagine he's distracting him.
Why his Golden Ryan's head leaning to 

1089
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,070
the right hand side.
I don't know why.

1090
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,960
Because that society needs to take 
Cybil.

1091
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:08,250
If cyborg turns his head to the other 
side.

1092
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,190
When Gordon Ryan releases the secondary 
leg,

1093
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:12,053
he's going to be a problem.
There's a battle for angle now that no 

1094
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:20,790
one sees Gordon Ryan's head tells the 
whole story here.

1095
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,543
Let's go a little further.
Freeze and Ryan is already beginning to 

1096
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:35,370
transition to the primary leg.
It's a way he's got it locked up.

1097
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:39,150
It's just so horrific to yes,
the two of them crossed over each other.

1098
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,350
Now at some point he's got uncross the 
legs to get to the primary leg.

1099
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:49,850
Let's go a little further.
Cyborg still engage in the hand fight.

1100
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,620
Now Gordon is about to make his 
transition to the hand fight.

1101
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,163
Yeah.

1102
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,960
Freeze Gordon Ryan's made the critical 
release of the secondary leg.

1103
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:11,710
This is where things start to get 
interesting.

1104
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:18,160
Cyborg has perhaps tragically sat on his
right hip,

1105
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:22,900
which means he has no ability to use his
secondary leg to escape,

1106
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,810
and because he's holding Gordon Ryan's 
arm,

1107
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:29,860
he has no ability now to one his body 
and go into a attorney and escape.

1108
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,840
Now Gordon reinders needs to release the
right arm.

1109
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:40,950
Let's go further.
Freeze.

1110
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:53,610
Go back just to here.
Okay.

1111
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,760
Gordon Ryan is about to release a 
secondary leg freeze right there.

1112
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,500
Now,
very slowly.

1113
00:56:00,501 --> 00:56:04,280
Take it forward.
Watch Gordon Ryan's left elbow freeze.

1114
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,060
Why did he put the elbow there?
No,

1115
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:10,903
no,
no.

1116
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,833
It's a wage.
It's a mobilizing the leg he really 

1117
00:56:15,561 --> 00:56:16,394
wants to attack.
He switched his arm position from 

1118
00:56:18,861 --> 00:56:22,820
controlling the secondary leg,
which he hasn't yet fully,

1119
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:25,743
but he's put his elbow in front of the 
toes of the primary leg to keep that 

1120
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:31,240
primary life from extending.
Correct,

1121
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:32,583
and to be able to transition if it 
honestly and to the Loc or he needs now 

1122
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:42,880
is to release the right arm.
Cyborg knows if he loses the right arm,

1123
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,833
the fight is lost.
Continuing Gordon goes back to our 

1124
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:56,084
position.

1125
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,240
Freeze.
Freeze.

1126
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:04,510
Go back just to here.
Why did Gordon Ryan,

1127
00:57:06,451 --> 00:57:11,451
when the hand five battle freeze go.
Cyborg is one of the strongest people in

1128
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,153
Jujitsu.
He's got two hands on a guy in a weight 

1129
00:57:18,821 --> 00:57:21,130
division lower than him.
Why can't he hold,

1130
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,870
why did he lose the arm?
Why Watch Gordon Ryan's right elbow?

1131
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:36,820
What did you say?
Sent,

1132
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:37,683
let me say that again.

1133
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,060
He's just lifting it up and pulling it 
away.

1134
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,450
What is he doing?
He changed the angle through the elbow.

1135
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,550
There's a grip over and a grip under.
If you just pull,

1136
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,110
you'll never release the arm.
Right?

1137
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,153
He changed the elbow position so that 
one grip was lost and then a push poll 

1138
00:58:00,901 --> 00:58:05,040
with the elbow and a slip once continued
forward.

1139
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:05,874
Now he's got the left arm set.
As soon as the hands touch and sidebar 

1140
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:11,604
just taps before he even gets a chance 
to extend it because he knows the games 

1141
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:16,460
lost.
Uh,

1142
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,270
he knew the game was last long before 
then.

1143
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,690
That's pretty God damn impressive.
Mm.

1144
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:22,883
Yes.
And yet you'll see this with almost all 

1145
00:58:24,661 --> 00:58:25,494
of my students.
I have seen that was almost all your 

1146
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:27,714
students.
Which is so bizarre now how many people 

1147
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:36,171
are recognizing the system and trying to
mimic it or trying to find out some sort

1148
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,060
of a counter attack to it?

1149
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,860
Um,
that's an interesting question.

1150
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:41,723
I'm a,
I'm told is actually kind of like an 

1151
00:58:42,931 --> 00:58:47,130
industry of people who tried to break 
what we do down and mimic it.

1152
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,173
Um,
I know there's people putting out 

1153
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:54,950
numerous instructionals they've,
they've watched what uh,

1154
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,060
the squad does and tries to,
to,

1155
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,830
to break it down.
Um,

1156
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,700
that's,
that's good.

1157
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,060
And it's natural.
I,

1158
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:01,943
I'd be doing the same thing if someone 
else was coming out and we're making 

1159
00:59:03,421 --> 00:59:05,610
people with a given me a lot studying 
what they're doing to.

1160
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,040
Um,
so yeah,

1161
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:08,874
there,
there does seem to be an industry of 

1162
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,500
that.
Um,

1163
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:11,843
the question is how successful I think.
Do you see any other groups of people 

1164
00:59:15,811 --> 00:59:20,220
coming out and just exclusively 
clinician people with the same moves?

1165
00:59:20,221 --> 00:59:21,890
Time and time again,
years at a time,

1166
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:21,980
at

1167
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,000
all levels of competition?

1168
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,150
No.
You're,

1169
00:59:24,151 --> 00:59:26,790
you're seeing more 10th planet guys do 
that now.

1170
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,200
10th Planet guys have,
um,

1171
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:32,280
and given you all the credit in the 
world by the way that they've,

1172
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:33,114
um,
started transitioning to a lot more leg 

1173
00:59:34,471 --> 00:59:35,670
lock attacks,
leg lock,

1174
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:36,623
fence

1175
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:38,790
trading on that.
Yeah,

1176
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,590
it's um,
uh,

1177
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:46,070
what we find is most people definitely 
struggle with defending it and,

1178
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:48,000
um,
uh,

1179
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:48,834
you know,
this has been around for quite a while 

1180
00:59:49,351 --> 00:59:50,184
now.
It's been five years since the school 

1181
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,990
really started pushing this publicly 
and,

1182
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,460
um,
uh,

1183
00:59:56,461 --> 00:59:58,740
it seems that there's still going to be 
some,

1184
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,410
eventually people will figure things 
out.

1185
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,250
It's just the way progress works.
But,

1186
01:00:05,251 --> 01:00:06,120
um,
uh,

1187
01:00:06,121 --> 01:00:06,954
I think at this point it's pretty clear 
that people have changed their minds 

1188
01:00:10,171 --> 01:00:11,004
about leg walks.
People I think are recognizing that 

1189
01:00:12,301 --> 01:00:13,590
there's something different going on 
here,

1190
01:00:13,591 --> 01:00:17,910
that this is a control based approach to
leg locks rather than a,

1191
01:00:17,911 --> 01:00:19,800
you know,
a speed and power boast,

1192
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,800
a approach to leg logs and,
um,

1193
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,083
uh,
the evidence for its success really 

1194
01:00:25,531 --> 01:00:27,330
comes from the nature of the squad 
itself.

1195
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:29,520
If you look at the three founding 
members of the squat,

1196
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:30,560
Eddie Cummins,
Gordon,

1197
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:33,690
Ryan and Gary Taunton,
all three have very,

1198
01:00:33,691 --> 01:00:35,310
very different body types.

1199
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,820
All three have very,
very different personalities and yet all

1200
01:00:38,821 --> 01:00:42,270
three use a very similar game.
Um,

1201
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,390
two of those three athletes came from 
nowhere.

1202
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:49,110
They had no competition record before 
they started training.

1203
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:51,750
Uh,
with me at the hands of Gracie Academy.

1204
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:55,020
One of them had a competition record.
He was a,

1205
01:00:55,021 --> 01:00:56,910
I believe Gary [inaudible] was a brown 
belt,

1206
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:01,260
a competitor in the g and,
but he had no legal game.

1207
01:01:01,261 --> 01:01:02,094
He was a guy who was essentially no one 
for scrambling from bottom half guard 

1208
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:07,500
and using randek naked strangles and out
of scrambles,

1209
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,290
um,
strangles out of scrambles.

1210
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,750
My God.
Then we have such a tongue twister.

1211
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,290
Um,
uh,

1212
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:14,124
so gary,
Tom was a particularly interesting case 

1213
01:01:15,961 --> 01:01:18,420
because he came to me is an already 
developed athlete.

1214
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,160
He's trained under a very good friend of
mine,

1215
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:21,930
Tom to blast,
um,

1216
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:23,183
and completely changed his game.
So that showed something very 

1217
01:01:26,071 --> 01:01:26,904
interesting that showed that someone 
could already have a developed game and 

1218
01:01:30,181 --> 01:01:31,014
then take on this and change the game.
So that was a particularly interesting 

1219
01:01:33,301 --> 01:01:35,730
case with the case of Eddie Cummings and
Gordon Ryan.

1220
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:37,830
They came to me early in their 
development.

1221
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:38,910
So they,
they,

1222
01:01:38,911 --> 01:01:41,400
um,
they took it on wholesale as it were.

1223
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,573
I think this style and approach and one 
of the things that's so fascinating 

1224
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:52,331
about it is it really requires someone 
like you to systematically break it down

1225
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:55,700
the way you have described it.
Um,

1226
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:01,150
I've done Jujitsu for 20 years,
but I'd never stopped and thought of all

1227
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:05,600
the positions in the system,
all the steps in the system,

1228
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,940
take the fight to the ground,
get past the dangerous legs,

1229
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:08,870
you know,
uh,

1230
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,240
achieve some sort of a dominant position
and go for the submission.

1231
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,670
I didn't do that.
I knew,

1232
01:02:13,671 --> 01:02:14,504
I knew.

1233
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:15,583
What I find with most utis supplies is 
they know what they're doing on an 

1234
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:19,440
unconscious level.
Yes.

1235
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,010
My job

1236
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,410
as a coach is to make it conscious.
Okay.

1237
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,880
Um,
now for me,

1238
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:24,714
the most interesting thing when I,
when I first had to think about Jujitsu 

1239
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:28,320
is a system.
Okay.

1240
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:32,130
I did that when I wrote a book for my,
for my Sensei Henzel Gracie.

1241
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:33,533
Um,
he asked me to write a book and I 

1242
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:35,650
started thinking deeply about,
you know,

1243
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,100
what is this thing that I study?
I spend all day on a man's,

1244
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:40,030
what am I doing exactly.
And um,

1245
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:41,760
when you start consciously thinking 
about it,

1246
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:42,594
okay,
breaking it down to steps you see 

1247
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,980
presented gets was a step by step 
system.

1248
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,180
My question was,
can I go further than that?

1249
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,440
If you did sue as a simple single 
system,

1250
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:57,053
what about if he divided Jujitsu up into
niche areas and instead of having one 

1251
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,253
overall system,
you had an overall system with many 

1252
01:03:07,861 --> 01:03:12,030
subsystems within it.
So he had a lake system,

1253
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,800
a bag system,
the front headlock system,

1254
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:16,680
a Kimora system.
My approach that you did,

1255
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:18,920
sue,
is it,

1256
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:19,754
I had recognized it much of the success 
of early procedures who came from it's 

1257
01:03:23,481 --> 01:03:27,380
systematic nature of the fact that it 
was a systems based approach to Jujitsu.

1258
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:28,760
And I took

1259
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,900
various niche areas and created systems 
within systems.

1260
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:38,290
Then things start to get interesting 
when I started integrating the system so

1261
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:41,440
that one subsystem failed.
You could transfer to another.

1262
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:47,730
That meant that my students could put 
opponents who were trained much,

1263
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:50,830
much longer than they head into a niche 
area,

1264
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,490
which my students had so much knowledge 
of.

1265
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:57,070
So much training in that isolated niche 
domain.

1266
01:03:57,490 --> 01:03:59,980
To take a take,
someone who had trained three,

1267
01:03:59,981 --> 01:04:04,300
four times longs in themselves and have 
more knowledge in that one domain,

1268
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:06,760
then they're much more experienced 
opponent did.

1269
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:11,710
And so what you saw with the squad was 
incredibly speedy progress.

1270
01:04:11,711 --> 01:04:12,544
Whether we're getting wins against 
people who are trained to three to four 

1271
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,393
times longer than they had,
and this idea of what I call integrated 

1272
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:22,960
subsystems instead of having to,
so it was just one simple single system.

1273
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:26,260
You keep the overall system of Jujitsu,
but you have subsistence within it.

1274
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,740
Each one integrated with the other,
so that one's one system fails,

1275
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:33,370
you can pass off to another and it goes 
back and forth until you get the wind.

1276
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,510
That was my approach.
Do Jujitsu.

1277
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:38,200
That's one I want to do as him.
If I can innovate.

1278
01:04:38,201 --> 01:04:39,460
You did.
So in any given direction,

1279
01:04:39,461 --> 01:04:41,380
that's probably the one I would push 
them angst.

1280
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:42,693
Now throughout this time your dealing 
with some pretty significant injuries 

1281
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,710
and physical limitations that you've 
had.

1282
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:52,630
Um,
tell me about those,

1283
01:04:52,631 --> 01:04:55,210
what those were and what and how those 
hindered you.

1284
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:56,190
Yeah.
Um,

1285
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,270
uh,
when I was in my early teens,

1286
01:04:58,271 --> 01:04:59,410
I was involved in a,
um,

1287
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,400
a rugby injury where my,
my knee was massively injured.

1288
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:06,190
Um,
over the next uh,

1289
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,100
six years.
Uh,

1290
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:12,070
I would dislocate my knee ligaments 
appeared to be,

1291
01:05:12,071 --> 01:05:13,050
um,
uh,

1292
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,930
severely compromised every six months or
so I get a fresh,

1293
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,070
which would be

1294
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:18,903
severe and not be on crutches.
I spent a significant amount of my 

1295
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,890
teenage years on crutches,
um,

1296
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:29,530
around the age of 19.
I had one last injury and uh,

1297
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:33,940
my knee just seem to have no power and 
it seems like,

1298
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,320
uh,
I walk with a limp and um,

1299
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:41,540
you must remember this is in the 1980s 
in New Zealand and this is pre Mris,

1300
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,660
um,
pre orthoscopic surgery.

1301
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,360
The doctors said,
well,

1302
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:47,194
we can do an operation where we 
shortened the ligaments so there's less 

1303
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:53,560
looseness in there and hopefully your 
knee will be strong again.

1304
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:58,750
I'm an operation was performed and uh,
unfortunately the ligaments were cut too

1305
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:00,630
short.
And as a result,

1306
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,380
my,
my leg never straightened again.

1307
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,083
Um,
I developed a severe case of 

1308
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:14,290
arthrofibrosis where my knee actually 
became deformed and doesn't straighten.

1309
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,160
Um,
simple actions like walking,

1310
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:21,700
kneeling are extremely painful for me 
and have been my whole life.

1311
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:26,530
I'm just walking around,
just walking is painful neediness,

1312
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,690
extremely painful.
And um,

1313
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,190
you know,
it's not easy to do Jiu Jitsu.

1314
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,920
We did,
there's a lot of kneeling and also there

1315
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:33,754
were other kind of structural problems 
as they got older because I walk with a 

1316
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:39,910
limp and one leg significantly bent and 
one straight.

1317
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,540
Uh,
I tend to be completely out of balance,

1318
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:44,374
out of sync with my body.
So I as soon developed a considerable 

1319
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:49,150
hip and back pain.
Um,

1320
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:51,250
so this was something I carried with me 
my whole life.

1321
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,600
And,
um,

1322
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:54,203
uh,
when I started unit two at the age of 

1323
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:56,540
28,
uh,

1324
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,453
there was,
uh,

1325
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:58,750
there was a concern,
you know,

1326
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:00,400
am I going to have to do this?
Well,

1327
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:01,234
fortunately,
ground grappling as a rule is generally 

1328
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:07,240
easier on your body.
Then standing martial arts,

1329
01:07:07,241 --> 01:07:09,940
it is a,
I don't think,

1330
01:07:09,941 --> 01:07:10,840
for example,
with my leg,

1331
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:14,020
I could even become moderately effective
at more title taekwondo.

1332
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:15,730
It was something we had to get a jump 
and land.

1333
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,620
I just couldn't do it.
Um,

1334
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,810
whereas a Jujitsu,
because it's on the ground,

1335
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:21,160
you can,
you can become pretty good.

1336
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,390
Um,
so I battled through that and uh,

1337
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:28,930
I'm,
I developed a,

1338
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:30,950
a satisfactory degree of competence.
Uh,

1339
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,013
uh,
I got a blight belt from Henzel gracie 

1340
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:33,844
and I became one of his main teachers.
So you train with such a compromised 

1341
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:39,080
knee,
uh,

1342
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,960
you just figure out a way around it.
You just,

1343
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:43,560
you know,
what are you going to do sit down?

1344
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:45,220
You,
you never thought,

1345
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:47,020
well boy,
I fucked my knee up.

1346
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,270
I don't want to fuck my other knee up 
to,

1347
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:52,390
you know,
I think at that point you,

1348
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:56,140
you just got to go forward and um,
you've got a choice.

1349
01:07:56,141 --> 01:07:58,030
You got to sit down and feel sorry for 
yourself,

1350
01:07:58,031 --> 01:08:00,250
where you're going to do the best you 
can with what you've gone.

1351
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,860
And how limited was your game because 
your knee,

1352
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:03,800
I mean,
were you able to,

1353
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:04,643
standing position was difficult for me,
but will you ever do triangles and all 

1354
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:08,584
sorts of different,
I mean,

1355
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:09,730
I had,
you know,

1356
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,670
every week or so I would tweak it and 
I'd be in pain for a day.

1357
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,250
I developed,
um,

1358
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,700
a strong for Ibuprofen throughout my 
life.

1359
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,080
Um,
and uh,

1360
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:21,830
other problems started to emerge.
You switched to the lower back?

1361
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:25,700
Lower back is a big issue and gave me 
problems.

1362
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:26,534
My whole animal.
Listo now I have a machine I have to 

1363
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:30,470
show you.
Okay.

1364
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:33,260
That's a called the reverse hyper.
Have you ever heard of it?

1365
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,123
Oh yes.
Um,

1366
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:37,220
I believe they were used by a guy called
Louis Simmons.

1367
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,373
Tom?
Yes.

1368
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:41,630
Uh,
yeah.

1369
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:42,523
Yeah.
I can't use one now because they have a 

1370
01:08:43,281 --> 01:08:45,800
hip replacement.
And when you go up,

1371
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:48,110
it puts extreme shearing force on a hip 
replacement.

1372
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:51,110
So I can do it with body weight,
but I can't do it with a weight.

1373
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,393
So,
um,

1374
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,080
uh,
I'm aware of what they are.

1375
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,003
They,
I know many people speak very highly of 

1376
01:08:56,481 --> 01:08:58,730
them,
but I'm so yeah,

1377
01:08:58,731 --> 01:09:01,020
I had this problem and,
uh,

1378
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:06,250
things didn't really become critical 
until my mid to early forties.

1379
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,233
When,
as a result of walking my whole life 

1380
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:12,890
with a limp,
my left hip started to become completely

1381
01:09:12,891 --> 01:09:13,724
bone on bone.
So then the problem's doubled because 

1382
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:19,250
now I had a completely screwed up knee 
and a hip,

1383
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:20,443
but I couldn't get any kind of 
operations because George St Pierre was 

1384
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:25,430
fighting.
Chris Weidman was fighting.

1385
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:27,210
They both had great goals.
And I,

1386
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,510
I,
so I delayed the,

1387
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:30,344
uh,
the hip operation as long as they could 

1388
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:35,540
until George had his first retirement 
and Chris Weidman,

1389
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:38,420
we became a world champion and then 
moved further away to long island.

1390
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,940
It wasn't training with me so much.
Um,

1391
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,220
at that time I,
uh,

1392
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:45,710
I started training the squad and,
um,

1393
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,270
uh,
my first,

1394
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:50,660
uh,
active competitive grappling student was

1395
01:09:50,661 --> 01:09:52,490
80 cummings and,
um,

1396
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:53,773
uh,
I was able to work effectively with him 

1397
01:09:56,630 --> 01:10:00,200
as best I could with my hip problems.
Uh,

1398
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,840
and of course the original lake problem.
Um,

1399
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:07,010
and then at some point I,
it got to a point where I literally,

1400
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:08,893
if I walked down in New York City block,
I would have to stop several times and 

1401
01:10:11,961 --> 01:10:12,794
just stand on the side of the road and 
wait for my hip to stop hurting so I 

1402
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:19,460
could walk in.
It just became impossible to work with.

1403
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:21,190
And I ended up getting a,
a,

1404
01:10:21,191 --> 01:10:25,250
a full hip replacement and that's when 
they shear off the top of your head.

1405
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,113
Yeah,
the screw bolt down in there with a new 

1406
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:29,060
hip and that's correct.

1407
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,250
And how does it feel now?
It's pain free,

1408
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,070
which is a wonderful thing for me.
Um,

1409
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:35,610
like any,
uh,

1410
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:37,640
fake Hep is never going to be as strong 
as your real hip.

1411
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:39,200
There's limitations on what I can do 
there.

1412
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,393
The only problem was that shortly after 
the hip replacement wind and then my 

1413
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:47,090
knee finally collapsed after 30 years of
of problems.

1414
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,820
And so I'm going to have to get a knee 
replacement on the same leg.

1415
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:53,720
Yeah.
Who and how do they do that?

1416
01:10:53,721 --> 01:10:54,554
One?
A knee replacements a little bit tricky 

1417
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,620
because you don't have as much bone mass
to work with.

1418
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,633
And um,
general generally the longevity of knee 

1419
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:02,660
replacements is not as,
uh,

1420
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,760
cause there's much more movement and the
need.

1421
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:08,450
And there there was in the hip there's 
much greater range of motion,

1422
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,780
um,
and this less bone to a fixed two.

1423
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:14,100
They generally don't have the longevity 
of a,

1424
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:16,560
a hip replacement.
Um,

1425
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,740
so,
uh,

1426
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:19,260
I'm,
I'm 50 years old,

1427
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:23,190
so ideally you would want a replacement 
that outlived you,

1428
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:27,690
but I would probably have to get a 
second knee replacement when I get older

1429
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:31,260
to replace the first,
which is not ideal,

1430
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:32,730
but I probably gonna have to do it.

1431
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:33,893
Well,
who knows what kind of crazy technology 

1432
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,620
they'll have down the line.
I hope so.

1433
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:41,520
I have to give me some kind of superhero
leg that turns things around for me.

1434
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,170
Yeah.
Well you never know.

1435
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,970
I mean it's just the,
the nature of the hip replacement,

1436
01:11:45,971 --> 01:11:50,100
the,
so it's so brutally invasive,

1437
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:51,343
uh,
the sheering off the top of the hip and 

1438
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:53,544
then the rod that's inserted deep into 
the bone of the hip and then all that 

1439
01:11:58,801 --> 01:11:59,880
jazz.
Yeah,

1440
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:01,890
it's a lot.
It's a lot going on there.

1441
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:03,003
So,
um,

1442
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:04,390
to,
to answer your question,

1443
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:06,490
uh,
in the early days it was a,

1444
01:12:06,491 --> 01:12:08,290
it was an impediment that I worked 
around.

1445
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,270
Um,
but as I got older,

1446
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,890
um,
I had to,

1447
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,820
uh,
do a first operation and now a second,

1448
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:16,781
believe it or not,
Joe,

1449
01:12:16,781 --> 01:12:18,970
I was actually scheduled to get my knee 
replacement tomorrow.

1450
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:21,580
Um,
but I,

1451
01:12:21,581 --> 01:12:25,990
I didn't do it because Gary Toner and is
going to be fighting his first MMA fight

1452
01:12:25,991 --> 01:12:29,730
and much 26 no.
Is He fighting for one FC One FC?

1453
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:32,770
So I,
if I got the knee replacement now,

1454
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:35,360
I would not be able to help them get 
ready for us to first MMA fight,

1455
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,420
which I thought would be,
um,

1456
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:39,220
uh,
there's not fear on my part in it,

1457
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:39,910
you know.
And,

1458
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:42,070
uh,
so I delayed it until,

1459
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:43,030
uh,
after that fight.

1460
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:46,120
Why did he decide on one MC?
That's interesting question.

1461
01:12:46,121 --> 01:12:46,720
You'd have to ask.

1462
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,420
Gary told him to be certain.
Um,

1463
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,130
uh,
but he,

1464
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,353
uh,
I think one of his main fears was that 

1465
01:12:54,281 --> 01:12:58,450
if he went through the amateur route and
then worked his way towards the UFC,

1466
01:12:58,900 --> 01:12:59,733
there would be problems because he's 
already an established name in 

1467
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:02,794
grappling.
And I think he was concerned that it 

1468
01:13:04,541 --> 01:13:07,420
would be difficult for him to get people
to fight amateur,

1469
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,060
um,
and uh,

1470
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:12,520
and then eventually make its way to the 
UFC.

1471
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:17,660
Whereas one FC is a fairly well known 
organization and they were pretty open.

1472
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,553
They,
he did a grappling match for them and 

1473
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:20,770
they loved it and were like,
you know,

1474
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:23,710
are you interested in mma?
And so he could,

1475
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,120
uh,
as it were,

1476
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:30,520
um,
go into a fairly high level of mma right

1477
01:13:30,521 --> 01:13:34,060
from the start as opposed to do a long 
circuitous amateur route and then battle

1478
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:36,250
his way into the UFC.
I believe,

1479
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,720
don't quote me on this,
but I leave.

1480
01:13:37,721 --> 01:13:38,370
That was the logic

1481
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:41,960
behind it.
Now are you a book?

1482
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:46,470
So when you're demonstrating techniques,
so you're demonstrating them verbally.

1483
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:48,830
Um,
after the hip replacement,

1484
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:51,890
I could only do it verbally and I had to
trust and,

1485
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,360
uh,
my,

1486
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,620
my students,
80 cummings,

1487
01:13:54,621 --> 01:13:55,431
Gary,
Tom and Gordon,

1488
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,650
Ryan and others.
Brian Glick isn't,

1489
01:13:57,950 --> 01:13:59,480
no one knows him,
but he's one of my,

1490
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:00,380
uh,
great students.

1491
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:01,880
Um,
I would,

1492
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,430
uh,
point with a stick and,

1493
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:07,010
uh,
they would do the most for me.

1494
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:08,203
Um,
since then I've gotten a little better 

1495
01:14:09,501 --> 01:14:12,780
and I like to demonstrate as best can 
these days when I,

1496
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,620
I can barely walk.
And,

1497
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:15,454
uh,
on those days I'll have the students go 

1498
01:14:16,631 --> 01:14:17,464
through.
Sometimes there's certain standard 

1499
01:14:18,781 --> 01:14:19,614
techniques that I had a little risky for
me to do and I'll have students 

1500
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:23,560
demonstrate those.
But,

1501
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:25,090
um,
uh,

1502
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,063
I,
I do what I can on the days that I 

1503
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:29,370
teach.

1504
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:30,203
It is quite fascinating that a guy who 
was catastrophic injuries of his leg is 

1505
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:40,671
one who is known for being an innovator 
and crushing people's lives.

1506
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:41,744
There.
There is something kind of a strange 

1507
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:44,430
about that.
Yeah.

1508
01:14:44,431 --> 01:14:46,080
You were joking around about it being 
revenge.

1509
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:46,943
Yeah.
This is missing my revenge against the 

1510
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:50,610
world.
If God took away my leg,

1511
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,930
I'm taking away everybody else's.
Um,

1512
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,360
and so,
um,

1513
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:54,841
yeah,
there,

1514
01:14:54,841 --> 01:14:57,810
there was something ironic about them.
Now,

1515
01:14:57,811 --> 01:15:01,710
when your teaching this system and um,
you,

1516
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:02,573
you're,
uh,

1517
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:05,560
showing all the guys in the squad,
the Donna,

1518
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:08,070
her death squad,
do you have,

1519
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:08,963
um,
like do you have it worked out to the 

1520
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:14,250
point where it's like you have a 
curriculum?

1521
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:15,383
Like do you have like,
even like the word curriculum because 

1522
01:15:17,191 --> 01:15:18,890
that kind of implies that it's all 
worked out and yeah.

1523
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:21,960
Violence and you know,
it's done step by step.

1524
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:25,350
Um,
I come in on any given day and I'm,

1525
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,213
I'm there seven days a week.
I watch all of my athletes every single 

1526
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:29,904
day.
They didn't do anything without me 

1527
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:32,003
watching them do it.
So I know at the end of every day what 

1528
01:15:34,651 --> 01:15:36,750
they need to work on tomorrow because 
I'm there.

1529
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,430
So it's not like a set curriculum early.
You know,

1530
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,780
I know that on April 13 I'm going to do 
this.

1531
01:15:42,781 --> 01:15:46,260
And it's not like that.
It's like I saw you train yesterday.

1532
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:48,480
I saw where you fucked up and I saw 
where you were good.

1533
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:50,370
So tomorrow we're working this.

1534
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,403
What an amazing resource for those guys 
to have someone like you standing over 

1535
01:15:54,831 --> 01:15:55,664
them,
watching them and analyzing their 

1536
01:15:57,321 --> 01:15:59,450
positions and techniques and progress.

1537
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,700
That's um,
that's generous of you to say.

1538
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,713
Um,
but I always feel that my students are 

1539
01:16:06,891 --> 01:16:09,290
more of a resource to me than I am to 
them.

1540
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:10,543
I've been blessed through my entire 
coaching career to have some truly 

1541
01:16:13,431 --> 01:16:17,390
remarkable students,
some of whom are famous and known to you

1542
01:16:17,391 --> 01:16:19,700
and many others who aren't.
And,

1543
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:21,230
um,
uh,

1544
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:26,260
whatever debt they owe to me,
I feel I owe at least as much to them.

1545
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,113
Um,
my students literally give me 

1546
01:16:31,011 --> 01:16:31,950
everything.
I'm,

1547
01:16:31,951 --> 01:16:34,430
I'm a notoriously difficult person to 
get along with them,

1548
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,500
demanding I'm,
I'm a perfectionist.

1549
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:39,590
I can be downright unpleasant when my 
body's in pain,

1550
01:16:39,591 --> 01:16:41,690
I'm short tempered.
Um,

1551
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:45,770
and yet they're like angels.
They based stick in there and they tough

1552
01:16:45,771 --> 01:16:48,440
it out and they,
they give so much time,

1553
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:50,090
so much effort,
so much thought.

1554
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,840
And as I said,
whatever resource I am to them,

1555
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:55,640
they,
they give it right back.

1556
01:16:55,641 --> 01:16:56,630
There are a resource to me.

1557
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:57,983
Well that that attitude is why you're 
such a fantastic coach in the first 

1558
01:17:00,421 --> 01:17:01,430
place.
Um,

1559
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:02,303
I remember one of the first times I've 
started talking to you is when you were 

1560
01:17:05,311 --> 01:17:10,311
working with George.
Now what's interesting is you had a very

1561
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:15,430
interesting approach and even the way 
you describe things you would talk about

1562
01:17:15,651 --> 01:17:16,640
shoot boxing.

1563
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:17,623
Hmm.

1564
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:22,540
Describe that because you,
you didn't talk when like I remember,

1565
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:23,374
uh,
I think one of our first long 

1566
01:17:24,401 --> 01:17:25,234
conversations with at some weird denny's
or something somewhere and one of those 

1567
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:33,370
weird roadshows,
like will it just sat down where you are

1568
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:33,970
absolutely.
Right.

1569
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:38,770
That was the first time we met.
We had a long conversation and um,

1570
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,680
you were talking about the principles of
shoot boxing.

1571
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,930
Please explain.
Um,

1572
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:48,580
one of the strange things about the 
sport of mixed martial arts is so young.

1573
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:53,380
There's still so much to be done.
Okay.

1574
01:17:53,381 --> 01:17:57,370
Even the way people understand mixed 
martial arts to me is interesting.

1575
01:17:58,780 --> 01:17:59,613
99% of people who look at mixed martial 
arts see mixed martial arts as an 

1576
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:07,420
eclectic sport.
In other words,

1577
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:11,320
it's a conglomeration of different 
martial arts kind of banded together and

1578
01:18:11,321 --> 01:18:14,650
then you've got mixed martial arts.
It's a mix of martial arts and there you

1579
01:18:14,651 --> 01:18:16,380
have it.
You get two guys in a cage.

1580
01:18:16,381 --> 01:18:17,214
And what mixed martial arts,
I never saw mixed martial arts as an 

1581
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:25,150
eclectic sport.
I see it as a transcendent sport.

1582
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:27,333
What I mean by that is there were four 
distinct skill areas of mixed martial 

1583
01:18:32,471 --> 01:18:37,471
arts.
Any one of those skill areas always goes

1584
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:41,740
beyond the component martial arts that 
make it up.

1585
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:44,043
In other words,
the skill area transcends the various 

1586
01:18:47,471 --> 01:18:48,304
martial arts that make it up and create 
something bigger and different from the 

1587
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:54,910
core components that originally built 
it.

1588
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,880
When you look at the sport of mixed 
martial arts,

1589
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:00,460
you see there were four dominant skill 
areas.

1590
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:02,613
The first occurs when they first come 
out and the two athletes who have no 

1591
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:08,830
connection with each other and they're 
dancing around the cage.

1592
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,010
This is the so called shoot boxing 
phase,

1593
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:17,950
which involves skills drawn from western
boxing,

1594
01:19:17,951 --> 01:19:21,250
Muay Thai karate,
a freestyle wrestling,

1595
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,413
and various other martial arts with the 
two athletes are jockeying for position 

1596
01:19:26,021 --> 01:19:29,020
and typically they're trying to 
determine the direction of the fight.

1597
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:34,120
Would it go down or would it stay up?
That's one skill area.

1598
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,333
The second skill area as a skill area of
the clinch with the two athletes are 

1599
01:19:39,491 --> 01:19:40,324
both still standing,
but now they've got a hold on each 

1600
01:19:41,801 --> 01:19:42,634
other.
They no longer moving around will this 

1601
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:50,530
has its key components come and drill 
them from Moitai,

1602
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,580
Greco,
Roman wrestling,

1603
01:19:51,581 --> 01:19:52,840
freestyle wrestling,
judo,

1604
01:19:52,841 --> 01:19:53,674
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1605
01:19:55,330 --> 01:20:00,330
Then there's a third key skill area.
The area of fence fighting fence.

1606
01:20:04,771 --> 01:20:07,860
Boxing with a two athletes are in a 
clinch,

1607
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,113
but they're locked on the fence,
which dramatically changes the skills 

1608
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:14,610
required for success than if you're in 
the open.

1609
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:19,350
And then you have a fourth skill area,
which is the ground.

1610
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:22,320
And of course that's divided into top 
and bottom position.

1611
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:27,210
So there were four skill areas of mixed 
martial arts.

1612
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:30,260
You could add more or less.
Uh,

1613
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:31,643
for example,
you could add in the idea of the 

1614
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:34,890
geography of the cage can add a new 
areas,

1615
01:20:34,891 --> 01:20:37,140
but let's stick with that fundamental 
four for now.

1616
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:41,550
If you show me any one of those skill 
areas,

1617
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:47,270
yes you can derive skills from those 
component martial arts,

1618
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:49,880
from Moitai,
from Judah,

1619
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:50,873
whatever you choose.
But that skill here is going to have 

1620
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,073
other elements that are not part of 
those original martial arts that has 

1621
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:02,460
something different,
something unique and something above the

1622
01:21:02,461 --> 01:21:04,620
various component martial arts that made
it up

1623
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:08,013
when you're fighting on the ground,
a lot of what you do is the ride from 

1624
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:12,580
Brazilian Jujitsu and modern mixed 
martial arts.

1625
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:14,600
Most of the athletes come from a to two 
background.

1626
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,053
When they work ground skills they they 
work on in a kind of a Jujitsu 

1627
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:21,400
framework,
but many of the things going on down,

1628
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:22,234
there are a mix of things that are far 
outside of your daily training and 

1629
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:30,240
designed units.
You can bring in things from Moitai,

1630
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,870
you're throwing Moitai al was on the 
ground,

1631
01:21:31,871 --> 01:21:33,940
but on the ground the,
I always have a very different feel from

1632
01:21:33,941 --> 01:21:35,160
the standing position.
They've,

1633
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:37,090
a mechanics behind them is significantly
different.

1634
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:38,403
You're throwing hooks on the ground,
but the mechanics of and hooks on the 

1635
01:21:41,951 --> 01:21:42,784
ground have very,
very different from the mechanics of 

1636
01:21:43,721 --> 01:21:46,570
throwing hooks in the standing position.
So yeah,

1637
01:21:46,571 --> 01:21:48,720
you're,
you're bringing skills in from box,

1638
01:21:48,721 --> 01:21:51,860
but you're adapting them to God.

1639
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,790
So the way to look at the sport of mixed
martial arts is not just like,

1640
01:21:54,820 --> 01:21:55,653
okay,
I'm going to rope together some race 

1641
01:21:56,831 --> 01:21:57,664
lanes and boxing and see what happens.
Rather you're developing skills in four 

1642
01:22:03,911 --> 01:22:05,770
distinct areas,
a minimum of four,

1643
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:10,510
and the skills you ultimately develop go
beyond.

1644
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:15,580
And I'd significantly different from the
core components that you started with.

1645
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:17,493
And so ultimately the skills of a mixed 
martial artist at the highest levels 

1646
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:24,520
transcend the various corps martial arts
that made the sport up.

1647
01:22:24,521 --> 01:22:29,230
You're going to something,
you're going further when you fight in a

1648
01:22:29,231 --> 01:22:31,090
mixed martial arts fighter in your 
Jujitsu fighter,

1649
01:22:31,091 --> 01:22:34,630
huge in a lot more than just you did sir
and the various other boxing styles,

1650
01:22:34,631 --> 01:22:35,770
et Cetera,
et cetera that you used.

1651
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,220
In the case of shute box and and George 
St Pierre,

1652
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:42,850
everyone always talks about George's 
wrestling.

1653
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:48,000
Now George is a very good wrestler.
He's wrestler a long time with very good

1654
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:53,001
people,
but 90% of the success of his ability to

1655
01:22:53,931 --> 01:22:54,764
take people down goes far beyond 
wrestling and has to do with the 

1656
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:03,770
precursors to the shot.
What wrestling teachers,

1657
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:06,070
he drew a mixed martial arts is how to a
shot.

1658
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,070
It gives you the body mechanics to 
finish the shot,

1659
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:15,180
but the sit ups completely different 
from wrestling.

1660
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,073
I can show you endless examples of good 
liz who went into mixed martial arts 

1661
01:23:20,081 --> 01:23:20,914
competition with no background in mixed 
martial arts and couldn't take anybody 

1662
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:25,750
down.
That distance is different.

1663
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:27,370
The standards,
different emotion is different.

1664
01:23:27,371 --> 01:23:29,950
The set ups are completely different.
The context is different.

1665
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:31,330
You've been punched sort of grappling.

1666
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:34,553
Okay.

1667
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,550
George,
in my opinion,

1668
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:44,610
throughout his career had a level of 
skill and technical insight and the,

1669
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,393
the art of boxing kickboxing into take 
downs that no one else has even come 

1670
01:23:51,961 --> 01:23:52,794
close to.
Much of what he did in that area came 

1671
01:23:59,071 --> 01:24:01,320
from himself.
Did he have good wrestling coaches?

1672
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,450
Absolutely.
Did he have good boxing coaches?

1673
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,150
Absolutely.
Great.

1674
01:24:06,151 --> 01:24:08,040
Moitai coaches 100%.

1675
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:09,980
Okay.

1676
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:14,980
But the skills he was exhibiting went 
beyond any one of those teachers or even

1677
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:16,783
them as a whole.
The act of tying together all of those 

1678
01:24:21,381 --> 01:24:25,640
disparate skills came from him.
The integration of skills.

1679
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:29,720
And so you have someone who had a 
wrestling background,

1680
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,150
had a boxing background,
had a Moitai background,

1681
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:32,984
but ultimately what he was doing with 
something bigger than all of those put 

1682
01:24:35,241 --> 01:24:36,074
together,
there's a sign of just to get fit here 

1683
01:24:37,671 --> 01:24:38,450
with,
uh,

1684
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:40,920
the,
the sum was,

1685
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:44,270
was somehow greater than the components 
that,

1686
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:46,220
uh,
individually made it up.

1687
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,860
And that's what I mean when I talk about
a trans in and support.

1688
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:54,440
Um,
George St Pierre was largely responsible

1689
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:55,483
through individual experimentation 
starting in his late teens and going 

1690
01:24:59,361 --> 01:25:02,270
through his entire career in the 
development of shoot box.

1691
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:06,153
Now when you work as a coach for George,
you weren't just working as a Jujitsu 

1692
01:25:10,870 --> 01:25:11,703
coach,
you were working in almost like a 

1693
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:18,841
mastermind sort of a position you,
I mean I saw some conversations that you

1694
01:25:20,111 --> 01:25:24,640
had with him where you discussed various
things and in fact one of the things you

1695
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:25,474
came to me about was you asked me if I 
knew anyone who was proficient at the 

1696
01:25:30,071 --> 01:25:34,480
spinning back kick and that's how I got 
to working with George.

1697
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:36,130
Your,
your,

1698
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:40,550
your coaching with him was not just 
simply like the,

1699
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,200
these are the principles of Jiu Jitsu.
This is what I want you to work on.

1700
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,213
When the fight goes to the ground,
you were working on a lot of different 

1701
01:25:48,761 --> 01:25:50,860
aspects.
Like you are a guy,

1702
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:51,703
they'd sort of put it together.
Now when you don't have a background in 

1703
01:25:55,541 --> 01:25:57,580
striking and you know,
you,

1704
01:25:57,710 --> 01:25:58,543
you were looking at all of these various
disciplines and trying to formulate a 

1705
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:06,230
strategy for a guy who just such a 
supreme athlete like George,

1706
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:09,080
how did you,
how did you formulate that?

1707
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,943
Did you do it based on the individual 
and based on their physical strengths 

1708
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:14,054
and limitations and sort of formulate 
what you think would be the best 

1709
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:17,774
approach?
Did you work it out with him in 

1710
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:20,240
conjunction?

1711
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,100
Um,
the,

1712
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:24,490
when,
when George comes to train with me this,

1713
01:26:24,491 --> 01:26:26,060
there's a bunch of considerations.
First of all,

1714
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,040
George lives in Montreal.
I live in New York.

1715
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:30,090
So time is always an issue.
Well,

1716
01:26:30,091 --> 01:26:32,210
he does go down there because then they 
quite often,

1717
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,380
but um,
uh,

1718
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:35,930
but it's not like a squat.
The squat like seven days a week,

1719
01:26:35,931 --> 01:26:37,490
three times a day.
George was never liked that.

1720
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,650
Um,
uh,

1721
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:44,690
so in the time available we'll work on,
uh,

1722
01:26:44,710 --> 01:26:45,800
on,
on what we can,

1723
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:47,050
so everything's always done with 
Georgia.

1724
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:48,103
Okay.
How much time is available and what is 

1725
01:26:49,311 --> 01:26:51,200
the scenario that's coming up for 
George?

1726
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:52,400
Almost always.
That was,

1727
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:53,670
um,
uh,

1728
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,910
an upcoming mixed martial arts fight.
Okay.

1729
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,170
Um,
so a lot of people often ask me to say,

1730
01:26:58,171 --> 01:26:58,431
well,
you know,

1731
01:26:58,431 --> 01:27:00,950
how can we didn't teach,
teach George Saint Pierre Lake logs,

1732
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:04,340
why wasn't he leg lock and everyone in 
mma?

1733
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,260
Um,
well it's,

1734
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:07,610
it's a good question.
Uh,

1735
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,320
first off,
um,

1736
01:27:10,430 --> 01:27:11,263
leg locking as you saw from the Gordon 
Ryan Clip requires if it's not done 

1737
01:27:16,581 --> 01:27:17,414
well,
leg log in is one of those things where 

1738
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:19,490
if it's done well,
it's amazing,

1739
01:27:19,491 --> 01:27:20,324
but if it's done badly,
it's the worst looking thing in the 

1740
01:27:21,531 --> 01:27:23,630
world and said disaster.
Um,

1741
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,280
so,
uh,

1742
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:26,143
secondly,
Georgia's game because his down to so 

1743
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:31,310
strong as almost always done from top 
position on the ground.

1744
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:33,800
Is it rare for George to be in bottomed 
session on the ground?

1745
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,530
Um,
and in a fight situation,

1746
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:37,364
if you're already on top of someone and 
you've got the striking prowess of 

1747
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:41,510
George St Pierre,
I was happy to,

1748
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,660
to coach him more and what we call a 
grapple boxing.

1749
01:27:44,661 --> 01:27:45,494
Just the skill of,
of grappling to punching on the ground 

1750
01:27:47,911 --> 01:27:50,390
that just made more sense for him.
Um,

1751
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,313
he's competent and leg logging,
but he's not like Gary Thompson and 

1752
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:56,060
Eddie Cummings or Gordon Ryan.

1753
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:57,950
It could,
he finished most black belts.

1754
01:27:57,951 --> 01:27:58,784
He absolutely.
But why would you stake a fight where 

1755
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:03,650
literally millions of dollars?
I mean 40 is a legacy on the line.

1756
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:04,753
Why would you take that risk when you 
could just stay on time to punch him 

1757
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:07,364
out?
Peggy did was say John Fetch for 

1758
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:08,810
example,
you know,

1759
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,670
um,
so it didn't really make sense that push

1760
01:28:11,671 --> 01:28:13,610
that hard on George.
Um,

1761
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:14,930
your question though was,
okay,

1762
01:28:14,931 --> 01:28:17,840
well what about these other skills?
What about standing position?

1763
01:28:17,841 --> 01:28:18,740
Well,
um,

1764
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:19,603
I'm,
I'm fascinated not just by judges who 

1765
01:28:20,641 --> 01:28:24,820
are my martial arts in general.
And I've always believed all the various

1766
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:25,663
sport martial arts in the world have 
areas where they are particularly 

1767
01:28:28,911 --> 01:28:29,840
strong.
For example,

1768
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:31,940
I've always people make fun of 
taekwondo,

1769
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:32,950
you know,
that are,

1770
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:34,420
dude,
don't want to just talk with him and him

1771
01:28:34,421 --> 01:28:36,730
and me,
you'll back me up on this joke.

1772
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:40,700
There are some taekwondo players out 
there at Olympic level who can kick with

1773
01:28:40,701 --> 01:28:43,550
a skill level that most people can't 
even imagine.

1774
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:45,890
Um,
uh,

1775
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,753
I've seen people like heard Perez 
kicking demonstrations where you're 

1776
01:28:51,231 --> 01:28:52,064
looking at it as,
this is one of the most impressive 

1777
01:28:52,701 --> 01:28:55,370
things I've ever seen in my life and 
this is as the guy who,

1778
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:57,380
if he hits you,
it's going to take your head off.

1779
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,710
It's impressive to borrowers.
There wouldn't hurt.

1780
01:28:59,711 --> 01:29:02,040
Pres was in his prime.
I watched him.

1781
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:03,960
Oh,
quite a few people.

1782
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:04,853
I watched him Kao uh,
one of the u s national champions with 

1783
01:29:07,051 --> 01:29:10,560
an ax care,
some of the worst Kaos have ever seen in

1784
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:11,394
my life came from taekwondo.
Like they tend to involve a jump 

1785
01:29:14,821 --> 01:29:17,400
spinning kicks with is just huge amounts
of,

1786
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:19,270
of,
of kinetic energy being developed.

1787
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,153
You see the same thing can point 
fighting crises and terrible knock outs 

1788
01:29:22,011 --> 01:29:24,360
and point finding because people make 
fun of these sports.

1789
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:27,540
Acting on their own is the issue.
That's the issue.

1790
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:29,310
That's the issue on their own.
They got problems.

1791
01:29:29,311 --> 01:29:31,420
But if you can integrate that into the 
door,

1792
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:33,420
well developed,
complete skillset,

1793
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:34,283
they could be incredibly effective.
And I always saw tremendous potential 

1794
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:39,240
for Tae Kwon dos jumps,
spinning back kick.

1795
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:42,510
No one does spinning back x better than 
taekwondo.

1796
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:44,580
Yeah.
That's one of the main things.

1797
01:29:44,581 --> 01:29:45,690
And they do it incredibly well.

1798
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:48,510
The set ups are fantastic that the 
application and mechanics,

1799
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:51,660
everything's super impressive.
So I always thought that would be a,

1800
01:29:51,661 --> 01:29:53,490
you know,
George had a good spinning back kick,

1801
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:54,990
but I thought that would be a nice 
addition.

1802
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:58,410
You always want to be building new 
skills into upon or you don't,

1803
01:29:58,530 --> 01:29:59,363
you don't want to be that predictable 
guide where everyone knows what you're 

1804
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:02,610
doing.
And um,

1805
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:03,613
uh,
and I know you came from taekwondo 

1806
01:30:04,501 --> 01:30:05,334
backgrounds and uh,
so I thought that would be an 

1807
01:30:06,451 --> 01:30:08,310
interesting thing for you to work on 
with him.

1808
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,160
Well,
it was a funny conversation because that

1809
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:12,750
was my specialty.
Yes.

1810
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,880
And so when you brought in,
I always wanted to talk to you.

1811
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:18,060
I was fuck found your fascinating guy.
So when he came up to me and you said,

1812
01:30:18,061 --> 01:30:20,610
do you know anyone,
it's almost like a trick question.

1813
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:21,600
It was a trick question.

1814
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,140
You know,
anyone besides your aunt,

1815
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:26,850
what I sat,
I was like,

1816
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:28,860
I was hesitant.
I was like,

1817
01:30:28,861 --> 01:30:30,540
okay,
you're not going to believe this.

1818
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:34,140
But the truth is,
I knew you had a good jump spinning back

1819
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:35,340
kick.
I was trying to subtly,

1820
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:36,243
did you?
Yeah.

1821
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:40,950
How did you know word gets around.
I thought you were just fucking with me.

1822
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,260
I mean I,
but I,

1823
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:46,050
I felt like when I was telling you I was
like man I don't even want to,

1824
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,470
I wish I knew someone who did it with 
two ls.

1825
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:49,763
You should have just been like yeah I've
got the best jump spinning back kick in 

1826
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:52,464
the fucking world.
I did jump spinning back kick quite a 

1827
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:56,610
bit but I prefer a regular spinning 
back.

1828
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:59,580
I want my foot on the ground cause I'm 
just going off of that foot.

1829
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,710
Yeah,
there's a significant amount of force in

1830
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:05,610
the left leg forcing,
pushing off that back.

1831
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:06,653
Interestingly you've seen some some guys
out there now having good success and 

1832
01:31:09,721 --> 01:31:12,060
even maybe staying back.
Cause I remember seeing Michael Page had

1833
01:31:12,061 --> 01:31:12,894
a beautiful one.
He's got everything that guy can very 

1834
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:15,594
impressive.
He's another guy who came from that 

1835
01:31:16,921 --> 01:31:18,980
point fighting background.
You know,

1836
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:19,823
you see Raymond Daniels and him and a 
lot of these guys from that background 

1837
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:27,870
that are defendant.
Daniel's worked with George for his last

1838
01:31:27,871 --> 01:31:28,860
two fights.
Very,

1839
01:31:28,861 --> 01:31:30,480
very impressive guy.
Phenomenal.

1840
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,161
Yeah.
And,

1841
01:31:31,161 --> 01:31:32,260
and again,
it's,

1842
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:33,503
he had just the point fighting skills 
and now he's developing real boxing 

1843
01:31:37,261 --> 01:31:38,910
skills and he's,
you know,

1844
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:41,160
you've seen him in Beltour kickbox,
you know,

1845
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:42,870
and you see,
you see the integration of the two.

1846
01:31:42,871 --> 01:31:44,100
It's phenomenal.
I mean,

1847
01:31:44,101 --> 01:31:44,934
he could just do things physically that 
most kickboxer just really don't know 

1848
01:31:48,781 --> 01:31:50,190
what he's doing.
He'll,

1849
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:54,990
he'll jump up and do what's called like 
a touch spinning back kick.

1850
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,080
Like he'll jump up and touch you with 
the front leg.

1851
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,820
I saw that,
hit it in a glorified I believe.

1852
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,450
And um,
yeah,

1853
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:05,080
he's phenomenal.
He's phenomenal.

1854
01:32:05,081 --> 01:32:05,914
But the,
again,

1855
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:11,020
when you see that it's like those things
by themselves,

1856
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:13,240
you're just going to get taken to the 
ground and smashed.

1857
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:14,074
And most people,
unless you land one of those 

1858
01:32:16,301 --> 01:32:18,220
catastrophic spinning back kicks right 
away,

1859
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,530
the the odds are you,
you,

1860
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:24,700
you need all those other things as well 
in order to be particularly effective,

1861
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:29,120
which is why George was such a thing.
Yeah.

1862
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:30,760
Yeah.
But that was a,

1863
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:32,223
that was a fun moment.
It was an interesting because like I've 

1864
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:36,010
always wanted to like show somebody 
this.

1865
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:38,380
It's cause it's a weird little thing 
that I know how to do.

1866
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:41,010
Um,
going back to your original question,

1867
01:32:41,011 --> 01:32:41,844
the idea of Georgian and shoot box,
you will see that Georgia's entire 

1868
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,053
methodology in a standing position is 
built around the concept of a dilemma 

1869
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:54,060
that the Lemur is always between his jet
and his takedown.

1870
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:59,520
People always talk about proactive and 
reactive takedowns.

1871
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:00,923
Okay.
This guy's are reactive to discuss a 

1872
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:02,874
proactive takedown guy.
The thing about George is he would use 

1873
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,093
his jab proactively,
but he would use his takedowns 

1874
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:12,383
reactively.
Now that's interesting because George 

1875
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:17,910
would literally provoke people.

1876
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:19,740
You're saying,
take down,

1877
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:20,643
oh,
I just want to point this out past 

1878
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:24,900
tense.
You're saying this like,

1879
01:33:24,901 --> 01:33:26,190
you know something.
I don't know.

1880
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:26,670
No,
no,

1881
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:27,503
no.
It's George just won the middleweight 

1882
01:33:29,221 --> 01:33:30,990
title,
relinquished the title,

1883
01:33:30,991 --> 01:33:33,570
and then the great speculation is will 
George fight again?

1884
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:34,453
Yeah.
The truth is no one knows because it 

1885
01:33:35,691 --> 01:33:37,700
comes down some medical problems.
George has,

1886
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:38,534
uh,
uh,

1887
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:39,453
uh,
he's got a problem on his stomach and 

1888
01:33:42,030 --> 01:33:44,110
colitis.
Is that what it is and what,

1889
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:45,510
what is that exactly?
It's,

1890
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,433
uh,
I'm not going to claim to be a medical 

1891
01:33:47,301 --> 01:33:48,134
expert,
but it's one of the most frustrating 

1892
01:33:49,401 --> 01:33:50,234
things that George has had to deal with 
where there are certain parts of the 

1893
01:33:53,181 --> 01:33:55,640
human body to just out of your control 
and the stomach is one of them.

1894
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:58,070
Just things happening in your stomach,
you can't control it.

1895
01:33:58,071 --> 01:33:59,990
Things like stress seem to make it 
worse.

1896
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,240
Um,
and uh,

1897
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,520
uh,
the truth is that no one really knows at

1898
01:34:04,521 --> 01:34:05,600
this point.
So,

1899
01:34:05,601 --> 01:34:07,190
um,
wherever this doubt,

1900
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:08,083
my

1901
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:10,620
instinct is to think,
well,

1902
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:12,180
you really want to come back,
George,

1903
01:34:12,181 --> 01:34:15,930
you've done all this and what a great 
way to cap off a career too.

1904
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:17,570
It was amazing.
It was in person.

1905
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,680
I got to tell you,
when he came back,

1906
01:34:19,681 --> 01:34:21,660
this is what was really interesting 
about that fight.

1907
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:24,090
George had said,
I'm better,

1908
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:26,460
I'm a better martial artists than I was 
before.

1909
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:28,900
And he looked better.
I mean,

1910
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:32,400
he definitely looked like he was a 
little out of competition.

1911
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:33,503
Like there was a moment he should,
how many fighters do you know came back 

1912
01:34:36,571 --> 01:34:38,490
up to a four year layoff.
Very few.

1913
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:39,953
But skill wise he looked phenomenal.
I mean his striking looked incredibly 

1914
01:34:44,641 --> 01:34:49,641
smooth and I think you could see it in 
bisping's face like pretty early on.

1915
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:51,173
Like this guy is,
this is not a rusty George Saint Pierre 

1916
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:56,220
is not a small welterweight who's,
you know,

1917
01:34:56,221 --> 01:34:58,460
making his way in the,
where he looked huge.

1918
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,410
He looked phenomenal.
His,

1919
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:04,460
his technique,
the way he was landing leg kicks and his

1920
01:35:04,461 --> 01:35:05,294
Sharp Jab.
And then ultimately that left hand that 

1921
01:35:07,461 --> 01:35:09,410
he used to stun bisbing and get him on 
the ground.

1922
01:35:09,411 --> 01:35:11,030
I mean,
he looks sensational.

1923
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:11,600
Yes.

1924
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,760
Um,
uh,

1925
01:35:13,820 --> 01:35:14,653
you were there the night George went 
into his first retirement and you'll 

1926
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:19,340
recall the whole retirement thing was 
kind of,

1927
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:20,840
the speech was vague.
It wasn't,

1928
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,730
it was confusing.
And because he did,

1929
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:25,610
in truth,
he didn't know if he wanted to retire.

1930
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,833
Um,
the whole thing was actually contrived 

1931
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:31,940
in the octagon right there in front of 
you.

1932
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:33,770
I would be in a hard fight.
Uh,

1933
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:35,760
training camp hadn't been the best camp 
though.

1934
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:37,360
The fight for Hendricks was,
uh,

1935
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,350
George was unclear if he wanted to fight
it all.

1936
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:40,184
There were,
there's all kinds of controversies 

1937
01:35:40,881 --> 01:35:42,610
involved in the fight.
And um,

1938
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:44,090
then when the fight was over,
it was,

1939
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:46,400
it was a very close fight.
Um,

1940
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:48,820
and uh,
uh,

1941
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:52,370
he wasn't sure what he wanted to do.
There was some language miscommunication

1942
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:54,043
and ultimately he essentially,
he walked away from the game and he 

1943
01:35:57,081 --> 01:35:58,220
walked away for four years.

1944
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:01,550
That's a long time to be out of a sport 
that as young as him or main,

1945
01:36:01,551 --> 01:36:03,230
which is evolving all the time every 
year,

1946
01:36:03,231 --> 01:36:04,490
the sport changes.
And,

1947
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:07,040
uh,
the belts tend to change hands very,

1948
01:36:07,041 --> 01:36:08,840
very quickly.
Um,

1949
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:13,520
so when George started talking to me 
about the idea of,

1950
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,810
okay,
I want to come back,

1951
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:17,240
I think I've still got conveyed.
I want to come back.

1952
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,460
This a desire,
passion.

1953
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:23,810
My point to him was,
first off you show you really want to do

1954
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:24,260
this.
Like,

1955
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,870
you know the last two fight camps,
it's tough.

1956
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:29,360
You didn't seem to have the same kind of
drives.

1957
01:36:29,361 --> 01:36:30,920
He used to have you show you want to do 
this.

1958
01:36:30,921 --> 01:36:31,754
Is this like a middle aged fantasy he 
going through here and he said none of 

1959
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,050
that.
I feel this,

1960
01:36:36,051 --> 01:36:36,884
I want to come back.
So my question to him was if you're 

1961
01:36:40,701 --> 01:36:43,790
going to come back,
I just going to do the same thing.

1962
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:46,850
You just going to come back to 
welterweight and do what you always did,

1963
01:36:46,851 --> 01:36:51,020
which has come out and beat the base 
well to weights and just hold a title.

1964
01:36:51,030 --> 01:36:53,000
It's used to going to be doing the same 
thing.

1965
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:57,980
I thought if he gonna come back,
let's do something significant.

1966
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:58,903
Something you haven't done before.
And so the way I put it to him was what 

1967
01:37:03,021 --> 01:37:03,854
are the three most persistent criticisms
you always hear about George Saint 

1968
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:08,720
Pierre?
Number one,

1969
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:11,750
you never fought up a weight class,
never went up.

1970
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:14,420
Number two,
you fought.

1971
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,313
So tactically sound was such an emphasis
on a strategy and techniques or what 

1972
01:37:21,531 --> 01:37:24,590
have you.
That matches could become dull.

1973
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:27,380
That the average fan was like,
well,

1974
01:37:27,381 --> 01:37:27,871
yeah,
he's,

1975
01:37:27,871 --> 01:37:29,420
he's winning easily.
It's dominant,

1976
01:37:29,421 --> 01:37:31,340
but it doesn't do it for,
it's not excited.

1977
01:37:31,341 --> 01:37:34,520
No drama in the funds on gun.
Um,

1978
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:37,130
so he had this idea that,
uh,

1979
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:39,530
on the one hand,
uh,

1980
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:40,683
uh,
he was very technically sound 

1981
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:42,224
strategically deep,
but the fights weren't as exciting as 

1982
01:37:45,711 --> 01:37:46,544
they ought to be.

1983
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:49,700
Um,
the idea that he'd never gone up,

1984
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,553
uh,
a weight category and the third most 

1985
01:37:51,801 --> 01:37:53,690
persistent Chris and we didn't finish 
fights.

1986
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:55,131
Okay.
He at,

1987
01:37:55,131 --> 01:37:57,630
he was a very skilled fighter.
It wasn't finishing fights.

1988
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:00,150
So my point is,
okay,

1989
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,013
if you're going to come back,
let's do it in a way where you address 

1990
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:06,060
those three things.
Okay.

1991
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:10,070
George is always concerned about his 
legacy as a fighter.

1992
01:38:10,071 --> 01:38:12,840
And if there were three persistent 
criticisms of George NPS legacy,

1993
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:14,790
it was those three things.
You're not finishing fights.

1994
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:17,130
You never went up a weight class and 
you're too tactical.

1995
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:18,653
Okay?
You're not providing the drama that a 

1996
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:22,620
fight should.
So I said,

1997
01:38:22,621 --> 01:38:27,621
let's change things.
We've got in that four years.

1998
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,640
Previous to that,
whenever I was training George,

1999
01:38:29,641 --> 01:38:32,370
I was training him for a fight.
He was not with fire fighting.

2000
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:33,960
Nick Diaz is finding cars,
condos,

2001
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:34,530
finding,
you know,

2002
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:35,363
whoever.
And it was always getting him ready for 

2003
01:38:36,601 --> 01:38:38,340
a fight.
You Find Matt Hughes in two months,

2004
01:38:38,341 --> 01:38:39,174
let's get ready now you're a tired,
I'm not going to train you to find some 

2005
01:38:43,561 --> 01:38:48,561
dude going to train you in Jujitsu.
Freddie Roach.

2006
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,160
It's going to train you in boxing

2007
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:55,363
in this sense we could,
we hit the time now to start working on 

2008
01:38:59,031 --> 01:38:59,864
finishing skills.
A significant change occurred where my 

2009
01:39:03,381 --> 01:39:04,214
primary emphasis in training George in 
that four year layoff was in 

2010
01:39:07,671 --> 01:39:10,940
submissions.
Now happily that happened at what time?

2011
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,100
The time the school,
it was coming out.

2012
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:14,653
So I had a group of some of the best 
submission peoples in the world for 

2013
01:39:17,631 --> 01:39:18,464
George to work with.
So it was submission started getting 

2014
01:39:20,151 --> 01:39:21,860
better.
Suddenly George Saint Pierre,

2015
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:25,460
he got on your back is a problem.
He's submitting people in the gym.

2016
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,270
I could run off some names.
I won't do it because it's not the thing

2017
01:39:29,271 --> 01:39:30,104
to do.
But I could run off some names of 

2018
01:39:30,651 --> 01:39:32,450
people.
He submitted an agenda would shock you,

2019
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:33,703
like well known Judah to people.
And for the first time he's our primary 

2020
01:39:37,161 --> 01:39:39,500
versus wasn't on grapple walks in.
It was submission.

2021
01:39:41,780 --> 01:39:44,810
Freddie Roach was working on what was on
the mechanics of punching.

2022
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,320
George always had good in out movement.
Who was head like that karate movement.

2023
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,790
The um,
the ability,

2024
01:39:49,791 --> 01:39:53,090
he always had a strong jab,
but now he's teaching them how to sit on

2025
01:39:53,091 --> 01:39:54,890
a punch.
70 George had a left hook.

2026
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:59,220
Okay.
And you're a guy who can integrate left,

2027
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:00,443
uh,
left hand chip between jab and lift or 

2028
01:40:01,941 --> 01:40:05,020
gets a dangerous man.
Um,

2029
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:06,420
everyone was worried,
you know,

2030
01:40:06,421 --> 01:40:09,390
there's so much overreaction to George's
jab is suddenly left talk.

2031
01:40:09,391 --> 01:40:12,060
Opportunities are opening up and now he 
was sitting on that left hook and people

2032
01:40:12,061 --> 01:40:12,894
getting hurt.
So now for the first time you got a guy 

2033
01:40:15,151 --> 01:40:18,360
who's got submissions and he's hitting 
with genuine power.

2034
01:40:23,170 --> 01:40:24,003
As he came back,
it was a question of who's going to be 

2035
01:40:26,861 --> 01:40:31,010
the opponent?
And the next thing I say it is,

2036
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:32,240
well,
you know,

2037
01:40:32,241 --> 01:40:36,990
went up a weight division,
go up to 85 now.

2038
01:40:36,991 --> 01:40:37,430
Now

2039
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:41,810
was any consideration about going up to 
85 because the fact that bisping was the

2040
01:40:41,811 --> 01:40:42,790
champion,
no.

2041
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:43,633
George has trained with business and the
decision was made before piston was the 

2042
01:40:46,311 --> 01:40:47,300
champion.
Real?

2043
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,193
Yeah.
How far in advance was the decision 

2044
01:40:50,091 --> 01:40:50,924
made?
Because bisbing had defended against 

2045
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:54,170
Henderson won against four

2046
01:40:54,180 --> 01:40:56,300
year project.
Okay.

2047
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,153
I didn't know initially.
Initially I couldn't make that decision 

2048
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:00,874
because then another student of mine,
Chris Weidman was the one 85 pound 

2049
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:05,320
champion and Chris and Georgia never 
fight each other.

2050
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:08,560
But once that was no longer an issue,
then it was like,

2051
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:09,160
hey,
this,

2052
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,590
this could work.
This could be interesting.

2053
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:15,800
So d during the entire four years he was
talking about eventually becoming,

2054
01:41:15,801 --> 01:41:17,450
not the entire four years.
No.

2055
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:20,230
Okay.
But he was training the whole time and I

2056
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:22,260
was pushing him a kid,
you don't fight anymore.

2057
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:23,890
Let's do some submission grappling.
Right.

2058
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:24,940
Okay.
Um,

2059
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,540
he stuck with Freddie Roach.
She loves working with Freddie Roach.

2060
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,433
And,
um,

2061
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:32,260
uh,
so the training was,

2062
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:35,050
was going in different directions.
It was this Moitai coach.

2063
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:38,480
Um,
mostly he works at Ferrazzi Hobby and,

2064
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:42,340
and tries to that,
but that's more a integrated for us as a

2065
01:41:42,341 --> 01:41:43,000
black belt of mine.

2066
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,320
So he,
um,

2067
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:45,580
often,
uh,

2068
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:48,840
does Jujitsu with fluoroscopy,
had I teach for us in frost,

2069
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:51,220
that does a good job there.
Um,

2070
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:52,550
but for us,
uh,

2071
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:53,463
ties things together,
let's his principal function and I know 

2072
01:41:55,361 --> 01:41:56,194
he trained with Phil nurse for awhile.
Then he trained with a lot of guys who 

2073
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:01,310
came out of,
uh,

2074
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:04,450
uh,
Thailand itself from Tiger Moy,

2075
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:05,800
Tai,
um,

2076
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:07,570
uh,
yard.

2077
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:11,170
That's a shortening of his actual name.
They will have very long names,

2078
01:42:11,171 --> 01:42:12,004
but a yard was one of his trainers.
They trained him prior to condit and 

2079
01:42:15,401 --> 01:42:17,230
Diaz,
um,

2080
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:18,850
uh,
did a fine job.

2081
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:22,570
So there's never been a shortage of 
coaches in his life,

2082
01:42:22,571 --> 01:42:23,830
but,
uh,

2083
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,530
there were certain things that seem to 
gel with them more than others.

2084
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:29,050
Interestingly,
during that four year period,

2085
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:30,333
George had a strong rebirth into karate 
and worked with a lot of specialized 

2086
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:36,880
created people,
including Raymond Daniels and others.

2087
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:38,380
Uh,
they came from the,

2088
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:42,340
mostly from the European point fighting 
karate a circuit and he was working with

2089
01:42:42,341 --> 01:42:46,650
them a lot.
And so somewhere or eh,

2090
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:47,753
the cross has certain poor a period of 
time where you're dealing with a 

2091
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,620
different athlete.
Now this is the guy who's had four years

2092
01:42:53,621 --> 01:42:55,840
off and the train had gone in different 
directions.

2093
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:57,333
It's finishing skills in both fisticuffs
and grappling had gotten considerably 

2094
01:43:01,781 --> 01:43:03,590
better.
Um,

2095
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:04,653
he was toying with the idea of going up 
to 85 and experimented with diet and et 

2096
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:12,310
Cetera to get his body weight up.
That's never an easy thing to do.

2097
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:14,283
And tactically he was working more on 
the idea of being an exciting fighter 

2098
01:43:18,581 --> 01:43:22,090
through movement and pushing harder for 
the finish.

2099
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:23,620
And,
uh,

2100
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,490
and I thought those were three very,
very healthy directions to go and,

2101
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:30,010
and um,
uh,

2102
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,600
this would,
as it were,

2103
01:43:31,601 --> 01:43:32,434
if he did come back,
this would be offer a genuine 

2104
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:37,930
opportunity to address the three most 
persistent criticism of his career.

2105
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:39,543
Initially,
there was a lot of resistance from the 

2106
01:43:40,451 --> 01:43:42,100
UFC.
I don't think they were fond of the idea

2107
01:43:42,101 --> 01:43:43,810
at all.
They wanted him to go to one 70 and,

2108
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:46,210
and do what he had done.
And uh,

2109
01:43:46,211 --> 01:43:49,270
but George pushed hard for the,
uh,

2110
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:53,420
for the fight at 85 and ultimately it 
happened in a rather strange way.

2111
01:43:53,421 --> 01:43:57,470
Tyrone Woodley had a fight at one 70.
What?

2112
01:43:57,471 --> 01:44:02,471
Shum uh,
wasn't the most crowd pleasing fight and

2113
01:44:03,081 --> 01:44:04,370
uh,
uh,

2114
01:44:04,490 --> 01:44:08,110
George St Pierre was supposed to fight 
tyrone woodley and in UFC,

2115
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:10,460
you know what fibers mean,
it's on.

2116
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,250
So they,
we chose the Madison Square Garden.

2117
01:44:13,310 --> 01:44:15,740
That's one of the great fight capitols 
of the world.

2118
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:16,663
And it's how it happened.
So there was consideration in fighting 

2119
01:44:19,161 --> 01:44:20,270
one 70.
Yes.

2120
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:25,170
And so this was the ufc his idea,
but what about your python for I,

2121
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:27,690
I thought first of all,
I'm,

2122
01:44:27,691 --> 01:44:28,850
I'm,
I'm not the matchmaker.

2123
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:32,780
I'm not the main policy making under,
I don't want to say that I was the guy,

2124
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:34,910
I was the guy that suggested those 
ideas.

2125
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:37,430
And George seems to like the idea,
he said,

2126
01:44:37,431 --> 01:44:38,264
if I'm going to come back,
if we're going to take the risk of a 

2127
01:44:39,411 --> 01:44:41,300
four year layoff and come back,
it's a big risk,

2128
01:44:41,301 --> 01:44:41,900
you know?
Yeah.

2129
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:43,790
I mean,
Muhammad Ali came back after three years

2130
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:46,850
and had to warm up fights and still lost
his title phone.

2131
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:49,820
But Muhammad Ali wehrly wasn't working 
out.

2132
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:52,790
That was,
that was when the Vietnam war thing,

2133
01:44:52,791 --> 01:44:55,180
it happens mostly doing tours of college
game.

2134
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:58,070
It wasn't really working out the whole 
time and improving.

2135
01:44:58,170 --> 01:44:59,780
You can see the difference in Muhammad 
Ali,

2136
01:44:59,781 --> 01:45:01,370
his body when he came back,
it's still,

2137
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:02,204
there's many other examples that you,
sugar ray Leonard came back after 

2138
01:45:04,011 --> 01:45:04,844
layoffs.
He had one successful and one very 

2139
01:45:05,901 --> 01:45:08,510
unsuccessful come back and he was 
working hard the whole time.

2140
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:10,820
So coming back,
cause it's a hard,

2141
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,253
tricky thing on many levels too.
Not just physical but also 

2142
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:15,203
psychological.
So now this collitus thing is thrown a 

2143
01:45:17,181 --> 01:45:18,014
monkey wrench into the gears.
If actually it threw a monkey wrench 

2144
01:45:20,210 --> 01:45:21,740
during the camp.
Really?

2145
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:23,900
I could tell you some stories about 
that.

2146
01:45:23,901 --> 01:45:26,270
That camp was uh,
as,

2147
01:45:26,271 --> 01:45:29,600
as good as the four years was.
The camp itself,

2148
01:45:29,601 --> 01:45:31,160
I,
I can say it now because it's over,

2149
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:34,070
was a disaster.
It was probably the worst camp I've ever

2150
01:45:34,071 --> 01:45:35,240
been involved in.
A really,

2151
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:38,390
I was coaching of course the scored for 
ADCC.

2152
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:39,950
So,
uh,

2153
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:43,940
adcc I believe was around six weeks,
uh,

2154
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:44,803
before George is fine.
So I was in Finland and communicating 

2155
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:50,960
with George and he's like,
feeling good.

2156
01:45:50,961 --> 01:45:51,794
Let's get the moment I get back,
I'm just going to get on a plane from 

2157
01:45:53,631 --> 01:45:56,030
Finland to Montreal and start the camp.

2158
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:59,080
Uh,
George sent me out.

2159
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:03,920
I've got stomach issues and I was like,
what do you mean stomach issues?

2160
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:06,620
What does that even mean now?
Um,

2161
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:09,950
uh,
about two weeks into the camp,

2162
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:14,390
the issues got so bad that George 
literally could not,

2163
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,970
now this is a six week fight camp.
It's a very short camp.

2164
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:19,070
Back in the day we used to do eight to 
12 weeks,

2165
01:46:19,190 --> 01:46:20,960
but George thought a shorter camp would 
be better.

2166
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:22,100
He,
as he's getting older,

2167
01:46:22,101 --> 01:46:25,510
he wanted to short at camp.
First two weeks were okayed,

2168
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:28,110
but I was in,
uh,

2169
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:32,170
the aftermath of the Finland expedition 
and um,

2170
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:33,770
uh,
when I first went up,

2171
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:35,540
George said,
I've got to cancel.

2172
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:37,003
Okay.
I,

2173
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:41,780
uh,
I can't train my fights four weeks away.

2174
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:44,203
And George took two weeks off.
It was a critical moment on a Friday 

2175
01:46:48,141 --> 01:46:50,790
evening where I say it to for Rasa 
Hobby,

2176
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:53,190
this is the second time I've had to say 
this to for our salary.

2177
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:57,690
The other was the Carlos condit camp.
I say George isn't training by Monday we

2178
01:46:57,691 --> 01:46:59,850
can to pull the plug,
there's no other way.

2179
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:05,460
And we were talking about a four year 
layoff and this camp is lost.

2180
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:06,383
It's dead in the water.
So four weeks out he takes two weeks 

2181
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:09,640
off.
Uh,

2182
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:12,540
I believe it might've been five.
I'll check the dates later,

2183
01:47:12,541 --> 01:47:13,374
but I'm very close to it.
There was a critical two week period 

2184
01:47:16,471 --> 01:47:18,420
where during that two weeks,
what is he able to do?

2185
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,370
Essentially?
Nothing.

2186
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:21,263
Nothing.
Yeah.

2187
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:24,060
Just no train light drilling some 
movement.

2188
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:25,060
And uh,
he,

2189
01:47:25,061 --> 01:47:26,300
he was,
it,

2190
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:28,710
it occurred the worst possible time.
It,

2191
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:29,573
it wasn't at the start of the,
was in the middle of the camp so that 

2192
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:35,070
the first two weeks were lost because 
then,

2193
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:36,990
uh,
we had two weeks of inactivity.

2194
01:47:37,110 --> 01:47:41,850
Then there's two weeks left.
And I remember the first time I went up,

2195
01:47:41,851 --> 01:47:44,400
I bought Jake Shields,
Gary Turner and Gordon Ryan with me.

2196
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:48,360
And we came up and we went through some 
drills on the ground and I was happy,

2197
01:47:48,390 --> 01:47:49,590
you know,
Joseph Del k on the ground.

2198
01:47:49,591 --> 01:47:51,810
He did fine against the score guys.
And um,

2199
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:53,273
uh,
we worked on some specialized grabbing 

2200
01:47:54,481 --> 01:47:56,910
stuff and then the next day he went to 
do a shoot box workout.

2201
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,193
Now I could sit here all day until you 
adventures of George St Pierre Doing 

2202
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:06,480
shoe box training with people.
I've seen him spot everybody.

2203
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:08,580
Okay.
I'm not gonna mention names,

2204
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:13,860
but I've seen George Saint Pierre 
takedown effortlessly.

2205
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:19,470
Some of the biggest names in mixed 
martial arts in weight divisions,

2206
01:48:19,471 --> 01:48:23,750
far above his own so many times per 
round.

2207
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,320
You just lose count.
Nigga.

2208
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:27,030
I,
I,

2209
01:48:27,031 --> 01:48:27,864
I'm,
I'm afraid to even tell you the stories 

2210
01:48:28,801 --> 01:48:31,170
because people wouldn't believe me.
Um,

2211
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:34,050
I'm used to seeing George Saint Pierre 
has shoot boxing,

2212
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:34,431
bap,
bap,

2213
01:48:34,431 --> 01:48:35,370
bap,
Bang down.

2214
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:36,480
Right.
Okay.

2215
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:37,613
Um,
I've seen that since the thought of his 

2216
01:48:39,841 --> 01:48:43,320
career,
I watched Joe Saint Pierre to a shoe box

2217
01:48:43,321 --> 01:48:45,660
workout where he couldn't score a take 
down.

2218
01:48:46,530 --> 01:48:49,560
This is a fights two weeks away.
I'm just looking,

2219
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:51,030
going like,
holy heck,

2220
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:53,340
what is this?
He's getting hit,

2221
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:55,920
he's getting frustrated,
he's getting tired.

2222
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:58,370
And I said to Varanasi,
us,

2223
01:48:58,380 --> 01:48:59,550
you know,
this is,

2224
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:00,443
this is a crisis.
This is one of the biggest uscs of the 

2225
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:05,460
year.
It's Madison Square Garden.

2226
01:49:05,461 --> 01:49:06,294
He's the headline.
The USC had to pull some big things to 

2227
01:49:10,531 --> 01:49:12,900
get this fight to happen.
They didn't originally didn't want it.

2228
01:49:12,901 --> 01:49:15,090
If we pull out now,
it's going to look like a disaster.

2229
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:17,220
It's going to be George let the UFC 
down.

2230
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:21,570
Um,
and to his everlasting credit,

2231
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:22,973
George said,
I'll be back on Monday and I'll be 

2232
01:49:25,441 --> 01:49:27,120
better.
We went up and,

2233
01:49:28,050 --> 01:49:29,220
uh,
he,

2234
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:31,050
he is,
he dug in deep.

2235
01:49:31,051 --> 01:49:33,240
What can I tell you?
He's a trooper.

2236
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:34,193
He,
um,

2237
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:35,123
he trained every day,
those last two weeks and as each day 

2238
01:49:39,151 --> 01:49:40,890
went by,
there was significant improvement.

2239
01:49:40,891 --> 01:49:42,630
And I remember there was a distinct 
moment,

2240
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:44,340
about five days before the end of the 
camp,

2241
01:49:44,341 --> 01:49:45,870
I swung to a shoot box,
work out,

2242
01:49:45,930 --> 01:49:48,250
and he looked like the old George and I 
was,

2243
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:50,230
okay,
I believe in this care again.

2244
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,300
You can do it.

2245
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,830
Jamie,
will you please google?

2246
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:56,790
Collitus I don't know enough.
I believe he should.

2247
01:49:56,791 --> 01:49:59,430
What the goals?
Ulcerative colitis.

2248
01:50:01,290 --> 01:50:02,640
Yeah.
I don't know.

2249
01:50:02,641 --> 01:50:03,474
It's so it,
it's something to do with stomach 

2250
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:05,970
ulcers.
Um,

2251
01:50:06,030 --> 01:50:08,030
I'm not going to claim to be an expert,
but uh,

2252
01:50:08,070 --> 01:50:10,260
yeah,
I can tell you what the symptoms were.

2253
01:50:10,261 --> 01:50:13,110
I was extreme stomach pain and inability
to eat at,

2254
01:50:13,111 --> 01:50:15,330
screwed up his entire diet.
And when did it start?

2255
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,433
Uh,
it's not an early in the camp and got 

2256
01:50:17,461 --> 01:50:19,770
progressively worse and then hit for the
camp.

2257
01:50:19,771 --> 01:50:21,180
There was no issues.
Uh,

2258
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:24,750
here,
all sort of colitis is usually only,

2259
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:25,673
uh,
in innermost lining of the large 

2260
01:50:27,241 --> 01:50:28,074
intestine,
colon and rectum forms range from mild 

2261
01:50:30,151 --> 01:50:30,984
to severe.
Having all sort of colitis puts a 

2262
01:50:32,581 --> 01:50:33,414
patient at increased risk of developing 
colon cancer symptoms including rectal 

2263
01:50:36,811 --> 01:50:38,190
bleeding,
bloody diarrhea,

2264
01:50:38,191 --> 01:50:41,010
abdominal cramps and pain.
And it sounds like a party.

2265
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,240
Yeah.
If you read the,

2266
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:46,350
can you bring it back,
read the first four treatment,

2267
01:50:46,351 --> 01:50:48,810
can help with this condition,
cannot be cured,

2268
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,960
requires a medical diagnosis,
lab tests or imaging.

2269
01:50:51,961 --> 01:50:56,760
Always required chronic can last for 
years or be lifelong.

2270
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,220
It's incredibly frustrating for him to 
deal with.

2271
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:02,220
And it says treatments,
including medications and surgery.

2272
01:51:02,650 --> 01:51:06,160
Yeah.
So it's a forgery,

2273
01:51:06,970 --> 01:51:07,900
but,
uh,

2274
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:10,960
it appeared to back off a little bit in 
the last two weeks.

2275
01:51:10,961 --> 01:51:12,600
He came back and he,
um,

2276
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:15,700
this is the kind of person,
George Saint Pierre.

2277
01:51:15,701 --> 01:51:16,534
It's the morning of the fight.
Saturday morning we're in New York City 

2278
01:51:19,961 --> 01:51:22,210
in the hotel room,
uh,

2279
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:23,141
for us,
uh,

2280
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:24,580
hobbies,
Freddie Roach and myself,

2281
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:27,760
or at the breakfast table,
George comes down for breakfast and he's

2282
01:51:27,761 --> 01:51:28,594
weighed in,
he looks at his breakfast is originally 

2283
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:39,760
the plan because it was a fight at one 
85 was to have george come in at a,

2284
01:51:39,761 --> 01:51:44,761
at a higher body weight.
But he ended up weighing 191 pounds,

2285
01:51:45,191 --> 01:51:48,010
which is exactly the same as he used to 
fight at welterweight,

2286
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:51,340
the same body weight.
So that was kind of a disappointment,

2287
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:52,900
you know.
Um,

2288
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:54,543
and uh,
he quietly excuse himself and went to 

2289
01:51:57,551 --> 01:51:58,384
the bathroom.
Everyone else went away to do their 

2290
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:00,250
things.

2291
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:04,150
And I sat there and I realized he's in 
the bathroom for an hour.

2292
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:06,900
He came out and I would say,
George,

2293
01:52:06,901 --> 01:52:08,470
you okay?
And he looked at me,

2294
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:09,304
he said,
I'm fine,

2295
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:12,910
but I knew he wasn't.
And then he went out,

2296
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:14,560
fought.
Um,

2297
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:15,903
and then afterwards he told me I was in 
so much pain and he was afraid to tell 

2298
01:52:19,811 --> 01:52:20,644
me because he would worry that if I 
cornered him and I thought he was 

2299
01:52:23,321 --> 01:52:24,154
compromised,
I wouldn't call him the way I normally 

2300
01:52:25,421 --> 01:52:27,400
would,
that I would doubt him.

2301
01:52:28,030 --> 01:52:29,890
So he kept it all inside,
didn't say a word.

2302
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:32,290
And uh,
he's a good kid.

2303
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:34,420
You know,
you can't help but to it like that.

2304
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:37,730
Wow.
Well that's what makes them a champion.

2305
01:52:37,731 --> 01:52:38,930
Yeah.
That's one of the things,

2306
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:41,570
it's,
it's less than perfect conditions.

2307
01:52:41,571 --> 01:52:43,910
He could still rise to the occasion less
than perfect.

2308
01:52:43,911 --> 01:52:45,980
It was a very far from perfect.

2309
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,270
Now you said that during the Johnny 
Hendricks fight during the camp for that

2310
01:52:50,271 --> 01:52:51,104
fight,
when he decided to impromptu retire 

2311
01:52:54,261 --> 01:52:58,580
inside the octagon yeah.
That there was talk during the camp that

2312
01:52:58,581 --> 01:52:59,710
he didn't want to fight.
Yeah.

2313
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:00,793
What was that about?

2314
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,980
Uh,
really centered around two things.

2315
01:53:02,981 --> 01:53:03,840
One,
I can just,

2316
01:53:03,970 --> 01:53:08,260
I can not discuss because it involves a 
personal life.

2317
01:53:08,261 --> 01:53:09,094
Joe Saint Pa,
there was some things going on in his 

2318
01:53:10,031 --> 01:53:12,440
personal life that,
um,

2319
01:53:12,970 --> 01:53:13,803
uh,
deeply affected him and he was deeply 

2320
01:53:16,871 --> 01:53:19,890
unhappy with some circumstances in his 
personal life and I'm,

2321
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:21,670
it's not appropriate for me to talk 
about those.

2322
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,113
Um,
and the second was the whole idea that 

2323
01:53:25,541 --> 01:53:27,910
it become an obsession with George at 
that time,

2324
01:53:27,911 --> 01:53:31,570
which is the use of anabolic steroids in
mixed martial arts.

2325
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:33,063
And um,
he was deeply unhappy with what he 

2326
01:53:36,791 --> 01:53:37,624
perceived as the prevalence of the use 
of anabolic steroids in mixed martial 

2327
01:53:40,721 --> 01:53:44,470
arts as a whole and among his opponents 
in particular.

2328
01:53:45,370 --> 01:53:47,380
And um,
uh,

2329
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:51,250
he wanted a testing program to be bought
in for that fight.

2330
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,560
There was talk about it but nothing came
of it.

2331
01:53:53,770 --> 01:53:54,603
And,
uh,

2332
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:59,940
it became like this psychological 
obsession during the camp and uh,

2333
01:54:00,700 --> 01:54:03,250
uh,
between those two issues,

2334
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:05,110
uh,
there was a lot of unhappiness.

2335
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:07,450
He came in,
he did a strain,

2336
01:54:07,451 --> 01:54:07,831
you know,
he's,

2337
01:54:07,831 --> 01:54:08,664
he's a professional athlete.
It's not like he missed workouts or 

2338
01:54:09,821 --> 01:54:12,340
anything crazy like there wasn't a going
out at night or anything foolish,

2339
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:13,713
but there was a degree of unhappiness 
where I'm looking and thinking how much 

2340
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:19,930
longer in this go on

2341
01:54:21,610 --> 01:54:22,443
now there was some talk about the tyron 
Woodley fight and then tyron had this 

2342
01:54:29,201 --> 01:54:30,034
bad performance,
but if George did get healthy and was 

2343
01:54:35,471 --> 01:54:39,130
confident enough in his health that he 
could get through,

2344
01:54:39,131 --> 01:54:39,964
get through an actual training camp,
would he be interested in considering a 

2345
01:54:42,701 --> 01:54:43,720
fight with Tyron Woodley?

2346
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:44,880
Absolutely.
I think Tyron,

2347
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:47,390
what is a great champion?
I know he gets a lot of steak,

2348
01:54:47,391 --> 01:54:49,340
a lot of flag.
That kid is talented,

2349
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:50,650
very talented,
very good,

2350
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:52,750
and he doesn't think George wants to 
fight him.

2351
01:54:52,751 --> 01:54:54,340
He was on the podcast the other day.

2352
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:59,630
People say that for reasons so that they
can motivate someone defined,

2353
01:54:59,790 --> 01:55:00,623
et Cetera,
et cetera.

2354
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:02,063
There's a political aspect to it and I 
think that both athletes have a deep 

2355
01:55:03,791 --> 01:55:05,890
respect for each other.
Um,

2356
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:09,010
targeted wound.
He's a very,

2357
01:55:09,011 --> 01:55:13,330
very difficult opponent to beat.
These people criticize his style,

2358
01:55:13,331 --> 01:55:14,164
but people don't understand difference 
between regular fighting and 

2359
01:55:16,721 --> 01:55:17,554
championship fighting.
Championship fighting is about winning 

2360
01:55:19,031 --> 01:55:21,340
and losing and you got to do what you 
gotta do to win.

2361
01:55:21,490 --> 01:55:24,700
That's the first consideration.
It's nice to impress the crowd.

2362
01:55:24,701 --> 01:55:25,534
It's nice to do this or that,
but ultimately it's about what are you 

2363
01:55:27,881 --> 01:55:28,990
going to do to win?
What do you,

2364
01:55:28,991 --> 01:55:31,030
what are you going to do to beat the 
second best guy in the world?

2365
01:55:31,031 --> 01:55:33,160
That's a difficult,
difficult thing.

2366
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:34,303
It has to be done correctly.
This idea of fighting to entertain this 

2367
01:55:38,151 --> 01:55:41,040
is a very complex thing and you talked 
about it with,

2368
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:41,923
uh,
George addressing that are attempted to 

2369
01:55:43,531 --> 01:55:44,364
address that in his comeback and trying 
to finish and be more energetic and 

2370
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:51,030
aggressive.
But the reality is that's not always the

2371
01:55:51,031 --> 01:55:54,510
best way to engage.
There's is a right way to fight a person

2372
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:58,620
with a particular skillset.
And especially in the Woodley,

2373
01:55:58,900 --> 01:55:59,910
uh,
versus,

2374
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:01,560
uh,
Stephen Wonderboy Thompson fights.

2375
01:56:01,561 --> 01:56:02,280
Yeah.
I was like,

2376
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:04,950
this is the only way to find that guy.
You cannot,

2377
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:07,410
I mean,
unless you are what he is,

2378
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:12,650
which is a very skillful traditional 
martial artist that has this very unique

2379
01:56:13,381 --> 01:56:14,214
ability to bend at the waist,
like a snake and slide in with 

2380
01:56:16,681 --> 01:56:19,200
techniques and it does a lot off the 
front leg.

2381
01:56:19,201 --> 01:56:22,650
Dangerous stuff off the front leg.
Unless you can do that too.

2382
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:24,810
You really shouldn't be on the outside 
striking with him.

2383
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:25,703
It's just,
it's just too weird that styles too 

2384
01:56:26,881 --> 01:56:27,714
weird.
So he kind of had the lay back and if 

2385
01:56:30,091 --> 01:56:32,910
you and I that again,
if you look at the results of the fight,

2386
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:36,000
the times in the fight where someone was
hurt,

2387
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:39,900
it was tyron woodley putting the hurt on
wonderboy Thompson.

2388
01:56:39,901 --> 01:56:40,734
Yes.
Those are the only times in the fight 

2389
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:43,590
where it was really exciting.
Other than that,

2390
01:56:43,591 --> 01:56:44,424
it was sort of wonderboy kind of trying 
to pick out them from the outside and 

2391
01:56:47,881 --> 01:56:50,220
um,
it's a very difficult fight to look good

2392
01:56:50,221 --> 01:56:51,054
at.

2393
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,890
Um,
you know,

2394
01:56:52,980 --> 01:56:55,430
the whole idea of mixed martial arts 
fans,

2395
01:56:56,030 --> 01:57:00,110
there's always three kinds of people 
that watch mixed martial arts.

2396
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:04,970
There's fans of drama is fans of 
violence and his fans of strategy.

2397
01:57:04,971 --> 01:57:08,150
And technique.
Guys like us,

2398
01:57:08,151 --> 01:57:11,380
when we watch mma,
we fall into the technique and strategy.

2399
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:14,900
That's the guy to me.
I can watch Woodley flight one,

2400
01:57:14,901 --> 01:57:16,080
the boy,
and I'm fascinated by that.

2401
01:57:16,090 --> 01:57:17,060
To me that's just like,
wow.

2402
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:18,980
I said magic.
How can watch it all day?

2403
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:23,660
Um,
many of the fans want to see violence.

2404
01:57:23,720 --> 01:57:26,750
That's what they're tracking too.
And it's a significant portion.

2405
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:28,083
Um,
others like the idea of drama and 

2406
01:57:29,930 --> 01:57:30,763
athletes in a sense have to brand 
themselves according to one of those 

2407
01:57:33,561 --> 01:57:34,394
three choices.
George always branded himself as the 

2408
01:57:36,711 --> 01:57:37,544
technique and strategy guy.
Tyron Woodley struggling with that now 

2409
01:57:39,861 --> 01:57:41,210
himself,
he's doing the same thing.

2410
01:57:41,740 --> 01:57:42,573
Um,
Kale Sona and is the quintessential 

2411
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:44,870
drama fighter.

2412
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:48,680
He didn't really have an exciting 
fighting style and he was never really a

2413
01:57:48,681 --> 01:57:51,320
technique and strategy guy.
So he went with drama.

2414
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:54,050
Some of he'd done vocally,
um,

2415
01:57:54,550 --> 01:57:56,300
you know,
get like a violence based.

2416
01:57:56,301 --> 01:57:58,550
Find someone who's a mop.
How jaros that's his appeal.

2417
01:57:58,600 --> 01:58:00,140
You know the Johnson,
yeah.

2418
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:01,820
Rumble Johnson.
It's a violence.

2419
01:58:01,821 --> 01:58:03,400
Okay.
He's not into drama,

2420
01:58:03,401 --> 01:58:05,350
is not going to talk anything.
He's not gonna.

2421
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:06,903
He's not,
no one is stuck as strategy and t neat 

2422
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:09,164
guy,
he's going to come out and do the same 

2423
01:58:09,501 --> 01:58:12,140
thing every fight and it's going to be a
violent finish.

2424
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,570
Um,
so every fighter has to,

2425
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,610
as it were,
identify what's his ear,

2426
01:58:16,630 --> 01:58:17,463
what's he gonna do,
what's going to be his appeal and work 

2427
01:58:18,831 --> 01:58:20,780
within that.
And um,

2428
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:23,450
you know,
tyron is learning.

2429
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:25,940
It's not an easy thing to do.
You get criticism from certain,

2430
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:27,980
uh,
as we said,

2431
01:58:27,981 --> 01:58:29,270
the other two elements of the,
of,

2432
01:58:29,271 --> 01:58:30,860
of the mixed martial arts audience,

2433
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:35,150
that seems like the big fight.
It's certainly the big fight for Tyron,

2434
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:37,550
but it seems like the big five for 
Georgia as well.

2435
01:58:37,570 --> 01:58:37,860
Yeah.

2436
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:40,260
It might only,
um,

2437
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:41,830
reservation.
Uh,

2438
01:58:41,850 --> 01:58:42,050
when

2439
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:42,611
you,
when you say,

2440
01:58:42,611 --> 01:58:45,250
is this the big fight,
is it essentially,

2441
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,380
it's the same fight that George did for 
a decade.

2442
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:51,550
It's George against another very,
very tough welterweight.

2443
01:58:51,950 --> 01:58:55,360
What you did for 10 years was life.
Yeah.

2444
01:58:55,361 --> 01:59:00,361
But tyron is so,
he's especially dangerous.

2445
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:04,420
I mean,
he's a more,

2446
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:06,250
I think he's more dangerous than 
Hendricks.

2447
01:59:06,251 --> 01:59:07,990
I think he's more dangerous than those 
guys.

2448
01:59:07,991 --> 01:59:11,680
I think his ability to put you away with
one shot is,

2449
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:12,783
but you could say top of the food chain 
tricks was putting people away with one 

2450
01:59:14,531 --> 01:59:16,240
shelf and one years.
Yeah,

2451
01:59:16,241 --> 01:59:17,074
he was Hendrix's fascinating case.
And we should probably talk about that 

2452
01:59:20,981 --> 01:59:23,430
once the camera stops.
Um,

2453
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:26,831
he's a,
he's a,

2454
01:59:26,831 --> 01:59:31,831
he was a fascinating case and I can 
understand why he was so successful,

2455
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:37,030
but you know,
there's a lot to maintaining that.

2456
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,073
There's a lot too is one thing to get to
a position where you are a world class 

2457
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:43,174
fighter.

2458
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:44,900
It's like how long can you keep that up 
to her?

2459
01:59:44,901 --> 01:59:45,734
And one of the most impressive aspects 
of George's career was the fact that 

2460
01:59:47,951 --> 01:59:49,780
George was able to keep that up for so 
long.

2461
01:59:50,110 --> 01:59:51,800
People don't understand this.
They say,

2462
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:52,643
um,
it's incredibly tough to become a UFC 

2463
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:56,530
champion,
but however tough net is,

2464
01:59:56,590 --> 02:00:00,160
it's 10 times tougher to stay there.
Um,

2465
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:03,310
and on so many different levels too.
It's not just a physical thing.

2466
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:04,413
The moment you become champion,
you become the most studied fighter in 

2467
02:00:06,131 --> 02:00:07,180
the world.
Yeah.

2468
02:00:07,270 --> 02:00:08,103
Everyone knows every little weakness.
They see every little strength and they 

2469
02:00:10,361 --> 02:00:12,100
can negate it.
And um,

2470
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:14,730
psychologically it's tough to,
you know,

2471
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:19,770
every time the other guy fights,
it's the biggest fight of his life where

2472
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:22,473
he's,
every time you find it was just another 

2473
02:00:23,531 --> 02:00:26,050
fun.
Is He a 10th title defense?

2474
02:00:26,110 --> 02:00:29,200
Fios is another flight.
The other guy across the ring,

2475
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:31,330
this is the biggest moment of his life.

2476
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:33,650
He's coming at you with everything.
He's gone.

2477
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:34,833
This is his moment of glory.
This is literally gonna change his life 

2478
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:38,073
and keep them.
So Ufc champion feel is his the next 

2479
02:00:39,461 --> 02:00:40,294
fight.
That's the question is like is it 

2480
02:00:42,341 --> 02:00:43,174
possible for a champion to maintain a 
challenges intensity through a 10 title 

2481
02:00:47,351 --> 02:00:52,150
fight defect or do you just have to 
accept the fact that you're dealing with

2482
02:00:52,151 --> 02:00:52,984
a completely different mind space?
I think ultimately you have to drop the 

2483
02:00:55,691 --> 02:00:59,080
whole pretense that it's about intensity
because no,

2484
02:00:59,140 --> 02:00:59,973
I don't believe anyone can hold the same
amount of intensity of a teen years of 

2485
02:01:02,501 --> 02:01:07,030
preparation.
You have to start thinking in terms of,

2486
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:09,520
I'm going to defend my title with 
technique and strategy,

2487
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:14,740
because if you go with intensity,
you can only hold intensity so long it's

2488
02:01:14,741 --> 02:01:17,230
going to diminish and time as you get 
paid more,

2489
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:19,120
as you get tired,
as you get injured,

2490
02:01:19,121 --> 02:01:21,760
as years go by,
the intensity drops.

2491
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:27,430
Now when you analyze various fighters of
today,

2492
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:30,370
who stands out to you?
Who they lot.

2493
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,500
There's some very,
very impressive people.

2494
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:36,580
A guy who impresses me enormously is 
Demetrius Johnson.

2495
02:01:36,610 --> 02:01:39,400
Yeah.
I extremely impressed by this.

2496
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:40,040
I think he's the

2497
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,640
greatest of all time.
Um,

2498
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,480
oh,
it's hard to,

2499
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:47,060
graceful time is such a tough thing to 
say.

2500
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,130
It's um,
uh,

2501
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,610
with Demetrius that the open question is
always going to be what was the level of

2502
02:01:52,611 --> 02:01:53,610
competition.
Right?

2503
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:56,990
But that's not his fault.
He can only fight the guys that give you

2504
02:01:57,050 --> 02:01:59,450
what's like Roy Jones Jr when Roy was in
his prime.

2505
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:00,860
Yeah.
Same sort of situation.

2506
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:01,694
Yeah.
He was so much better than everybody 

2507
02:02:02,771 --> 02:02:04,970
else.
It's like how good were these guys?

2508
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:08,180
I mean they were worldclass guys,
but against him,

2509
02:02:08,181 --> 02:02:10,340
they just looked like they didn't belong
in there.

2510
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:11,473
What you typically find is that when you
come to a cs who's the greatest of all 

2511
02:02:15,141 --> 02:02:15,974
time,
it's always going to come down to 

2512
02:02:16,731 --> 02:02:19,010
criteria.
And um,

2513
02:02:19,250 --> 02:02:23,060
each guy,
his his strong point,

2514
02:02:23,061 --> 02:02:24,830
his claim to fame,
as far as,

2515
02:02:24,831 --> 02:02:26,270
you know,
I was the bass guy of all time.

2516
02:02:26,550 --> 02:02:29,000
Um,
let's stick with just UFC champions.

2517
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:29,953
Otherwise we could have a discussion 
where we too great if we go into pride 

2518
02:02:32,781 --> 02:02:34,290
and you know,
sure he's getting,

2519
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:36,650
it's going to get out of control.
Um,

2520
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:41,360
but Demetrius Johnson's,
uh,

2521
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:42,890
his,
his claim to fame is,

2522
02:02:42,970 --> 02:02:46,820
is the completeness with which he's 
winning fights.

2523
02:02:46,970 --> 02:02:50,240
He's using everything beautifully.
He's knocking,

2524
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:51,380
you know,
he's hitting people.

2525
02:02:51,381 --> 02:02:52,610
He's,
he's clenching people.

2526
02:02:52,611 --> 02:02:54,020
He's,
he's hitting clinched knockouts.

2527
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:55,590
You know,
you don't see those often in the USC.

2528
02:02:56,030 --> 02:02:58,160
Um,
he's incredibly good on the ground.

2529
02:02:58,161 --> 02:03:01,400
A few times he gets in trouble.
He seems to navigate his way out without

2530
02:03:01,401 --> 02:03:02,650
a problem.
Um,

2531
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:05,660
this a completeness in his skillset,
which is incredibly impressive.

2532
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:06,733
Okay?
He's integrating wrestling and striking 

2533
02:03:08,091 --> 02:03:10,250
and ways that just deeply,
deeply impressive.

2534
02:03:10,810 --> 02:03:11,643
Um,
you'll get someone like Jose Aldo who's 

2535
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:16,940
right up there in terms of,
you know,

2536
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:18,590
as he wanted the grace of all time.

2537
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:20,960
Um,
a sad thing about USC is that,

2538
02:03:21,110 --> 02:03:23,210
uh,
UFC fans I should say is that,

2539
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:25,160
um,
people have very short memories.

2540
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:28,070
You a guy loses a couple of fights and 
suddenly he sucks.

2541
02:03:28,071 --> 02:03:28,581
And it's like,
dude,

2542
02:03:28,581 --> 02:03:31,250
Jose Aldo was a killer and you kill it 
for 10 years.

2543
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:33,650
Um,
and uh,

2544
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:34,910
obviously very,
very skilled.

2545
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,190
He had that and um,
and he fought,

2546
02:03:37,540 --> 02:03:39,020
you know,
many tough opponents.

2547
02:03:39,110 --> 02:03:42,350
And uh,
do you feel like when you see a guy,

2548
02:03:42,351 --> 02:03:44,300
like,
although you were just seeing the miles,

2549
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:47,150
the miles pile up,
or do you think that Max Holloway,

2550
02:03:47,180 --> 02:03:48,880
he's not that old,
it's nothing,

2551
02:03:48,881 --> 02:03:50,000
all of that.
All 32.

2552
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:50,863
Yeah.
So I'm reluctant to say it's the miles 

2553
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:56,120
and also wholesale to it didn't really 
take a lot of damage and it's crazy.

2554
02:03:56,121 --> 02:03:58,520
And he's,
he's not like a guy that got knocked out

2555
02:03:58,521 --> 02:04:00,260
five times and you know,
it came back.

2556
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:03,110
So in terms of like the damage he took 
in his age,

2557
02:04:03,111 --> 02:04:05,630
I don't think it's a question of miles 
and his,

2558
02:04:05,690 --> 02:04:08,800
do you think as a team it's a question 
of the game just passing them by,

2559
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:10,940
um,
new levels of the game?

2560
02:04:11,450 --> 02:04:13,700
I that's,
that's a great question.

2561
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:15,930
Well,
I feel like Max Holloway's style,

2562
02:04:16,130 --> 02:04:17,890
it was almost like the perfect.
Yeah.

2563
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:21,200
Yeah.
A lot of it comes out to styles and um,

2564
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:22,790
and you're right,
uh,

2565
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:23,713
Holloway's awkward distancing and things
like very good distance but also 

2566
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:30,950
phenomenal endurance,
unbelievable mental toughness,

2567
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:31,873
extreme confidence in himself.
And he has the ability to break guys 

2568
02:04:35,211 --> 02:04:38,340
just puts a piece on them.
Very Nick Diaz like in that regard.

2569
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:40,260
Yeah.
It just puts that pace on him.

2570
02:04:40,261 --> 02:04:43,680
And you saw it with Aldo.
You see all those start to wilt cause it

2571
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:45,520
almost thought as strongly in both 
cases,

2572
02:04:45,610 --> 02:04:47,310
yes.
It starts very strong.

2573
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:48,173
Well that's his thing though.
He's so explosive and he sprints 

2574
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:53,130
essentially.
But you really can't do that.

2575
02:04:53,131 --> 02:04:53,964
I mean,
his style is highlighted by incredibly 

2576
02:04:58,381 --> 02:05:02,580
explosive,
fast movement and Max is not.

2577
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:06,990
Maxxis is about avoiding and then 
accumulation of bombs,

2578
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:11,000
a of techniques keep it on you keep and 
also his well-roundedness,

2579
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:15,060
his ability to submit you ability to 
absorb shots,

2580
02:05:15,450 --> 02:05:18,600
maintain composure when being fired upon
all those things.

2581
02:05:18,601 --> 02:05:21,780
Incredible strengths of his but 
particularly,

2582
02:05:21,810 --> 02:05:23,870
uh,
matched up against Aldo.

2583
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:25,580
His strengths really shine.

2584
02:05:25,640 --> 02:05:26,720
Yes.
Yeah.

2585
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:28,170
But that's a,
Eh,

2586
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:31,470
a whole mark of that if you're going to 
call someone of the greatest of all time

2587
02:05:31,471 --> 02:05:32,304
is they have to be able to take on a 
wide array of opponents and still be 

2588
02:05:35,571 --> 02:05:36,650
successful.
Yeah.

2589
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:37,583
Which is why Demetrius gets my vote.
I just feel like when you look at 

2590
02:05:41,641 --> 02:05:43,440
Benevidez,
when you look at,

2591
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:47,820
uh,
many different people that he fought,

2592
02:05:47,970 --> 02:05:51,450
showed him a bunch of different looks,
bunch of different styles,

2593
02:05:51,870 --> 02:05:54,000
and he was able to overwhelm the mall.
Wilson,

2594
02:05:54,001 --> 02:05:54,520
Hey,

2595
02:05:54,520 --> 02:05:57,640
what's your assessment of his fight 
against Dominick Cruz?

2596
02:05:57,641 --> 02:05:58,474
Apple Weight Division?

2597
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:02,060
See,
I look at that as a learning experience.

2598
02:06:02,570 --> 02:06:04,490
A different era,
a different guy.

2599
02:06:04,491 --> 02:06:07,880
He had a full time job back then.
It wasn't the same fighter happens if he

2600
02:06:07,881 --> 02:06:11,180
finds dominick Cruz is second time of 
fascinated by that.

2601
02:06:11,210 --> 02:06:13,100
I want to see him fight Tj dillashaw 
yeah,

2602
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:16,730
I think that's the big fight because Tj 
is willing to go down to 125.

2603
02:06:16,850 --> 02:06:19,340
So instead of fighting dominick at one 
35,

2604
02:06:19,341 --> 02:06:20,174
Tj is like,
I can make one 25 and Tj feels like 

2605
02:06:22,551 --> 02:06:25,100
he'll be the guy to break the legacy.
He'll be far bigger,

2606
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:25,993
stronger.
It feels like he could match him speed 

2607
02:06:27,381 --> 02:06:29,690
for speed and he thinks he can make the 
weight comfortably.

2608
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:31,790
I'm really fascinated by that.
Fine.

2609
02:06:32,300 --> 02:06:37,300
Because also I think Tj is one of the 
few guys that's trained,

2610
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:38,733
uh,
by,

2611
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,640
I think Matt Hume is one of the great 
unsung heroes of MMA.

2612
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:44,600
I agree with it.
He's a master,

2613
02:06:44,601 --> 02:06:46,220
fascinating,
fascinating guy.

2614
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:48,320
Incredibly intelligent,
deep,

2615
02:06:48,321 --> 02:06:51,540
deep knowledge of the sport.
Both stand up and on the ground and,

2616
02:06:51,541 --> 02:06:53,270
and integrating those two things 
together.

2617
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:57,160
He's one of the few guys you can 
genuinely say his,

2618
02:06:57,670 --> 02:06:59,200
um,
uh,

2619
02:06:59,470 --> 02:07:00,303
expertise across all areas of mixed 
martial arts and played a pivotal role 

2620
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:09,430
in taking someone from being an unknown 
to a legitimate greg,

2621
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:11,240
we'll champion,
um,

2622
02:07:11,470 --> 02:07:13,390
all the time.
I see people who,

2623
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:17,440
people often don't make a distinction 
between recruiters and coaches.

2624
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:18,521
Okay.
This,

2625
02:07:18,521 --> 02:07:19,354
there's many fight camps out there that 
are very good at recruiting people that 

2626
02:07:22,061 --> 02:07:26,140
were already good and helping them to 
manage them,

2627
02:07:26,141 --> 02:07:27,340
et Cetera,
and make them slightly better.

2628
02:07:27,730 --> 02:07:30,820
The world's full of recruiters,
but there's not many coaches out there.

2629
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:36,270
Matt Hume took a kid who'd known,
had heard of and took him from obscurity

2630
02:07:36,580 --> 02:07:39,550
to arguably one of the best of all time.
Okay.

2631
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:41,800
Um,
and he,

2632
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:43,353
he did it in a way with that,
that kid went from being essentially a 

2633
02:07:45,611 --> 02:07:50,611
wrestler to a genuinely well-rounded 
mixed martial artist with a complete set

2634
02:07:51,131 --> 02:07:52,630
of skills.
Uh,

2635
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:54,220
that's an impressive accomplishment.

2636
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:55,740
Yeah.
Um,

2637
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:59,700
and it's also his,
the way he does it,

2638
02:08:00,030 --> 02:08:02,340
the way he fights,
how little damage she takes.

2639
02:08:02,370 --> 02:08:04,560
Yes.
It's his movement,

2640
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:05,470
his,
his,

2641
02:08:05,471 --> 02:08:06,810
uh,
ability to control,

2642
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:11,160
like a good example.
Dodson who fought John Dodson,

2643
02:08:11,161 --> 02:08:16,161
who's unbelievably explosive and fast 
and dangerous and just overwhelmed him.

2644
02:08:17,750 --> 02:08:18,583
If Demetrius Johnson didn't exist,
Dolson would've been a very good 

2645
02:08:21,081 --> 02:08:21,980
champion.
Oh yeah.

2646
02:08:21,981 --> 02:08:23,420
Highly regarded champion.
Yeah.

2647
02:08:23,730 --> 02:08:26,450
That people don't realize how good some 
of these opponents adion and they say,

2648
02:08:26,451 --> 02:08:27,200
oh,
well,

2649
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,610
I see the level of a ponant that 
goodwill Dalton's it

2650
02:08:30,150 --> 02:08:34,050
very good at Dodson was especially a few
years ago.

2651
02:08:34,130 --> 02:08:37,920
It's extremely dangerous.
He seems to be in a bit of a Rut down,

2652
02:08:37,921 --> 02:08:40,350
whether it's a psychological rod or a 
physical Rut.

2653
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,620
It not quite the same guy that he used 
to be,

2654
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:47,010
but you know,
it's hard when a guy best you,

2655
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:48,083
the way that mighty mouse best too,
because it seems like the level of 

2656
02:08:51,571 --> 02:08:54,810
talent is so far above where you're at,
that you,

2657
02:08:54,840 --> 02:08:56,640
it's like you're left with a dilemma.
Like,

2658
02:08:56,641 --> 02:08:58,440
how do I catch this guy,
Ken?

2659
02:08:58,490 --> 02:08:59,323
Is it even possible for me to catch him?
Because they had two fights and the 

2660
02:09:02,281 --> 02:09:04,860
second fight,
mighty mouse won handily.

2661
02:09:05,220 --> 02:09:06,960
He,
the first fight was closer.

2662
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:09,540
The first fight was more dangerous.
He got hit a few times,

2663
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:10,793
but in the second fight,
mighty mouse just showed leaps and 

2664
02:09:12,931 --> 02:09:16,170
bounds and it was just a route he just 
ran him over.

2665
02:09:16,980 --> 02:09:17,813
Um,
the other arguments are Anderson 

2666
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:21,780
Anderson in his prime is one of the,
uh,

2667
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:23,850
it's a great argument for the greatest 
of all time,

2668
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:25,633
you know,
uh,

2669
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:26,950
outside of the UFC,
it's fader.

2670
02:09:27,630 --> 02:09:30,900
I think those are really the only 
arguments for the greatest of all times.

2671
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:32,273
And George George's in there,
especially coming back and beating 

2672
02:09:34,561 --> 02:09:36,150
bisping,
that puts him,

2673
02:09:36,630 --> 02:09:38,160
you know,
right back into the mix.

2674
02:09:38,161 --> 02:09:41,010
And in terms of a argument of one of the
greatest of all time.

2675
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:43,120
Yeah,
I think it was an important step for him

2676
02:09:43,121 --> 02:09:43,954
because as I said,
there were three persistent criticisms 

2677
02:09:46,001 --> 02:09:48,350
and he answered all three in one night.
So,

2678
02:09:48,351 --> 02:09:49,810
um,
that definitely helps his case.

2679
02:09:50,010 --> 02:09:52,050
What's your thought on could be abnormal
to madoff?

2680
02:09:52,051 --> 02:09:53,090
Extremely

2681
02:09:53,090 --> 02:09:57,740
embraced.
His kid is a deeply,

2682
02:09:57,741 --> 02:09:59,870
deeply impressive.
I've um,

2683
02:10:00,050 --> 02:10:00,883
uh,
he's coming to the academy a couple of 

2684
02:10:02,421 --> 02:10:05,210
times before fights.
I've never actually seen him train.

2685
02:10:05,540 --> 02:10:06,373
Um,
he,

2686
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:07,423
uh,
after his fight in Madison Square 

2687
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:10,813
Garden,
he bought himself and a group of his 

2688
02:10:12,771 --> 02:10:13,604
friends,
his training partners came into the 

2689
02:10:14,361 --> 02:10:16,340
academy and trained in my Monday 
afternoon class.

2690
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:17,480
It could be,
didn't train.

2691
02:10:17,481 --> 02:10:19,790
He just sat on the bench cause he'd just
support on Saturday nights.

2692
02:10:19,791 --> 02:10:21,560
Of course he's not going to train,
but his,

2693
02:10:21,561 --> 02:10:22,580
um,
his,

2694
02:10:22,610 --> 02:10:23,443
uh,
his training partners came in and 

2695
02:10:24,951 --> 02:10:26,840
trained with a squad and that was a fun 
afternoon.

2696
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:27,990
They rolled with,
um,

2697
02:10:28,010 --> 02:10:31,160
I think mostly Nikki Ryan and um,
uh,

2698
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:33,800
it's hard for them of course,
because it's submission grappling.

2699
02:10:33,801 --> 02:10:36,160
That's not really what they do.
They do more the interface of,

2700
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:38,780
of um,
grappling to bind with striking.

2701
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:40,070
So they had a hard time of it.

2702
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:40,903
But,
uh,

2703
02:10:40,910 --> 02:10:42,590
he struck me as a very,
very nice person.

2704
02:10:42,680 --> 02:10:44,510
He shockingly big for his weight 
division,

2705
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:45,490
shockingly,
shockingly.

2706
02:10:45,690 --> 02:10:46,750
So,
um,

2707
02:10:47,270 --> 02:10:51,650
like all the people coming out of the 
Caucasus regions of Russia has wrestling

2708
02:10:51,651 --> 02:10:56,651
is extremely good and they have probably
the base wrestling program in the world.

2709
02:10:57,411 --> 02:10:59,690
That whole area stretching from,
uh,

2710
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:01,123
uh,
asitia through Dagestan's or Chechnya 

2711
02:11:03,411 --> 02:11:07,040
all the way down to Iran at that areas 
is the hotbed of wrestling in the world.

2712
02:11:07,550 --> 02:11:08,383
And it shows all find fighters.
They're all strong and wrestling and he 

2713
02:11:11,331 --> 02:11:13,100
named is add to that,
the various skills.

2714
02:11:13,101 --> 02:11:14,660
And you've got a tough,
tough group

2715
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:15,890
people.
Yeah,

2716
02:11:15,891 --> 02:11:16,724
I was extremely,
I bet I've been impressed with every 

2717
02:11:17,811 --> 02:11:19,460
single performance he's had in the 
octagon.

2718
02:11:19,461 --> 02:11:20,990
I mean,
he's a undefeated,

2719
02:11:20,991 --> 02:11:23,450
which is incredibly rare in and of 
itself,

2720
02:11:23,451 --> 02:11:25,310
but in the hundred and 55 pound 
division,

2721
02:11:25,311 --> 02:11:26,144
even more impressive.
But the way he mauled Barboza Jesus 

2722
02:11:30,710 --> 02:11:31,543
Christ and you can see the fight was 
essentially over halfway through round 

2723
02:11:33,621 --> 02:11:34,540
one.
Yes.

2724
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:37,040
Yeah.
You could see it in Barboza his face.

2725
02:11:37,041 --> 02:11:38,630
He was drained.
Yeah.

2726
02:11:38,631 --> 02:11:40,400
That was an incredibly impressive 
performance.

2727
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:42,830
Um,
I,

2728
02:11:42,831 --> 02:11:43,870
uh,
uh,

2729
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:44,743
obviously there's still,
you can't put them yet and the grace of 

2730
02:11:47,301 --> 02:11:49,310
all time category,
but he hasn't won a title,

2731
02:11:49,311 --> 02:11:50,144
hasn't even challenge for it yet.
But you definitely get the sense that 

2732
02:11:52,401 --> 02:11:54,290
if,
if he had had a title fight by now,

2733
02:11:54,291 --> 02:11:57,770
he probably would have been a champion 
by now hem versus Connor,

2734
02:11:58,430 --> 02:11:59,900
Jesus Christ.
That's what I want to say.

2735
02:11:59,901 --> 02:12:02,670
Him versus connor and Russia or him 
versus Tony,

2736
02:12:04,160 --> 02:12:04,993
Tony Ferguson.
And then would be a very interesting 

2737
02:12:06,231 --> 02:12:06,900
fight.

2738
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:07,733
Well,
what's interesting about those two 

2739
02:12:08,011 --> 02:12:08,844
fights as you have basically polar 
opposites can be to him and we get all 

2740
02:12:11,781 --> 02:12:14,540
of us a control based fighter whereas,
uh,

2741
02:12:14,570 --> 02:12:16,580
Tony Focus in is a scramble based fight 
them.

2742
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:18,293
And just that clash in styles is going 
to be fascinating with regards conor 

2743
02:12:22,831 --> 02:12:26,820
mcgregor and could be minimum get off.
The feeling one gets is that if they did

2744
02:12:26,821 --> 02:12:30,690
fight,
it would be a complete shutout in one of

2745
02:12:30,691 --> 02:12:31,524
two directions.
It's either like a man beating up a 

2746
02:12:34,891 --> 02:12:39,891
child on the ground or it's just a flush
knock out a guy unable to cover distance

2747
02:12:42,931 --> 02:12:46,800
properly and walking into a left hand 
and just being catastrophic k Ote.

2748
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:51,030
And you feel like there's potential for 
it to go in both directions.

2749
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:52,903
Uh,
and

2750
02:12:53,260 --> 02:12:55,000
that's a fight I don't think goes to the
distance.

2751
02:12:55,270 --> 02:12:55,900
It's,
uh,

2752
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:57,460
it's one way or the other.
Yeah,

2753
02:12:57,461 --> 02:12:58,930
I agree.
Um,

2754
02:12:58,931 --> 02:12:59,764
I feel like what connor presents,
it's interesting in terms of danger is 

2755
02:13:03,191 --> 02:13:07,040
speed and one shot knockout power with 
his hands and could be,

2756
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:09,320
has been heard coming in by Michael 
Johnson.

2757
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:10,183
It's really the only adversity ever 
suffered inside the occupant and he 

2758
02:13:12,251 --> 02:13:12,930
dealt with it.
Well,

2759
02:13:12,930 --> 02:13:14,510
yes,
that's a good sign for debate.

2760
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:17,200
It's a sliver of hope that every 
opponent clings to.

2761
02:13:17,530 --> 02:13:20,950
They watched that one moment where 
Michael Johnson clipped him and be like,

2762
02:13:20,951 --> 02:13:21,461
look,
look,

2763
02:13:21,461 --> 02:13:22,480
he's human.
Yeah.

2764
02:13:22,630 --> 02:13:26,020
It can be hurt.
It's like the terminator if it bleeds.

2765
02:13:26,021 --> 02:13:29,350
Okay.
I believe that this predator.

2766
02:13:29,530 --> 02:13:30,341
Oh yeah.
What'd I say?

2767
02:13:30,341 --> 02:13:31,174
Terminator?
Yeah,

2768
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:33,680
you just fucked up your reference.
Sorry,

2769
02:13:34,600 --> 02:13:36,030
I'm sweaty.
Ah,

2770
02:13:36,031 --> 02:13:37,200
yeah,
I did fuck it up.

2771
02:13:37,420 --> 02:13:38,253
Um,
but I think that connor has been 

2772
02:13:40,621 --> 02:13:44,100
overwhelmed on the ground though and 
he's been overwhelmed by Nadya's.

2773
02:13:44,270 --> 02:13:45,103
Yeah.
And he's been controlled in the ground 

2774
02:13:46,441 --> 02:13:47,274
by Chad.
One gets the feeling that whatever 

2775
02:13:48,721 --> 02:13:52,080
amount of controlled they were able to 
impose on them would be nothing compared

2776
02:13:52,081 --> 02:13:54,520
with what could be,
could impose more of a,

2777
02:13:54,620 --> 02:13:55,510
could be busy.
Um,

2778
02:13:56,010 --> 02:13:58,140
it's a much more dangerous form of 
control.

2779
02:13:58,141 --> 02:13:58,830
Could be.
Yes.

2780
02:13:58,830 --> 02:13:59,663
It could be,
has a program of hitting people on the 

2781
02:14:01,531 --> 02:14:02,364
ground,
which is substantially better than 

2782
02:14:04,681 --> 02:14:06,330
either of the two athletes you just 
mentioned.

2783
02:14:06,331 --> 02:14:07,800
Yes.
Um,

2784
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:11,490
and big differences when it could be,
gets you on the ground.

2785
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:13,650
You're not getting up.
No,

2786
02:14:14,010 --> 02:14:16,800
you're getting mauled and it's almost 
like a spider.

2787
02:14:17,070 --> 02:14:17,903
Like he's injecting venom into you and 
slowly but surely like we can in your 

2788
02:14:21,331 --> 02:14:22,890
body,
like you,

2789
02:14:22,891 --> 02:14:27,000
you see after the first round when 
Barboza gets up,

2790
02:14:27,330 --> 02:14:29,250
it's like okay.
You mean he's,

2791
02:14:29,251 --> 02:14:30,084
he's alive still.
But this is a different person now and 

2792
02:14:32,821 --> 02:14:33,654
going into the second round,
I mean the Barboza gave an admirable 

2793
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:37,010
count of himself.

2794
02:14:37,010 --> 02:14:38,580
I mean showed himself to be a true 
warrior.

2795
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:40,410
He did try a couple of spinning back 
kicks in.

2796
02:14:40,411 --> 02:14:42,060
Yeah.
Some of them were relatively close.

2797
02:14:42,220 --> 02:14:43,053
Barboza is kicking.
Heavy strategy though is very different 

2798
02:14:46,111 --> 02:14:48,900
than connors connors kicks or just the 
opposite.

2799
02:14:48,901 --> 02:14:52,620
His kicks are just probes.
He sort of poking at you,

2800
02:14:52,621 --> 02:14:53,454
poking at you and it putting things out 
in front of you and he's just tried to 

2801
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:00,420
just trying to drop that hard left hand 
on you.

2802
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:02,430
It's a fascinating guy.
It was fascinating.

2803
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:05,850
I always undervalued him.
When he first came in the UFC,

2804
02:15:05,851 --> 02:15:06,280
I said,
oh,

2805
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:07,113
it's high but typing.
But the more I started with we'll 

2806
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:10,770
wrestle.
He's saying he's very,

2807
02:15:10,771 --> 02:15:12,420
very skilled.
While he's also,

2808
02:15:12,421 --> 02:15:16,380
he mind fucks people.
He mind fucks people in a way that,

2809
02:15:16,530 --> 02:15:17,363
um,
but I don't think he's mind fucking 

2810
02:15:18,481 --> 02:15:19,980
could be anything that works on could 
be.

2811
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:22,380
I don't think that's going to happen.
I just think there's,

2812
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:24,990
we do dealing with a totally different 
kind of human being.

2813
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:28,200
Those people from Dagestan are just so 
hard.

2814
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:31,200
It's just a hard part of the world.
They're just,

2815
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:34,770
they're made of hardier stuff.
You know what I mean?

2816
02:15:34,771 --> 02:15:36,900
It's just like they have to deal with 
way more.

2817
02:15:36,930 --> 02:15:40,260
Not that people in Ireland are soft.
They're fucking hard people too.

2818
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:44,850
I just think that with,
I've always said the most important,

2819
02:15:44,851 --> 02:15:49,650
if you have a pyramid of technique,
when it comes to mixed martial arts,

2820
02:15:49,830 --> 02:15:50,663
the base of the pyramid,
the most important thing is the ability 

2821
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:57,120
to control the grappling,
the ability to take a guy down.

2822
02:15:57,121 --> 02:15:59,520
If you can take a guy down and control 
him,

2823
02:15:59,940 --> 02:16:00,773
you have a significant advantage.
You can choose where the fight takes 

2824
02:16:03,361 --> 02:16:06,060
place and if you are competent in the 
standup,

2825
02:16:06,061 --> 02:16:08,400
which could be was definitely competent 
in the standup.

2826
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:13,200
So you are adequate in the standup but 
overwhelming when it gets to the ground.

2827
02:16:13,650 --> 02:16:17,040
You can present problems with a guy 
standing up and which,

2828
02:16:17,041 --> 02:16:17,874
which case his problems.
The guy has to deal with the striking 

2829
02:16:20,581 --> 02:16:23,370
aspects which opened up the takedowns.
Um,

2830
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:26,160
I wholeheartedly agree with you,
but I'll go a little further.

2831
02:16:26,790 --> 02:16:29,650
Whenever someone asks me what are the,

2832
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,750
what are the programs?
Well,

2833
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:34,960
what do you look for when you see a guy 
dominating fights?

2834
02:16:34,961 --> 02:16:35,321
What,
what,

2835
02:16:35,321 --> 02:16:39,280
what makes someone go in the right 
directions with a training and,

2836
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:42,640
and the fighting itself.
I always say this three things.

2837
02:16:42,641 --> 02:16:45,160
If you show me a fighter who can,
one,

2838
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:51,310
dominate the setups to dominate the pace
of the fight.

2839
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:56,110
And three,
how can I phrase this?

2840
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:03,180
Dominate the simple direction of the 
fight.

2841
02:17:03,390 --> 02:17:05,190
Three things.
Dominate the setups,

2842
02:17:05,220 --> 02:17:07,440
dominate the pace,
dominate the direction.

2843
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:11,700
You show me a fighter who can do those 
three things and I'll show you a fighter

2844
02:17:11,701 --> 02:17:14,460
who can win 95% of the fights he gets 
into

2845
02:17:16,570 --> 02:17:18,510
dominate the setups,
dominate the pace,

2846
02:17:18,560 --> 02:17:21,700
dominantly direction.
Thinking about someone that could be,

2847
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:23,650
or anyone who comes from a,
a,

2848
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:24,593
a strong wrestling or judo,
Jujitsu with takedowns baseline is they 

2849
02:17:28,221 --> 02:17:29,054
always kind of at a dominated direction.
They determine whether it goes down to 

2850
02:17:32,711 --> 02:17:37,711
the ground over there where it say 
standing to be always dominates the pace

2851
02:17:37,811 --> 02:17:39,880
of the fight.
Once you're on the ground,

2852
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:40,833
you're on top.
The other guys is reacting to what 

2853
02:17:42,971 --> 02:17:44,470
you're doing,
trying to get back up to his feet,

2854
02:17:44,471 --> 02:17:45,304
et Cetera,
et cetera.

2855
02:17:45,790 --> 02:17:46,623
You're dominating pace.
If there's one weakness that could be 

2856
02:17:50,651 --> 02:17:53,410
pairs is,
is not as strong.

2857
02:17:53,411 --> 02:17:58,411
It dominating the setups to get to those
areas where he can dominate pace and uh,

2858
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:01,780
et Cetera,
et cetera.

2859
02:18:02,530 --> 02:18:03,363
If he's going to lose a fight,
it's going to be in their area and 

2860
02:18:05,861 --> 02:18:06,694
corner more than anything else.
As a guy who dominates the setups you 

2861
02:18:11,081 --> 02:18:12,820
set up before the kicks,
a probe,

2862
02:18:12,850 --> 02:18:13,683
they're not kicks.

2863
02:18:13,890 --> 02:18:15,120
It's not trying to hurt you with the 
kicks.

2864
02:18:15,130 --> 02:18:17,560
He's probing.
He hurts you with this.

2865
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:22,150
Okay.
So connor skill is,

2866
02:18:22,151 --> 02:18:25,300
he's a master of dominating setups,
especially in a standing position,

2867
02:18:26,230 --> 02:18:27,063
but to beavs mastery.
Out of those three critical areas for 

2868
02:18:30,371 --> 02:18:33,760
domination and all forms of fighting is 
he's a dominant,

2869
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:34,833
uh,
he's incredibly dominant in determining 

2870
02:18:36,940 --> 02:18:39,310
the direction of the fight and the pace 
of the fight.

2871
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:41,370
That's why he never gets tired and it's 
white.

2872
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:43,870
It's got a very high work rate,
but he never gets tired.

2873
02:18:44,070 --> 02:18:44,903
He never see him just completely 
shattered despite the [inaudible] 

2874
02:18:46,460 --> 02:18:46,820
working

2875
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:49,640
hard the whole time and the fight,
despite the fact that he's significantly

2876
02:18:49,641 --> 02:18:51,740
weakens themselves,
make 155 pounds,

2877
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:54,650
which apparently he's done far better 
now.

2878
02:18:54,890 --> 02:18:58,760
He had a real nutritionist heading into 
this camp and it was much easier for him

2879
02:18:58,761 --> 02:18:59,594
to cut the weight.
I'd be fascinated to see him fight at 

2880
02:19:00,831 --> 02:19:02,780
one 70 and,
well that's a plan.

2881
02:19:03,230 --> 02:19:04,063
Apparently that was a plan.
I'm woodley was joking around about it 

2882
02:19:05,631 --> 02:19:07,690
saying he,
he'll send them nutritionists.

2883
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:08,533
So Sal,
keep his psycho ass down at one 55 was 

2884
02:19:10,311 --> 02:19:11,710
his exact,
that's fine.

2885
02:19:12,900 --> 02:19:14,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

2886
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:18,450
With regards to your point before saying
this,

2887
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:19,633
this core combat skill,
the most important one that you as a 

2888
02:19:21,861 --> 02:19:23,570
commentator look for when you look at 
finance,

2889
02:19:23,571 --> 02:19:24,404
you know,
um,

2890
02:19:24,440 --> 02:19:26,830
can you determine,
uh,

2891
02:19:26,860 --> 02:19:28,430
you,
you put grappling

2892
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:30,260
skill,
is that number one same way.

2893
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:32,210
There'll be wrestling with every samba 
at the beach you get.

2894
02:19:32,211 --> 02:19:33,680
So what have you,
um,

2895
02:19:33,700 --> 02:19:34,880
I,
I would go through them and say,

2896
02:19:34,881 --> 02:19:36,500
yeah,
there's three things that I look for.

2897
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:38,900
Who dominates the setups,
who dominates the pace,

2898
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:39,853
who dominates the direction.
Now what are your thoughts about 

2899
02:19:42,471 --> 02:19:45,170
strength and conditioning for mixed 
martial arts fighters?

2900
02:19:45,440 --> 02:19:47,660
That's a,
that's a huge question.

2901
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:50,900
But the question is like,
what takes precedent?

2902
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:51,793
The skill training take precedent.
Like there's several schools of thought 

2903
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:55,333
and um,
one of them would be one of the more 

2904
02:19:57,531 --> 02:20:01,160
interesting ones is nick curse on and 
Marvin Marinovich that camp.

2905
02:20:01,190 --> 02:20:02,023
They believe that you already know how 
to fight and that what the camp really 

2906
02:20:04,791 --> 02:20:08,150
should be about is just radical strength
and conditioning to the point where,

2907
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:09,200
let's,
uh,

2908
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:11,900
let's,
that's a mixed question then.

2909
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:13,153
Are you talking about a fight camp or 
he's talking about fight training over 

2910
02:20:15,981 --> 02:20:17,130
the year?
It's very difficult.

2911
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:17,993
Let's,
let's talk about a fight camp and 

2912
02:20:18,771 --> 02:20:19,640
specific.
Okay.

2913
02:20:21,020 --> 02:20:23,390
Okay.
Average fight camp is around,

2914
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:24,920
uh,
uh,

2915
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:27,730
six to eight weeks and has the lungs,
you have a,

2916
02:20:27,750 --> 02:20:29,150
it's like a 10 to 12 weeks.
That's a,

2917
02:20:29,210 --> 02:20:30,770
that's a very,
very long fight camp.

2918
02:20:31,190 --> 02:20:32,023
Um,
how much physiological change can you 

2919
02:20:35,211 --> 02:20:37,040
affect in the body and six to eight 
weeks

2920
02:20:39,630 --> 02:20:42,840
she can,
you could tighten everything up.

2921
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:43,733
You can,
you can certainly increase your 

2922
02:20:44,881 --> 02:20:46,680
endurance,
your threshold,

2923
02:20:46,681 --> 02:20:47,514
your ability to work.
How much could you increase your vo two 

2924
02:20:49,381 --> 02:20:52,260
Max and six weeks is a good question.
A few percentage points,

2925
02:20:52,261 --> 02:20:53,094
I believe.
Uh,

2926
02:20:53,130 --> 02:20:54,960
I think considerably less than that.
Really?

2927
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:55,853
Yeah.

2928
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:58,593
Hmm.

2929
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:03,520
I don't know how much could you increase
your vertical jump in six weeks?

2930
02:21:03,640 --> 02:21:04,473
Not much.

2931
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:07,033
Not much at all.
I'm not a big believer in the idea that 

2932
02:21:09,921 --> 02:21:14,870
you're going to create big,
significant fight changing physiological

2933
02:21:14,871 --> 02:21:18,020
changes in six to eight weeks.
It's not really my experience.

2934
02:21:18,650 --> 02:21:19,483
Um,
but I can show someone a single 

2935
02:21:21,711 --> 02:21:25,820
technique which can have a direct impact
on a fight.

2936
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:29,320
I can show them that in five minutes.
Okay.

2937
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:30,473
Um,
I'm not gonna claim to be a medical 

2938
02:21:31,311 --> 02:21:32,144
expert who has a deep understanding of 
these things about my experience in 

2939
02:21:35,421 --> 02:21:40,010
coaching is that physiological changes 
take time and you're not going to get it

2940
02:21:40,011 --> 02:21:41,990
done in a fight camp.
Yes.

2941
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:45,020
You can make physiological changes over 
a year,

2942
02:21:45,021 --> 02:21:46,010
two years.
Absolutely.

2943
02:21:46,130 --> 02:21:48,110
George went up a weight division.
Okay.

2944
02:21:48,111 --> 02:21:49,850
But it took quite a bit of preparation 
to do.

2945
02:21:49,851 --> 02:21:50,684
So it didn't happen in six weeks.
What kind of strength training was he 

2946
02:21:53,211 --> 02:21:56,150
doing to do that?
I know he's very involved in gymnastics.

2947
02:21:56,950 --> 02:22:00,260
George George has primary physical 
training outside.

2948
02:22:00,261 --> 02:22:01,580
It has gymnastics.
He loves it.

2949
02:22:01,790 --> 02:22:03,410
Um,
uh,

2950
02:22:03,440 --> 02:22:05,990
he also for a time did Olympic 
weightlifting.

2951
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:07,610
Less so now than before.
But,

2952
02:22:07,810 --> 02:22:08,643
uh,
there was a time that was a big part of 

2953
02:22:09,891 --> 02:22:11,030
it.
Um,

2954
02:22:11,060 --> 02:22:16,060
recently he started taking on a training
in water with various fins,

2955
02:22:17,481 --> 02:22:18,081
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

2956
02:22:18,081 --> 02:22:20,510
to increase resistance.
And he's quite a fan of that.

2957
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:22,120
But the truth is,
George go through,

2958
02:22:22,190 --> 02:22:24,010
goes through cycles and,
uh,

2959
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:25,130
you know,
boredom is a factor.

2960
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:26,190
He get bored at a certain

2961
02:22:26,190 --> 02:22:29,250
kind of physical activity and you want 
to try something new.

2962
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:32,040
Right?
And so he's gone through various cycles.

2963
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:37,220
I can tell you this,
Georgia's strength has not significantly

2964
02:22:38,101 --> 02:22:42,960
changed despite the various changes in 
physiological training.

2965
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:44,153
Like when he did Olympic lifting,
he wasn't massively stronger than when 

2966
02:22:46,831 --> 02:22:51,150
he did regular weight lifting or when he
did swim training,

2967
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:53,250
I did.
I didn't feel like,

2968
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:54,900
okay.
One made him stronger than the other.

2969
02:22:55,190 --> 02:22:56,510
Okay.
Um,

2970
02:23:00,580 --> 02:23:02,920
there's so many interesting questions 
and the one you just asked it.

2971
02:23:03,160 --> 02:23:05,350
Okay.
Do I believe that strength is important?

2972
02:23:05,380 --> 02:23:07,290
Absolutely.
Okay.

2973
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:08,193
And anyone who says that strengths 
doesn't make a difference in a fight is 

2974
02:23:10,781 --> 02:23:11,614
just straight up ignoring the obvious 
facts is a reason why men don't find 

2975
02:23:15,401 --> 02:23:18,040
women because there's massive strength 
differences.

2976
02:23:18,310 --> 02:23:20,930
There's a reason why this weight 
categories because there's big strength.

2977
02:23:20,931 --> 02:23:22,180
There was been heavyweight and 
lightweight.

2978
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:23,770
Okay.
Um,

2979
02:23:24,310 --> 02:23:26,950
strength makes a difference.
The proof of that is simple,

2980
02:23:27,070 --> 02:23:29,350
easy to observe.
Why do people take anabolic steroids?

2981
02:23:30,280 --> 02:23:31,960
Because they know that strength makes a 
difference.

2982
02:23:32,020 --> 02:23:32,853
Okay.
And is there a reason why they are 

2983
02:23:33,191 --> 02:23:34,024
illegal?
Because they do change the outcome of 

2984
02:23:35,711 --> 02:23:37,570
fights.
So yeah,

2985
02:23:37,571 --> 02:23:38,404
strength is extremely important.
The question is how are you going to 

2986
02:23:40,421 --> 02:23:43,090
build it and then are you going to do it
in camp?

2987
02:23:43,870 --> 02:23:46,300
Is your fight camp can be based around 
strings?

2988
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:47,433
That's a risky strategy.
Can you ready to get that much stronger 

2989
02:23:49,361 --> 02:23:51,220
in six weeks?
Um,

2990
02:23:51,370 --> 02:23:52,203
I've always believed that the whole idea
of fight camp is to prepare an already 

2991
02:23:55,991 --> 02:23:59,740
well trained athlete to get around the 
problem of one individual.

2992
02:24:00,550 --> 02:24:01,383
It's programming one individual to solve
the complex problem that another 

2993
02:24:04,991 --> 02:24:05,824
individual presents.
It's kind of like preparation for an 

2994
02:24:07,871 --> 02:24:08,830
exam,
so to speak.

2995
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:12,820
And um,
for me,

2996
02:24:12,821 --> 02:24:13,780
the whole,
the whole thing,

2997
02:24:13,990 --> 02:24:16,600
every flight campus motivated by two 
very simple questions.

2998
02:24:16,810 --> 02:24:20,230
How are you going to win this fight and 
how you not going to lose this fight.

2999
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:21,833
The entire structure of the campus based
around that and almost all of it has to 

3000
02:24:25,301 --> 02:24:29,150
do with tactics and techniques rather 
than changes in the physical body.

3001
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:34,170
Now when George is in off camp,
when,

3002
02:24:34,171 --> 02:24:37,420
when we say out of camp is that when he 
would,

3003
02:24:37,690 --> 02:24:41,680
that's a period of skill acquisition,
trying to acquire new skills.

3004
02:24:43,030 --> 02:24:43,863
So that's when he would t I know he's 
notorious for taking trips to like to 

3005
02:24:46,361 --> 02:24:47,194
Brazil,

3006
02:24:48,050 --> 02:24:49,330
experimentation,
you know,

3007
02:24:49,331 --> 02:24:51,590
you bring in different perspectives at 
different person,

3008
02:24:51,740 --> 02:24:53,770
hey this is interesting,
this has potential,

3009
02:24:53,780 --> 02:24:56,630
this doesn't really have much.
But then you start changing things up.

3010
02:24:57,590 --> 02:24:58,423
Now do you have that same approach with 
all the fighters that you've worked 

3011
02:25:01,731 --> 02:25:03,470
with?
It depends on the context.

3012
02:25:03,471 --> 02:25:04,304
How they mixed martial artists.
Did they train with me full time part 

3013
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:08,090
timers?
It would depend on the context.

3014
02:25:08,360 --> 02:25:10,150
I can answer with regards to the school.
Yeah.

3015
02:25:10,160 --> 02:25:10,851
Well I mean I'm,
what I'm,

3016
02:25:10,851 --> 02:25:14,540
what I was going to bring up is Weidman 
Weidman's approach.

3017
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:15,500
Um,
uh,

3018
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:16,333
you know,
coming from that elite wrestling 

3019
02:25:17,451 --> 02:25:19,640
background.
And then developing a lot of,

3020
02:25:19,641 --> 02:25:20,630
uh,
significant,

3021
02:25:20,970 --> 02:25:22,370
uh,
mixed martial arts skills.

3022
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:24,130
He,
uh,

3023
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,030
is in,
uh,

3024
02:25:25,031 --> 02:25:26,840
an unusual situation right now.
Right?

3025
02:25:27,190 --> 02:25:28,023
Where,
where does he stand in terms of like 

3026
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:31,420
future opponents?
Like where's he at right now?

3027
02:25:32,170 --> 02:25:33,640
That's,
uh,

3028
02:25:33,710 --> 02:25:36,820
that's a tough question to us to answer.
Um,

3029
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:38,073
uh,
Chris I think had probably one of the 

3030
02:25:40,571 --> 02:25:44,950
most meteoric rises into will change 
chip level.

3031
02:25:44,951 --> 02:25:49,951
He literally beat twice in a row.
The guy that at that time was considered

3032
02:25:49,961 --> 02:25:51,790
by most people to be the greatest of all
time.

3033
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:53,253
His run up to that was incredible.
I'm sure you've commentated many of 

3034
02:25:56,801 --> 02:25:59,410
those funds until this kid who an 
animal,

3035
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:00,273
that the timeframe with which she went 
from obscurity to world championship 

3036
02:26:03,850 --> 02:26:06,220
level is incredibly,
should undefeated,

3037
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:09,910
is insane what he was doing.
Um,

3038
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:12,610
so there was this incredible meteoric 
rise.

3039
02:26:12,611 --> 02:26:13,444
And then there was a,
a short period after that where he 

3040
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:16,473
appeared to be crushing great former 
champions and the outer machito Vito 

3041
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:20,080
Belfort.

3042
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,960
It wasn't just beating them,
he says smashing it.

3043
02:26:21,961 --> 02:26:23,530
And that makes it an incredibly 
impressive.

3044
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:25,630
Um,
and,

3045
02:26:25,631 --> 02:26:26,464
uh,
and then I think people were shocked by 

3046
02:26:28,690 --> 02:26:29,523
what appeared to be an unbeaten record.
And then suddenly three losses in a row 

3047
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:36,880
and catastrophic iasis that we're 
getting smashed by Luke rockhold getting

3048
02:26:36,881 --> 02:26:37,714
kod by a flying knee from Yoel Merrill 
and getting dominated by gay guard 

3049
02:26:41,401 --> 02:26:43,240
saucy.
And then all the controversy that it led

3050
02:26:43,241 --> 02:26:44,830
to that stoppage.
So it was,

3051
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:49,920
it was three in a row that on a guy who 
never even experienced defeat.

3052
02:26:50,490 --> 02:26:51,323
And so you go from no defeats to three 
catastrophic defeats in a row that 

3053
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:56,590
that's,
that throws everything off.

3054
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:58,023
Um,
but then he rebounded with even gas 

3055
02:27:00,110 --> 02:27:03,530
finished one of the toughest guys in the
division and he's not an easy know.

3056
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:06,220
You saw what guested on went on to do 
with yes.

3057
02:27:06,580 --> 02:27:08,290
Bisbing bisbing and uh,
so yeah,

3058
02:27:08,370 --> 02:27:09,160
he's,
that was,

3059
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:10,740
that was a great one.
That was a nice come back.

3060
02:27:10,750 --> 02:27:12,160
And,
but the question is,

3061
02:27:12,161 --> 02:27:13,930
where does it go from here?
Um,

3062
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:16,030
uh,
and I don't have an answer for you.

3063
02:27:16,031 --> 02:27:18,320
I'm so sorry.
How often do you work with them on,

3064
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:19,450
not often,
Chris.

3065
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:22,000
Um,
Chris came to me as a student.

3066
02:27:22,030 --> 02:27:23,950
He was a student of met Sarah,
who's,

3067
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:27,300
um,
one of my great friends and a,

3068
02:27:27,310 --> 02:27:29,920
a training partners from the Henzel 
Gracie Academy.

3069
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:34,540
And Matt was having some medical issues 
and he said,

3070
02:27:34,541 --> 02:27:35,374
John,
you know,

3071
02:27:35,470 --> 02:27:38,440
can you take over this student of mine,
Chris Weidman,

3072
02:27:38,441 --> 02:27:41,110
this guy is incredibly talented.
I'd heard of Chris because you know,

3073
02:27:41,111 --> 02:27:42,440
we're linked schools,
uh,

3074
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:45,130
fairly close by and people were telling 
me about this amazing wrestlers,

3075
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:47,650
you know,
uh,

3076
02:27:47,710 --> 02:27:50,530
incredibly talented picks techniques up 
and you know,

3077
02:27:50,531 --> 02:27:51,364
I always take these things with a grain 
of salt because people exaggerate and 

3078
02:27:53,171 --> 02:27:54,004
stuff like,
so Chris started coming in and it was 

3079
02:27:56,111 --> 02:27:56,920
all true.

3080
02:27:56,920 --> 02:27:57,753
This kid,
you can show him a teeny on Monday and 

3081
02:27:58,991 --> 02:28:00,490
by Tuesday is doing a better than you 
are.

3082
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:04,600
And uh,
he has a gift for physical movement that

3083
02:28:04,930 --> 02:28:07,480
you don't see very often and guys that 
big,

3084
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:11,230
he's big,
agile,

3085
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:12,423
highly intelligent and uh,
and had at that time a level of self 

3086
02:28:20,201 --> 02:28:21,034
confidence that was deeply impressive.
I would show Chris a guillotine 

3087
02:28:25,461 --> 02:28:26,294
variation and then five minutes later he
would be using it in the gym and then a 

3088
02:28:30,690 --> 02:28:33,560
month later to be using it in an MMA 
fight.

3089
02:28:34,030 --> 02:28:39,030
I guess he,
he literally would see opportunities and

3090
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:44,110
immediately act upon them.
What I worry about with Chris is that in

3091
02:28:44,391 --> 02:28:49,391
those three losses,
W I'm not saying this has happened,

3092
02:28:49,581 --> 02:28:54,581
but what I worry will happen is it 
fighters who are typically very dominant

3093
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:59,770
and what confidence fighters when they 
experienced a feet lose confidence and a

3094
02:29:00,261 --> 02:29:01,094
big pot of croesus success was that 
ability to see opportunity and have the 

3095
02:29:04,191 --> 02:29:05,930
confidence to immediately act upon it.

3096
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:09,920
Um,
so my concern if I,

3097
02:29:09,950 --> 02:29:11,570
uh,
if I,

3098
02:29:11,571 --> 02:29:12,404
if I look at Chris's,
will that still be there when he still 

3099
02:29:14,121 --> 02:29:17,210
had the same conference,
which was such a big part of his rise to

3100
02:29:17,211 --> 02:29:18,044
the top,
will it be drastically altered by three 

3101
02:29:20,061 --> 02:29:21,260
losses?
And I'm,

3102
02:29:21,380 --> 02:29:22,213
I'm very pleased to say that it didn't 
appear to be so in the fight with 

3103
02:29:25,281 --> 02:29:25,820
guests,
Willem,

3104
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:26,690
he,
he,

3105
02:29:26,691 --> 02:29:27,524
uh,
he actually took a heavy hit at the end 

3106
02:29:28,521 --> 02:29:30,860
of the first round in that fight and 
came back at eat.

3107
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:32,900
It looked like he had,
he'd gone through those,

3108
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:33,793
those,
um,

3109
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:34,783
those three losses and come back,
come back strong and everything was 

3110
02:29:36,861 --> 02:29:38,720
fine.
So I'm pretty confident.

3111
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:40,310
Uh,
Chris,

3112
02:29:40,311 --> 02:29:42,320
we'll go on to great success again at 
one,

3113
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:43,593
knowing how good Chris is on the ground.
How shocked were you about the Luke 

3114
02:29:47,921 --> 02:29:48,754
rockhold fight?

3115
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:50,940
Uh,
it was a hard one for me to watch.

3116
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,260
Um,
uh,

3117
02:29:52,500 --> 02:29:56,850
Chris stopped working with me after this
second Anderson Silva fight.

3118
02:29:56,910 --> 02:29:59,190
We did most of that came together and 
then,

3119
02:29:59,230 --> 02:30:00,600
uh,
he stopped working,

3120
02:30:00,750 --> 02:30:01,680
um,
uh,

3121
02:30:01,860 --> 02:30:03,600
with me move further out onto long 
island.

3122
02:30:03,601 --> 02:30:06,600
He opened up a gym with Ray Longo and,
uh,

3123
02:30:06,601 --> 02:30:09,320
went back to train with Matt Serra and,
uh,

3124
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:10,193
they,
those guys were incredible training 

3125
02:30:11,131 --> 02:30:12,840
camp.
They did a fine job getting them through

3126
02:30:12,841 --> 02:30:13,950
the machine to fights,
et Cetera,

3127
02:30:13,951 --> 02:30:15,040
et cetera.
Um,

3128
02:30:15,090 --> 02:30:17,030
I went,
um,

3129
02:30:17,540 --> 02:30:17,980
uh,
I,

3130
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:19,930
I was at that UFC,
uh,

3131
02:30:20,250 --> 02:30:21,083
it was in Las Vegas.
Conor mcgregor was the main event and 

3132
02:30:24,210 --> 02:30:25,370
Chris was the,
uh,

3133
02:30:25,410 --> 02:30:27,480
Co main event.
And,

3134
02:30:27,510 --> 02:30:29,250
um,
uh,

3135
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:32,070
the fight had interesting beginning.
Um,

3136
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:33,660
Chris was doing well with the take 
downs,

3137
02:30:33,661 --> 02:30:34,494
but,
um,

3138
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:35,773
uh,
luke rockhold was doing a great job of 

3139
02:30:37,501 --> 02:30:38,334
controlling Chris's head with like fake 
guillotines to prevent any kind of 

3140
02:30:41,551 --> 02:30:44,010
damage on the ground and doing a good 
job of standing back up to the feet.

3141
02:30:44,011 --> 02:30:45,750
So there was no really significant 
damage.

3142
02:30:46,310 --> 02:30:47,143
Um,
then they got into an interesting 

3143
02:30:47,821 --> 02:30:50,340
kickboxing battle where,
um,

3144
02:30:50,460 --> 02:30:51,293
uh,
it,

3145
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:52,313
it seems to go in one direction,
then switched directions and increased 

3146
02:30:54,421 --> 02:30:56,430
seem to be getting the better of it and 
things look good.

3147
02:30:56,730 --> 02:30:57,563
And then there was just one episode 
where everything just came unstuck in a 

3148
02:31:01,921 --> 02:31:04,980
second.
And I remember watching and it's like,

3149
02:31:04,981 --> 02:31:07,230
uh,
like watching a bad dream,

3150
02:31:07,231 --> 02:31:08,064
you know,
and um,

3151
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:09,421
uh,
yeah,

3152
02:31:09,421 --> 02:31:10,254
it was shocking.

3153
02:31:10,630 --> 02:31:11,171
Yeah.
Chris,

3154
02:31:11,171 --> 02:31:13,690
through an ill advised wheel keck.
Yeah.

3155
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:18,220
Which is slow and telegraph and rockhold
took him to the ground.

3156
02:31:18,221 --> 02:31:20,070
And what I was most shocked with

3157
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:22,170
was,
and I've seen it time and time again,

3158
02:31:22,171 --> 02:31:23,004
I saw it in the David Branch fight and 
sought in Leo Machida fight is rockhold 

3159
02:31:26,850 --> 02:31:29,020
top game.
It's be fucking terrifying.

3160
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:31,110
Pretty impressive,
very impressive.

3161
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:33,540
Unbelievable.
I attribute that,

3162
02:31:33,570 --> 02:31:35,850
not just his skill,
which I think is considerable,

3163
02:31:35,851 --> 02:31:40,380
but also to training on a regular basis 
with Daniel Carmia and Cain Velasquez is

3164
02:31:40,381 --> 02:31:42,480
just his wrestling,
his grappling,

3165
02:31:42,810 --> 02:31:46,260
it severely underrated.
Maybe not so now,

3166
02:31:46,410 --> 02:31:48,750
but his ability to control guys on the 
ground.

3167
02:31:48,751 --> 02:31:52,350
It's just terrifying.
Generate an amazing job,

3168
02:31:52,770 --> 02:31:54,540
I hope.
Got very strong submission skills.

3169
02:31:54,570 --> 02:31:55,403
Yes.
People I didn't think talk about those 

3170
02:31:58,141 --> 02:31:59,280
at all.
And uh,

3171
02:31:59,550 --> 02:32:02,550
he submitted a good people and he's hit 
summit at Biscayne without one arm.

3172
02:32:02,551 --> 02:32:03,384
Good team.
Suddenly some of his finishes like 

3173
02:32:04,861 --> 02:32:06,860
highlight reel finishes.
Beautiful.

3174
02:32:07,370 --> 02:32:07,981
Um,
you know,

3175
02:32:07,981 --> 02:32:11,100
he's got tremendous skills.
Um,

3176
02:32:11,101 --> 02:32:13,200
he's big for the division.
Uh,

3177
02:32:13,260 --> 02:32:15,330
he's uh,
you talk about a guy who,

3178
02:32:15,540 --> 02:32:16,373
uh,
Dominique's that pace and dominates the 

3179
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:21,750
direction he's,
no one can hold them down for any period

3180
02:32:21,751 --> 02:32:23,370
of time,
is great at getting makeup to his feet.

3181
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:24,900
He wrestles the fence very,
very well.

3182
02:32:24,901 --> 02:32:27,240
Like all the Aka guys,
they're good on the fence.

3183
02:32:27,690 --> 02:32:29,100
Um,
he's a,

3184
02:32:29,101 --> 02:32:30,510
he's a very,
very impressive fighter.

3185
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:32,670
I'm impressed with him and a lot of 
ways,

3186
02:32:32,671 --> 02:32:35,550
but his ability to control top level 
guys,

3187
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:37,013
I just thought,
my thought was when he got Chris down 

3188
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:40,261
like,
okay,

3189
02:32:40,261 --> 02:32:43,800
Chris is a worldclass grappler.
He's going to be able to get out of this

3190
02:32:43,801 --> 02:32:45,230
situation.
That'd be scrambles to,

3191
02:32:45,231 --> 02:32:46,890
it's a lot happening,
but there was none of that.

3192
02:32:47,160 --> 02:32:51,400
It was just total control and ground and
pound for a considerable period of time.

3193
02:32:51,410 --> 02:32:52,243
Yeah,
it was rough.

3194
02:32:52,290 --> 02:32:55,770
It was rough to watch because it was one
of those where you could easily make the

3195
02:32:55,771 --> 02:32:57,570
argument for it had been stopped sooner.
Yeah,

3196
02:32:57,571 --> 02:32:58,650
I think so too.
Yeah,

3197
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:00,360
it was a rough one.
Um,

3198
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:03,060
and now rockwell is going to face Yoel 
Romero,

3199
02:33:03,180 --> 02:33:05,580
which is very,
he's the freaking ball freaks.

3200
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:08,330
That's like that guy was made in a lab.
Yeah.

3201
02:33:08,440 --> 02:33:10,350
Isn't Yoel Romero with fighting dated 
Brunch?

3202
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:12,930
No.
Did this happen recently?

3203
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:14,180
Yes.
Uh,

3204
02:33:14,330 --> 02:33:16,260
I've been at Robert Whitaker,
got injured.

3205
02:33:17,010 --> 02:33:18,120
What happened?
The knee again,

3206
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:21,240
most likely if I had a gas,
I don't think they released it,

3207
02:33:21,570 --> 02:33:23,760
but there's been an injury.
Maybe it's a different entry,

3208
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:25,710
but um,
when did this happen?

3209
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:26,910
A couple days ago.
Wow.

3210
02:33:27,050 --> 02:33:30,030
I've just flown to California and using 
the Internet.

3211
02:33:30,031 --> 02:33:31,170
So yeah.
So rock.

3212
02:33:31,171 --> 02:33:34,140
Good for you.
It was only two days.

3213
02:33:34,150 --> 02:33:35,870
Joe should all say that.
Um,

3214
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:37,613
but a rockhold and you'll,
well now we're going to fight for the 

3215
02:33:39,781 --> 02:33:42,540
interim belt.
That's a huge development.

3216
02:33:42,630 --> 02:33:43,830
Yeah.
Big Development.

3217
02:33:44,130 --> 02:33:45,000
Wow.
Yeah.

3218
02:33:45,330 --> 02:33:46,580
Um,
that's uh,

3219
02:33:47,430 --> 02:33:49,590
I mean Yoel Romero.
That's um,

3220
02:33:49,970 --> 02:33:51,750
it's,
that's a different vibe.

3221
02:33:53,370 --> 02:33:54,203
Yoel Romero is probably the most 
uncontrollable man in the universe is a 

3222
02:33:58,981 --> 02:33:59,814
difficult,
difficult posting to control in any 

3223
02:34:01,321 --> 02:34:02,154
aspect of the fight.

3224
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:06,120
He's a fight is some parts of what he 
does make no sense.

3225
02:34:06,170 --> 02:34:07,003
Like he's one of the greatest grace 
lists of his generation and many people 

3226
02:34:09,451 --> 02:34:10,590
take them down.
Yeah.

3227
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:11,543
It gets taken down all the time,
but they kind of control and he just 

3228
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:15,870
springs back up.
He's not worried about being taken down.

3229
02:34:15,871 --> 02:34:17,380
I think that's part of it.
Yeah.

3230
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:21,010
Cause he comes so hard with the upper 
body leaves the lower body open and um,

3231
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:22,600
and you're right,
there's no consequence to it.

3232
02:34:22,601 --> 02:34:24,080
He can just get up whenever he feels 
like it.

3233
02:34:24,490 --> 02:34:25,930
Um,
he,

3234
02:34:26,510 --> 02:34:27,343
he,
he has a greater propensity to change 

3235
02:34:31,121 --> 02:34:34,780
direction at speed than anyone else who 
would have seen in my life.

3236
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:36,880
Yeah.
People always talk about speed.

3237
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:37,540
They're all,
you know,

3238
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:39,370
this guy's font.
So that guy's spas to me,

3239
02:34:39,371 --> 02:34:41,560
the only kind of,
there's two kinds of speed,

3240
02:34:41,810 --> 02:34:43,720
they don't impress me in fighting.

3241
02:34:44,050 --> 02:34:47,020
One is the speed of decision making.
Okay.

3242
02:34:47,021 --> 02:34:47,854
If you can make decisions,
good decisions faster than your 

3243
02:34:49,751 --> 02:34:51,010
opponent,
you gotta win a lot of fights.

3244
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:56,700
And the other is your ability not to go 
and straight lines at speed.

3245
02:34:57,100 --> 02:34:57,933
But to change direction.
Speed of directional change is the most 

3246
02:35:02,261 --> 02:35:03,094
important kind of physical speed.
And fighting I'll get is plenty of 

3247
02:35:06,131 --> 02:35:10,060
people that weren't really that fast,
but they can change direction quickly.

3248
02:35:10,300 --> 02:35:12,790
And that's the kind of speed that counts
and fighting.

3249
02:35:13,330 --> 02:35:14,163
So the two kinds of speed that you 
needed to be to be a fighter was speed 

3250
02:35:16,241 --> 02:35:20,530
of decision making.
And a speed of directional change.

3251
02:35:20,770 --> 02:35:24,130
And you see lots of fast people that 
there's a Hussein bolt is fast,

3252
02:35:24,310 --> 02:35:26,140
but he's not fast and directional 
change.

3253
02:35:26,141 --> 02:35:28,780
It's not his thing.
But I think that Yoel Romero is,

3254
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:30,003
there's this certain twitchiness to his 
movement where it's so hard to read 

3255
02:35:33,101 --> 02:35:33,934
where he's going,
where he's going to be in the next half 

3256
02:35:35,411 --> 02:35:35,800
second.

3257
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:38,990
That's,
it's just a handful to deal with that.

3258
02:35:38,991 --> 02:35:42,190
That is a very good assessment of what,
what's shocking about him,

3259
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:45,910
his ability to go from zero to 60 insist
freakish shin.

3260
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:48,260
This is him at 40.
Yeah.

3261
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:50,433
What was he like when he was 25?
He just doesn't look like a 40 year old 

3262
02:35:53,231 --> 02:35:55,680
man and just everything is wrong.
Yeah.

3263
02:35:55,720 --> 02:35:58,720
It doesn't look like a normal person.
Like if you look at his body,

3264
02:35:58,721 --> 02:35:59,554
his proportions,
everything looks like something from a 

3265
02:36:02,291 --> 02:36:03,320
movie.
Yeah,

3266
02:36:03,820 --> 02:36:04,770
yeah,
yeah.

3267
02:36:05,110 --> 02:36:07,270
And that flying knee that he hit Chris 
with was like,

3268
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:10,450
she,
she's Christ and now he could feel it.

3269
02:36:10,451 --> 02:36:11,440
And the audience,
it was,

3270
02:36:11,470 --> 02:36:12,340
uh,
it was,

3271
02:36:12,341 --> 02:36:13,174
uh,
it was terrible.

3272
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:16,450
It's just the,
the amount of force that he can generate

3273
02:36:16,451 --> 02:36:17,284
is just stunning.
But he's also a guy that's carrying 

3274
02:36:19,781 --> 02:36:20,614
around a tremendous amount of muscle and
I wonder what kind of pace he can keep 

3275
02:36:23,981 --> 02:36:24,700
up.

3276
02:36:24,700 --> 02:36:26,500
You know?
And we saw that in the whitaker fight,

3277
02:36:26,530 --> 02:36:29,470
you faded a bit and that fight,
one of losing that fight,

3278
02:36:29,471 --> 02:36:31,450
and we've seen it in several,
was fights.

3279
02:36:31,451 --> 02:36:32,284
The Tim Kennedy fight,
you faded in that fight and eventually 

3280
02:36:34,570 --> 02:36:38,920
came back to win.
But he's got so much to feed.

3281
02:36:39,130 --> 02:36:41,260
There's so much tissue,
you know?

3282
02:36:41,350 --> 02:36:42,190
Yeah,
yeah.

3283
02:36:42,250 --> 02:36:43,083
No,
he's a fascinating character and 

3284
02:36:43,561 --> 02:36:45,340
fascinating.
And again,

3285
02:36:45,370 --> 02:36:49,250
boy wouldn't you have loved to seen him 
in the UFC at 26 yeah,

3286
02:36:49,570 --> 02:36:51,700
I mean when he was just dominating 
everyone,

3287
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:52,573
the wrestling scene and he says he's as 
good as I get in Raceland metaled into 

3288
02:36:55,811 --> 02:36:58,810
every single world class competition he 
ever answered.

3289
02:36:59,110 --> 02:36:59,943
Not only that,
but the best wrestlers in his weight 

3290
02:37:03,101 --> 02:37:07,870
division of that time.
He beat all of them like crazy.

3291
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:11,170
It's as good as he did it.
The hard to imagine.

3292
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:12,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

3293
02:37:14,010 --> 02:37:16,010
All right John,
I think we've covered

3294
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:19,040
basically enough or it's a,
we're three hours in here,

3295
02:37:19,041 --> 02:37:19,940
man.
Oh my God,

3296
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:21,833
this is awesome.
This is longer than one of my instagram 

3297
02:37:23,481 --> 02:37:25,760
posts.
Your instagram posts are amazing,

3298
02:37:25,761 --> 02:37:27,530
by the way.
I'm a huge fan.

3299
02:37:27,640 --> 02:37:28,800
You're,
you're one of the few.

3300
02:37:29,350 --> 02:37:31,910
That's not true.
I have a lot of friends share them.

3301
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:34,400
They didn't send them to me in text 
messages.

3302
02:37:34,401 --> 02:37:35,234
Occasionally you are breakdowns of 
technique and strategy and what is 

3303
02:37:39,951 --> 02:37:41,630
actually happening.
I think they're critical.

3304
02:37:41,631 --> 02:37:44,240
I think your voice and what you're 
doing,

3305
02:37:44,241 --> 02:37:46,880
like with the squad and what you're 
doing for,

3306
02:37:46,910 --> 02:37:50,810
for Jujitsu as a whole and the way 
you're able to articulate that and break

3307
02:37:50,811 --> 02:37:51,520
these things down,
it's,

3308
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:52,700
it's,
it's really,

3309
02:37:52,730 --> 02:37:54,620
really critical.
I think it's awesome.

3310
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:56,070
Thank you.
Very [inaudible].

3311
02:37:56,230 --> 02:37:59,120
Say thank you and I'm really glad we 
finally got a chance to do this.

3312
02:37:59,510 --> 02:38:01,640
It's better than a meeting at Denny's.
Yes.

3313
02:38:01,990 --> 02:38:03,350
Denny's for meeting.
It was fun to,

3314
02:38:03,610 --> 02:38:05,360
um,
what is your twitter for people?

3315
02:38:05,361 --> 02:38:07,520
Is it just John,
Donna her on instagram rather?

3316
02:38:07,880 --> 02:38:09,710
You don't have a twitter?
I believe it's Danaher.

3317
02:38:09,711 --> 02:38:10,970
John Danaher.
John.

3318
02:38:10,971 --> 02:38:11,660
Yeah.
Okay.

3319
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:12,550
Beautiful.
Thank you brother.

3320
02:38:12,560 --> 02:38:13,393
Cute.

3321
02:38:23,580 --> 02:38:25,540
Okay.
