1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,480
Okay,

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,590
here we go.
In five,

3
00:00:02,591 --> 00:00:03,760
four,
three,

4
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,350
two,
one,

5
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,053
boom.

6
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,140
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joe Schilling and Daniel Straus.

7
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,183
Fucking house Joe Shillings.
Just fucking up my kick machine out 

8
00:00:14,511 --> 00:00:15,170
there,
man.

9
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,030
That thing ain't read and write.
I mean,

10
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:18,620
I hope not.
I really hurt my ego up.

11
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:20,210
You are lightened up.
Fuck her on fire.

12
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:22,610
That thing is not.
We got to get that recalibrate.

13
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,523
It tells in here complaining about a 
sciatic pain and this hip and still 

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,110
kicked me in like what is going on?
I hear most sweaty.

15
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,570
Forget about sciatic pain.
Daniel Straus.

16
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:34,550
You've gone through some fucking pain.
Dude,

17
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,610
you are defying science and doctors and 
David telling you it was over.

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,110
Tell everybody the whole story.
Put this,

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,360
bring this sucker up here at a story 
goes.

20
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,903
I was out one night,
buddy of mine was having trouble and 

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,670
needed somebody to go out.
Welcome.

22
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,070
So,
uh,

23
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,933
was around the city that night and um,
after taking him home we were leaving 

24
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:59,520
the highway.
Has it split off?

25
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,730
I was coming around was like yeah,
I was on a bike.

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,260
So.
And I had a passenger.

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,123
So what was called eight,
26 is the highway as the splits off to 

28
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,310
95.
I was going around eight,

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,720
26.
Now here's the tricky part.

30
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:16,410
I don't really remember what's going on 
from there.

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,603
So the men and the passenger,
remember we were hit from either the 

32
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,240
side or from the back.
Um,

33
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,400
but coming around the bend boom,
coming around,

34
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,920
got pushed into the wall.
I'll wake up under the,

35
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,170
a guard rail,
can't move,

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,573
you know,
nobody else is there and the car is 

37
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:35,154
gone.

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,300
There was not really a witness there 
until like later pulling up behind us.

39
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:42,930
So it fucked me up for awhile.
I mean fuck me up right now.

40
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:43,764
But,
you know,

41
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,590
uh,
getting back to just what it is,

42
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:48,070
the body's healing.
And then.

43
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,090
So what was the extent of your injuries?
All right.

44
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:51,924
So,
uh,

45
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,860
I had,
um,

46
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,730
in my c four,
five and six,

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,373
I had contusions on my spinal cord and 
half a mile on the left side of my 

48
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,323
spinal quarter was a pressure so bad 
that it shut down my whole nervous 

49
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,280
system,
like all my body.

50
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,773
So a mix up in my neck and then my 
middle of my back was just compressed a 

51
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:16,470
lot of the swelling and that's what,
uh,

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,330
caused a lot of the,
you know,

53
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,403
not being able to walk,
not being able to feel the nervous 

54
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,940
problems.
Never system that I have or the nervous,

55
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,260
uh,
issues that I had.

56
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,790
So what did they do to fix it?
I've been rehabbing a,

57
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,970
they wanted to do surgery right away,
but how many months ago was this?

58
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,100
This was in December.
This was September 17th.

59
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,100
So,
um,

60
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,540
they wanted to do or they wanted to do a
surgery immediately.

61
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,950
You know what I'm trying to tell them,
like,

62
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,784
no,
I'm,

63
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,230
I'm trying to fight again,
blah,

64
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:46,860
blah,
blah.

65
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,040
What kind of surgery?
Fusion.

66
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,060
That's what they wanted to.
They wanted to go in and take the,

67
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,923
I think the,
I want to say the three to the five or 

68
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,980
four to six or something,
fuse that altogether,

69
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,680
which obviously there's no rain that's.
And it's a big spot.

70
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:06,490
So a wasn't trying to have that looked 
up for.

71
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,130
We looked for,
you know,

72
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,093
a couple of rehab places and eventually 
got hooked up with a place called a 

73
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,280
neural fit,
three 60.

74
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,493
So I've been rehabbing there since the 
accident and I mean it's weird in 

75
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,360
Europe,
pembroke Pines,

76
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,980
Florida,
close to Miami,

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,300
a great crew.

78
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,880
But yeah,
they've been giving me back in the game.

79
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,803
I've been a,
I was doing that extensively every day 

80
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,390
for like two days a week,
two hour or couple of hours a day,

81
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,550
you know,
two to three times a day.

82
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:34,870
What kind of shit that they do for your 
neck?

83
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,400
Uh,
for more.

84
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,430
For me,
first we had to start with um,

85
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,730
you know,
just the um,

86
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,130
the fine motor stuff,
touching,

87
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,210
feeling,
you know,

88
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:48,820
I had problems with my sensitivities.
So like,

89
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:50,940
you wake up onto the guard rail,
you know,

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,833
you guys don't remember what happened 
when you wake up in the hospital where 

91
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,080
they're telling you for.
They got all of this stuff.

92
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,200
They were like,
oh,

93
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,420
to walk.
Could you feel,

94
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,940
could you like how were you when you 
woke up for me?

95
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,380
Um,
when I woke up,

96
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,840
boom.
Yeah.

97
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,840
So back to the store when I woke up,
when I woke up,

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,810
so I woke up and uh,
you know,

99
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,490
I had my helmet on but I couldn't move 
my legs.

100
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,153
My passenger had one over top.
She had her hands so she wasn't like 

101
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:23,260
extremely,
but she had went out to.

102
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:26,010
So I couldn't really feel nothing 
because nothing.

103
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,330
I was just telling him to get my helmet 
off and get my helmet off.

104
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,673
Finally had a truck,
had pulled up and seen that we were in 

105
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,130
an accident and they,
what they shouldn't do,

106
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,950
but pull me out and uh,
yeah,

107
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,900
because I was supposed to touch anybody,
get me out of there,

108
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,290
you know,
I was freaking out.

109
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,350
They pull me out from under it and uh,
you know,

110
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,290
going into the hospital,
that whole,

111
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,353
the scary part was,
was knowing nothing was broke but not 

112
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:58,060
being able to feel nothing.
Trying to wipe my face or trying to grab

113
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:01,450
something and you just couldn't move my 
head in my head.

114
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,100
I'm moving my leg,
I move my arm,

115
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,360
nothing's going on.

116
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,340
You know what I'm saying?
So you're thinking you're paralyzed.

117
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,580
I'm gone.
It's a wrap like Paul Williams.

118
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,690
Yeah.
I'm just like,

119
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,710
fuck.
So I get to the hospital finally.

120
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:15,461
Um,
you know,

121
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:18,790
they're trying to work on me and seeing 
the doctors.

122
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,780
He's telling me,
well,

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,310
you know,
because of my neck,

124
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:24,730
it's unlikely that I'll be walking 
anytime soon.

125
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,290
No,
a couple of days,

126
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,720
couple of weeks ago after that,
you know,

127
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,554
just banging.
And in the meantime I'm trying to 

128
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,420
explain to them I'm an athlete.
I know you see this.

129
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,240
I've been through this type of incident 
before,

130
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,650
you know,
I grew up wrestling.

131
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:40,210
I'm from Cincinnati,
grew up wrestling,

132
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:43,900
so I've had neck problems for fuck my 
whole life,

133
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,710
you know what I mean?
And uh,

134
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,100
so I'm trying to explain to him like,
you know,

135
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,380
chill out.
Just give me some time.

136
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:52,210
Let me,
let me work something out.

137
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,820
I don't want to do the surgery right 
now.

138
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,663
I really want to.
They want you to do it in the hospital 

139
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:56,780
right there.
Right.

140
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,350
Then there was no other,
you know,

141
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,190
there's no other choice.
You never gonna walk again.

142
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,670
Do you want to go back to them right now
and go,

143
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,660
hey motherfucker,
look,

144
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,180
look who's walking around know,
you know what I mean?

145
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,014
And it's been like that majority of 
times in my career where I've done 

146
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:09,410
something,
something's happening.

147
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,700
Oh,
you're not gonna be able to do this.

148
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,110
You got me fucked up.
Right.

149
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,060
He's hitting pads with me at the gym 
yesterday.

150
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,630
The guy sparring this happened in 
December.

151
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,320
That's insane.
It's just insane.

152
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,463
It just makes me sick that they always 
want to cut you immediately when it 

153
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:22,364
comes to any kind of bulging disc issue.
They want to get in there and it's 

154
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,990
hurtful to us because,
you know,

155
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,300
I understand they got a job to do,
but do your job.

156
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,350
Right.
You know what I mean?

157
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,740
Like they have one method,
one method of surgery.

158
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,690
So,
um,

159
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,740
but yeah,
like I said,

160
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:42,440
I was rehabbing that neural fit three,
six d,

161
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:46,220
which is a great physical therapy place 
down there in pembroke pines.

162
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,990
And uh,
you know,

163
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,100
I've been getting back with me,
strengthen my neck,

164
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,110
which is small exercises.
Like I said,

165
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:58,250
I started with fine motor stuff where I 
had to work on a lot of balance stuff,

166
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,590
you know,
um,

167
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,120
you ever fuck with that iron neck thing?
You ever used that thing yet?

168
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,830
No,
I have not used out here.

169
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm trying if you want to mess around 
with it and he's fantastic.

170
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Fantastic.
So you are six months out now.

171
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,560
Six months out.
When did you start walking again?

172
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,993
It took me like,
even now I'm still like trying to get 

173
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,270
the form right.
But uh,

174
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:26,400
it took me about three months because 
she was like read,

175
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,260
learned how we learned how to tie her 
shoe in my hand.

176
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,230
My Motor,
like my hand wasn't moving his right.

177
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,163
It wasn't working as good.
It's just everything slowed down for me 

178
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,040
because of my spinal cord.
So wow,

179
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,790
you know,
that is the most for me was the scariest

180
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,730
part because I was everything so unsure,
you know what I mean?

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,810
The most recent MRI.
When did you get,

182
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,280
have you gotten a gv one?
About a month and a half ago.

183
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,520
And whenever you look good,
it looks good.

184
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,750
All the swelling went down.
Um,

185
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,620
the left side is clear,
the only way I can explain it,

186
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:01,690
there's two,
there's two,

187
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,370
two months,
white lines and it gets blocked.

188
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,470
You know what I'm saying?
That's where the fluids coming down.

189
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,920
My left side of my,
on the fluid was being blocked.

190
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:14,150
So now I'm having a clear line of fluid 
going down my spinal cord.

191
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,390
Now it's just about healing,
which,

192
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,140
you know,
I've been working.

193
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,410
That's the part to get overcome the 
healing part,

194
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,340
the neurological part and the nerves and
all that part that goes with it.

195
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,174
It's the body that can only.
There's not too much that I can do to 

196
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,430
tell this other than,
you know,

197
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,290
eating right,
all the simple shit,

198
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:37,040
but it's the body that's telling.
But it's crazy that you're sparring.

199
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,110
Yeah,
I do a lot of things.

200
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:42,470
I shouldn't do your spine with friends,
so you know,

201
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,240
that everything's going to be cool.
I mean,

202
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,643
good trading partners.
I was down at Henry who's h kickboxing 

203
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,890
was training down there.
Um,

204
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,810
so you know,
I live in Fort Lauderdale,

205
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:55,560
so you,
that's,

206
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,390
you know,
working out with those guys,

207
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:58,224
you know,
no one's out there to hurt me or tried 

208
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:04,000
to get me hurt or injured.
Everyone's had a lot of respect and love

209
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,853
seeing me back.
So I've never been in a situation where 

210
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,640
I'm trying to go super hard.
Not yet,

211
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:09,474
but I love to.

212
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,650
You can get,
we can get it.

213
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,640
So when you hitting the bag or hitting 
pads,

214
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,810
you feel like you have full strength?

215
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,010
No,
no,

216
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,330
no.
And that's the thing that I'm,

217
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,953
that I'm excited about.
I'm a broken toward that is dying to be 

218
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:26,470
fixed,
you know what I mean?

219
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:28,690
Because I'm a brand new,
you know,

220
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:32,710
I can be fixed in any way.
Like I'm relearning everything.

221
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:33,401
I'm not,
you know,

222
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:36,010
it's not like I can't box,
it's not like I can't wrestle,

223
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,850
but it's now just relearning the,
you know,

224
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,300
the mechanics of making your brain knows
how to do it,

225
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,670
but your body's got to relearn it.
Exactly why?

226
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,090
And it's like the nerve,
the nerve stuffs is on the right side of

227
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:49,880
your body,
right?

228
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,713
It's like muscle memory coming back.
Even yesterday I was holding pads from 

229
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:53,644
like,
his job was a little weak and like his 

230
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,940
is a lifting of his foot or whatever the
thing we're trying to do,

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,840
but once as we are doing it,
once he felt the right way to do it,

232
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:03,220
then he could repeat it,
you know what I mean?

233
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,890
So it was a lot to do with it

234
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,770
and is big for me,
man.

235
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,700
I really want to be back in the cage by 
the end of this year.

236
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,260
Really.
You know what I mean?

237
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,180
I want,
wouldn't be fighting about an issue here

238
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,200
and it's not impossible.

239
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,330
Well you got a great attitude man.
This idea that you love it,

240
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:20,164
that you're a broken toy and you got to 
rebuild it and fix it and it's exciting 

241
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,643
for sure.
It gives you an opportunity to kinda 

242
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,223
start again.

243
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,370
I mean that's been my whole life my 
whole life.

244
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,533
So I'm just there again at this point in
my career and unfortunately this had to 

245
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:39,670
happen for me to turn the corner and get
focused in another way.

246
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,830
But you know,
it's just what it has to be,

247
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,560
but it's so exciting that you have this 
attitude that's the.

248
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,360
That's the cool thing about it.
It's like you're not,

249
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:48,830
woe is me.
You're like,

250
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,450
Hey,
I'm on a rebuild,

251
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,453
but let me get right back in there.
You must be so excited that you could 

252
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:56,030
just do everything again.

253
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,610
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

254
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:01,420
Like first was finding out what we're 
headed,

255
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,410
making sure that Dick work

256
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,480
first,
live on,

257
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,560
always fuck off my back.
So just making sure I could do shit,

258
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,273
you know?

259
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,280
No,
the first,

260
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,060
first couple months was just brutal,
you know,

261
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:25,820
not being a.
When I asked him to eat,

262
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,560
did it slowly start to come back where 
you got like some motion?

263
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,490
Well,
I've had a lot of,

264
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,200
I think it's stenosis,
spinal stenosis for,

265
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,560
for years,
you know what I mean?

266
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,450
Source.
Do you do any decompression?

267
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,763
I do a little bit here and there.
Whenever I can get to the chiropractors 

268
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:47,394
I'm doing some or you know,
it's like I said it's been bad for 

269
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:50,620
years.

270
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,453
Have you seen that thing that you hook 
up to your neck and yet came from a 

271
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,334
doorway

272
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,140
stretch it?
No,

273
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,403
I did that same thing with a rolled up 
towel or bang from the doorway and it 

274
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:03,650
helps mind tremendously,
but I got mine I'm sure from fighting,

275
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:08,651
but then also like I'll lay on my back 
at night for like two weeks.

276
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,380
My neck will be all know.
Isn't it crazy?

277
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:13,214
You're a professional fighter.
You fuck up your back watching youtube 

278
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,270
videos for sure.

279
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,890
But everyone's doing it,
man.

280
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:21,700
That's all we do is take the whole 
working.

281
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,810
People's necks are changing.
It's terrible

282
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,900
if it wasn't for like,
you know,

283
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,180
being in awareness that I have now for 
like my neck and neck injuries,

284
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,123
just seeing a lot of things.
I'm like trying to posture up and just 

285
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,380
seeing shit because I'm just,
I'm always like this.

286
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,230
Always,
always hurting.

287
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,064
So you know,
it's been one thing after another four 

288
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:45,750
years and that's actually leading into 
this,

289
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,350
you know,
this accident with this injury,

290
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,513
you know,
try to keep this mike closer like this 

291
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,000
noble to y'all.

292
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,670
So are you.
How old are you now?

293
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:59,430
Daniel,
I am 33,

294
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,000
34.
I'm at that age where you forget how old

295
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:03,950
you are.
Yeah.

296
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,450
So I'll be 34 and nine July.
Well your,

297
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:12,120
you're healthy and you know,
the ability to recuperate from something

298
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,240
that's that devastating that quickly 
shows what good of shape you're in.

299
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,080
That must have a big impact on,
on your rehab process.

300
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:19,630
Right.
Does,

301
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,463
it does mean a regular person that has 
that kind of injury probably is not 

302
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:24,120
going to bounce back like that.

303
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,223
Not as quickly and being like I said,
being an athlete has helped me 

304
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,580
tremendously.
I mean,

305
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:33,090
well my neck,
Korean obviously as strong as it was,

306
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:33,870
the,
you know,

307
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,140
the damage would have been worse.
But uh,

308
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,490
being able to bounce back was been,
you know,

309
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,950
being young,
being able to.

310
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,530
I put my body through so much that this 
is.

311
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,290
Yeah.
Compared to what has been through.

312
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,124
So yeah,
being young definitely helped me and 

313
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,390
trying to keep that,
that,

314
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,750
that time away,
but you know,

315
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,290
so how will you know when you get back 
in there?

316
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,720
Are you wrestling yet?
Yeah,

317
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,230
wrestling,
doing everything.

318
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,190
You wrestle them,
Breslin I've wrestled.

319
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,340
Yeah,
wow.

320
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,920
I'm nervous about getting your neck 
yanked on.

321
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,450
Uh,
I was nervous before.

322
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,110
Right.

323
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,710
But now I'm just getting confident with 
getting my neck strong,

324
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,290
making sure I don't do the stupid moves 
I've been doing the caused the injury.

325
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,620
So,
um,

326
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,060
my next step is just being clear.
BNC by a doctor,

327
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,330
a neurologist.
Yes.

328
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,990
He can fight.
Sign off.

329
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,670
Let's get back to business.
So,

330
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,860
and house bound toward treating all this
great.

331
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,950
Uh,
I can't say anything negative about them

332
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:36,400
because they've always done nothing but 
help me out in situations so,

333
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,693
you know,
I've been with them

334
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,930
or sometime you know,
and uh,

335
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,330
two times world champion tomorrow too if
y'all motherfuckers didn't know.

336
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,910
But uh,
yeah,

337
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,410
they've always,
they've always,

338
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,180
they've always been fair to me,
you know,

339
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,153
that's great.
Obviously you've always had problems 

340
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,940
here and there,
but I've never really had any major,

341
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,470
you know,
loved Scott Coker.

342
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,210
I do too.
He's a good dude.

343
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,000
So I always been good to me.
So it's been really good.

344
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,970
I hear nothing but good things to it and
how they treat people like guys who have

345
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,833
gone over there said it's a,
it's just a huge relief to get treated 

346
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,740
with respect.
You know,

347
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,480
like they were a little nervous about 
going over there.

348
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,463
Right,
right.

349
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,980
You know,
a lot of people will always ask them,

350
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:17,711
hey,
would you want it?

351
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:18,350
I'm like,
Eh,

352
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,940
this is home for me.
You know what I mean?

353
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:20,840
Like,
man,

354
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,290
the ideal for everybody would be bell 
to.

355
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,480
It gets to the same state as the UFC.
The same level.

356
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:28,520
That would be ideal.
That would help.

357
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,120
Like if you see Gennady Golovkin 
fighting Canelo Alvarez,

358
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:34,570
you don't give a fuck if it's golden boy
versus Bob Arum.

359
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,720
Nobody that they want to see champions 
go after it.

360
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,670
That's,
that's what everybody wants to see.

361
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,700
Ultimately that's what I would like to 
see across the board.

362
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,920
You know,
I mean I don't think it harms anybody.

363
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:49,400
I think it helps everybody.
Competition is definitely getting better

364
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,770
for everybody.
It's better for the athletes for sure.

365
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,813
You know,
and the more money that gets thrown 

366
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,490
around and the more promoted.
I mean,

367
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,100
if,
if a superstar emerges from beltour tour

368
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,080
that's at the same level that Rhonda 
was,

369
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:01,870
or connor is or something like that 
would be amazing.

370
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,690
That's great for everybody.
For everybody.

371
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,480
And you know,
there's a possibility there too.

372
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,010
I mean,
Michael Venom pages,

373
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,113
he's getting a lot of mainstream press.
People were paying attention to him now 

374
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:12,700
because the other crazy shit.
He doesn't matter.

375
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,893
We need more of that.
I thought he actually retired from him 

376
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,533
in a box for awhile,
like retired from the a box to 

377
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:20,794
something.
Nothing.

378
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,863
You know what man,
dude like that probably will retire and 

379
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,180
unretired just for the press,
you know,

380
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,520
just seems to be the thing that happens 
a lot.

381
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,790
Speaking of retiring and retiring

382
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,693
Joe Shell and back to mma,
I know you competed in the high rollers 

383
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:36,960
event this weekend,
which by the way,

384
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:39,330
Eddie Bravo told me he was so high.
He thought he was going to jail.

385
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,740
He told me,
he goes,

386
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:44,520
I was convinced I was going to jail.
It was so paranoid.

387
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,970
That was such a cool event.
The event for people don't know what the

388
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:48,804
fuck we're talking about.
So it was an event put on that cell and 

389
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,043
a big lawn on my buddy's,
they called the high rollers and it's 

390
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,280
cannabis infused Jujitsu tournament is 
what they call day.

391
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,233
What are those two dudes that's slapped 
each other and then they smoked a joint 

392
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:06,504
together?
The lapd there something between and 

393
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:09,660
then they stepped out with a joint.
I mean it was good though.

394
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,700
Before every match,
everybody smoked.

395
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,090
They smoked together.
The whole event.

396
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,950
There was no alcohol.
The Bible Super Chill.

397
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:20,010
They played like hip hop in the 
background fall.

398
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,110
It was like kind of press star studded 
event.

399
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:22,944
It was really fucking cool as it is by 
far the coolest martial arts event I've 

400
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,920
ever been to.
It was the

401
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,180
shout out to that Dj man.
He did like eight hours straight playing

402
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:36,140
the same song,
like only twice paid twice a month.

403
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,210
Uh,
we don't really,

404
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,360
I don't think he had bought it.
Was it?

405
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,183
It's a weird connection.
Marijuana with Jujitsu and it's always 

406
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,280
been there.
And people that don't know,

407
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:49,060
like people that don't smoke weed,
like I have to tell them that please.

408
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,153
Jeff Glover

409
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:55,310
and his opponent smoking weed.
It's hilarious.

410
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:57,234
Man is really,
really fun and that they're doing that 

411
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:00,474
man,
but I like it was a real cool event and 

412
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,773
it was real cool Jujitsu and we'd have 
always been connected for as long as 

413
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:10,170
I've been doing Jujitsu.
People smoked pot in the parking lot and

414
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:15,171
then went and enrolled.
That's still do kickboxing apparently is

415
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,404
the same way you practice focus.
But I always found that I'm not good at 

416
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,070
learning when I'm high or maybe I get 
too high and I can't learn like,

417
00:18:27,071 --> 00:18:29,010
like some Oh,
show me something and I'm not sure where

418
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:29,791
to put my legs.
I'm like,

419
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,624
what do I do?
Step over here would have put my right 

420
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,000
foot.
What?

421
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,280
Yeah,
I find that a bit,

422
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,010
but when I'm rolling,
if I'm rolling high then it just,

423
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:39,260
you just get into that zone and

424
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,610
if you know,
like when they say like,

425
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:44,790
uh,
if you take it,

426
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,943
when you study for a test,
you're sucking on peppermint and then 

427
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,000
the day of the test you take pepper.
You suck on pepper.

428
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,140
You supposed to help you remember?

429
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,220
Oh yeah,
yeah.

430
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,180
Like that's Kinda how it is

431
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,023
with,
uh,

432
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,950
with martial arts for me anyway,
like I'm high as fuck and I'm kinda like

433
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:02,130
just a programming into my deep 
subconscious or whatever.

434
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,363
That's my thought.
Maybe you think smoking all the time 

435
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:09,570
when you try and then smoking,
not smoking when you perform,

436
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,020
do you think that has a,
like a positive or negative effect?

437
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,290
Uh,

438
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,820
I don't know.
I don't really.

439
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,290
Well,
well let me ask you this,

440
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,410
if that was the first time I said we're 
not testing for weed,

441
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:24,710
you could fight high as fuck.
What would you do that smoke that day?

442
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,413
I wouldn't smoke probably 10 minutes 
before a lot of shit going on in my 

443
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:30,800
head.
This is cool.

444
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,430
This is cool.
But like,

445
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,500
yeah,
it's a lot of money on the line.

446
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,310
Well it's also,
you know,

447
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,130
the consequences are a lot different,
you know,

448
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,080
zig zagging a lot different when kicks 
and punches are being thrown.

449
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:45,914
Yeah,
for sure.

450
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,383
For sure.
Well remember when Nate Diaz or nick 

451
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,830
rather fought Gomi?
Nick Fargo me home.

452
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,581
Well,
I mean,

453
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,890
I know nick and I,
if you asked him that question,

454
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:55,140
you'd be like,
Oh,

455
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,610
have you spoken to right there?
And like he would for sure 100 percent.

456
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,940
I bet he would fight better probably.
Yeah,

457
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:03,770
not a fan of it.
You're not a fan of fighting.

458
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:04,370
Hi.
No,

459
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,370
no,
no fault.

460
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,204
One time.

461
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,990
What happened?
Well,

462
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:08,824
for once,
for once I went through the crowd 

463
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:12,790
instead of the,
the walkway.

464
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,670
That's what I do it

465
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,750
like you.
You're supposed to come out.

466
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:23,584
I was at Shark Bites and uh,
you'd come out and then you go at an l 

467
00:20:27,221 --> 00:20:28,054
shape and go straight to the cage.
Came out the ushers always fuck that 

468
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:34,300
shit up though.
That's happened like every time he tried

469
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,920
to walk out the cage the wrong way.
Like,

470
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,341
no,
no,

471
00:20:36,341 --> 00:20:37,120
the other one.
Anyway,

472
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,070
so I came out just crowd sitting there 
and just beeline straight to the crowd.

473
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:43,240
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

474
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,050
Stepping up to the cage,
like stepped over the fence.

475
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,153
Check me out.

476
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,271
Got It.
Now I'm like,

477
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:50,120
ah,
I don't remember.

478
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,840
Shock fights and the,
that was a bud brotzmann thing.

479
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,940
He's a buddy of mine.
Bullshit.

480
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,420
Yeah.
He was one of the original guys that are

481
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:58,880
on King of the cage.
Was it?

482
00:20:59,010 --> 00:20:59,843
Yeah.
Then didn't get involved in shark 

483
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,060
fights.
Yeah.

484
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,243
Somebody.
Did they have something to do with like 

485
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,340
fight as well?
I don't know.

486
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,100
So maybe there's a few people involved.
So it was a good car though.

487
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,100
I had a ga podell.
They had a show.

488
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,770
Could you want to fuck with a bunch of 
people know?

489
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,390
Hmm.
So what was it like fighting?

490
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:20,224
Hi.

491
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,273
Well for me at the time,
that was my biggest event and almost 

492
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,320
fighting a Karen,
Deborah Gideon.

493
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,440
So it was the biggest name I had fought 
to me it was like that.

494
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,980
Fuck.
You know what I mean?

495
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:37,330
I just was kind of overwhelmed.
I wasn't a Jujitsu.

496
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,410
I didn't know much about you.
Just to actually,

497
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:42,830
the whole fight was weird because on 
Monday I separated.

498
00:21:42,831 --> 00:21:46,370
My arm are separated my shoulder.
Wednesday they called me for the fight.

499
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,190
Saturday

500
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,300
fought for years to like,
I guess I'll get high for this.

501
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,090
Right.
You separated show like what?

502
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,970
Like separation,
like a separated shoulder.

503
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,240
Torn muscle.

504
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,531
No,
no,

505
00:21:57,531 --> 00:21:57,880
no,
no.

506
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,500
Um,
yeah,

507
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,620
up in the um,
I don't know what the fuck you asked me.

508
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,880
Did he love him?
Yeah,

509
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:06,970
well we got it like bandaged up,
got to work in,

510
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,360
fought with it.
He didn't fight,

511
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,194
would've been bandaged up,
but the next few days kind of build on 

512
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:16,570
it.
I said worked on as much as I can.

513
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,170
Went out there.
Uh,

514
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,860
it was in Texas,
fought and uh,

515
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,570
yeah,
it was just for me.

516
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:23,560
It was weird.
Like I said,

517
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,440
one decision,
uh,

518
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,580
like I said at first round he had threw 
a bunch of like lego blocks.

519
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,650
Yeah,
he's a serious spookseekers leg lock.

520
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,660
That's what I was saying.
Like,

521
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,810
hi,
I don't know,

522
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,530
I just want to get out of here.
So it was,

523
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:44,640
it was a bad thing for me.
So one I'm done fighting,

524
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,750
I'm done.
I was like,

525
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,480
I'm cool.
Have you ever fought?

526
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:48,314
Hi?

527
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,490
Uh,
I mean,

528
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:52,770
I'm sure I've fought at spar high all 
the time.

529
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,503
What's your feeling about that?
I think it like a for this Jujitsu 

530
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:01,704
tournament,
you know,

531
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,620
Jujitsu is not my strong suit obviously.
And so for me,

532
00:23:04,621 --> 00:23:05,454
that was my first Jiu Jitsu tournament 
and we just put on the gay like about a 

533
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,900
month ago when Matt told me about the 
things you should do it and Micky Gall I

534
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:16,470
trained with everyday and uh,
him and Bomba and we like,

535
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:16,951
all right,
fuck it,

536
00:23:16,951 --> 00:23:18,830
we'll do it.
So we start putting on the g and the,

537
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,750
that was a,
I didn't want to make a fool of myself.

538
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:23,730
So being high and having that like 
pressure,

539
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:25,800
like not being completely comfortable,
I think it was different.

540
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:26,634
But like in a kickboxing fight I could 
probably be drunk and still be pretty 

541
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:30,804
comfortable with.

542
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,273
Yeah.
There's a lot of people that think that 

543
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,090
I'm one of them to think that marijuana 
is a performance enhancing drug.

544
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,690
I don't think so.
Yeah.

545
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,940
On a certain.
On certain levels,

546
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,380
certain levels I think you can fuck you 
up but.

547
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,273
But it's,

548
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,233
if you get the dose right,
I think you puts you in a zone in a 

549
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,840
comfortable zone.

550
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,903
Right.
And I think a lot of them for 

551
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:53,524
performance,
like how well it's gonna increase your 

552
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:58,130
performance is not being super stressed 
out over bullshit the week.

553
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:00,160
And that's where I find the most 
benefit.

554
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:03,910
Like when I would quit smoking weed for 
a couple of days before the fight,

555
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:05,920
that was when it's like now is when I 
need it the most.

556
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,763
That was when the most stressed out when
I had the most anxiety that I have the 

557
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,390
hungriest they can,
you know,

558
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,470
I was like,
this sucks,

559
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:13,360
you know,
like in displays and just relax.

560
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,633
I think that helps.

561
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,481
Hey Man.
How you doing?

562
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:17,700
Any cryo therapy or anything to reduce 
swelling?

563
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,790
A little.
Like I said,

564
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,410
I was doing a little bit with uh,
the um,

565
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,780
the.
I'm drawing a blank,

566
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,030
the chiropractor that I was going to,
but I haven't done much of it.

567
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:32,470
But that's one thing I really wanted to 
get into because of the swelling a lot.

568
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,340
Like I said,
a lot of it,

569
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,170
it's went down over the,
over the time.

570
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:39,040
But body feels amazing after that crab.
Yeah,

571
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,090
dude,
I'm a big fan.

572
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,600
And you do it like super doses of cbd 
though too.

573
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,890
Yeah,
a lot of CBD.

574
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,590
A lot part of that.
Some of that in that bag you gave me.

575
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,060
Yeah,
check that out.

576
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:52,600
That's some flavor rec stuff that a flat
can't stop.

577
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:54,400
Crazy shirt in there.
Quite a few.

578
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,150
Can I take just wondering,
I'm like,

579
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:59,180
is he a medium or large and extra large?
No,

580
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,240
just broke as fuck.
I put large.

581
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:07,080
Isn't there?
Perfect.

582
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:10,710
That was perfect.
So strength for you joe.

583
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,743
What js?
It's a company called flavor to CBD 

584
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,970
Company.
I've been working with red pen,

585
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,723
so like medicated drops.
I get it gives you like a certain dose 

586
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:21,910
every time you click it.

587
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,470
Oh,
I've been using um,

588
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,290
you ever heard that company Jambo?
They just sent me some cbd.

589
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,200
A rub on.
Holy Shit.

590
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,710
Is that work for you?
Fuck yeah.

591
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:34,544
Two thousand milligrams cbd rub on.
I told you this sciatic pains but fuck 

592
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:41,990
with me or the last week or so and uh,
I rub it on my hip like it's like my ass

593
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,853
muscle right over like right here.
That's where like it travels down and I 

594
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:47,340
rubbed that shit on before I go to

595
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,393
that has these,
a medicated patches you can use to have 

596
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,130
roll ons that you could use evidence 
solve stuff.

597
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,323
And uh,
I just feel like I smoked so much weed 

598
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,830
with cbd in it all the time that it 
don't,

599
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,510
it doesn't seem to work for me.
I don't notice it,

600
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:03,190
you know?
And then they have vision droppers.

601
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:04,780
I use that like crazy.
Yeah.

602
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:07,630
Maybe you just got too much of a 
tolerance.

603
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,530
Why?
I just think of you.

604
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,350
If you smoke weed constantly,
there's cbd and everything.

605
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,090
You're hitting both.
So like when,

606
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,720
when my coach who's like 65 and never 
smokes weed and I give him,

607
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,830
put that shit on him,
he's like,

608
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:19,580
oh my God,
my elbow feels crazy.

609
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,250
I'll get you some of that Jambo Shit.
It's better than anything I've ever used

610
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:25,990
before.
They have two versions.

611
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:26,824
They have a thousand milligrams in 2000 
milligram and I put that 2000 milligram 

612
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,830
and it's got like a menthol in it.
So you feel it in your skin,

613
00:26:32,831 --> 00:26:34,240
like woo heats up.

614
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,910
Only time I've really ever filling that 
is like using it on my neck,

615
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,830
like using on my neck and I've used it 
on my hand to where I liked the achiness

616
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:44,100
does the achiness goes

617
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,390
away,
but on my neck as well,

618
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:50,391
I felt the most like up in the pain,
but I put this of CBD vaporizers in.

619
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:55,230
Then there's cbd bath bomb.
We used that before my buddy's fight,

620
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,243
the day of the fight.
We dropped it in the a and the hot tub 

621
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,500
CBD bomb.
Some fucking monsters out there that are

622
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:06,380
trying to make this illegal and it's 
pharmaceutical.

623
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,700
Those guys.
Fuck those guys.

624
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:09,534
So scary that someone would do that.
They would try to spend money to try to 

625
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:14,850
make this stuff illegal and while 
they're doing that,

626
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:18,480
they legalized like the fucking gmo 
synthetic version,

627
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,610
which is like actually killing 
seriously.

628
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:23,280
Fuck those people or fentanyl.
That shit's killing.

629
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,820
Everybody killed Prince.
It killed David.

630
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:29,320
Bowie had killed.
Who the fuck else are?

631
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:31,620
They killed it.
Killed it.

632
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:32,454
Killed a bunch of people.
This year Tom Petty Killed Tom Petty 

633
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:38,600
too.
Did he killed David Bowie or something?

634
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,170
Killed David Bowie.
Who knows?

635
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,530
What's the ball?
That's a.

636
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,580
it's a cbd bath bomb.
Dang.

637
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,090
You just drop that in.
That's it.

638
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:51,500
It's fucking not fucking around.
Legit.

639
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,563
Good time.
I really feel like a rub on effect from 

640
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,250
CBD is soak in.
One of those is really never did.

641
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:00,084
The bathroom is good and it's fun to 
watch you drop it in and I'll got a lot 

642
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,450
of shit right?
Some stuff,

643
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,890
Joe.
I got some good little,

644
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:11,800
uh,
you know,

645
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,770
to Chili's and Adam.
Woo.

646
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,790
Good stuff.
Exciting.

647
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,050
Live acts.
Got It all.

648
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,860
And this is also my.
Take this on my international flights.

649
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,810
Allegedly the key is illegal.
It's illegal,

650
00:28:27,811 --> 00:28:30,720
but it's when you put the vape pen and 
do it,

651
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,440
it looks like a car key so you can just 
walk right in security.

652
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,240
Oh that's crazy.
I'm in the bathroom.

653
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,870
Say screw the cap on from,
from us.

654
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,150
He put it in there.
And Man.

655
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,880
And these are these candy.
So my complaint about the candy thing is

656
00:28:55,231 --> 00:29:00,120
if they're going to have like um,
those are cbd with thc wants to.

657
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:03,480
And if you're going to have thc,
like super potent candy,

658
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:05,850
they shouldn't taste so fucking good 
because I'll eat the whole bag.

659
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,580
You know what I mean?
Like who's going to eat?

660
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:08,940
Just one.
That's very good.

661
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,190
That's watermelon.
Watermelon bags.

662
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,290
Ambulance.
Yeah.

663
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,690
This is watermelon.
It's like your belt.

664
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,180
Super Lucky.
Do check your shit.

665
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,030
The Shit.
Look at this thing.

666
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,310
I love it.
And then I think it has like A.

667
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,183
There's three different settings.
Repeat or value burning these kids 

668
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:34,650
today.
Oh,

669
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,060
you got to turn it on five times.
Click it.

670
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:38,250
Find on to the other side.
One,

671
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:39,060
two,
three,

672
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,020
four,
five.

673
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,383
Boom.

674
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,203
Nope.

675
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,180
That's the heat up to work.
A joke.

676
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,230
Fucking it up there.
Job.

677
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,830
You got it.
You got it.

678
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,740
You got to go on.
Maybe it had to heat up.

679
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,600
There it goes.
There it goes.

680
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,660
Burn it.
How was the ballot tours?

681
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,780
Drug testing policy standard.
We don't have like the additional,

682
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:11,160
uh,
you saw the random tests.

683
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:14,160
But I get tested before or after every 
fight.

684
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,610
I've been tested most of my fights.
I know that.

685
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,810
Yeah.
So.

686
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,450
And I've had people talk shit like,
ah,

687
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,303
they don't tell us,

688
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,190
well I don't know what you're talking 
about the test after fights,

689
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,563
but obviously there's a big difference 
between that and hey it's four weeks 

690
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:28,270
out,
wake up,

691
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,230
6:30
in the morning,

692
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,120
would even up to Daniel here,
Piston Cup,

693
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,820
look at that stair or it's crazy.
I mean they,

694
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:36,940
they have lost a lot of people off the 
roster in the UFC.

695
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:40,300
The really crazy thing is the body's 
changing people.

696
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:41,140
You weren't sure,
you know,

697
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,790
you know,
everybody passed the test when they were

698
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:43,624
doing it on the way in day,
but then you're looking at their bodies 

699
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:46,930
changed.
Like whoa.

700
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,920
So many of them just shriveled up and 
they just looked totally different.

701
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:53,140
And their performances are different 
mindsets,

702
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,510
different guys that were just 
unstoppable.

703
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:58,090
And so they came in.
It's like you're on like a six fight,

704
00:30:58,091 --> 00:31:00,430
losing streak.
Crazy dropped two weight classes.

705
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,740
Anybody who says it's steroids doesn't 
work as they're crazy fucking mind.

706
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:06,574
They're not taking it for fun.
They're not going all the way down to 

707
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:10,984
Tijuana and buying this shit because 
it's fun to get to do something on the 

708
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,023
weekend.
So do you feel like you got a new lease 

709
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:17,764
on life?

710
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,150
Um,
I'd do,

711
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,980
man.
Right now I'm just grinding,

712
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,850
like fully focused on getting back into 
the cage,

713
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,730
like,
you know,

714
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,603
having,
having what happened to me and being in 

715
00:31:31,711 --> 00:31:32,544
a position that I'm in,
I don't really have too many things to 

716
00:31:34,411 --> 00:31:36,480
go back to them.
So you know,

717
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,060
having a new lease on life really isn't 
how I would say it is,

718
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,640
it's just what it is.
I'm just focused on the next step,

719
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,560
you know what I mean?
The next step in my career,

720
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,740
the next step in the path and what I've 
been going through,

721
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,960
you know,
it's always just something for me.

722
00:31:51,961 --> 00:31:54,690
So no,
I wouldn't say it's a new lease of life,

723
00:31:54,691 --> 00:31:56,280
but just a new chapter.

724
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,420
But you must feel very fortunate that 
you can recover from that.

725
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:00,254
I do,
I do.

726
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,110
It's amazing story.
I love hearing that

727
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,390
is,
it just sucks.

728
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,250
You know what I mean?
It sucks to be in this position,

729
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:08,840
but I'm,
I'm,

730
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,260
I'm here,
I'm talking to you,

731
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,990
talking to this guy,
walking around.

732
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,660
So I'm blessed more than,
than anything,

733
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:20,660
but this is just fired me up to just get
sick on,

734
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,350
you know what I mean?

735
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,183
So you got to feel pretty fucking 
unstoppable after I go fly into the air 

736
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,730
slamming champion before this shit.
And you come back like,

737
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,940
what's going to stop?
Yeah,

738
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,883
that's the goal.

739
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,840
Get another belt,
get back,

740
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:34,070
get another belt.
Show people.

741
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:34,904
I'm not,
you know,

742
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,590
I'm not done.
Not done at all.

743
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,230
You know?
So uh,

744
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,850
yeah.
I'm even still riding.

745
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,160
Are you fucking savage?
Jesus Christ.

746
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,190
Just say one 76 the other day,
dude.

747
00:32:47,191 --> 00:32:49,420
I'd be an h one.
The real one.

748
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,353
A real hummer.
I'd be in one of those bitches and I'd 

749
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:54,780
ride in the middle of it.
Figure out a way to.

750
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:56,380
If we put the steering wheel in the 
middle,

751
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,633
I don't want to be on either side and 
strapped me in with a race harness and 

752
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:03,034
put fucking airbags everywhere.
I want this thing to be like an 

753
00:33:05,591 --> 00:33:07,970
inflatable bath toy,
but I'm an.

754
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:08,860
I'm an

755
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,800
adrenaline junkie,
so although to do anything,

756
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,320
you know,
I shouldn't be riding obviously,

757
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,690
but uh,
you know,

758
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:19,420
I need something to study my mind.
So like I said,

759
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,260
training training has been going 
something I got back into riding,

760
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:24,094
something I got back into and it's 
pushing me to like move forward with 

761
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,230
that because.
How long was it before you wrote again?

762
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:35,580
I probably started riding again maybe 
about a month and a half years.

763
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,020
What?
About a month ago?

764
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,760
About a month ago.
A month ago.

765
00:33:38,761 --> 00:33:39,750
Okay.
Not a month end.

766
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,310
So five months after the injury?
Probably about a month.

767
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,510
If you did a month after an injury,
like this dude is fucking crazy.

768
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:50,150
Get barely walk.
That's some shit I would try to.

769
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,113
I mean I would definitely try it.
But what do you think makes you such an 

770
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:54,720
adrenaline junkie?
I don't know.

771
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:56,060
Even right before all my fights.

772
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,080
So like it's just been that way.
Like I would always ride a lot before my

773
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:03,710
fights because I had to release,
you know,

774
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,910
all the adrenaline and all the pent up 
like anxiety,

775
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,400
anxiety going on and that's just how 
I've always been.

776
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,410
I've always wanted to see what was it 
like to kill yourself,

777
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,950
you know?
What was it like that?

778
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,490
No,
you know what I mean?

779
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:22,430
Like adrenaline wise,
what was it like to do something fun,

780
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:24,640
exciting to push the limit,
get on the APP,

781
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,461
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

782
00:34:25,461 --> 00:34:27,920
That sounds very different than I didn't
mean it like that.

783
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,530
You don't want to.
Fighters that are liked.

784
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,770
I mean Diego corrals.
He died in a motorcycle accident.

785
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,590
Paul Williams,
you know,

786
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,453
he got fucked up.
There's so many fighters that have 

787
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,200
gotten into motorcycles for that very 
reason,

788
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,670
but it's not just motorcycles.
I mean I've done until all type of shit.

789
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,440
Like what else?
I mean,

790
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,820
I love diving waters when one of my 
favorite things.

791
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,480
Oceans,
one of my favorite things to do.

792
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,693
No,
I've never been in a situation whereby 

793
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,430
the diary thing,
but you know,

794
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:59,120
I want to do skydiving.
I want to do rock climb and I want to do

795
00:34:59,121 --> 00:34:59,954
all of these

796
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,790
show shillings on my page.
He and Joe are on the same page.

797
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,190
I don't even like roller coasters to 
drag me on it the first time.

798
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,300
Then I'm like,
we're going again.

799
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,501
To that point,
I'm like,

800
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:12,460
no,
fuck that.

801
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,003
You ride bikes a little bit,
but I want to go the down at the ranch 

802
00:35:17,651 --> 00:35:18,484
with coldwell riding with them,
but they make fun of me because I'll go 

803
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,300
like 60,
like 60.

804
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:23,580
Then it starts getting like,
oh no.

805
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,493
It must be cool.
Cowboy example will be fucking going 

806
00:35:28,781 --> 00:35:32,920
down the highway 90 with his hat off,
like resizing his hat,

807
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,830
you know?
No hands 90 down the highway or snapping

808
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:38,400
pictures

809
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,680
of us while he's riding.
Oh Jesus.

810
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,510
I don't want.
Isn't that

811
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,120
for sure.
I love that dude.

812
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,190
I don't want them to get hurt.
I don't want to hear that.

813
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,800
Yeah,
fuck what?

814
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,920
He's good at it.
I guess.

815
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,490
I'm sure he is good at fighting too,
but it's fucking dangerous.

816
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,770
Just like you should dot your I's.
Cross your t's or 90 on the highway.

817
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,810
Fuck that.
Yeah.

818
00:35:59,811 --> 00:36:02,870
He's a perfect example of a legit 
adrenaline junkies.

819
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:03,980
One hundred percent.
Yeah,

820
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,840
100 percent.
One hundred percent.

821
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,610
I guess just some people once.
I guess fighting is a big part of it.

822
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:13,190
Like once you've experienced the highs 
of fighting,

823
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,323
I guess the,
the lows of regular life or just too 

824
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,390
fucking boring?
Is that what it is,

825
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,313
man?
Imagine.

826
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,603
I feel like you would get.
I would definitely mammon thought about 

827
00:36:21,351 --> 00:36:22,184
retiring,
but when I stopped fighting I think 

828
00:36:24,171 --> 00:36:25,004
that's what really bothered me because 
I'm addicted to like not the adrenaline 

829
00:36:30,051 --> 00:36:33,230
side of the lake.
The challenge like the you can't do this

830
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:36,590
like me versus the world like that.
That really gets me going.

831
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,200
I think if I didn't have that when I'm 
older,

832
00:36:39,201 --> 00:36:41,570
I'd be pretty pissed off you versus the 
world.

833
00:36:41,571 --> 00:36:43,250
Like how so?
Uh,

834
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,610
like,
or like even me versus a man versus man,

835
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:48,540
like one on one,
like no other.

836
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,360
It's just,
you're the only one that you can,

837
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,940
you can count on in that scenario I 
guess.

838
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:53,774
But like that,
that personal challenge is what drives 

839
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:59,780
me and fuels me.
And that's why I think in my career,

840
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,480
the fights that I wasn't supposed to 
win,

841
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,110
we're always the ones that I really 
showed up for it because that Jen,

842
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,460
that,
that hit me where it was,

843
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,440
if I was supposed,
supposed to,

844
00:37:09,441 --> 00:37:12,260
when everyone thought I was going to win
for some on some level,

845
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:15,170
I would not show up the same way.
Very common.

846
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,000
That's very common.
Yeah.

847
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:17,890
A lot of guys,
when,

848
00:37:17,891 --> 00:37:19,130
when they think it's going to be an easy
fight,

849
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:20,120
they can't get up.
They don't.

850
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,920
They just have this weird.
And it's weird

851
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,753
because like you don't know,
your coaches won't let you not trained 

852
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:27,250
that way.
Like you train hard for the fight,

853
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,093
you know that something about the thing 
in your head doesn't click or it 

854
00:37:31,831 --> 00:37:32,430
doesn't,

855
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,850
don't go after.
Yeah.

856
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,693
It's like the thing that everybody hates
the most about before a fight that 

857
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:42,520
discomfort and anxiety and just fuck,
why am I doing this?

858
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:43,354
Fuck.
That is what is your friend when you're 

859
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:45,900
in there?
Yeah.

860
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,670
Yeah.
It's the fights were guiding extent.

861
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,603
Yeah.
That's what fucking drowns you at the 

862
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,234
same time.
Because it'd be people like fucking 

863
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,630
their whole campus,
perfect.

864
00:37:54,631 --> 00:37:56,450
And as soon as they walk out in front of
that crowd,

865
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:57,390
it's like who the coach is,
like,

866
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:59,310
who the fuck is this?
What the fuck's going on?

867
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,370
But don't you think that that's always 
that kind of person,

868
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,280
like a guy like you doesn't have that.
There's not,

869
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,200
that's not a thing that you experience,
you know,

870
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,570
I mean there's the type of people that 
crumble or usually like the guys who are

871
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:16,510
just murderers in the gym and then for 
whatever reason,

872
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:20,290
under the bright lights they falter,
but they rarely rise.

873
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:24,040
Like those guys rarely win the big 
fights that they're not supposed to win.

874
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:24,874
That's not,
they're not the same psychological 

875
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:29,140
makeup.
So like something about the challenge or

876
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:32,860
the unknown to some people it just 
overwhelms them.

877
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:35,980
Whereas other people,
whatever their psychological is,

878
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,710
that challenge is what fires them up and
gets them excited.

879
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,930
Yeah.
Yeah.

880
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,500
It's weird,
right?

881
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:45,100
Consistency is the hard part.
And longevity for fighters in general.

882
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,003
The curriculum,
that's what makes floyd mayweather so 

883
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:53,140
impressive to me is for him to be at the
top of the game for so long and can make

884
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:56,860
all the money and continue to be at the 
top of the game and still do that.

885
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,610
I mean versus like,
you know,

886
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,280
the guys that blow up and then Jon Jones
has trouble,

887
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:05,110
they don't know how to deal with the 
fame for him.

888
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,060
Connor throwing shit through bus 
windows.

889
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:07,894
Like it's hard to stay balanced and 
consistent through that whole mental 

890
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,220
thing.

891
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,830
The biggest one of my biggest thing has 
been,

892
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,900
you know,
the mental part of fighting,

893
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,190
you know,
getting to the top,

894
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,260
being pushed back down,
getting to the top,

895
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,783
you know,
just dealing with that as a fighter has 

896
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,960
put a lot of stress on them.
Like,

897
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,390
you know,
every time that I got into the cage,

898
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:30,570
like had thought or how I acted.
A performance.

899
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,040
Yeah.
So you,

900
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,660
you did some work with vinny shoreman,
right?

901
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,890
Yep.
How did that help?

902
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,900
A vinny helped me a lot for a,
worked with him for I think three years,

903
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,393
two or three years.
And I find that I'm tell everybody 

904
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,560
beneath Germans a hypnotist whose been 
on the show a couple times.

905
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,670
Actually I was the one that had told you
about the bottom up on this phone.

906
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,880
Shit,
someone wants credit.

907
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,820
I made you have any.
Um,

908
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,820
he has me.
It was a trip.

909
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,601
Right?
Wow.

910
00:39:57,601 --> 00:39:59,610
This is real.
It really worked for me.

911
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:00,250
And then,
uh,

912
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,083
I find that as I've grown,
I think just like any technique you get 

913
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:07,210
better at it and has it needs time to 
lay,

914
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,420
kinda resonate inside of you.
And I feel,

915
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:11,780
I mean I haven't worked with them in 
over a year and a,

916
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,103
I still am figuring out like,
oh that was the fuck he was talking 

917
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:16,524
about.
Or like this is leanne starts to sink 

918
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:19,030
in.
So I think it's been,

919
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,370
the mental game is a huge,
a huge asset.

920
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,533
Do you ever work with a sports 
psychologist or a hypnotist or anything 

921
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:27,270
like that?

922
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,260
I mean I've worked a little bit with a 
guy named will back in Florida.

923
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,094
This was some years ago,
but something I've always wanted to 

924
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:35,120
dabble in.
Something I've wanted to explore.

925
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,490
I haven't really got a chance to do a 
lot of things,

926
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:39,980
but that's one thing I've always,
like I said,

927
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:44,300
the mental part is been key to me,
so I've always wanted to do

928
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,650
it might be a good thing to help you 
during your recovery too,

929
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,873
you know,
to just really concentrate on recovery 

930
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:53,050
and really concentrate on the parts of 
your body that need

931
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:58,130
be fixed and you need to reach out to 
the right people to get the right,

932
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:01,960
you know,
um,

933
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,970
help as far as like,
you know,

934
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,770
people to talk to as far as like that.
I don't really know anybody like that.

935
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,170
Vinny shoreman to the rescue.
You?

936
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,780
Yeah,
he'll,

937
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,120
he's probably listening.
He'll do it over skype to you do it over

938
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:17,954
a fucking face time.
And the of used to hypnotize me over 

939
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:24,820
facetime all the time and then get on 
fight day.

940
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,560
He would call me and like we'd be 
backstage.

941
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,390
He'll be back in the states in October.
Yeah.

942
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,440
Yeah.
So

943
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,840
I'll look it up.
I'll make the connection.

944
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,750
I would definitely look into that would 
definitely like.

945
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,790
But you've been using the,
a lion's mane.

946
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:43,150
Mushrooms,
two minutes.

947
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,893
Yeah.
I send them that video and started 

948
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,473
talking to him about it.
When I found out about what happened to 

949
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:50,630
him,
you know,

950
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:51,543
it was like,
I'm sure not as bad as he was going 

951
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:54,554
through,
but like we were just going to walk 

952
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:56,680
again.
Oh,

953
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,510
if Dan was in a horrible accident and 
then every time I talked to him he would

954
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:01,170
just be like real like,
Nah,

955
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:02,300
fuck them.
It's going to happen.

956
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,670
Fuck that.
I'm like,

957
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,990
alright,
you need to take this lion's mane.

958
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:06,824
Mushroom.
He needs with these core to set 

959
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,324
mushrooms,
take all the flavor of cbd that you can 

960
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,240
get some other mushrooms is good for 
your brain.

961
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,900
You'll be cool.
And uh,

962
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,120
I mean,
look at it.

963
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:18,490
Look what I did.
Look what I did.

964
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,383
Oh Joe Joe.
Walking around and hearing that you're 

965
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:24,670
sparring and hitting the bag and heating
pads.

966
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,590
Yeah,
I mean all these things put together.

967
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:31,591
It's just what's given me back.
So it's nothing's impossible.

968
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,823
I mean,
I can prove that nothing's impossible 

969
00:42:34,841 --> 00:42:37,000
and shit,
you know,

970
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,990
doing it,
like you said,

971
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:43,010
even the lion's mane and the different 
CBDS I've been taken and just getting my

972
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:46,510
body back to like feeling good mentally 
feeling good,

973
00:42:46,511 --> 00:42:49,510
just everything's working.
Like in steps,

974
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:52,720
so little steps at a time.
Basically every day by day.

975
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,010
So we'd say like 80 percent now I'll 
give you 75.

976
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,460
Seventy five is good,
you know,

977
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,220
75 minutes you can get to 100,
you know,

978
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,970
like I'm running.
You know what I'm saying?

979
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,770
That wasn't one of my big goals was like
buy in six months,

980
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:08,630
I want to be running,
set a goal,

981
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,800
started running,
boom.

982
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,210
I'm a guy who couldn't walk.

983
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:14,320
Exactly.
So that's awesome.

984
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,443
It's,
it's,

985
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,080
it's,
I don't know,

986
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,420
it gives me an a.
every time I think about it,

987
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:23,200
the reason why I stopped just because 
every time I have to talk about it,

988
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:27,520
I get into mental thought of it in the 
process of going,

989
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:32,260
laying in the bed,
not be able to feel shit to,

990
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,563
you know,
dragging your foot after you're walking 

991
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:38,020
with a walker to be able to pull up your
pants.

992
00:43:38,021 --> 00:43:41,290
Now it's crazy.
It is fucking crazy.

993
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,550
You know what I mean?
And it just,

994
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,413
it keeps me.
It keeps me humble enough to just talk 

995
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:51,310
about the situation and love it.
Love Life.

996
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,990
That's a beautiful story man.
I love hearing things like that.

997
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:57,240
People recovering from things because 
it's just,

998
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:58,074
it makes you appreciate the fact that 
you are all healthy every time anything 

999
00:44:02,461 --> 00:44:03,294
goes wrong in your life.
It's an opportunity to appreciate what 

1000
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:07,224
it's like when things go right and if 
you can get back to where you were and 

1001
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:11,550
you'll have a new perspective.
I do for sure.

1002
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,913
For sure.
Are you fucking with that lion's mane 

1003
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:14,964
stuff too?

1004
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,740
Yeah.
My how often you take it.

1005
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,533
I was taking it every day.
I made a bunch of capsules with lion's 

1006
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:24,150
mane and a quarter.
So you made the capsules yourself.

1007
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,230
You can buy it on Amazon little capsule 
machine.

1008
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:32,810
Make 100 capsules a little concoction.
They're nice.

1009
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,580
So when I saw on your,
your show,

1010
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,670
I'm Paul stamets was talking about how 
the,

1011
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:39,504
uh,
I think it was cte that you guys were 

1012
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:42,204
talking about how the,
the lion's Mane helps a final note on 

1013
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,823
the for repairs it or if it just helps 
like the find a way around blockages or 

1014
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:53,430
whatever with neural tissue.
Nerve tissue.

1015
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,010
And I was like,
Daniel,

1016
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,350
I hit him up with a right.

1017
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:57,681
No,
that,

1018
00:44:57,681 --> 00:44:59,540
lion's mane stuff is miraculous.
I mean there's,

1019
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:00,943
it's amazing that more people don't know
about it and that more people aren't 

1020
00:45:03,471 --> 00:45:04,304
talking about it,
but anybody that's involved in contact 

1021
00:45:05,991 --> 00:45:06,824
sports and the athletes that are getting
hit and they're getting their cage 

1022
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:11,810
rattled a lot.
They should be taking that stuff all the

1023
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:12,980
time.
Yeah.

1024
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,990
And CBD as well,
right?

1025
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,041
Yeah,
for sure.

1026
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:17,990
I mean,
I just look at it like the business that

1027
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:22,991
we're in is really dangerous and like if
you know that there's something that you

1028
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,550
guys could get punchy,
right,

1029
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:26,384
or guys lose their chin or have problems
like performing on fight night or 

1030
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:33,530
whatever,
like if you can,

1031
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,870
if you could take cbd to be better for 
swelling,

1032
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,704
you can take lines made of repair,
the concussions and shit that we're 

1033
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:40,154
getting constantly.
Like I just think you're kind of stupid 

1034
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:45,170
if you're not actively trying to figure 
out a solution to all these problems.

1035
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,510
Have you ever fuck with Kratom?
I never.

1036
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,430
Not really.
I know people that have.

1037
00:45:49,431 --> 00:45:50,480
I've,
I was um,

1038
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,433
I was hanging out with Simon rex 
yesterday and he was telling me like 

1039
00:45:53,061 --> 00:45:57,320
some awesome stories about people that 
were addicted to opiates.

1040
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,340
They got off of it with Kratom,
Aka dirt nasty.

1041
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,950
So good.
That's so funny,

1042
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,460
dude.
That's an awesome dude.

1043
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,323
He's a good dude.

1044
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,191
I,
uh,

1045
00:46:06,191 --> 00:46:08,560
I took eight,
created eight pills yesterday,

1046
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:09,843
which most of the time I was taking two 
and then I took four and then yesterday 

1047
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:15,970
I took eight.
Now I get it.

1048
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,960
That stuff makes you high as fuck when 
you take eight.

1049
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:24,160
My whole body felt weird.
I was like pretending to be sober.

1050
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,960
I was walking around and pretend to be 
sober,

1051
00:46:25,961 --> 00:46:28,750
but not like a drunk.
Not,

1052
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:29,613
not like reaction time,
like almost knocked something off the 

1053
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:33,040
counter.
I caught it real quick.

1054
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,590
It's like everything's normal.
Like your body moves good,

1055
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,960
but you're like,
Woo.

1056
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:38,843
You feel weird.
You feel like you're under the 

1057
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,000
physically.
Mentally.

1058
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,770
It's very nice.
It's like,

1059
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:45,790
yeah,
it gives you a body buzz,

1060
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:49,330
but it's,
it's great at alleviating anxiety.

1061
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,970
Like it makes you really chill.
It's weird.

1062
00:46:51,971 --> 00:46:54,820
It's just like puts you in this nice 
headspace where you just like,

1063
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,470
ugh.

1064
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,303
Like everything's calm.
I think the idea is that it fills up 

1065
00:46:59,591 --> 00:47:02,050
these opium receptors and that's what,
uh,

1066
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,140
what people that have had real problems 
with opiates.

1067
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:08,800
That's why they like it.
Because even if you're fucked up on it,

1068
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:12,100
you're not fucked up.
You fucked up like,

1069
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:13,120
Woo.
I feel something.

1070
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:13,954
Something crazy is going on.
And I was taking eight and my buddy 

1071
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:19,930
Chris Bell,
he's the guy who directed that a bigger,

1072
00:47:19,931 --> 00:47:21,220
stronger,
faster documentary.

1073
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:25,750
He had a real problem with opiates.
He got a pretty serious,

1074
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:28,060
a hip injury,
how to get a hip replacement surgery and

1075
00:47:28,061 --> 00:47:31,990
was in massive and when he has a serious
arthritis,

1076
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,250
like a genetic arthritis,
and when he got his hip replaced and got

1077
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:37,084
on pain pills,
he got hooked bad in the middle of 

1078
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:41,770
making a documentary about prescription 
drugs,

1079
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,660
which is crazy.
In the middle of it,

1080
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:46,930
he got hooked himself,
just total random,

1081
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,190
you know,
synchronicity.

1082
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,190
And he takes 10.
He takes 10 of those,

1083
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:54,370
so he takes two more than I took it 
yesterday for like four hours.

1084
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,360
I was walking around like this,

1085
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,780
but there's no real side effects in 
comparison to the other stuff.

1086
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,010
No,
no real side effects.

1087
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,830
After that last man standing tournament,
I'm with Laura,

1088
00:48:03,831 --> 00:48:05,570
had three fights in one night.
My,

1089
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:11,150
I had like super bad chest contusion of 
my chest is still there years later,

1090
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:15,250
the swelling and swelling of my sternum.
And uh,

1091
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,540
it would pinch off nerves running down 
my shoulder.

1092
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,420
And then I think it actually pinched off
the nerve root,

1093
00:48:20,421 --> 00:48:21,950
which is when I started doing the,
um,

1094
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,950
the decompression with the chiropractor 
and so my left side started like,

1095
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:28,371
getting,
like,

1096
00:48:28,371 --> 00:48:31,850
it was noticeably getting smaller,
like it was the muscle atrophies because

1097
00:48:31,851 --> 00:48:34,520
you don't know that I didn't know.
You might know what Joe,

1098
00:48:34,521 --> 00:48:35,354
you know,
everything is that the nerve root 

1099
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,640
actually feeds them the muscle and 
allows it to grow without,

1100
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,190
once that's fucked up,
then your muscle won't grow anymore.

1101
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,023
It's when you atrophy and shit,
it's very difficult to get it to grow 

1102
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,720
back to if you don't catch it quickly.
Right.

1103
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:48,853
And,
uh,

1104
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,230
did you have a problem and get into grow
back or do you catch it quick?

1105
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:52,383
Well,
I think when we started doing the 

1106
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:54,560
decompression and all that stuff,
it worked.

1107
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,660
Um,
I mean it grew back I think,

1108
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,360
um,
but the,

1109
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,300
the pain that I was feeling from all the
shit I kept,

1110
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,340
I kept getting Vicodin,
prescription Vikatin in Norco and uh,

1111
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:09,380
you're literally in pain.
So I would take the medicine.

1112
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,813
But,
um,

1113
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,953
after like two months,
like I looked at my kitchen counter and 

1114
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:16,730
there was just empty pill bottles,
like everywhere.

1115
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:17,564
And I noticed that I was like really 
fucking aggressive and like short and 

1116
00:49:19,941 --> 00:49:23,000
like I just stopped right away when I,
when I realized that,

1117
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,070
but I could totally see how that would 
be.

1118
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,530
That could become a,
an addictive thing for sure.

1119
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,900
I was there manning,
you really need it,

1120
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:30,763
you know,
it wasn't like I was like trying to get 

1121
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,384
fucked up.
I was like,

1122
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:33,830
Oh,
I'm in pain and take a pill.

1123
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,113
And then,
uh,

1124
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,680
did you go to a doctor and get it looked
at?

1125
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,053
Yeah,
I went to.

1126
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,840
What did they say about your sternum?
Uh,

1127
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,710
they said that there was nothing wrong 
with it and went to the hospital twice.

1128
00:49:42,711 --> 00:49:43,544
I woke up,
uh,

1129
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,960
America woke up screaming and shaking 
from the pain and went to the doctor,

1130
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,470
the hospital,
and they did an x ray.

1131
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:51,200
And so there's nothing wrong with that.
And I'm like,

1132
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:53,450
look at the swelling.
It looked like a tennis ball.

1133
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:54,823
And they said that it was in our 
cartilage or between the ribs or had 

1134
00:49:58,401 --> 00:49:59,690
gotten some sort of confusion,
you know,

1135
00:49:59,691 --> 00:50:00,524
somebody gets a hit and elbow and there 
had swells up that mine was doing that 

1136
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,910
under the rib or under the sternum 
plates or some shit.

1137
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:10,940
So there's this constant pressure.
I just started taking advil,

1138
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:15,260
like it was going out of style and then 
that would make the swelling go down and

1139
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:16,094
then I wasn't in pain anymore.
And the problem that I was having with 

1140
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:21,020
the Vicodin was it's not an anti 
inflammatory,

1141
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:23,570
so it did nothing for the,
for the actual cause of the pain.

1142
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,180
And I was just eating fucking vicodin 
like crazy.

1143
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,230
So,
um,

1144
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,270
and then,
uh,

1145
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,960
yeah,
but not,

1146
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,980
I pretty much eat.
I take advil every day regardless for my

1147
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:37,124
knees hurting or my toes are hurting.
Or like just years of not supposed to 

1148
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:40,424
fuck with that stuff every day.
It's not good to do the honest gut 

1149
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:45,404
health.
Right.

1150
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:46,970
That'll help.
I mean,

1151
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,860
in Kimchi helps to probiotics Kombucha.
It just,

1152
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:54,500
it ruins your gut health and it causes 
inflammation.

1153
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:57,740
This is what my friend Cameron Hanes who
runs ultra marathons,

1154
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,843
he was taking 800 milligrams a day,
sometimes twice a day and a because he 

1155
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:02,984
was in pain all the time because he runs
fucking dude runs a marathon every day 

1156
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,880
on Saturday.
This Saturday coming up,

1157
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:12,320
he's running for 24 hours and his goal 
is 120 miles in 24 hours.

1158
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,640
I mean,
he's a fucking maniac.

1159
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,540
So this dude's always in pain.
And uh,

1160
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,393
I had Dr Rhonda Patrick on.
She was explaining about how 

1161
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:20,023
nonsteroidal antiinflammatories like 
Ibuprofen actually cause inflammation 

1162
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:25,304
because they fuck up your gut bacteria 
and they fuck up your body's ability to 

1163
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:29,930
process information and it causes pain.

1164
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,973
So he listened and there's connections 
to stroke and all sorts of other 

1165
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:34,604
problems.
So he gets off of it and all his pain 

1166
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:36,734
went away.
His pain was caused in part by the fact 

1167
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:42,140
that he was taking this stuff for his 
pain,

1168
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,870
which is a terrible,
ridiculous vicious cycle.

1169
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,500
What's APP for how long?
Straight was he taking?

1170
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:51,110
He was taking it for years.
For years.

1171
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,093
Yeah,
he will because he's been running 

1172
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,443
forever.
He's been doing marathons and ultra 

1173
00:51:55,431 --> 00:51:58,160
brand 238 miles last year.
The,

1174
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,990
you know the mole APP to 30,
which is just the same.

1175
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,113
Yeah,
we'll have to even possible it takes 

1176
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,660
three days,
three fucking days.

1177
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,350
What's really crazy is you have to.
The first day you woke up the next day,

1178
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,063
another 24 hours of reading.
So there's a type of mindset that you 

1179
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,220
have to have to be able to do something 
like that.

1180
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,940
That's just super human.
You have to be able to just every step,

1181
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:20,900
left foot,
right foot,

1182
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:23,120
left foot,
right foot and agony and pain.

1183
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,133
All your toenails are falling off.
Everything's in seeing them post 

1184
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:30,170
pictures of nasty fucking feet.
All fucked up.

1185
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,063
Yeah.
What's crazy is a woman beat everybody 

1186
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:34,843
by more than 10 hours.
A woman who I had on her name is 

1187
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:38,540
courtney doe.
Walter,

1188
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,383
she beat everybody by 22 miles.
She was 22 miles ahead of the second 

1189
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:44,504
place.
Dude,

1190
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,120
it's unbelievable.
She's a fucking animal.

1191
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:51,870
She slept for one minute and three days.
One Minute for a minute.

1192
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:57,340
Sorry.
Twenty two miles come up.

1193
00:52:57,501 --> 00:52:59,360
I don't think steroids help in that 
world.

1194
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,160
I think in that world those people are 
just,

1195
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:02,840
it's just mental.
I really,

1196
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,733
I really don't think it helps.
And then they'll get paid for it a 

1197
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,590
little bit.
They get sponsors and shit.

1198
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:10,783
Cam doesn't get paid.
He had a sponsors under armour sponsors 

1199
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:15,050
them and you know,
but not really.

1200
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,043
It's just because they're animals.
I know every step I'd be like thinking 

1201
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,344
about what am I doing this for?
Well it's also your use to psychotic 

1202
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,460
interactions with other people

1203
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,293
in short amount of time.
Like you used to like 20 minutes 

1204
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,380
description.
Chaos.

1205
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,900
I mean dude,
that last man standing,

1206
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:35,910
it was one of my favorite events I've 
ever been to.

1207
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,013
I fucking loved it.
I don't want you to ever do it again 

1208
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:42,660
because I love you fighting fucking four
times in a night.

1209
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,190
Oh Man,
I kinda want to do it again.

1210
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,670
It's crazy.
There's something about doing that,

1211
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,070
you know,
you're doing something special and,

1212
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,160
and uh,
you know,

1213
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,063
epic like that was,
that was my man the last man standing 

1214
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:57,840
the tournament.
That was like my main focus after the,

1215
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,030
after I knocked out Simon Marcus and 
then I guess after a beat,

1216
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,340
after the first two fights going into 
the third one,

1217
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:08,760
like I'm pretty sure I wasn't going to 
beat our two most to beat up,

1218
00:54:08,761 --> 00:54:09,594
but I was just had this crazy buzz about
knowing that I was doing something 

1219
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,180
special like this was really fucking 
cool,

1220
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,120
but I would love to do it again.

1221
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,173
I think that's how those people will 
feel when they're running those crazy 

1222
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:21,484
ultra marathon.
They know they're about to do something 

1223
00:54:22,841 --> 00:54:25,720
insane.
It'd been a regular fight.

1224
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,780
Is Insane.
To regular fights in a night is insane.

1225
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:29,883
Three irregular fights in the night 
against worldclass kickboxers and then 

1226
00:54:33,581 --> 00:54:34,414
the first fight you got to go for rounds
because after three rounds it was a 

1227
00:54:36,701 --> 00:54:39,700
draw.
What in the fuck man,

1228
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,430
good notify.
Had to do that shit right now if you get

1229
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:48,700
excited to hear you talk about it.
I liked.

1230
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,233
I've always loved tournaments.
I've always wanted to be in like a day 

1231
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:57,740
tournament like that should be dope.

1232
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:00,223
Now you're making your move back to mma 
because kickboxing is just not what it 

1233
00:55:05,991 --> 00:55:06,824
should be.
I think we both feel that kickboxing is 

1234
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:10,394
one of my favorite things to watch.
I'm a giant fan of it and for whatever 

1235
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:14,534
reason it is just not caught on in 
America the same way boxing has or the 

1236
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,010
same way.
And my man

1237
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,913
Smith and I've spent my whole,
well I've been doing this since I was 

1238
00:55:24,051 --> 00:55:25,730
15.
I'm 34.

1239
00:55:25,731 --> 00:55:26,564
So all of that time I've been thinking 
about this same question and then like 

1240
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:29,824
I'm just,
you know,

1241
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,770
it is what it is.
Yeah.

1242
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:34,430
It's like you can't hold onto it 
anymore,

1243
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,050
at least not for me.
The sport is going to grow,

1244
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,490
it's going to keep,
keep doing good.

1245
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,330
And I hope that that continues,
but for me,

1246
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,673
I need to do,
uh,

1247
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,370
keep,
keep progressing,

1248
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,710
so to speak.
That is a

1249
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,020
did.
Here's what it is.

1250
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:48,883
I mean,
that's the best way to put it because 

1251
00:55:49,941 --> 00:55:54,380
there's no way we're gonna fix it,
but I don't understand,

1252
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:55,070
you know,
I mean,

1253
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,780
I really,
really don't understand.

1254
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,673
I fucking love watching kickboxing and 
when people tell me about how they love 

1255
00:56:00,801 --> 00:56:01,520
boxing,
I'm like,

1256
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,780
that's great.
Boxing is great.

1257
00:56:02,781 --> 00:56:05,750
I love boxing to kickboxing is way 
better than boxing.

1258
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:08,990
That extra level of,
you know,

1259
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:14,020
thrown in kicks and knees and especially
if you go to Moitai elbows and clench.

1260
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:15,770
It's just,
it's a wilder,

1261
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:20,150
crazier striking sport and I just don't 
understand it.

1262
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:24,370
I mean,
when I watch you fight or Kevin fied

1263
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,203
or you know,
Kevin Ross or Georgia Petrosian John 

1264
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:28,991
Wayne part,
like,

1265
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:30,670
how the fuck would you not want to watch
that?

1266
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:32,800
But it's so exciting.

1267
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,410
And then continuously just don't,
they just don't tune in,

1268
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,140
doesn't.
It's like fuck,

1269
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,250
I don't know what it is,
I just don't understand this.

1270
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:43,980
Just beltour have real problems with 
their ratings when they air it.

1271
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,513
Um,
I don't know exactly what the ratings 

1272
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:48,180
are.
I know that they're,

1273
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:49,440
uh,
they're average.

1274
00:56:49,441 --> 00:56:52,530
They're not super fantastic on any.

1275
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,600
So it's below what the averages for the 
MMA fights.

1276
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,590
Yeah.
Yeah,

1277
00:56:57,591 --> 00:56:58,424
for sure man.
It's a bummer to real fucking bummer 

1278
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,770
because for,
for anybody who's a fan,

1279
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:08,060
anybody who likes watching it like shit,
like that event in La,

1280
00:57:08,061 --> 00:57:09,680
that last man standing.
Holy Fuck.

1281
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:11,990
Was that fun?
That was crazy.

1282
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,660
Yeah,
that was.

1283
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,493
That was probably one of the best 
kickbox Siemens was the buscot boxing 

1284
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:17,170
event I've ever been to.
Yeah,

1285
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,243
me too.
The whole energy and the forum just in 

1286
00:57:19,381 --> 00:57:20,920
general,
that layout of that was,

1287
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:21,630
was bad ass

1288
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:22,151
that.
Yeah,

1289
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:23,730
that form is perfect for that.
I mean it,

1290
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,860
everybody knew it was a special night 
that it was crazy,

1291
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,450
you know,
that they were doing this,

1292
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,033
you know,
what is it like knowing that like how 

1293
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:35,680
much time do you have in between your 
second and third fight and everything is

1294
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:39,700
fucked up and sore and you know,
you're about to go into another fight.

1295
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:45,070
I think it's probably like 30 minutes,
30,

1296
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,690
40 minutes.
Maybe one more.

1297
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:47,643
One other fight between you.
So just enough time for everything to 

1298
00:57:49,781 --> 00:57:50,950
start hurting.
Yeah.

1299
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,473
Yeah.
Um,

1300
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:57,520
yeah.
I guess I was just because of the money,

1301
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:58,383
like I knew that each time my father was
going to get more money and that was 

1302
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:01,714
like my focus in the 30 minutes,
like not wanting to go back out and 

1303
00:58:04,121 --> 00:58:06,050
never crossed my mind,
you know?

1304
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,920
Versus if I think if I wasn't getting 
paid for it,

1305
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:09,754
I'd be like,
oh,

1306
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,870
that's cool.
Yeah,

1307
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,250
that was fine.
You know what I mean?

1308
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,130
So that's why I was asking about those 
ultra marathons,

1309
00:58:15,131 --> 00:58:15,964
how they get paid for it or not because 
I don't think that would be my main 

1310
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:19,640
focus.

1311
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,850
You say that,
but I think that if you were there,

1312
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,600
just your competitive spirit would kick 
in and you would go,

1313
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:27,434
let me see what I could fucking do here.
Give me another minute hand and a 

1314
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,630
cigarette.
Yeah,

1315
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:35,630
you're at mile 79 and you're like,
shit I'll have to do is 21 more miles.

1316
00:58:38,661 --> 00:58:39,494
I could do that now.
Do you think you'd like to fight in a 

1317
00:58:44,811 --> 00:58:47,270
tournament like old school,
Ufc one style?

1318
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,200
Oh,
there's one to,

1319
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,850
to uh,
you know,

1320
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,630
being part of the,
towards tournament,

1321
00:58:51,631 --> 00:58:55,220
it was dope being a part of like a 
monthly tournaments.

1322
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,550
Right.
I've always wanted to be like,

1323
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,330
you know,
was,

1324
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,510
was good.
Would again,

1325
00:59:00,511 --> 00:59:01,344
you know,
find some of the best fighters in the 

1326
00:59:02,101 --> 00:59:04,430
world three times a night.
Yeah.

1327
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,300
That's really what's going to test you 
to me.

1328
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:07,950
So the,
yeah,

1329
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,890
there's so many factors involved.
So many variables,

1330
00:59:10,891 --> 00:59:12,410
right?
Like your opponent could get up

1331
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:16,210
quick first round knockout,
and you could go a three round war,

1332
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:18,250
you know,
and then you face each other in the next

1333
00:59:18,251 --> 00:59:19,084
round.
It's just,

1334
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,040
I get the commissions not wanting

1335
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,300
to do it anymore.
I get it.

1336
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,640
The only place that would let you do is 
probably like one of them,

1337
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:27,590
native American casinos.
It's like,

1338
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:30,590
come on in,
come on in.

1339
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,660
Got The commission is the commission of 
problem.

1340
00:59:32,661 --> 00:59:34,220
I think they would do it in California.
Do you think?

1341
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:36,410
So it did with glory when I did it.
Yeah.

1342
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:37,244
But that's kickboxing.
I don't know if they would do that with 

1343
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,250
mma.
Kickboxing.

1344
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:41,084
It's wildly widely criticized.
A lot of people think that was a bad 

1345
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:45,044
idea.
I think the way they can do it with 

1346
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:47,444
kickboxing is because of boxing.
The boxing rule says up to 12 rounds or 

1347
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:52,880
whatever.
So for kickboxing,

1348
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,520
that's three fights.
Yeah.

1349
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:56,883
I don't know how that works with them.
I may though that makes sense with 

1350
00:59:58,581 --> 00:59:59,990
kickboxing.
That make sense?

1351
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,110
Because I think they probably would have
a hard time saying like,

1352
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,020
have Daniel can fight 10 rounds of Ima 
may tonight.

1353
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:10,430
That's what's the most rounds of 
kickboxing you ever fought in the night.

1354
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:13,310
But other than that tournament like one 
single fight,

1355
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:15,063
a five,
five rounds when I was probably more 

1356
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,143
times.
Always,

1357
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,530
always,
always like that.

1358
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,700
Right.
Why is that?

1359
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,093
Um,
I think that the rule set and Thailand 

1360
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,153
is based primarily around gambling.
It's like human cock fighting is what 

1361
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,420
tie isn't in Thailand essentially it 
sounds negative,

1362
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:35,210
but it's Kinda that way everybody in the
audience is,

1363
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,770
is gambling and betting and yelling and 
motioning back and forth.

1364
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:40,604
The treatment bedding.
So like in Thailand it's a three minute 

1365
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:43,070
round,
but it's two minute rest,

1366
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:45,800
which I think is awesome.
That is awesome.

1367
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:46,723
But yeah,
I follow for the WBC world title over 

1368
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:50,270
there.
And Wow,

1369
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:55,660
what year was this Jamie?
They played the music.

1370
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,931
Yeah,
yeah,

1371
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:01,760
for sure.
And I find a Roger Dominance Stadium and

1372
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:02,960
Thailand,
which is like one of the.

1373
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:04,100
Wow.
I was just dumb.

1374
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,390
And,
and one or the two being one.

1375
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,300
So I fought over there.
Uh,

1376
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:11,693
the two minute rest is cool except that 
you kind of run out of things to talk 

1377
01:01:14,931 --> 01:01:17,730
about like my coach.
And I was like,

1378
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:21,950
so I'm like looking at ring girls out,
fight a tie guy.

1379
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,330
Uh,
no,

1380
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,060
I'm both times now.
First Time I fought a guy from Argentina

1381
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,013
at Roger Stadium and the second time 
I've bought a car ped car at Pythian 

1382
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:32,640
from Golden Glory.
Jim,

1383
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,840
for the WBC world title.
Now when you,

1384
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,210
um,
fight over there in Thailand,

1385
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:42,290
did they still expect Westerners to take
it easy on that first round?

1386
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:45,020
Because the idea is during the first 
round most ties,

1387
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:46,123
they go fairly light because they were 
ready for the bedding to get 

1388
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,630
established.
They don't want to go.

1389
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:51,853
I think you don't want to come out too 
strong because then nobody will bet on 

1390
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:55,724
you are against the other person.
I don't think they expect that from the 

1391
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:02,780
foreigners though.
Just as a whole.

1392
01:02:02,781 --> 01:02:03,614
They think that the foreigners suck.
Like they think like foreigners won't 

1393
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:06,494
block leg kicks.
A lot of times you'll see like the ties 

1394
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:10,670
come out and just wreck the foreigner in
the first round and again.

1395
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,460
So yeah,
I don't think they're,

1396
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:16,760
they're expecting the foreigners to 
participate.

1397
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:20,010
So I would love to go back in time

1398
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,873
and watch Ramon decker when he first got
there and that was like the golden era 

1399
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:25,120
of

1400
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,600
can we tie in like the nineties when,
when they didn't have the,

1401
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,720
you know,
like right now it's the first round.

1402
01:02:31,721 --> 01:02:33,520
They don't really fight the second and 
third round.

1403
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:34,354
They fight in the fourth round that they
may or may not fight depending on who I 

1404
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,670
know who's who won the first two.
They take it off because they do nothing

1405
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,580
really.
I mean not nothing but almost nothing.

1406
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:46,414
They're not really trying to win because
they know they're going to fight in a 

1407
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:52,501
week and then like in the golden era of 
was like when like those guys would come

1408
01:02:53,171 --> 01:02:54,004
out and just,
it was a prime time and everybody would 

1409
01:02:56,201 --> 01:02:59,920
fight every round and it was supposedly 
was better.

1410
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:01,003
Does Ramon decker fights?
Anybody who doesn't know anything about 

1411
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,653
Moitai?
Go on Youtube right now and watch Ramon 

1412
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:11,170
dekkers and watch chaos.
That dude,

1413
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:12,543
he fought guys who was his size to that 
was what was interesting about him is 

1414
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:16,474
like he was a small guy.
It wasn't like a big guy who was going 

1415
01:03:18,581 --> 01:03:21,310
over there to fight the ties.
He was their size.

1416
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:23,090
Yeah.
And he felt like the top,

1417
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:23,924
top,
top guys and like the and like their 

1418
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:26,323
pro,
which is pretty rare now you see like 

1419
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,600
Sanchez,
super famous,

1420
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:34,601
but like [inaudible] is,
is like the celebrity guy who's fighting

1421
01:03:34,761 --> 01:03:36,530
like the older,
heavier ties,

1422
01:03:36,531 --> 01:03:37,364
like the,
the top ties right now in Thailand at 

1423
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:43,780
120 pounds,
15 pounds and they're like 16 years old.

1424
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:45,750
It was like the top guys.
Right?

1425
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:46,843
Then you build a name where you're big 
enough name that the foreigners know 

1426
01:03:50,001 --> 01:03:52,700
about you,
the rest of the world and market you and

1427
01:03:52,701 --> 01:03:53,840
then you fight,
you know,

1428
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:57,420
you go to America and in American you go
to wherever.

1429
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,940
So He's like a Samurai,
blue cow.

1430
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:02,880
Those guys,

1431
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,700
he's fighting constantly and he seems to
be fighting on the road a lot.

1432
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:06,563
I'll go to these weird places and fight 
some dude who looks like he's in real 

1433
01:04:09,121 --> 01:04:11,040
trouble almost immediately.
Right?

1434
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,690
Well,
they're like,

1435
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:13,524
oh,
we're going to bring sunshine over for 

1436
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,410
this fight.
And like always got to fight somebody.

1437
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,733
They tarred.
Uh,

1438
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,890
and then a lot of times the ties don't 
fight each other.

1439
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,280
Like it's very rare that you'll see 
outside of like a tie stadium.

1440
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,200
Um,
you know,

1441
01:04:25,201 --> 01:04:28,440
you never hardly,
you're not going to see yahtzee classify

1442
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:33,840
boot cow or like a tie versus they,
the ties to kill the foreigners and then

1443
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:39,000
still be on the same team has got such 
an interesting style too,

1444
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:39,834
because if you looked at him,
if you only saw like a silhouette and 

1445
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:44,190
you saw him move around,
you'd go immediately.

1446
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:45,024
Oh,
that's her.

1447
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,320
You could tell instantly,
yeah,

1448
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,070
it's constantly moving,
shuffling his feet,

1449
01:04:50,071 --> 01:04:51,900
switching back and forth,
real light on his feet.

1450
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:53,590
He just moves different than everybody 
else.

1451
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,703
He does like the old wiper boron was 
like the original martial art of the 

1452
01:04:59,100 --> 01:04:59,933
turned into a tie.
If you watched like the old Tony John 

1453
01:05:01,471 --> 01:05:02,304
like on bark or whatever and they run up
on your leg and like dropping the ball 

1454
01:05:06,331 --> 01:05:07,164
on your head was like the [inaudible] 
stuff and like a lot of the techniques 

1455
01:05:09,811 --> 01:05:10,644
that st jude does,
like the cartwheel kick or like the 

1456
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:13,524
games that he plays a lot.
Silla is another one that's really 

1457
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:17,000
similar to him on the wash.
You just,

1458
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,230
when they've met laird

1459
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,580
Zilla fight in lion fight against a do 
with zero fights.

1460
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:23,483
They let him it with zero fights.
The dude had zero Moy Thai fights over 

1461
01:05:29,951 --> 01:05:30,784
$400.
He got up to the top and he had kicked 

1462
01:05:34,091 --> 01:05:34,924
this dude into another dimension,
but it was one of those things where it 

1463
01:05:37,691 --> 01:05:40,300
was inevitable from the first minute of 
the first round.

1464
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:43,270
You like this guy was an mma fighter.
Not a bad fighter,

1465
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:45,640
but just doesn't belong in there with 
laird zillow.

1466
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,820
It was ridiculous.
Yeah,

1467
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:52,570
and when would I put it online?
The please don't ever do that again.

1468
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:54,610
They're like glue.
Connor Mcgregor's going floyd.

1469
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,473
Floyd.
Merriweather.

1470
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,550
Yeah,
that's $100,000,000,

1471
01:05:57,551 --> 01:05:58,960
bro.
Kind of different.

1472
01:05:58,961 --> 01:05:59,794
Pretty sure.
Like if I didn't pay that guy anywhere 

1473
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:02,114
close to that,
pretty sure that guy got his head 

1474
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:06,640
knocked off for 10 bucks and it wasn't 
the same.

1475
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:08,380
That guy is not conor mcgregor either.

1476
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:11,890
Right?
I mean if conor Mcgregor Zilla at an MMA

1477
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:13,540
fight or more Thai fight,
I go,

1478
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:15,160
okay,
let's see what happens.

1479
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,031
You know,
I mean,

1480
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:18,700
I don't think he's going to win,
but that might be interesting.

1481
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:23,530
But you know,
seeing those guys in the real high level

1482
01:06:23,531 --> 01:06:26,890
guys and seeing like what they are able 
to do,

1483
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:31,180
seeing the way they move and it's so 
important for,

1484
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:35,650
especially for mma guys that don't 
understand the levels of striking,

1485
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,470
that there's.
When guys are just striking,

1486
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,640
there are just,
there's some elite upon elite upon elite

1487
01:06:42,641 --> 01:06:44,500
levels.
You know?

1488
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:45,363
I mean,
it's such a black pillow versus a 

1489
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:48,043
bluebell.
Yeah,

1490
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,240
it'd be like a really bad ass blue belt.
The black belt,

1491
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:54,280
you're just completely lost,
like it's not even close to just getting

1492
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,270
dominated.
Yeah,

1493
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:58,410
you can just get shot down,
you know,

1494
01:06:58,620 --> 01:06:59,453
or like you're a good high school 
wrestler and you go against the world 

1495
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:02,853
chair.

1496
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:05,223
Yeah.
That's been one of the more unique 

1497
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:09,760
things about combat sports is that there
are these deep,

1498
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:12,170
deep levels and you don't,
you know,

1499
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:13,053
sometimes you need to see like a guy 
like Khabib number got madoff is a 

1500
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:17,254
perfect example.
You got to see him fight against guys 

1501
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:22,420
who you know are bad ass and see him 
smush them.

1502
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,920
Just the real difference.
Right?

1503
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:25,420
Yeah.
They realized where this Guy Zach,

1504
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,273
because he's not doing anything.
It's not like he's doing jumped three 

1505
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,113
60,
we'll kicks in the that nobody else can 

1506
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:30,994
do.
He's doing things that everybody else 

1507
01:07:31,691 --> 01:07:33,190
does.
He's just doing.

1508
01:07:33,191 --> 01:07:35,380
I'm at a level that no one else is doing
it now.

1509
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:36,603
It's crazy.
He's wrestling is like 10 times the 

1510
01:07:40,591 --> 01:07:43,440
level of like a lot of Russell's there 
could be.

1511
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,060
Have you ever trained with them?
Never tried water.

1512
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:49,930
He impresses me with like,
you know,

1513
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:50,900
watching them fight.

1514
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,600
Who was the best wrestler at American 
top team when you were there,

1515
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:56,500
what would you think,
do you think is the best recipe you

1516
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,160
train?
What did.

1517
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,000
I mean he wasn't a fighter.
Had to be Brown.

1518
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:03,820
I mean Brown.
He is a dog.

1519
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,540
Just coach wise.
He was just,

1520
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,820
what's his name?
Mike Brown.

1521
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,850
It was brown.
He might wouldn't know.

1522
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:14,250
Where's he out of act?
No,

1523
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,710
but where it was he was he dressing her?
I'm saying Mike Brownie,

1524
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,310
not a um,
a,

1525
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:20,243
a fighter was a coach.
Mike Browning was probably the best 

1526
01:08:22,241 --> 01:08:23,050
wrestler at.
Oh,

1527
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:28,050
the coach was interesting.
My brother just had his hands.

1528
01:08:28,811 --> 01:08:33,811
He was movement and strength.
Just a dog and he wasn't a fighter,

1529
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:36,730
not just wrestling.
Yeah.

1530
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,520
But he,
he had a college career too though.

1531
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:40,540
Yeah.
Where'd he go?

1532
01:08:40,541 --> 01:08:41,374
I think it was in Boston maybe.
Or what was my brand new from up north 

1533
01:08:45,431 --> 01:08:46,060
somewhere.

1534
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,590
So he's never had any MMA fights.

1535
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,370
No Brownie has.
Yeah.

1536
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:53,960
How many of you have fought for the UFC 
for four?

1537
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:58,990
Fucking.
What was that before UFC or that young?

1538
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:05,170
Um,
be uriah a WC had a good career.

1539
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:09,230
Oh,
Mike Brown.

1540
01:09:09,231 --> 01:09:13,070
You're sounding.
You're seeing Brownie is Mike Brown?

1541
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,121
I was like,
who's this?

1542
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:19,121
Browning talking about it and I fought 
for the UFC.

1543
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:24,200
Was going through my Rolodex.
Browning.

1544
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,070
Browning.
Browning.

1545
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:26,860
Who's browning?
No,

1546
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,230
Mike Brown's brother right now.
He's a,

1547
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,153
he was a bad motherfucker in his day.
Cool motherfucker to do like he's 

1548
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:35,980
brother.
Favorite person I fuck with.

1549
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,210
Well,
he's a great coach now too.

1550
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:39,044
He was in Colby Covington,
scorn of this weekend and they told me 

1551
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:42,261
after the fight,
he's like,

1552
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,360
dude,
this kid's cardio is insane.

1553
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:45,620
He's like,
it's insane.

1554
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:47,000
He goes,
I think it might be like a,

1555
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:49,790
just a natural gift that he has.
I mean he trains really,

1556
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:51,620
really hard,
but he said his cardio.

1557
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:53,410
It's just off the charts.
Hmm.

1558
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,280
Yeah.
Interesting.

1559
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:59,870
It's funny how much attention he like if
he wasn't that good before,

1560
01:09:59,871 --> 01:10:02,170
but it is like he got a ton of fucking 
intention.

1561
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,860
It's really started talking shit.
Oh,

1562
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:07,440
for sure.
I mean just the temp room.

1563
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,080
Yeah.
Well the talk and shit.

1564
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,720
Got them to the dance,
but beating my other way,

1565
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:12,500
he beat my,
uh,

1566
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,330
everybody had to open their eyes up and 
go home.

1567
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:16,340
But a lot of people had doubts.
They were like,

1568
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:19,040
dos Anjos is a fucking straight up 
assassin.

1569
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,440
He's going in there at gun against.
They got fucked up.

1570
01:10:21,441 --> 01:10:24,260
Robbie lawler got merk.
Neil Magni like,

1571
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,810
how's he going to beat this guy?
And he beat the shit out of him.

1572
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:30,680
He literally beat him every round.
It was crazy like he watching.

1573
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:34,940
I mean maybe you could give him the 
first round of Dos Anjos and you know,

1574
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,100
he was always a threat because he's 
still got power,

1575
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,880
but colby just on end it was like Nick 
Diaz style just pop,

1576
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:41,870
pop,
constant,

1577
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:44,480
constant attack,
constant kicking them,

1578
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:45,470
constant punching them.

1579
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,200
I was very impressed,
very impressed.

1580
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:49,760
Watch it.
I didn't see it.

1581
01:10:49,761 --> 01:10:51,890
So I can't really say anything.
Very impressive man.

1582
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:54,490
That the most impressive thing was the 
pace he put on them because they'll.

1583
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:59,500
Santos is known for his cardio and he 
had a real problem with that cardio when

1584
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:00,344
he was at 1:55
because he had diminished his body so 

1585
01:11:01,611 --> 01:11:03,860
much and then he moves up to one 70 and 
you're like,

1586
01:11:03,861 --> 01:11:06,410
well,
now he literally doubled his output.

1587
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:11,330
If you look at the strikes per minute in
the 155 pound division and then one 70,

1588
01:11:11,331 --> 01:11:14,010
it was double at one 70 and still

1589
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,410
colby melted them.
Just just stayed.

1590
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:18,480
Stayed on and kept that heat on.
It was crazy.

1591
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:20,580
So impressive.
Very impressive.

1592
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:25,350
But now he's got tyron so mad.
Tyrone wants to fucking kill him.

1593
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:30,120
That's a different person like tyron 
hasn't so much because he hates him.

1594
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:32,340
All the shit talking colby has been 
doing.

1595
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:36,180
He did interviews with people.
We told them don't bring up colbys name.

1596
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,043
I don't want you to even bring up his 
name because he didn't want colby 

1597
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:41,850
getting any attention,
but now it's too late.

1598
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:43,343
Now.

1599
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:48,340
Anyone's name other than his brother all
the time on any show ever.

1600
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,960
Period.
Ever.

1601
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,880
We're going to fight now.
He should be happy.

1602
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:56,220
That guy talks a lot of shit now because
that's what's gonna make them money,

1603
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,153
right?

1604
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,640
I mean fuck you go from.
How do you feel about shit talking?

1605
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:05,540
I was never shit talker but because I 
never wanted to be that guy,

1606
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:06,374
that shit talk shit coming back it up.
So I like when people talk shit because 

1607
01:12:09,771 --> 01:12:13,640
I'm gonna beat your ass anyway,
but you know it works for some.

1608
01:12:13,641 --> 01:12:15,620
It doesn't.
Like I said for me it was,

1609
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,633
I was never one of those guys but it has
been one of those things that you see 

1610
01:12:20,421 --> 01:12:21,890
every,
every couple of years.

1611
01:12:21,891 --> 01:12:22,724
It's the one guy that stands out from 
talking shit and it's like I had worked 

1612
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:27,674
for him.
They just start to see everybody tried 

1613
01:12:29,591 --> 01:12:30,424
to trickle it.
Well I think connor did that for a lot 

1614
01:12:32,841 --> 01:12:35,210
of people,
but colby saying some hilarious shit.

1615
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:35,380
Okay.

1616
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,270
Take this belt and bring it to Donald 
Trump.

1617
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:40,900
Shit.
Yeah.

1618
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:43,410
Fuck it.
It's fucking funny though,

1619
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:45,200
man.
Thing Sheldon.

1620
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:46,510
Chill.
It was like,

1621
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:49,750
it obviously fun,
like just that's obviously bullshit,

1622
01:12:49,751 --> 01:12:51,170
but it's fucking works.
Yeah,

1623
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,173
exactly.
But Charles still the bus might see the 

1624
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:56,530
manager and make me watch him talk about
anything.

1625
01:12:57,490 --> 01:12:58,310
I really like.
What?

1626
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:59,143
He's a smart dude.
It's really good because little is a 

1627
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,050
instagram videos that he does in his 
car.

1628
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:06,310
We were fucking great.
They're excellent.

1629
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,173
Fucking great.
I would take a class from chill on how 

1630
01:13:09,791 --> 01:13:11,470
to like talk shit.
Do that shit.

1631
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:13,110
I would totally do it.
Yeah,

1632
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,610
man.
When he was fighting Anderson Silva,

1633
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,250
those.
Those were the glory days of Shit.

1634
01:13:18,251 --> 01:13:20,620
Talking in MMA.
He opened up the door for everybody.

1635
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,473
Oh,
the feeding the Nogueira brothers a 

1636
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:26,920
carrot.
Carrot got his bus was a donkey.

1637
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,920
I didn't know that.
They had the internet there.

1638
01:13:29,921 --> 01:13:31,030
I swear.
I didn't know.

1639
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,830
I thought it was on a private forum.
The internet

1640
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:33,813
and eyes balls.
He went over and did the ultimate 

1641
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:38,360
fighter in Brazil.
I mean,

1642
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,213
went over to Brazil,
stayed there for six weeks and did the 

1643
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:43,264
ultimate fighter and coached alongside 
vandelay and vandelay got jumped by a 

1644
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:48,423
Dieta and vandelay got so goofy on the 
show that vandelay last Brazilian fans 

1645
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:57,640
because vandelay was coming after him 
and shale was trying to be calm about it

1646
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:58,540
and was like,
look,

1647
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:00,310
you know,
like don't touch me,

1648
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:01,720
don't come near me.
And you know,

1649
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:03,280
vandelay comes near him,
he grabs him,

1650
01:14:03,281 --> 01:14:04,390
takes him down,
and he's like,

1651
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:08,110
it was so,
it was so interesting.

1652
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:12,550
Like watching him turn it all around and
people mad at Vanderbilt.

1653
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,700
I mean the Brazilians were mad.
Evacuated the like you're making us look

1654
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,160
bad.

1655
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,350
A perfect place.
A perfect.

1656
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,023
Perfect.

1657
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,170
Yeah.
I mean there's,

1658
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:24,350
there's a time and a place for shit 
talking and this is the time and this is

1659
01:14:24,351 --> 01:14:27,770
the place.
It just seems like to make money now.

1660
01:14:27,771 --> 01:14:29,330
It's,
it's such a wise move.

1661
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,400
I mean it's sports entertainment at the 
end of the day,

1662
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:33,980
regardless of what anybody wants to say 
or think about it.

1663
01:14:33,981 --> 01:14:36,980
And like I'd rather.
I mean I've watched two guys that aren't

1664
01:14:36,981 --> 01:14:37,701
that good.
If I,

1665
01:14:37,701 --> 01:14:39,240
you know,
like the tough man contest,

1666
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:40,074
so if it's marketed right and think the 
bouncers and bartenders are like 

1667
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,210
whatever,
like the entertainment,

1668
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:45,053
it's entertainment.
Some of the best fights have been 

1669
01:14:46,471 --> 01:14:48,400
against guys who aren't some of the best
fighters.

1670
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:52,630
Splutter being I'd love that guy was the
best fights ever.

1671
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:54,000
Sure.

1672
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,760
I'm going to start like a fucking tough 
man contest.

1673
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:57,220
Promotions.

1674
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,230
Well and even good guys who aren't world
champions.

1675
01:14:59,231 --> 01:15:00,064
Like when a god he fought micky ward.
We knew that they were both perfectly 

1676
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:03,814
matched and they were just going to 
collide in the middle of the ring and 

1677
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:07,023
beat the fuck out of each other.
But are some of the classic boxing 

1678
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:10,294
matches

1679
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,373
for sure.
Didn't have to be for the heavyweight 

1680
01:15:14,781 --> 01:15:15,450
championship.

1681
01:15:15,450 --> 01:15:16,580
No,
no,

1682
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,483
no.
I mean there's been some amazing fights 

1683
01:15:19,351 --> 01:15:20,490
in the UFC there.
Similar to that,

1684
01:15:20,491 --> 01:15:22,470
like Gilbert Melendez,
verse Diego Sanchez.

1685
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:24,770
That wasn't for a title.
I was one of the greatest fights of our.

1686
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:26,010
See that shit was crazy.

1687
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:27,950
So classic.
So it makes.

1688
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:29,203
I mean I've always like that shit.
Two fighters that don't really have too 

1689
01:15:34,021 --> 01:15:34,854
much on the line and talking shit about 
a fight hype and the hype behind the 

1690
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:41,390
fight is what makes life.
It always does.

1691
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:41,890
Yeah.

1692
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:42,723
As long as you can actually still fight.
That's what's makes it interesting with 

1693
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:49,440
the guy with connor or a guy like colby 
day can fuckin fight it.

1694
01:15:49,441 --> 01:15:50,680
Talking a lot of shit.
But when the,

1695
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:52,270
when the,
when the bell rings,

1696
01:15:52,271 --> 01:15:53,200
they're backing it up.

1697
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,173
I mean we're talking about this earlier,
but that's what bugs me the most about 

1698
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,780
cm punk was there.
He has the,

1699
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:03,940
the ww II background you would think 
would be like great on the mic.

1700
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:05,530
You know what I mean?
And they're like maybe you can't back it

1701
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:06,364
up or fight or whatever.
Like he goes from like cocky and 

1702
01:16:08,411 --> 01:16:11,560
confident I'm the Fuck Jab or whatever 
that we're going to be like,

1703
01:16:11,561 --> 01:16:12,341
oh,
you know,

1704
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:13,780
I just believe in yourself.
Kids.

1705
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:18,820
It's like really hard to listen.
I don't believe he has no physical,

1706
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:20,730
like no physique.
He doesn't.

1707
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:22,480
It's not like it's,
it's kind of sad.

1708
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,000
I just shit on cm punk.

1709
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,000
No,
listen,

1710
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:27,450
you didn't shit on him.
You were honest about them.

1711
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:30,010
You were honest about what you saw.
I don't think that shit on him.

1712
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:32,380
Right.
He's a very nice guy.

1713
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:34,300
He's a very nice guy and he's a hard 
worker,

1714
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:35,134
but he does not have athletic talent.
He's missing a lot and he's a showman 

1715
01:16:39,581 --> 01:16:40,414
and when he was in the wwe,
he was allowed to say I'm not fucking 

1716
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:46,420
man and throw his arms up there and they
had it scripted so that he was the man.

1717
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:47,703
But you know,
when you're in there with a guy like 

1718
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:49,983
Mike Jackson who had zero fear of him 
and just was so casual and just popping 

1719
01:16:56,771 --> 01:16:57,604
them in the face anytime he wanted to 
and literally could have stopped him 

1720
01:17:00,231 --> 01:17:01,064
anytime.
If he just got angry and want to stop 

1721
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:03,334
him,
he could have stopped him at any point 

1722
01:17:03,731 --> 01:17:07,360
in the fight.
And even though he beat him decisively,

1723
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,220
the performance was pissed white off so 
bad

1724
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,053
the way he was fighting that.
He called him a fucking idiot and he 

1725
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,240
said,
I'll never fight in the UFC again.

1726
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,313
Anyone.
So like if Mike Jackson went out there 

1727
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:18,674
and just start cm punk with a right hand
left hook combination and that was the 

1728
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:23,120
end of it,
they would say,

1729
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:24,950
well cm punk,
you gave it a shot.

1730
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:25,910
That's it.
It's over.

1731
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,770
Mike,
who would you like to fight next?

1732
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,630
And now it's like,
you know,

1733
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:32,350
you're not even fighting in the UFC 
anymore because you should have,

1734
01:17:32,450 --> 01:17:34,340
you should have stopped him like what 
you were doing.

1735
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:37,940
He tickled him fucking it.
I'll make a joke of the sport,

1736
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:40,070
like it's already like a joke because if
this guy,

1737
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:41,990
everyone thinks punk punks like fucking 
joke.

1738
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:43,213
I guess he is,
but like don't make a joke of the sport 

1739
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:50,130
and like not just like poking fun of the
fence.

1740
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:51,283
I get rid and it's coming from.
I get ridiculous comment as to how to 

1741
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:54,140
starched stem.
Yeah,

1742
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:57,050
it's the whole thing was,
it was very weird.

1743
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,260
The whole thing was very weird,
was like right away when you see cm punk

1744
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:01,303
holding,
holding his hands up and moving stiff 

1745
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:03,890
and throwing kicks.
So like,

1746
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:05,143
oh Jesus,
like I don't like that being on paper 

1747
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,540
view.
I understand that they're,

1748
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:09,383
they're selling paper view cards,
but paper view in the UFC should be the 

1749
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:14,900
elite fighters.
Curtis blades versus Alistair overeem.

1750
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,300
Should have been on that paper view 
card.

1751
01:18:17,301 --> 01:18:19,070
That's what should have been there.
Not,

1752
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:20,900
not what we got to see.
You know,

1753
01:18:20,901 --> 01:18:23,980
what we got to see was just.
Yeah,

1754
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,473
I don't like when it's like,
like you're playing a trick on the 

1755
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:28,810
fence,
you know what I mean?

1756
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:32,210
Promoting this guys if you something and
then it's like inspiring videos come out

1757
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:33,650
and it's like,
what the fuck is this?

1758
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,120
Inspiring?
Videos are crazy.

1759
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,393
Awful.
It was like a guy who just showed that 

1760
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:38,134
as far awful.
It's like you took a dude who's no 

1761
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:42,410
wrestling background,
no nothing,

1762
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:45,230
or this one I want you to do.
This is a jab.

1763
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,810
It was the right hand is when you throw 
a kick.

1764
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:49,820
I want you to pivot.
Your hips go ahead and there as bar.

1765
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,073
I mean he just.
He doesn't have the ability to move his 

1766
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:54,644
body.
Right.

1767
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:55,603
There's a lot of guys that you could 
take out there that are track and field 

1768
01:18:57,921 --> 01:18:58,754
guys or football players and you could 
get them to fight better than him in a 

1769
01:19:02,811 --> 01:19:05,870
couple of weeks easily because they're 
athletes,

1770
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,840
they're athletes.
They would understand how to shift their

1771
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:09,950
weight,
throw a punch,

1772
01:19:09,951 --> 01:19:13,640
and yet the,
the sparring videos that I saw was,

1773
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:16,820
I think it was his first fight,
but even then he wasn't.

1774
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17,653
He signed for like two years before he 
had his first fight or something like 

1775
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:20,923
that.
There's no way that you're six years 

1776
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:24,650
deep in the game and yet he's still at 
that bad.

1777
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,750
You know what I mean?
He doesn't have any talent.

1778
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:27,793
It's all it is.
It just doesn't have physical talent or 

1779
01:19:29,811 --> 01:19:31,950
whatever for whatever reason,
whether it's a,

1780
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,290
he,
his approach,

1781
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:35,540
his intensity,
whether it's,

1782
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:38,630
it's not as coaching.
So at Duke fucking Rufus,

1783
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:40,250
you know,
I mean,

1784
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,253
it has to do with cushman that he talks 
about Duke roufus hit and one of the 

1785
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,750
prefects.
He said,

1786
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:46,760
uh,
how do you see this fight?

1787
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:47,091
It's like,
oh,

1788
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:49,700
I really like a head kick to would love 
to see a head kick and like,

1789
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:51,470
I don't think that's going to happen.
Oh,

1790
01:19:51,471 --> 01:19:53,830
that's so crazy.
That is.

1791
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,280
So,
that's such a crazy thing to say.

1792
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:56,570
Um,
you know,

1793
01:19:56,571 --> 01:19:59,780
Duke's a beautiful person.
He's a great guy in every,

1794
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,470
every sense of the word.
He just says he's a great guy.

1795
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:05,210
He did his best.
You know,

1796
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,890
there's only so much you could do.
No,

1797
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:08,160
I mean,
I'm sure

1798
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,993
you would love working with Duke.
I'm sure he would love working with you 

1799
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:13,620
if you and duke work together.
I'm sure you guys would have a great old

1800
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:16,300
time because you're Joe fucking 
chilling.

1801
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,920
Right?
And he's Duke fucking relevance,

1802
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,260
you know,
let them know.

1803
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,630
But you know what I mean.
I mean,

1804
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:23,890
you have to have something to work with,
you know,

1805
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:24,724
I mean if duke just grabbed some dude 
from a gas station that has been 

1806
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:33,660
drinking beer and smoking cigarettes his
whole life and had him in a fight in six

1807
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:35,000
months,
how much can you,

1808
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,113
we expect.
But I would rather see that fight 

1809
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,860
against these other ones.
Right.

1810
01:20:39,861 --> 01:20:41,970
Let's find out how that one would go.
Well,

1811
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:43,570
a guy,
you can find it a gas station.

1812
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:47,270
What's interesting is they both.
Both guys fought micky gall first.

1813
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:49,520
Just weird.
Did you see his instagram?

1814
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,360
Mickey's?
Yeah,

1815
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:55,130
he did like his own pre-fight a analysis
of how it was going to go.

1816
01:20:55,131 --> 01:20:56,330
It was really good.
Yeah.

1817
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:58,490
Well,
um,

1818
01:20:59,010 --> 01:20:59,843
you know,
that was a disaster when I saw Mickey 

1819
01:21:01,911 --> 01:21:04,940
fight and then I saw that it was going 
to fight cm punk.

1820
01:21:04,941 --> 01:21:07,160
I was like,
who said Yes to this?

1821
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,053
Why the fuck would you say yes to this?
This is a hundred percent guaranteed 

1822
01:21:11,001 --> 01:21:13,100
brain damage.
There's no way you're going to beat him.

1823
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,770
There's not.
You don't have a goddamn chance in hell.

1824
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:16,843
You have no chance.
And I was saying that people get mad at 

1825
01:21:18,801 --> 01:21:20,240
me.
The CM punk fans get mad at me.

1826
01:21:20,241 --> 01:21:20,960
I'm like,
look,

1827
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,600
this is what I do.
My job is to analyze shit.

1828
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:24,800
I look.
I look at fighters,

1829
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:26,960
I look at it,
I understand what I'm talking about,

1830
01:21:26,961 --> 01:21:27,980
man.
This is like,

1831
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:31,670
I've got a pit bull and I'm going to put
them in a cage with a puppy.

1832
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,550
What do you think's gonna Happen?
The pit is going to kill the puppy.

1833
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:36,830
This is what?
This is how it works.

1834
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,113
This isn't like,
this isn't maybe that puppy going to 

1835
01:21:39,501 --> 01:21:40,520
grab him by the face.
No,

1836
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:41,080
no,
no,

1837
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:41,271
no,
no,

1838
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:42,320
no.
Listen to me.

1839
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:45,590
I'm telling you,
this is how bad this matchup is.

1840
01:21:45,591 --> 01:21:46,424
This is a,
this is a Brazilian jujitsu brown belt 

1841
01:21:48,891 --> 01:21:52,580
with a nasty back game.
Strong and fast.

1842
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,050
You look at,
uh,

1843
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:58,950
the matchup with the cm punk just had 
Mike Jackson Mckee beat my checks in and

1844
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:01,970
I'm like under a minute.
So much him took his back,

1845
01:22:01,971 --> 01:22:04,340
strangle him.
He's a bit out here training with me for

1846
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:05,174
like the three months now.
And the kids getting really good 

1847
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:08,600
striking is getting really,
really good.

1848
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:10,430
He's fucking talented men.
Really good.

1849
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:12,680
And he talks a lot of shit too that he's
good.

1850
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,960
Plus has got hilarious walkout music 
when it comes down to.

1851
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:19,610
Oh Mickey,
I to convince him since he got here,

1852
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:20,850
I called his phone and it's like,
you know,

1853
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:22,880
those people have this ring back songs 
and they're like,

1854
01:22:22,881 --> 01:22:24,210
fucking horrible.
Yeah.

1855
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,780
Elevator music.
And he answers and I'm like,

1856
01:22:26,781 --> 01:22:28,340
dude,
turn that fucking shit off.

1857
01:22:28,341 --> 01:22:30,740
You change it or at least have it be.
Hey Mickey,

1858
01:22:30,741 --> 01:22:34,490
you're so fine.
And what is his music on some trash?

1859
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:39,530
It's just elevator.
Doesn't like something awful.

1860
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:42,880
Fucking change it.
Mickey.

1861
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:47,960
That's when is he fighting again?
Uh,

1862
01:22:47,961 --> 01:22:49,750
I don't think it has anything booked 
yet.

1863
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,700
I think he's,
he's calling show Sean Shelby.

1864
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,220
So he's working with you with this 
tracking?

1865
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:55,303
Yep.
No know he's helped me with my ground 

1866
01:22:56,511 --> 01:22:57,344
game.
And who was he working with his ground 

1867
01:22:58,251 --> 01:22:59,640
game out here?
Uh,

1868
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:04,010
uh,
Jason Manly and a Bomba Fast Gonzales.

1869
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:06,190
Where's that out of a Bama

1870
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,250
trades of me.
And Jason Manly is a,

1871
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:10,660
the training that muscle farm.
That's cool.

1872
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:11,494
So where is he a?
Is He staying in Burbank out there as 

1873
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:14,104
you stay in there?
You,

1874
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:18,520
he's standing there.
Me and I'm a Eagle Rock.

1875
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:19,443
Nice.
She's actually roommates with Eve 

1876
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,071
Edwards.
No,

1877
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:21,904
Shit.
Yeah.

1878
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:23,130
Oh,
that's right.

1879
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:26,530
Here we got me.
I forget this little love eve.

1880
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,380
Genesis dude thing going.
Yeah man,

1881
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,130
he's great,
isn't he?

1882
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:31,900
He's a great dude.
Crazy great dude.

1883
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,790
He's a very good.
On the desk too,

1884
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,820
it's interesting to see like a former 
fighters on the desk,

1885
01:23:36,821 --> 01:23:39,340
like some dudes are lost and some dudes 
are smooth.

1886
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:41,980
Some humans are very good at it.
He's.

1887
01:23:41,981 --> 01:23:42,940
I think he's as great.
Right?

1888
01:23:42,941 --> 01:23:43,774
It's fairly.
I think he's one of my favorite ones to 

1889
01:23:45,341 --> 01:23:45,881
watch.
Yeah.

1890
01:23:45,881 --> 01:23:49,200
I tweeted about it like years ago when 
he first started doing.

1891
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:49,790
I'm like,
diet,

1892
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:51,040
really appreciate him doing it.

1893
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,920
You know,
I'm Mike Bisping is very good at it too.

1894
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:56,110
Although he's been him.
Colby got out.

1895
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:59,750
It was a little awkward.
They went after it after the uh,

1896
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:05,040
after the fight.
Bisbing can't not talk shit himself,

1897
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,070
which I kinda,
I kinda,

1898
01:24:06,071 --> 01:24:07,810
I really appreciate that about him 
actually.

1899
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,760
Well he's,
he's a dog man.

1900
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:12,850
His,
his competitive drive is pretty intense.

1901
01:24:12,851 --> 01:24:14,480
You know,
bisping is in my opinion,

1902
01:24:14,481 --> 01:24:15,314
like one of the best,
but he's like one of the best poster 

1903
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:18,034
boys for just hard work,
mental toughness and determination and 

1904
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,380
also being that like British due to 
that,

1905
01:24:23,381 --> 01:24:27,950
the bar that'll have a beard tell you to
go fuck herself and piss off.

1906
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:29,013
Well the.

1907
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:32,420
Yeah.
Yeah,

1908
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,080
that's good.
He's got problems with his other eye now

1909
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,590
to he.
Yeah.

1910
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:39,700
You got some sort of a detachment in his
other eye is good.

1911
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:42,940
I thought they were going to fix fix 
one.

1912
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:45,630
I thought it was going to get better or 
something.

1913
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:47,403
He's got some sort of oil in it that 
protects it before he retires and then 

1914
01:24:51,521 --> 01:24:53,950
when he retires he's going to get it 
operated on to fix it,

1915
01:24:53,951 --> 01:24:56,170
but now he has a new problem with his 
right eye.

1916
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,930
He was seeing some flash or something 
like that,

1917
01:24:58,931 --> 01:24:59,764
his right eye and he went to the doctor 
and found out it's kind of detachment 

1918
01:25:01,391 --> 01:25:03,550
there and he's like,
fuck this.

1919
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:04,413
I'm done.
Because he was going to have one more 

1920
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:07,000
fight and now he's like,
I'm done.

1921
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:08,320
He did it all,
man.

1922
01:25:08,321 --> 01:25:10,900
He won the ultimate fighter.
He won the title,

1923
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:13,220
you know,
and,

1924
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,980
and now he's a good analyst to the desk 
because she thing go on his podcast.

1925
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,950
I think you're great too.
He's doing good.

1926
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,040
That is a nice thing to write some 
movies.

1927
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:25,270
Yeah.
He's always got something going on.

1928
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:26,373
Um,
it's nice that guys do have those other 

1929
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:30,190
options too.
Like podcasts and different things.

1930
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:31,600
Now there's,
there's ways out,

1931
01:25:31,601 --> 01:25:32,434
you know,
especially looking at like what jobs 

1932
01:25:33,881 --> 01:25:34,714
done.
Sharp has taken it to a whole nother 

1933
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:36,761
level.
I mean,

1934
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:37,594
he's as far as guys being able to get 
out of out of the fight game and then 

1935
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:41,823
make a living as a podcast.
He's fucking doing stand up now and 

1936
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,870
headlining clubs and shit and traveling 
all over the country.

1937
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:48,550
And He's good man.
He's fucking funny.

1938
01:25:48,551 --> 01:25:51,070
He's a funny dude.
It's hilarious.

1939
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:51,963
You know,
it's just nice that fighters have 

1940
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,330
options because,
you know,

1941
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,810
seeing the guy stick around when he 
shouldn't be doing it anymore.

1942
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:00,520
It's one of the hardest things for sure.

1943
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:03,160
And then they'll be like all the nfl 
guys or any pro sport.

1944
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,003
Most of these guys are broke by the end 
with him like four years of when they 

1945
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:08,150
finish.
And uh,

1946
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:10,100
yeah,
there's not a whole lot of other options

1947
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:12,500
for a lot of the guys.
So I think it's good.

1948
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:15,260
It's nice that we have other options for
sure.

1949
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:18,100
So would you sign it?
You showed everybody the way here,

1950
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:19,280
Joe.
There's a way,

1951
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,020
you know,
there's a way.

1952
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:24,350
There's ways now,
especially with the Internet man,

1953
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:26,720
there's just crazy ways.
I mean,

1954
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:29,270
how much money think mighty mouse makes 
on his twitch stream,

1955
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,433
let's say a decent amount.
I don't know how much this is like the 

1956
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:37,730
video game dudes twitch stream and 
they're not even like the best gamers in

1957
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:38,564
the world and they make thousands and 
thousands of pages on there all the 

1958
01:26:41,601 --> 01:26:42,434
time.
Would you say is planning something 

1959
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:43,791
right now?
Sugar.

1960
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:47,540
Sean's in it too bad.
Not that we're going to watch it,

1961
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:49,880
but he had song rampage does that too?
I think so.

1962
01:26:49,881 --> 01:26:50,780
Yeah.
He's a big Gamer.

1963
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,610
He's always talking about.
Is he still active?

1964
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:53,780
Is he still gonna fight again?

1965
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,510
Yeah.
I was trying to get a fight with him not

1966
01:26:55,511 --> 01:26:58,330
too long ago and uh,
I'm not sure what.

1967
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:00,730
Well he's like 290 pounds right now,

1968
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,620
but I feel like at half six figure that 
for that size I could do that.

1969
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,770
Could do that.
That could be read pitch.

1970
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:09,970
I don't know if I'd go for like Brock 
Lesnar.

1971
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:11,213
Well,
the rates lower cut a heavyweight we're 

1972
01:27:12,241 --> 01:27:15,240
talking about because he doesn't,
he doesn't try to take it down,

1973
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:16,123
right.
Most likely is going to try to stand 

1974
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:17,814
with you.
Do you have a set schedule for you 

1975
01:27:21,871 --> 01:27:22,860
return to mma?

1976
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:23,983
Uh,
I'm hopefully getting at something 

1977
01:27:26,101 --> 01:27:27,420
around September,
August,

1978
01:27:27,421 --> 01:27:28,920
late August,
early September,

1979
01:27:28,921 --> 01:27:29,430
I think.

1980
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:32,760
And you just decided that we're 
kickboxing is right now.

1981
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:34,350
Just doesn't have enough juice.

1982
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:35,640
Uh,
yeah,

1983
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:36,270
I,
uh,

1984
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:37,103
you know,
I want to keep progressing financially 

1985
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:40,990
and uh,
you know,

1986
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:41,801
uh,
like I said,

1987
01:27:41,801 --> 01:27:46,210
money motivates me a lot and uh,
if I reached the ceiling of the sport so

1988
01:27:46,211 --> 01:27:48,040
to speak,
and there's,

1989
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:49,870
Oh,
I'm amazed right here,

1990
01:27:49,871 --> 01:27:52,480
right next door and uh,
yeah,

1991
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:54,480
that makes sense.

1992
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,313
Yeah.
No,

1993
01:27:58,530 --> 01:27:59,211
yeah,
I mean,

1994
01:27:59,211 --> 01:28:00,740
how many more years you think you're 
going to do it?

1995
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,080
A four,
five,

1996
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,093
four,
five.

1997
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:08,460
I want to make big fights as much money 
as I can.

1998
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:13,080
Um,
and set up for life after fighting.

1999
01:28:13,081 --> 01:28:13,681
I think,
you know,

2000
01:28:13,681 --> 01:28:14,760
you can't just quit,
right?

2001
01:28:14,761 --> 01:28:15,594
You gotta find ways to market yourself 
to the highest level to get as much 

2002
01:28:18,901 --> 01:28:19,734
attention as possible.
So the irrelevant in the space that you 

2003
01:28:21,961 --> 01:28:25,530
pass and I just don't think they 
kickboxing is going to get me there.

2004
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:27,500
Yeah,
man,

2005
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:29,240
it's a bummer.
But I think you're right.

2006
01:28:29,241 --> 01:28:32,000
I think it's a smart if you're just 
dealing strictly financially.

2007
01:28:32,001 --> 01:28:34,670
I think it's a very smart move.
It's very unfortunate.

2008
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,880
I really wish there was a solution.
I do not know what it would be though.

2009
01:28:37,881 --> 01:28:39,920
I mean everybody's tried.
Spike TV tried,

2010
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:43,220
they tried the paramount network.
They tried with glory.

2011
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:44,110
No

2012
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,410
one thing it also with pellets or you 
know,

2013
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:49,270
maybe I'll come back,
maybe there's a big fight,

2014
01:28:49,271 --> 01:28:50,104
you know,
maybe Musashi's like you don't want to 

2015
01:28:51,581 --> 01:28:54,280
think I want the bills were kickboxing,
title to be

2016
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:55,500
right.
Yeah,

2017
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,490
let's do it.
So yeah.

2018
01:28:57,730 --> 01:28:59,520
Um,
but I would fight if they let me,

2019
01:28:59,521 --> 01:29:02,130
I would fight fucking kickboxing first,
win

2020
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,560
that fight and then come back out the 
same night and fight mma.

2021
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:08,340
Leo.
I brought it up.

2022
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,653
I brought it up to coker at a meeting 
not too long ago where they say they 

2023
01:29:13,021 --> 01:29:13,854
just kinda looked at me like fucking 
crazy horse the same way they looked at 

2024
01:29:17,761 --> 01:29:20,010
me when I said I wanted to fight rampage
of vandelay.

2025
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:25,110
Well his deal is he back like,
what's going on with vandelay?

2026
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:26,003
I don't know.
I just saw it as an opportunity when 

2027
01:29:28,661 --> 01:29:30,070
Chell beat him,
you know,

2028
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,400
his complaint was that,
you know,

2029
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:33,140
he just took her panel,
laid on top of them,

2030
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,010
which has been kind of my complaint for 
a while.

2031
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:37,580
So I figured,
but they don't want that fight.

2032
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:40,163
Why don't they want their friends when 
they get barely already had his face 

2033
01:29:42,751 --> 01:29:45,120
surgery.
Doesn't want to have it done twice.

2034
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:49,800
Rampage is my buddy when he just.
He just doesn't want that.

2035
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,440
He said he wants an easy fight like 
vandelay so.

2036
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:55,390
Well there's a lot of history between 
those two guys to.

2037
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:56,730
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2038
01:29:56,790 --> 01:29:59,100
You'd want to fight for him?
Yeah.

2039
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:00,563
He was A.
Vanderbilt was an interesting story to 

2040
01:30:01,831 --> 01:30:02,664
write when he was fighting over in pride
and then he came over to the UFC just 

2041
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,570
completely different human being.
Yeah.

2042
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:08,533
You know,
just in the rampage fights when rampage 

2043
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:11,994
brought them over in prod and that also 
a lot of miles on them to get to think 

2044
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,380
of both things.
No.

2045
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:21,210
Yeah,
she's got me thinking about felony,

2046
01:30:21,211 --> 01:30:22,044
talking about,
uh,

2047
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,230
you know,
fighting and whatnot

2048
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:28,710
over the felony.
The known as the crazy horse.

2049
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:31,120
Crazy horse has now changed his name to 
felony ladies.

2050
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:31,983
Gentlemen.
No longer refer to him as crazy horse 

2051
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:39,020
you ever see that fight backstage is 
nothing like swear swears up and down.

2052
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:41,690
Yeah.

2053
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:42,523
Beat them up.

2054
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:45,663
So the sleep,
he definitely just somebody else will 

2055
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:49,303
somebody else.
But didn't he say he says he killed 

2056
01:30:51,301 --> 01:30:52,134
vandelay city sucker punched him after 
he got choked out on the video that you 

2057
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:58,050
see.
He fought later on that night and won by

2058
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:01,360
knockout I think after being choked 
unconscious in the back.

2059
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:05,550
And he said he knocked out vandelay.
Oh yeah.

2060
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:08,120
Yes and no.
No,

2061
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,090
no.
It happened before.

2062
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:13,610
He fought in the locker room and he went
out and won and then he,

2063
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,560
he says he knocked out vandelay,
punched him and knocked him out.

2064
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:19,650
Vandelay went out and won a decision.
So vandelay,

2065
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:23,490
if he's telling the truth,
he killed vandelay earlier that night.

2066
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,350
Yes,
exactly.

2067
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:29,383
Here's the fight.
This is vandelay when you know that 

2068
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:36,740
doesn't even look like the same person I
know is the same person.

2069
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:38,803
Yeah.

2070
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:44,590
Like the Mario brothers muscles.
He tacked this dude and he got caught in

2071
01:31:47,811 --> 01:31:52,811
a triangle.
Very danger.

2072
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:58,940
Danger.
That's it.

2073
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,860
I forget who it was that did this to 
him,

2074
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:06,280
but it was one across and Gracie's black
belts.

2075
01:32:15,170 --> 01:32:17,560
Okay.

2076
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:21,060
How big is.
How big is a felon now?

2077
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:23,410
You got it?
Fifty five pounds maybe.

2078
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:25,090
Probably.
Yeah.

2079
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:26,080
He's out cold here,

2080
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,553
right?

2081
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,190
Yeah.
Cold.

2082
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:41,710
Oh,
they're very nice to him.

2083
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,420
His eyes opened up.
He's like,

2084
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:45,290
what?
I think like,

2085
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:46,880
uh,
you did A.

2086
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,070
I saw a clip the other day.
The guys asked you,

2087
01:32:49,071 --> 01:32:51,650
uh,
what's the practical use of Jujitsu?

2088
01:32:51,651 --> 01:32:52,300
And you're like,
well,

2089
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:53,600
I'm a street.
If we got in a fight,

2090
01:32:53,601 --> 01:32:55,490
I would kill you.
That's like,

2091
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,393
I think people don't realize that like 
without the ref to like stop the fight 

2092
01:32:58,821 --> 01:33:01,070
or even those guys like they stopped 
him.

2093
01:33:01,071 --> 01:33:01,541
Like,
okay,

2094
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:03,050
I let him go.
He's already unconsciously.

2095
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:05,270
That would kill you if you would be 
dead.

2096
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:06,903
You were dead dead if that guy doesn't 
want to let go of you until your brain 

2097
01:33:10,011 --> 01:33:12,750
doesn't work anymore.
And that's a wrap and that's that.

2098
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:17,000
That's real shit.
That's my friend Eric.

2099
01:33:17,001 --> 01:33:19,160
Trying to come up with some excuse to 
not work out.

2100
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:21,680
That's why I said,
what's the practical use?

2101
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,290
Jujitsu.
We had the fight.

2102
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,850
I wouldn't kill.
You know the crazy horse fight.

2103
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,033
Two guys on the basketball court got a 
big fight and then he takes him down 

2104
01:33:31,611 --> 01:33:32,360
really,
really quick.

2105
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,740
He attacked a guy.
Oh yeah,

2106
01:33:33,741 --> 01:33:35,330
he fucked up sign.
Oh yeah.

2107
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,910
Oh he's.
He thinks he's a bad ass and he doesn't.

2108
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:39,380
How a fight.
Oh look at this.

2109
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,850
Oh,
I'll punch in the back of the head.

2110
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:41,410
Oh Shit.

2111
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:44,810
Ooh.
Look at this thing.

2112
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:47,350
And he's still trying to find him 
hilarious.

2113
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:52,210
He's taking that leg apart though right 
here.

2114
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:05,780
He's got them in the heel hook right 
here.

2115
01:34:05,781 --> 01:34:08,700
There's no play basketball again by the 
that's in that position.

2116
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:10,050
He's telling the truth though,
right?

2117
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:13,500
All he has to do is Yank that fucking 
thing up clockwise and that's a wrap.

2118
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,061
Pop,
pop,

2119
01:34:14,061 --> 01:34:14,894
pop.

2120
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,610
That horrible pain of getting.
He'll hooked and not tapping.

2121
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:24,400
Not The business,
especially that inside.

2122
01:34:24,401 --> 01:34:27,250
He'll hook that is so nasty when it goes
across the body.

2123
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,860
The amount of Torque on your knee.
This is like no way.

2124
01:34:29,861 --> 01:34:31,900
Unique and hang in there.
It just rips apart.

2125
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:36,180
I'm good on knee surgery.
Is that that Polaris?

2126
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:39,730
Well,
he does.

2127
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:40,563
He does outside in inside,
but the inside one is just the outside 

2128
01:34:43,601 --> 01:34:44,950
one.
You got a little bit more.

2129
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:46,830
There's a little more movement like 
this.

2130
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:47,883
I mean you got to tap,
but the problem is when someone's got 

2131
01:34:50,171 --> 01:34:52,870
you in this way across the body and then
they go like that,

2132
01:34:52,871 --> 01:34:53,704
man,
you got about an inch or two above it 

2133
01:34:55,331 --> 01:34:58,100
and it's just.
It's horrible

2134
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,480
too.
It sounds terrible.

2135
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:00,553
You could hear a duck everything pulling
apart and snapping off the bone and 

2136
01:35:04,311 --> 01:35:07,160
people screaming.
Paul Harris would not let go either.

2137
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:09,530
That was his thing.
He would just hang on to heal hooks.

2138
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,870
It sounds so bad.
It sounds so bad.

2139
01:35:11,871 --> 01:35:15,600
I got to go with the fucking Komora.
There was,

2140
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:18,230
I'm not sure what the differences,
but uh,

2141
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,590
it sounds like at this,
in Americana,

2142
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:23,930
this is the Camorra I think it was this 
way,

2143
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:26,750
the,
it sounded like ripping a towel.

2144
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:28,183
Terry cloth towel.
If you pull it all apart and the fibers 

2145
01:35:29,621 --> 01:35:31,100
start popping.
That's what it sounded like.

2146
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:36,590
It's still here to my head.
So three tap.

2147
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:39,230
I mean,
after he's like,

2148
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:40,340
oh,
it's cool,

2149
01:35:40,341 --> 01:35:41,174
it's cool.
And I'm like,

2150
01:35:41,180 --> 01:35:43,760
that's fucking cool.
I didn't need to break your fucking arm.

2151
01:35:43,761 --> 01:35:45,890
You could have just tapped dickhead.
Yeah,

2152
01:35:45,891 --> 01:35:46,724
I saw.
I got to hear this shit in my head all 

2153
01:35:47,631 --> 01:35:49,400
night.
I saw a video of a street fight.

2154
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:53,530
There's another video where the dude 
gets a guy in an Alma Plata and he's,

2155
01:35:53,531 --> 01:35:54,740
he's,
he's pushes arm up.

2156
01:35:54,741 --> 01:35:56,420
You see the art guys arm.
Just give out.

2157
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:57,973
Oh,
the street fight I saw was like Mexico 

2158
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:04,010
or Brazil or some good groundwork 
though.

2159
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:07,250
He's nice on Omoplata in a street fight.
It's always a plus.

2160
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,560
I mean there's a street fight.
Game is changing,

2161
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:13,563
you know,
dressed for dangerous super dangerous 

2162
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:21,510
kid who was like on the playground.
It was like flying like karate kid.

2163
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,253
Now they're going to be like rear naked 
choke and each other fucking little 

2164
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:27,824
kids.
Little kids grow up watching Bela torn 

2165
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:32,900
the EFC and kickboxing.
They know what a leg kick is.

2166
01:36:32,901 --> 01:36:33,734
Now they know all that shit.
They know how to grab the back of the 

2167
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:36,560
head.
Other kids are yelling,

2168
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:39,200
ne need.
They know what to do now.

2169
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,093
Oh,
is this it?

2170
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:41,323
Yeah,
this is.

2171
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:42,530
Yeah,
this is awful.

2172
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,780
The dude gets.
He brings that Lego,

2173
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:45,643
that guy.
The guy on the top has no understanding 

2174
01:36:47,841 --> 01:36:48,590
of what to do with is.
Oh,

2175
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:50,030
here it is.
Oh Sir.

2176
01:36:50,031 --> 01:36:51,560
I'm just gonna.
Here comes here.

2177
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:52,394
Comes here.
Comes,

2178
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:57,430
watch this.
Get ready and it comes to noise.

2179
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:04,190
Awful man sound.
Oh,

2180
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:09,700
there it is.
Look at it.

2181
01:37:09,771 --> 01:37:12,860
Just laying fucked up backwards on his 
arm.

2182
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,200
Oh,
don't move it.

2183
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:16,063
Jesus Christ.
He's just laying there like he must've 

2184
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:21,440
been drunk too because he's like,
he didn't even pull his arm out.

2185
01:37:21,441 --> 01:37:25,490
He had no idea what he was doing.
Listen.

2186
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:27,120
Yeah.
Do you guys see that?

2187
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:29,390
You don't know your smoke,
Daniel?

2188
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:30,950
Is that what that is?
Cigarettes there.

2189
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:33,520
These are empty.
It was something else in here.

2190
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:36,260
Come on man.
Do you smoke cigarettes?

2191
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:37,313
Yes.
Yes I do.

2192
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:40,340
How often you smoke?
Soon as I get out of here.

2193
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:42,350
As soon as you get out of here.
How many?

2194
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:45,820
How many a day to go?
Uh,

2195
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,860
I don't know.
Probably about half a back.

2196
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,570
Jesus hanging out with this motherfucker
is.

2197
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:54,170
Okay.
This is part of.

2198
01:37:54,171 --> 01:37:55,590
You just got to get it.
Got a ticket.

2199
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,453
Just go ahead and get a job.
Just looking out for your best 

2200
01:37:58,801 --> 01:37:59,634
interests,
man.

2201
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:03,030
Have you ever tried to switch to vape or
anything like that?

2202
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:04,310
Uh,
I've done man.

2203
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,490
Listen,
I've done it all.

2204
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:07,570
Vape.
I've chewed,

2205
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:11,550
have tried to stop everything.
I just,

2206
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:15,410
I'm a individual or just

2207
01:38:15,610 --> 01:38:20,610
you're an individual individually.
Were you smoking when you were the.

2208
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:24,620
You are the current war.
Military Champ holds.

2209
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:26,830
I was like,
damn,

2210
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:27,963
that's so crazy.

2211
01:38:27,980 --> 01:38:28,813
We've spoken to.
I was like chewing in smoking since I 

2212
01:38:30,811 --> 01:38:32,820
was 12.
13

2213
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:35,150
does a lot of Thai fighters to smoke,
right?

2214
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,610
Scott Boskey doesn't need Disney.
Always smoke.

2215
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:39,780
Does that.
Makes a lot of metal,

2216
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,230
a lot of fires.
I don't want to put it out there like,

2217
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:44,430
but billy Bob last but a lot of fighters
that,

2218
01:38:44,431 --> 01:38:46,090
you know,
at high level in the UFC,

2219
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:46,943
smoke cigarettes.

2220
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:50,440
I used to try to hide it like they used 
to be one thing.

2221
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,730
I'm trying to hide it and then you 
always say,

2222
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:57,820
oh I can't believe your athlete.
You're smoking until I leave me the fuck

2223
01:38:57,821 --> 01:38:58,200
alone.

2224
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,930
I hear you talk and they go,
man,

2225
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:05,590
you an 80 year old blue center fuck's 
going on with your voice man cigarettes.

2226
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:11,450
They give you that hard living voice.

2227
01:39:14,110 --> 01:39:16,450
There's definitely a benefit and a level
two,

2228
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:18,990
like not hiding who you are.
And again I was just talking to somebody

2229
01:39:18,991 --> 01:39:21,780
about that today.
Like it is nice to that I could say that

2230
01:39:21,781 --> 01:39:25,530
I smoke weed and be myself and whatever.

2231
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:28,110
Shit.
Especially we'd know,

2232
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:29,760
you know,
I mean there's a lot of people that have

2233
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:31,860
some dumb ideas about what we does to 
you,

2234
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:32,843
you know,
and it's nice that guys like you were 

2235
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:35,244
out about it so he could realize like no
real smart guys like you were out there 

2236
01:39:38,701 --> 01:39:40,710
to pro athletes,
but like I'm a stoner,

2237
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:42,270
I'm a comedian.
Like makes sense.

2238
01:39:42,271 --> 01:39:46,790
But pro athletes like seeing like that,
a guy like who takes care of his body,

2239
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:48,120
smoke Swedes,
not,

2240
01:39:48,121 --> 01:39:49,440
it's not ruined in his car.
He was like.

2241
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:51,690
The other thing is that people want to 
think that it's lazy.

2242
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:52,633
Yeah.
That's what bothers me most about the 

2243
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:57,040
misconception of it as like that you're 
not a productive person,

2244
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:59,430
that you just sit around the house and 
that someday,

2245
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,220
like on Sunday I sit around the house 
high motherfucker Shit.

2246
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:05,000
But every other day I'm working my ass 
off constantly

2247
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:07,760
stays off for sure.
For sure.

2248
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:11,420
There's a photo in the green room from 
Ryan Loco.

2249
01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:14,720
Shout out to Ryan.
You a smoking cigarettes.

2250
01:40:14,721 --> 01:40:16,640
It is that law firm.
Last man standing.

2251
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,810
It's in between fights.
Uh,

2252
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,280
yeah.
I think it will.

2253
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,020
I don't know if it was last man standing
or if it was,

2254
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:26,840
it was a locker room,
one of the glory fights.

2255
01:40:26,841 --> 01:40:28,550
I don't know if it was between flights 
or not.

2256
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:29,533
Yeah,
there it is.

2257
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:34,270
That's up in the green room right now.
Officers.

2258
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:38,450
It was like a Jimmy Hendrix and Elvis.
Right?

2259
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,650
With the same.

2260
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,440
Yeah.
Yeah,

2261
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,920
yeah.
I got a gang of new ones coming now.

2262
01:40:43,921 --> 01:40:46,950
I got um,
Steven Tyler when he was a teenager,

2263
01:40:46,951 --> 01:40:48,720
got arrested for weed.
I got him.

2264
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:52,260
I got conor Mcgregor.
Conor Mcgregor Mug shot.

2265
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,970
I got the real Jimi Hendrix Mugshot,
not the,

2266
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
not the photo that we had on before,
which was like his real mug shot label,

2267
01:41:00,071 --> 01:41:03,100
but the photo was from one of them,
Jimmy Hendrix experience photos.

2268
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,810
We got the real mugshot photo.
Now.

2269
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:06,763
Jimi Hendrix hasn't been heroin and I'm 
trying to go to Toronto with that 

2270
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:13,600
heroin.
Here it is right there.

2271
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:15,163
Yeah.
When someone's tried to tell me Jimi 

2272
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:17,733
Hendrix didn't do heroin.
Well tell that to the Toronto Police 

2273
01:41:20,290 --> 01:41:21,760
Department when they fuck it.
Arrested him for it.

2274
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:26,850
There's a picture of me on instagram.
I saw was a Bruno Mars,

2275
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:32,590
fucking a justin beaver to other Brits 
celebrities,

2276
01:41:33,501 --> 01:41:34,334
wherever they were all smiling in their 
mugshot and it was like when you know 

2277
01:41:36,531 --> 01:41:37,060
you have

2278
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:41,740
money,
they just got Vince Vaughn.

2279
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:43,331
Yeah.
Yeah.

2280
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:45,950
They just busted him.
Dui Sucks.

2281
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,750
Good chicken and drive is a good.
I got both.

2282
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:53,790
I got a Dui when I was 20,
22 on shrooms,

2283
01:41:55,030 --> 01:42:00,030
shrooms and drug tested you patent.
They didn't give me for this rooms.

2284
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:02,303
They fucking help for the deal.
I would think that maybe the shrooms 

2285
01:42:04,151 --> 01:42:06,410
would help balance out the booze problem

2286
01:42:07,230 --> 01:42:08,063
was.
I kept arguing with the guy and he was 

2287
01:42:08,861 --> 01:42:11,550
like trying to get me to blow on the 
street and I'm like Oh yeah,

2288
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:14,043
nothing happening like pretending to 
blow and then they take me downtown and 

2289
01:42:16,391 --> 01:42:17,224
I was like in and out of like falling 
asleep and they kept like waking up and 

2290
01:42:20,141 --> 01:42:23,060
they had like the Dui,
a breathalyzer machine.

2291
01:42:23,061 --> 01:42:24,820
It looks like kind of like this or 
whatever.

2292
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:25,833
The actual big machine.
And I remember like arguing with him 

2293
01:42:28,931 --> 01:42:29,840
like,
what if it was,

2294
01:42:29,841 --> 01:42:31,050
if I don't blow and he's like,
the,

2295
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:33,350
you get suspended for six months.
And I'm like,

2296
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:36,300
what if I blow and it's a d in a bad as 
a unit.

2297
01:42:36,301 --> 01:42:37,630
He was suspended for a year and I'm 
like.

2298
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:38,813
And then I asked them that back and 
forth like 20 times I kept falling 

2299
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:41,030
asleep.

2300
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:43,970
I ended up,
I ended up not blowing.

2301
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:49,280
It would make you want to not blow like 
what are you?

2302
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:51,280
Fucking stupid.
So by the time,

2303
01:42:51,281 --> 01:42:51,450
yeah,

2304
01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:55,210
go to jail or you go to court anyway,
your suspensions almost up.

2305
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:56,044
So I ended up,
I ended up getting off on that because 

2306
01:42:57,311 --> 01:42:58,144
it was a uh,
they pulled me over for turning the 

2307
01:43:00,641 --> 01:43:03,580
wrong way on a one way street.
But I just showed that I wasn't,

2308
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,320
I didn't do any field stuff

2309
01:43:05,490 --> 01:43:06,323
already.
Tests,

2310
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,400
I'm not saying you shouldn't drink and 
drive,

2311
01:43:08,401 --> 01:43:09,620
I'm not,
I'm trying to pick that.

2312
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:10,640
But if you do drink,
uh,

2313
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:11,660
during,
uh,

2314
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,860
yeah,
I didn't do the field sobriety tests.

2315
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,140
So they didn't have any probable cause 
that it was actually drunk.

2316
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:18,480
And when he didn't blow and uh,
they said,

2317
01:43:18,481 --> 01:43:19,314
well,
he was driving the wrong way in one way 

2318
01:43:19,801 --> 01:43:20,431
street.
And I was like,

2319
01:43:20,431 --> 01:43:24,440
I've never been to that area before.
So side note technique,

2320
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:28,020
don't blow.
Yeah.

2321
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:29,850
Hmm.
Never had a dui.

2322
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:32,400
Good for you know,
driving a fucking motorcycle,

2323
01:43:32,401 --> 01:43:33,234
man.
You better be silver will punch you 

2324
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:36,713
smoking cigarettes,
not paying attention what you're doing 

2325
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:41,590
with Uber and lyft and all this shit.
Now it's Kinda,

2326
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:43,800
it's pretty responsible to get a fucking
Dui.

2327
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:47,720
I bet it's dropped down significantly 
because of uber and lyft are really bad.

2328
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:49,440
It has for sure.
I think so.

2329
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:51,440
Listen Boys,
let's wrap this bitch up.

2330
01:43:51,441 --> 01:43:53,840
Thanks for bringing me all this stuff,

2331
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:56,960
