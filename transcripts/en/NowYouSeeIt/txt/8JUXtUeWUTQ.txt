Speaker 1:          00:00          Let me give you an image that's a cliche, but it's an image. John Wayne. Oh God. Couldn't we start with someone easier? Let me ask you a question. Has John Wayne ever been at a loss of words? Seriously, go watch your favorite John Wayne Classic and pay attention to how he speaks over his 40 year career regardless of his age, character, or mood. He almost always talks, but the same. Iconic masculine confidence and control. He always has the right thing to say in as few words as possible. Envelope. That'll be the day even when he's angry, he's not really angry. He never loses his cool. He never stammered screams or even improvises. Lost my temper in 40 years, but pilgrim, you caused a lot of trouble this morning. Might've got somebody killed somebody out a belt, chewing them out. Even at his worst. He doesn't lose that cool John Wayne presence, and there's actually something amazing about that ability, and I'm not saying this makes him a bad actor. Actually, many studio Hollywood actors had a limited vocal range. Whether Humphrey Bogart was a private investigator. Actually, Jack, if he didn't eat a nightclub owner where I'm going, you can follow what I've got to do. You can be any product or even an Irishman. I would hoping that maybe in the state of mind, he always had his trademark voice. It explains why some actors at that time are so easy to imitate it. You got any girlfriends at the same problem bringing them over and John Wayne is no exception.

Speaker 1:          01:24          The John Wayne still seems to stand out. His complete control. His whole persona has an almost mythic quality to it, so you're a men's only good for one node at a time. It's as if he's created a certain idea for masculine authority through his voice. There's an idea of talking like John Wayne, but post-classical method acting ushered in a wave of chameleon. Actors like Marlin Brando, Robert De Niro, and Meryl Streep, actors who morphed to their voices and disappeared into their roles. Any attempt at imitating Daniel Day, Lewis would probably result in simply imitating one of his characters, not the actual actor, because he does them all so differently. The use of complex voice acting not only created more immersive performances, but actors and directors now use voice in more complicated ways to tell their story. It's not always about what a character says, but how and when they say it, voice shows the characters control of a scene or their lack of control.

Speaker 1:          02:14          I want to use voice acting as a means for analyzing one of the most complicated characters in film. Daniel, plainview in there will be blood and I think to understand Daniel plainview, you have to first understand talking like John Wayne. Get off your heart and head into the Solo. John Wayne's big break came in 1939 in stagecoach and his introduction starts his streak of vocal control right from the beginning. John Wayne has a mastery of voice after a long montage of stage coach ride and he's the one that can stop the entire narrative with a single command and notice what else is going on. In his introduction shot, he immediately establishes himself as a master of his own movement through his flashy gun turn, the epic pushing of the camera toward his face and the mythical quality of the background like he manifested out of the West. Here we see fearlessness and mastery and the whole film stops to accommodate him.

Speaker 1:          03:04          The remainder of the scene presents another interesting phenomenon. Invoice in 1939 editors. We're still tinkering with how to cut dialogue and the camera would stay on a character most or all the time they were talking except for John Wayne. In this scene, you'll notice he's the only character that talks while the camera focuses on other characters and they expect to see you riding shotgun on this run. Marshall, as he talks, it cuts to reactions or he talks away from the camera as he approaches the stage coach. Even in his first big movie, even as Ringo, the kid, and even right at his character introduction, his voice could control the movement all on its own. He has an almost directorial influence on the story. There's a distinct power to talking without being seen in the same way that a narrator of a story has a godlike quality to them.

Speaker 1:          03:45          If they talk, well, not interviewed, that means they're still controlling the scene even when they aren't there. In John Wayne's introductory scene, we see two methods of showing control, directing the narrative through voice and controlling the camera, and he's not the only one to control this wet, please. We actually also here Daniel plainview, before we see him speaking, I've traveled over half our state like John Wayne. He shows narrative control in his character introduction. He establishes he's the only one qualified to drill, and when people try to interrupt his narrative, he ignores them. What is your offer? We're wasting time. I do my own drilling. His authority does get challenged when the crowd uproars, but he simply leaves changing the narrative to what he wants. Refusing to not have total control.

Speaker 2:          04:35          No, no, no. There's no confusion. Doesn't take the leash

Speaker 1:          04:40          and controls the movement of the camera. It stops when he stops. It moves. When he moves after another voice of God transition, we see him get elise. How he wants shifting the conversation to be about family, to win them over. Another way to show control in a movie is through controlling the voices of others. This can be as simple as regulating when people talk or regulating what they're allowed to say,

Speaker 2:          05:05          man, we

Speaker 1:          05:08          associate what people say with what they're thinking, what they believe in, and what they want. If you control what someone can say, you control everything about them. Shame my name. In any scene, a character's voice can show control in these factors, how voice directs the narrative, how the voice controls the shot, and how characters control the voices of others. It's usually a combination of the three double you motherfucker. In reality, everybody wishes they had the control of voice like John Wayne. Even when people disagree with him, he still drives the narrative and it has complete mastery of the world around him. He may sometimes be a flawed hero, but the floor is never in his voice, so we always had some level of control. In Red River, he gets betrayed, but his voice makes it clear that he'll end up with what he wants. Every time you turn around and expect to see me one time, you'll turn around and I'll be there, but the problem with John Wayne's authority, it never gets questioned.

Speaker 1:          06:00          Even when he loses, he still talks in that confident air, never completely losing his mastery of the world of the West. What makes there will be blood so well written is how carefully each scene tests, power dynamics through voice and Daniel Plain fuse iconic presence does get challenged in inventive ways to the point where the film seems to question whether or not a John Wayne like vocal control is ever possible or even desired. Daniel plainview actually gets a pretty worthy opponent in the film. Eli Sunday is a gifted orator and he constantly questions playing views, vocal authority. Do you started to take a seemingly benign conversation? Plainview has with Eli Sunday. What appears to be Eli, just making a simple request is actually a carefully coated fight for vocal control. Eli starts with some innocent Chit Chat, which plain view doesn't engage in spirit seem high.

Speaker 1:          06:52          Then Eli chooses to see himself without being offered. Here we see Eli taking initiative, contrasting his brother's politeness in an earlier seed. Can I sit down please? The scene becomes about vocal control. When Eli asks to speak at the induction of the well, I will bless the. Well actually he doesn't ask. He says he will directing the speech as he wants it. Before you begin, you should introduce me. Of course, plainview correction, but Eli ignores his correction. You'll see me walk up. He even provides him a script and then you could say the proud son of these hills who tended his father's flock, plainview bates, him letting him pick the time. Well, let's make it 4:00 then and then it cuts to the actual induction where Eli is supposed to speak, but plainview directs it his way, pulling up the little girl and performing his own script.

Speaker 1:          07:40          He does it all on his own. Ignoring Eli's request. The camera hovers on Eli as plainview blesses the well and his voice of God dominates the scene, and Eli, he even manipulated Eli's words and makes them his own number one name for the lovely ms dot every Sunday here by my side, a proud daughter of these hills and a simple sequence plain view gives up the win. Let's Eli's guard down and deans back control of directing the moment how he wanted controlling the camera and controlling Eli's words, but Eli shouldn't be underestimated as a character. He speaks very well and is the vocal leader of the town. It's two directors pitted against each other. One directs the congregation. The other directs the oil. The next focal showdown between the two comes in Eli's territory. When plain view has to get baptized. Notice Eli already starts in control. When we hear his voice, before we see him speak, I truly wish everyone could be saved. Don't chew. He directs when the congregation speaks. Of course, plainview resists, but Eli subjugates him. He has to respond to as directed by Eli. What do you want me to show you? Life forces him to say exactly what he wants and what he's insecure about. I have a bend in my child

Speaker 1:          08:50          and in a complete reversal, Eli speaks as the voice of God throughout. While we focus on plain, it's a total opposite to the last confrontation you like, gives him the lines and he has to recite them, forcing plainview to for the first time, lose his vocal control. The next time they see each other is at the end of the movie. Even though Eli asks for help in this scene, he still starts off in control. The camera follows him and he asserts himself by making them drinks. When plain view agrees to work with him, he says he'll do it on one condition. I'd like you to tell me that you are to have been false prophet because God is a superstition and now playing view is the director. Again. No,

Speaker 2:          09:38          put your glass down.

Speaker 1:          09:40          In theory, plainview has bested him, but it doesn't really feel like a John Wayne kind of local control. I did watch beach. It's a bastardized version because at the end, plain winds, but he's not in control. He spirals completely out of control. Towards the end, he phones from the mouth, stutter, screams, and grunts. He loses mastery of everything in this scene. Even his walk, when we think of John Wayne's grace, it's also in his walk. Plainview stumbles around incomplete, erratic, chaotic,

Speaker 3:          10:13          yes.

Speaker 1:          10:15          He doesn't have control at all. Another relationship that showcases his lack of vocal control is with his adopted son, hw at first do they work together as partners, but when he becomes deaf, they lose their ability to communicate and in short, plainview doesn't know what to do with him. He's no longer an asset to the company in plainview, sends him away years later, hw returns with his translator, and plainview tries to control him vocally by forcing him to speak, becoming threatened when he considers how a competitor you speak instead of your little dog wolf, full, full, full, full, full, full. So again, he gets vocal control, but at what cost? It's cruel and doesn't feel like mastery in a lot of what he says. Daniel plainview may have the vocal influence, but he's a con man. In one of his monologues, he elegantly talks about the schools, he'll build the wheat, he'll grow and the importance of family values, but the visual show only men and no school's irrigation or farmland, just people preparing the drilling.

Speaker 1:          11:07          His Voice of God authority tricks us even though plain view constantly talks about bringing wealth to the town, there are actually very few signs of him improving the town. There's a sort of false sense of control when he talks. He vocally controls Eli, but not himself. He can't vocally control his son because he lost his hearing, but he tries anyway and he can't control the work he does. He has to lie about the benefits of his drilling and much of the dangers of worker out of his control. We expect playing views monologue to be true because narrators are supposed to guide the story. One John Wayne movie that follows these principles of narration is Red River, which has a monologue that's almost identical to plain views. If you replace oil drilling with cattle,

Speaker 4:          11:43          good hungry people to make them strong, make them grow. The key

Speaker 1:          11:49          difference though is that John Wayne's hypermasculine advertisement of his cattle business is actually taken seriously, whereas there will be blood codes plain view as a fraud. John Wayne's movie seemed to have some unrealistic ideals for heroes, whereas there will be blood shows, the more sinister sides of being in control, and I know I said John Wayne always has vocal control, but even he loses it in some of his later movies that says this chaotic shooting of Buffalo sheds light on the darker side to his supposedly mastery. Regardless, many of his earlier films create an idea of a hypermasculine male with complete control of what they say and how they say it. There's a certain fantasy to sounding like John Wayne Chandler and the easy way you'll learn the hard way, but movies like there will be blood bring into question the validity of such a one dimensional kind of control.

Speaker 1:          12:35          Having such vocal authority actually doesn't end well. If someone really had as mainly a dominion over their world, they wouldn't end up like a cool suave John Wayne riding into the sunset. They'd probably become the erratic, miserable and lonely Daniel plainview because at the end of the day, the old western heroes aren't real. That level of mastery is not only unrealistic but also dangerous. Think about it. Why couldn't Daniel, plainview have let Eli Sunday give that speech? What difference does it make if he gave his little blessing? Daniel plainview explains it himself. I have a competition, no one else to succeed, and maybe that hypermasculine unfaltering thinking is no way to live and no fantasy to strive towards. Never Apologize, Mr. to sign of weakness. When studying voice John Wayne makes for a great place to start. His way of speaking is hyperbolic and he represents the ability to vocally master a scene.

Speaker 1:          13:24          His purest vocal power, however, feels unrealistic in dangerous when studying more vocally complicated characters. One can use John Wayne's power as a starting point and see how a character succeeds in the John Wayne level of vocal control and how they fail. Do they control the camera? Do they control the narrative and do they control others, and also at what cost? Thanks for watching. This video is brought to you by skillshare.
