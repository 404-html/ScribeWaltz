Speaker 1:          00:00          In a few moments, he will have written the funniest joke in the world and as a consequence he will die laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Ah Ha.

Speaker 3:          00:33          I think it's wrong to say either style of comedy is better. I find it kind of annoying when people say British comedy is always smarter, or whittier. Have you seen arrested development or 21 jump street or even a spongebob episode?

Speaker 1:          00:44          Be careful, Patrick. Being an artist is a heavy responsibility. Each work of art is like a child and must be treated as such. It was just going to draw a cartoon. Okay. Why didn't you say so?

Speaker 3:          00:56          This definitely very smart writing on both sides of the Atlantic, but that doesn't answer the question. What makes them different? After weeks of research? My answer is still. I don't know, but let's give it a shot.

Speaker 1:          01:06          No one could read it and live.

Speaker 2:          01:13          Oh

Speaker 4:          01:26          No,

Speaker 3:          01:32          no, I don't. I didn't change. I mean the difference,

Speaker 5:          01:35          you know, if we're talking about the big to Britain and America, sorry, rest of the world.

Speaker 3:          01:42          I think the first step is to take a British comedy and see how it's American adaptation changed. What's the difference between David, Brent and Michael Scott by season to the US office begins its movement away from the UK. Originally we even see a subtle cinematic change by brightening the lights in the office while originally just a way to differentiate it from the UK version. The added brightness seems to serve as a nice metaphor for the adaptation as a whole,

Speaker 5:          02:04          but the big differences, the Americans are more optimistic and uh, and last due to the fact that Americans are told they can become the next president of United States and British people to told it won't happen to you. And they carry that. I carry that with them.

Speaker 3:          02:24          There's no doubt that America lightened up the show. Michael Scott had his failures, but there's a hope to it. In one episode he wasn't invited to Jim's party, but shows up anyway, genuinely hurt and bitter. Wow. Who opened the morgue for this thing? He picks a duet song and no one will sing it with him. Reluctantly, Jim joints in giving Michael a big cheesy smile and an overall happy ending to the episode. But when David Brent performance, it's still funny, but at different kinds of funny, nobody pities him or cheers them on. They all just watched you. Been embarrassing. There's no happy ending and it's not very hopeful. Or look at how both characters wrap up their time on the shelf. Spoiler alert, Michael Scott clits to move with his fiance to call Rato and David Brent begs for his job back. I will try twice as hard. I really, well I not being complacent and I'll turn this place around if we just say that it's not definite now. And of course this doesn't include the Christmas special, which was a lot happier.

Speaker 5:          03:25          Put it this way. The American coming here like John Belushi or someone like that is do you know that scene in a animal house where the fellow playing folk music on a guitar and John Belushi picked up the guitar and destroys it and the cinema just smashes it. And then where goes his eyebrows up a camera and I want to say, God, he's so great with a British comedian would want to play the focusing.

Speaker 3:          03:54          We want to play the failure. Get an engine started near the five by five, so maybe the difference is the optimistic American dream versus the dark British reality. At least that's what many people think about it. Europe is just basically a gene pool of people whose answers to said, oh, don't. I don't think I can risk their are risk of America is a gene pool of people say, well, that's risky, but I think that answer is too easy because you have to ignore the fact that Americans love the failures like Sean from Shaun of the dead and plenty of modern American sitcoms feature losers who never get their redemption. Frankly, I think it's an outdated theory. The past television era of married with children and Seinfeld and friends always featured the classic wise guy who always had the funny one liner for every moment to say, you know how to take the reservation. You just don't know how to hold it.

Speaker 3:          04:53          I think in the last 10 years, we're starting to see a self awareness of this American dream optimism style of comedy, and it's always sunny. There certainly is that feeling of hope in the characters. They think they can accomplished anything, but they always take it way too far by becoming violent, cruel, and hilariously backstabbing. It's almost a critique on American optimism in America. You're supposed to succeed, but at what cost? Completely gone. We're definitely gonna. Need a silencer gun? Find no guns, no guns up. Piano wire. Okay. Maybe we can use the panel. Why? Whatever it is. Be The guy to pull the trigger on this thing to mention. They always fail in face the consequences and it seems like not one single thing ever works out for Larry and curb your enthusiasm. I need to step out of the car please. Oh, come on.

Speaker 3:          05:35          Are you serious? Did episode of Louie ends with his date running into a helicopter to escape? It doesn't get more pathetic than that. So maybe some American comedy pokes fun at the hope and lighthearted nature of past sitcoms, or maybe American comedy is even shifting towards that British cynicism or maybe will always hold that American optimism in our hearts and even in the millennial generation where the American dream seems to do nothing but screw over. It'll always be ingrained in our culture and mindset to shrug it off and keep on trying. I'm not gonna take no for an answer because I just refuse to do that because I'm a winter and winter is we don't listen to words like like no or or don't or stop. Those words are just not in our vocabulary. I know this is a topic a lot of people get passionate about it, but I hope the comment section doesn't get too heated. At least I don't expect some kind of Spanish influence. Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition. Thanks for watching.

Speaker 6:          06:29          Just a bit of a break for just a little above that.
