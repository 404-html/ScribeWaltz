Speaker 1:          00:05          Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:08          Hollywood is a crazy world. Even crazier history. It's conniving, competitive and above all risky. I think to analyze movies, it's important to understand the context surrounding the production of the movie that's mentioned. It's also extremely interesting,

Speaker 2:          00:29          separate Hollywood's life into five distinct areas and see the thievery, desperation and failure in the industry. Starting with the first movies actually began far away from Hollywood, California. All movies before 1911, like the great train robbery in the first Frankenstein movies were filmed entirely on the east coast. In fact, the all too familiar term cliffhanger, most likely, originates from a series called the peril of poly in 1914, which was filmed in the former motion picture capital of the country, Fort Lee, New Jersey. The move to Hollywood happened for several reasons. It was cheaper. There was nice weather year round in California, provided a lot of distinct film locations. Nothing illustrates this better than paramount's description of the region. One reason hardly talked about, however, is the fact that these million dollar motion picture industries were fleeing to California so they could more easily break the law in 1891.

Speaker 2:          01:18          Thomas Edison patented the kinetic breath that technology used to film movies with his patent. He had a legal monopoly on the entire industry, even at control over movie projectors and film distributors. Edison aggressively sued many people using his adventure, going so far as to hiring thugs to smash cameras and rate independent studios. Filmmakers like Fox and paramount had to flee to the west coast so they could make their movies outside of Edison's influenced. So technically any movie made before 1917, not from Thomas Edison's production company was completely illegal. In 1917, in the United States, supreme court ruled his monopoly unlawful and against public interest. It's interesting how an industry founded on breaking the rules is now aggressively taking video essays down on Youtube despite their obvious fair use. But I digress.

Speaker 3:          02:02          Shall we try it right?

Speaker 2:          02:10          In the late 19 tents, America cinema transitioned into what we're familiar with, the booming Hollywood industry. The industry skyrocketed. A key innovation was the addition of dialogue in the late 19 twenties, which kept the industry afloat popular and innovative throughout the Great Depression. The era between 1917 in the late 19 forties is commonly referred to as studio system Hollywood. This is one production companies had decade long contracts with actors, directors, and writers. If you think the movie industry has monopolized now, know that five studios had control of absolutely everything in the 19 forties. Each major company had ownership of actors, directors, distribution, and even the movie theaters. Creators could only make it an industry if they stuck with one company for almost their entire careers by signing longterm and sometimes very unfair contracts out of this era came. Classics such as Gone With the wind, Snow White and the seven dwarves and the original Kong. One interesting aspect of this time period is that with so many movies being made and so many people flocking to the theater movie, companies could afford producing movies with medium sized budgets and scripts that weren't necessarily blockbuster material like citizen Kane and Casa Blanca. Nowadays, big companies pull most of their time and resources into several big budget movies a year, which is quite a shame.

Speaker 2:          03:24          The end of this era came from another battle with the courts. The Supreme Court ruled against paramount pictures saying ownership of the theaters and distribution of their films was a restriction of fair trade. This loss of control of distribution protected independent filmmakers, but meant to decline in the big industry. The next hit to movie popularity was television. Television hurt the industry. Since many people could stay at home to get their entertainment. Movie viewership plummeted in the 30, 60 percent of people went to the movie theaters at least once a week, but since the 19 sixties, the number has consistently stuck around only 10 percent to combat TV. Movies had to do what? TV couldn't do, big screens and big budgets. The Hollywood epic came into fruition. This is when movies got absolutely insane. Cinema scope lenses stretched the screen to almost twice the size of conventional film. There were movies like Cleopatra in 1963, which was the highest grossing film of the year and still didn't make back its budget. One of its huge hundred foot set pieces had to be built twice in two separate countries because the lead Elizabeth Taylor got sick

Speaker 2:          04:26          soon. The new Hollywood era broke through. Starting with Bonnie and Clyde, film school trained directors gained major influence in the industry as opposed to the producers of old Hollywood with low budget hits like jaws by Steven Spielberg, Star Wars by George Lucas and the Godfather, right? Francis Coppola. Producers gave more control to the filmmakers who in turn produced more provocative, diverse, and innovative movies. Personally, I find this atmosphere the most conducive to amazing filmmaking, but it came at a price with such freedom. Several films got way out of hand. Many directors took their power too far and movie budget skyrocketed out of control. Apocalypse now as an extreme example, there's a documentary on the production process of the movie called heart of darkness that I absolutely recommend I cannot come close to describing the mayhem of making that movie in such a short video. Hurricanes heart attacks a coup in the country they filmed.

Speaker 2:          05:11          It's crazy with apocalypse now in 1979 and the box office bombed heaven's gate in 1980 bankrupting a huge production company. Producers tighten their grip on filmmakers, which makes absolute sense, and what happened was in the seventies, all those filmmakers that dig a final cut, the budgets grew and grew and each one, one after the other had a financial disaster that almost tore down the studios. If you treat the movie industry like an actual business, it's definitely one of the riskiest one movie the public hates and it cripples the company. Millions are on the line and with continuously decreasing ticket sales companies had to adapt.

Speaker 2:          05:46          Now we're at the movie industry as we know it today with home video in the nineties and streaming services like Netflix. It's hardly worth it to drive all the way to a movie theater anymore, so companies make a handful of movies and promote them. Crazy superheros and fantasy movies dominate box office sales because those are the movies that are worth seeing on the big screen. Movies like pop star in the nice guys bond this year because they're light comedies and frankly I'm willing to wait for them to come to Netflix and a couple of months. What's amazing about this era is that it gets easier and easier to make feature length movies. I bought a used dslr camera tripod, memory card case, and editing software for less than $600. You don't need a huge movie of conglomerate to get your voice heard and your art noticed. Hollywood becomes more and more obsolete every day. So pick up your iphone, hit record, and say, action. Thanks for watching.
