Speaker 1:          00:09          The Simpsons has some of the most memorable gags, John, by the most memorable faces. Why don't you just go down to moles and talk to them? I bet he'd be willing to share some of his success. Was he you with the most memorable catch phrases?

Speaker 2:          00:26          Merge. I'm too upset to eat. Where do you go? Go to Moe's

Speaker 1:          00:30          with almost 30 years on television, the show remains a staple in American culture. So what's the secret that makes the show so legend?

Speaker 3:          00:36          No. Hey,

Speaker 1:          00:44          the secret is bounced.

Speaker 3:          00:45          We did

Speaker 1:          00:51          the simpsons had a comedic advantage over every other TV sitcom at the time because it was animated. If it could be drawn at the Simpson riders could make the joke, they could do just about anything. And that made for some hilarious gas.

Speaker 3:          01:10          No.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Well, what makes the simpsons so great is that the creators chose not to do just about anything,

Speaker 4:          01:16          does the hardcore rule, which is, you know, there's a lot of cartoons that, uh, where the impossible can happen, you know, and you think about a Wiley coyote cartoon where he can literally blow up and then come back and he's, he's black. And or he's flattened like an accordion and they were, it was always made very clear to me that this is a real world and it gets stretched. Obviously it gets stretched like crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Why purposefully hold back the cartoon jokes.

Speaker 5:          01:42          Right. Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:44          thank you. That's the secret behind the Simpson success. Certain point, it was like, this is not a cartoon. We're making a show that's not a cartoon. It happens to be a cartoon, but it's not a cartoon. Now we us young ones like the car goofy cartoon jokes and as silly as we could be, but the slightly a whiz in the older guys that know the approach it as a family and it was, as you say, I think it's genius. It's through the balance between cartoon gags and realistic portrayals of family life that the simpsons stands out. This show had the heart and realism of a family Sitcom, but the humor of a cartoon take homeless triple bypass surgery. The episode has hilarious gags that could only be done in an animation show. Mr. Barnes, I think he's dad said to him, to his widow,

Speaker 5:          02:28          eh,

Speaker 1:          02:31          no wait, he's alive. Oh good. Canceled the him dope, but the episode is just real enough to have genuinely emotional moments.

Speaker 2:          02:39          Don't worry. Marge America's health care system is second only to Japan, Canada, Sweden, Great Britain, well all of Europe. But you can thank your lucky stars. We don't live in Paraguay.

Speaker 3:          02:55          It's a perfect

Speaker 1:          02:56          balance between what's real and what's funny, what I tried to is my life's work

Speaker 6:          03:00          is to bridge the gap between the, the, the funny artifice that I saw on tv and what I knew was real. And I think that's partly the success of the simpsons.

Speaker 1:          03:08          The result is a show that's funny, but also has this connect with the characters. What makes homer such a memorable character is more than just when he's an idiot. The best moments in the simpsons are when he proves he isn't a caricature and he's actually a caring husband and loving father.

Speaker 6:          03:20          Oh my little making. They may never called you again.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Genki pants shows like family guy and south park are really good at providing social commentary and funny Gehrig's. But these shows don't have the heart and realism of the simpsons. The simpsons has the perfect balance. So whenever the simpsons has episodes on a specific topic like politics, marriage, or religion, the episodes typically have sincere lessons along with the edgy jokes and social commentary. The Simpsons discusses these topics with the perfect combination of humor and sincerity. Other animated cartoons focus more on telling the most jokes as possible rather than presenting a lesson and other family sitcoms oftentimes shovel corny message down your throat. The Simpsons is right in the middle. Take the episode. Bart sells his soul. The episode is not without its classic Simpson's humor.

Speaker 7:          04:04          What every religion says there's a soap bar. Why would they lie? What would they have to gain?

Speaker 1:          04:11          I don't care. Strobing but in between the jokes is a very interesting commentary on religion. Bart sells his soul to mail house for $5 and he finds himself empty without it. Unable to laugh at his pranks that you usually bring him joy. The episode actually has extremely powerful symbolism when Bart without his soul, his left stranded in an ocean unable to steer himself in the right direction. The episode has a great wide shot of bark protesting against spirituality in the barren church. With a heavenly light casting down on him from above and an Erie Echo in his voice.

Speaker 7:          04:41          Listen, you don't have a soul. I don't have a soul. There's no such thing as a soul.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Through his spiritual journey, he realizes the value of his soul. The episode conveys the message that one spirituality is not given by some church or by anyone else. It's created internally and the simpsons gives all this philosophical thought in a cartoon. I'm not saying that the simpsons is the funniest most of the matic or most realistic show, but what I am saying is that it is one of the few shows to bounce each of these three elements almost perfectly. Of course, the glaring unanswered question is what happens just about every Simpson's video on youtube has a top comment about the shows decline in quality and while people attribute many factors to the decline of the simpsons, like bad show runners, bland storylines, lacey writing or overused celebrity cameo appearances, I think the declines could possibly be summed up by saying the simpsons lost its balance. A slate magazine review of the show sums it up nicely. Episodes that once would have ended with homer and marge bicycling into the sunset now and with homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into marches neck. Thank you. Even in the new hd opening title sequence, we can see this subtle change in a show that's more cartoon then reality.

Speaker 3:          05:54          Wow.

Speaker 1:          06:01          The majority of television shows never maintain the balancing act, the simpsons accomplished. Although that's not necessarily a bad thing. Some shows are mostly to make you laugh or mostly to make you feel, and that doesn't make them bad shows, but what makes the Simpson so legendary is that they were able to have the laughter and the heart.

Speaker 3:          06:22          Yeah.
