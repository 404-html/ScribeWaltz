Speaker 1:          00:17          This is Jack Nugen and you're watching now you see it. Let's talk about how the film inglorious bastards is actually making fun of you. Couldn't. Tarantino is one of the most popular and consistently violent mainstream directors. His films focus on people committing violence. Criminals who killed contract killers, a black market gun runner who killed a former assassin, killing for revenge, a special Walmart two unit who's one goal is killing nets, more contract killers. And finally his newest film, the hateful eight coming out fall 2015 we'll start Samuel L. Jackson, as you guessed it, as contract killer. There's no doubt that Terentino's films, especially as higher budget ones display this sort of hyper violence with numerous and exaggerated deaths. Vanity Fair made a nice chart telling each duck in a tarantino film at how that person died. Showing just a file. It is, scopes can be Terentino's eighth till inglorious bastards.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Ace, no exception. The film needs 57 killed, not cleaning the 340 teeth deaths from the fire. And the fear at the end of the film is averages to one kristen to death. About every two and a half minutes. No, that's fine. Even with all this violence, inglourious basterds was a huge financial and critical success earning over $300 million in eight academy award nominations. The majority of Terentino's films did well in the box. In fact, of the nine films, charity Tino has directed eight have earned a triple their original budget. So what does it say about us, the viewers who pay to see and enjoy Terentino's films? Do we like violence? Is it wrong for us to enjoy movies where people die left and right turn to, you know, realize is this chuck position and you mean goes so far as to criticize us, the viewers for finding hyper violence in his, yeah, so entertaining.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Let's take a look at inglorious bastards and see how we critique an audience that glamorizes violence. Inglorious bastards is about a World War II special unit named the bastards whose mission is to blow up a cinema where dozens of high ranking Nazi soldiers in the lead watcher I propaganda film, including killer himself. The film shown at the cinema is about Friedrich solar and Nazi soldier who single handedly kills 215 brushings from a guard tower. The film titled Nation's Pride is extremely violent from what we see. The film consist of little more than shots of Friedrich's older shooting and killing thousands of Russian soldiers. The crowd of Nazis loves it. They cheer and laugh at each step of praising the film hill even tells the director of the film, this is your best film, yet we can't help but look at the audience watching nuisance priding find them a bit humorous and ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          02:29          They do this repetitive, tasteless and unnecessarily killing, entertaining and well made. To us. It appears to be nothing but a cheap spectacle movie. But think about it. It doesn't sound familiar. The Nazi viewers or audience members watching a film, but so are we watching inglorious bastards. It's a film with NFL. Don't we react with similar praise to quint Terentino's hyper violence. Psalms 20 where the audience members, I want to suggest to the Terentino's is trying to say us viewing inglorious bastards is similar to the Nazis viewing nation's pride. We cheer a death even when it's tasteless and glorifies unnecessary violence. We see just as much excessive violence inglorious bastards as the Nazis do when nations pri, while the bastards are in the middle of their plan to blow up the building, the owners of the cinema in a separate attack like the whole cinema on fire and lock the exit doors so the Nazi crowd is trapped in burnt alive.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Even though the bathrooms mission to kill everyone in the cinema is fulfilled, they still shoot into the crowd of Nazis. More unnecessary violence and blogged a cinema even more unnecessary violence. There's ridiculous files throughout the film. People caught off scalps get beat to death with baseball bats and get shot in the testicles. Both nation's pride and inglorious bastards contain excessive violence. Similarities don't stop. They're both protagonists. Carve Nazi symbols with a knife and are overly faithful to their country. Even the shots and nations private inglorious bastards are similar. Look at this shot of a person flying out of the exploding cinema. Notice the similarities between this shot and these shots of soldiers falling out of buildings during nation's pride chair. Tino is showing that his movie is not far off from nation's pride. Even the film titles are comparable where inglorious bastards is the exact opposite meaning of nations pri.

Speaker 1:          04:01          These films are similar, so are their respective audiences. US viewing inglorious bastards and the Nazis viewing nations pri, we both praise the violence in the film. We both cheer on death. We both get desensitized to the brutality of it. By comparing us to the Nazi viewers Terentino's criticizing our love for excessive violence. We're a bunch of easy to please dimwitted audience members who find entertainment and senseless gruesome killings in the same way that the Nazi viewers are portrayed as simple minded audience members find entertainment in the over to top violence and nations pride. He's poking fun at us. He's saying where as ridiculous as the Nazi viewers are looking at other instances of it sort violence and this is by no means limited to include as faster. It's either Tarantino does this in all of his other films as well. He sometimes even use his death for comedy.

Speaker 2:          04:43          I said goodbye, but I'm as you got to have an opinion. I mean, do you think that God came down from Heaven and stop an accident?

Speaker 1:          05:03          It takes skill to pawn audience into a world where killing can make up a punchline, but there's more to it than that. The screen desensitizes us. We can remove ourselves from the realities of death. When we watch a film and terrence, you don't knows it. The extent we can see death as a joke though is worth making fun of and nations. Pri provides a good allegory for how ridiculous we can be. Is it hypocritical that we can praise violence in a film yet to announce it in reality? One final anecdote about the two films and their audiences. While nation's pride is playing shows, sauna kills the real friedrich solar, but nobody in the audience notices because they're so engrossed in the violence up to fill. They think the gunshot noise is just another sound effect is Tarantino making your commentary about how we don't address or notice deaths in reality and only pay attendance to the ones in the movies we adore.

Speaker 1:          05:42          Glorious bastards is not the only felt to critique it's viewers, which I need to film that features an audience. Consider if the directors making a commentary about the audience actually watching the film, Wolf of Wall Street. It's about the rise and fall of a corrupt businessman named Jordan Belfort. He's unfaithful to his wife, steals money from thousands of people, has no one who truly loves him and spends years in jail. Logically, we should look at Jordan Belfort as a dishonest, despicable man, but look at the audience in the final shot of the film. Do they look like they despise him? They adore him. They want to be just like him, rich and famous. No matter how much dishonesty and stealing it takes, just like inglorious bastards. The director of showing the flaws of us as an audience is Jordan Belfort. Really the type of person we should strive to be like a clever director can use audiences or even crowds of people as a way of generalizing a society as a whole. It's most interesting. However, when the commentary is centered on the viewers of the film who are far from perfect. So the next time you see any movie that features an audience, ask yourself, are they making fun of me?
