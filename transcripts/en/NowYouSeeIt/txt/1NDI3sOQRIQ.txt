Speaker 1:          00:10          Welcome to now you see it when characters drought in movies, they're gone forever, but more than just the character leaves. They always take something with them. Maybe they take away fear, a friendship, trust in others or a desire to go somewhere new, but what happens when a character starts drowning and survives? She's not gone forever, but instead he's alive, but he isn't just alive. He's alive all over again. He supposed to be dead when he rises up again, key changes, but change isn't the right word. It's more violent than change. He's reborn.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Oh

Speaker 1:          00:47          Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Let's look at drowning more symbolically in the truman show. Truman lives on an island, caged from reality. He's been conditioned to fear the outside world after the drowning of his father. Finally, he sails out of his world and confronts the next nearly drowning in the process. It's the same pattern we see in baptism, death and rebirth. Through the medium of water, Truman goes and still scared of the outside world and comes out ready. He died and was born again. In any drowning scene, we see symbolic rebirth, which originates from the Judeo Christian sacrament of baptism. A new believer is taking completely underwater, dies out of his old self in his report and in his identity as a follower of Christ.

Speaker 3:          01:36          The preacher done, washed away all my sins and transmission. It's a straight now from here on out and have an everlasting my.

Speaker 1:          01:47          What are you talking about? We got bigger fish to fry using water as death and rebirth. Imagery has been used for centuries in literature, but it has since found its way into film. Every drowning experience has a different meaning based on the context. Whoever causes you to nearly drown is the symbolic enemy and whoever saves you is your symbolic saved. This includes drowning yourself, am saving yourself, and if you're unable to say someone else, that represents losing a part of yourself. If that person was close to you, baptism, imagery is not restricted to violent drowning. We can see the same death and rebirth more subtly in say a shower seat or a sewage drain followed by a torrential downpour while not as a parent. Any scene where a character gets cleansed with water can represent a death and rebirth for the character. The shower scene in psycho has baptism.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Imagery actress Janet Leigh said in her book on the film, Marion had decided to go back to Phoenix, come clean and take the consequence. So when she stepped into the bathtub, it was as if she were stepping into the baptismal waters. The spray beating down on her was purifying the corruption from her mind, purging the evil from her soul. She was a virgin again, tranquil at peace in the shower. She's causing herself of her since in her attempt, though she gets murdered and fails in her baptism. Countless films use water as a way of showing a deep internal change for a character. So someone goes under water, whether they're hiding, feeling trapped, getting super powers are falling out of an exploding plane. Remember that getting dunked underwater represents a part of them dying and another part being reborn, or maybe it's just a way to get a kiss from Wendy peppercorn.
