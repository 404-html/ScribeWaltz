Speaker 1:          00:00          What's your favorite movie memory? What I mean is what's your fondest memory while watching a movie? The question came to me this morning when I was watching the episode of Louis Ck is horace and Pete, it's a TV show that he produced on his website and it's great. There's this interesting segment where an old man enters their bar. I'm going to let the whole scene play out. I really encourage you to get the first episode. If you enjoy this.

Speaker 2:          00:19          My mother would send me here for a Pail of beer for my dad.

Speaker 1:          00:23          We used to sell beer pills out the bank.

Speaker 2:          00:25          Yeah. And I, I, I came here to get my first beer and I met my wife here. She was sitting in that stool. Yeah. And we were. We were married for years and I was happy and then I heard that she was sleeping with my best friend and so I showed up here one night and she was sitting in that stool again with my best friend kissing her and I just shot them both dead. Yeah, that was back in 1961. I just got to go to jail today.

Speaker 3:          01:40          That guy really there you want a beer?

Speaker 1:          01:49          So here's my question. Was that segment tragic or funny? I think the first instinct is to find it morbid. Certainly a man murdering his wife and spending his life in prison is tragic, but the way it's presented is also comedic. It's a rollercoaster of events. I was choking on my morning Bagel from laughter at how his story got absurdly worse and worse. I'm a big believer that the funniest moments are the ones that are also the saddest. I watched daddy's home the other day and it's fine. It had some good labs, but with comedies like daddy's home, there's always something missing and that brings me to my point. The funniest movies are also the saddest movies. It's the tragicomedy hear me out on this one. I'd venture to say that the vast majority of comedy these days contains characters who served no other purpose but to make us laugh.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Stuff like bridesmaids and spaceballs and they're great. Those are classics and I think Mel Brooks is a genius, but there's something inherently shallow about the comedy. All we got was laughter, but with this moment from horace and Pete, there's such a huge spectrum of emotion. It goes from a laugh, the fact that he met his wife there and caught her cheating there to a very sad moment, a homicide to a final resolution. Pete offering him a drink. That rollercoaster is just well better. It means more that way. It really lingers with me afterwards when I experience multiple emotions in one moment, not just laughter and it's different from dark comedy. Dark comedy is when you make comedy out of something that's supposed to be taboo, but tragic comedy is when you let the sad moments be genuinely sad, and the funny moments as a result are more genuinely funny. This scene brought me back to my favorite memory of watching a movie. I was watching little Miss Sunshine with my mom, Dad and sister, and this scene came up. Slight spoilers ahead in this scene, dwayne finds out he can't fulfill his dream of becoming a

Speaker 4:          03:21          pilot. You cannot fly jets

Speaker 1:          03:27          rewatching it. It's certainly a tragic scene, right? But here we see another essential moment of tragic comedy. The funniest moments are also the saddest moments. As soon as he found out he was colorblind, I started getting emotional, but then frank has his perfect. Thanks.

Speaker 5:          03:41          Okay. Got An emergency

Speaker 1:          03:46          and at this point my mom busts out laughing and all of a sudden I do too. Uncontrollable laughter and my sister and dad think we're crazy. So is the scene funny? Well, no, it's tragic, but at the same time, yes it is fight. The lows are low, but the highs are high. Steve Carell is a master of comedy because he earns his last by also having his sad side

Speaker 6:          04:05          and that's when I decided to check out early. Yes, yes, and I failed at that as well.

Speaker 1:          04:14          He has that perfect balance throughout the movie. I've noticed his best movies put him as a pathetic character while the movies where he's always goofy, don't have that spark any ads. His talent to my favorite movie memory, every character choice makes this seem perfect. The Way Dwayne maniacally punches the side of the car, the car horn honking randomly. The fact that Richard Texas watching argues that they don't have time to pull over Dwayne's reaction is priceless.

Speaker 5:          04:35          It's going to be good

Speaker 1:          04:39          at this point. I'm in tears, sad tears, but I'm also laughing hysterically. The climax of the scene is pretty much perfect.

Speaker 1:          04:54          My Dad and sister were looking at my mom and me dumbfounded. How could we be so cruel and insensitive? Can't they see? This is tragic. No, it's not tragic. It's better than tragic. It's tragic comedy because last time I checked, life is tragic and funny, but 99 percent of movies are either one or the other and the ones that you both are the diamonds in the rough. Once you noticed this type of movement, you can't help but appreciate it that much more. So that became my favorite movie memory, laughing and crying at the same time with my mom. What a treat those movies that genuinely capture the human experience. Sometimes it's tragic.

Speaker 3:          05:24          Sometimes it's comedy, right? Thanks.
