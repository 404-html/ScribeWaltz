Speaker 1:          00:00          Urban dictionary defines a jump scare as a technique used by unimaginative filmmakers as a cheap method of frightening the audience. And judging by a lot of comments on my last video, people tend to agree with this definition. I agreed that the jump scare has lost its former glory, not only our movie saturated with them. I think many filmmakers are using them completely wrong. But where I disagree with a lot of people is that I think there's still hope for the jump scare and people don't give them nearly enough credit for how amazing they can beat. So let's see what they can do. And if you can't handle all the jump scares why you are nothing but a great big coward, you Roy and its simplest form, a jump scare is a jarring cut, usually accompanied by a frightening sound. To illustrate this technique, let's look at an example that's not from a horror movie

Speaker 2:          00:43          shoots ticket one time.

Speaker 3:          00:56          Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:58          Now what makes this more than a cheap jump scare? What's important is that it not only scares, but it outlines a major plot point that resonates throughout the Lord of the rings trilogy. With a jump scare. We see how the ring can turn the kind bilbo into an evil and terrifying creature. A jump scare was without a doubt the best way to show the terrors of the ring firsthand. So now for the rest of their adventure that jumps gear sticks with us and reminds us how high the stakes are and how powerful the ring is. Great. Think jumps gears are misunderstood, is that they're supposed to do much more than just give us a simple startle. A jump scare should add tension to the rest of the movie by making us distrust any moment where we feel safe after being startled, once were put on high alert and with every long pause or dark shadow we experience afterwards, there's a heightened suspense and alertness because now we question everything we see. This is where many filmmakers use the jump scare rung when used correctly. The technique makes the call moments of the movie scary too.

Speaker 3:          01:53          Places down it can wander in and out of any panic night

Speaker 1:          01:57          scare should function like real life. Once he gets scared. Once you're scared for the rest of the night, they're great movies like the witch that use very subtle and infrequent jump scares. They aren't scary themselves, but the quick cuts in change in sound still add to the overall suspense of the movie. The technique is done wrong when it's used too often and isn't punctuated with suspiciously calm and suspenseful scenes like when silent hill revelation makes a jump scare out of literally everything including a pop tart. Actually, I take it back. You can use a toaster for an effective job, but it's the great buildup that does it

Speaker 3:          02:40          trick.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Another misunderstanding is that people don't know what makes a jump scare good. Take this of the technique from watch Mojo's video on the top 10 jump scares of all time. It's a one two punch of a scary face and a loud noise and that's exactly what makes it jump scare. So effective. This is a completely wrong way to analyze jump scares. The most important part is not the scare itself. It's the 30 seconds of buildup before the scare buildup is what separates the good jump scare from the cheap one. Here's a simple example from the sixth sense, the 10 opens at the top left of the frame and moves to the bottom right along with the camera. This framing guides our eyes towards the bottom right where a jump scare. Oh wait, sorry.

Speaker 3:          03:29          Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:33          This is a jump scare that doesn't require a fast cut or even any jarring movement to be scary. It was the buildup from the slow camera movement that did the trick. Compare that to the laziest jump scare of all time, the bad guys showing up through the bathroom mirror.

Speaker 3:          03:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:48          There's no time for the buildup and it's a huge cliche. The predictable jump scare scenarios are giving the whole technique of bad reputation. The best ones should go against our expectations, not appeal to them. This jump scare and insidious feels so fresh because we unconsciously expected the scared to come from the flashback, not from where she's telling the story. Similarly, with this scene in jaws, we expected the scariest part to be when he found the tooth, but there's actually something much worse waiting.

Speaker 3:          04:21          Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:21          good jump scare. It's a lot like a magic trick. It's all about the showmanship. Let's use the prestige and a jump scare from the original poltergeist to outline this idea

Speaker 3:          04:31          if magic trick consists of three parts. First part is called the pledge competition shows you some old Larry Bird or Ma Pepsi all shipped to Japan. Did you say you usually date real? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          05:01          Nope.

Speaker 3:          05:05          Coach probably isn't too. The second age is called the term magician takes the old shopping. I might just do salad. You're looking for the secret, but you weren't falling because she cooks. No. Want to know. Look to be full. Yeah, but you wouldn't clap yet because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. That's why

Speaker 1:          05:58          every magic trick I said Third Act. Oh, this part, the part we call press.

Speaker 3:          06:08          Sure.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Let's face it. Jump scares usually suck, but don't write them off just yet because when used, right, they're pretty great and don't worry, I won't end this video with a jump scare or will I? Thanks for watching.
