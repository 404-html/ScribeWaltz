Speaker 1:          00:03          In a womb, in a world world or old world. You know what? Hey, make sure your phone's turned off. I think we're getting some feedback out here. A trailer boils down to four main elements, plot, characters, conflict, and the cliffhanger. Really, each trailer is its own unique short story that happens to pull all its clips from one movie. The only real difference between a trailer and a short story is the cliffhanger. A trailer's main goal is to get people to want to see the movie. The cliffhanger is basically what's missing from the trailer, the part that has to be enjoyed by purchasing an $11 ticket to see the movie yourself. So how do you make a trailer that's so good? It's safe to say the movie will do well to stop. Okay. Safety first. Safety is safety is first. Let's look at the history of trailers structure and see why.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Even today, some trailers are still pretty forgettable since the 1950s trailers had a narrator basically just tell us the four elements. They'd say who the characters were, what the conflict was, the plot, and whatever makes the movie worth seeing. Now here at Connie Tam and all the other wonderful people and this unforgettable stories, clips from the movie only accompany the narration. So for the majority of cinematic history, the trailer was more or less a sales pitch by some narrator. Tell us the character, tell us the conflict, tell us why it's worth seeing and show a few clips to keep us from getting bored. Maybe throw in some silly music if it's a comedy or something epic, if it's action or drama. Although some trailers from this time were very well made. The psychos trailer, it's narrated by Alfred Hitchcock as he walks through the bates motel and in this house, the most die, a horrible event took place.

Speaker 1:          01:37          But as trailers had to get shorter to fit into TV commercial breaks, they became more formulaic. Think about the stereotypical inner worlds trailer. It's a narrator telling us the characters telling us the plot, the conflict, and the cliffhanger at new door cop, John McLean to see his wife and it's not just for action movies. Comedies have a similar formula. Tell us everything. Sprinkle in some jokes along the way. Her name is Samantha Baker and today is her 16th birthday. The problem arose when this format became predictable and boring. The inner world style of trailer now gets parodied more often than actually used in a world where laughter was king. Uh, no. In a world. Yeah. I do have to be careful generalizing though because while the majority of trailers did follow the formula, there have always been trailers that stands out. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:24          I need to talk to Mary came over last night. I want a salad last night because I was upset that Joe was getting married and before I knew what we were kissing and nationally short we did it,

Speaker 1:          02:35          they take it, but eventually even the average trailer started getting more creative and most importantly more efficient. The short story of the trailer is limited to around two minutes. If there's any way to say more in less time than perfect. First cut out the narrator and incorporate voiceovers from characters in the movie. This change makes the most sense. If we use character voice, so for, we could have plot and conflict introduced while also introducing the characters. So I'm going to have to science the shit out of it. Second, we don't need the character telling us the cliffhanger show, the cliffhanger. We want to see light sabers if we're seeing a star wars movie, so the best way to make a trailer for star wars tease us and to the trailer right before the light sabers hit, the trailer is sending a message. If you pay for a ticket, you will get to see this. Third is the built start with something familiar, something normal then disrupted. Does it live on the Great Plains of Africa? No. Hey, make the clips, get faster, the music louder and then peak followed by some resolution. Many early trailers never did this, but it's since become the norm,

Speaker 1:          03:40          but that's the problem. These techniques have become so normal that they aren't enough to make a trailer stand out anymore. The vague dialogue, the over the top music, it's very familiar to us. Like that last line of the trailer that's supposed to be really epic, but it's so vague that it hardly makes any.

Speaker 3:          03:54          Since I saw you, I believed it was side. It's something new can come into this world.

Speaker 1:          04:04          One way trailers combat with monotony, it's through making more unique trailers where the sequence of shots gives the four main elements instead of a voiceover telling us the conflict and telling us the plot with the right clips from the movie in the right order. We see the plot and conflict in the American sniper trailer. Chris Kyle has his sights on a child he may have to shoot to protect his team. Chris Kyle's internal conflict, not addressed in voiceover but in the sequence of clicks and the cliffhanger, whether he pulls the trigger, maybe show a scene between the two main characters in their secret identities and cut back and forth between their talk and them as superheroes.

Speaker 4:          04:48          I have a bad history with stress, like clowns

Speaker 1:          04:53          show an entire scene in a movie, not with cut after cut and not with ridiculous music and voiceover in the background. Just a good scene that makes for a memorable trailer and partly why the furious seven trailer one the golden trailer award. I think in a lot of ways movie trailers are like car commercials. The majority of commercials are relatively the same. Show the car driving around and looking cool. While a narrator brags about the car, half the car stop announced its name and show the brand logo. Obviously this type of commercial gets car salt because it's used all the time, but it's boring. It may be cheaper and easy to write, but it's so familiar. It's the unique car commercials that go viral or are really funny or different that are probably the most valuable because they create buzz and get shared all across social media.

Speaker 4:          05:35          Pauline,

Speaker 1:          05:36          maybe most trailers will continue with a more formulaic presentation of the four elements, but those ones that stand out, the cool trailers, do you want to share on facebook and talk about with their friends? Those are the ones with the bank for their, yeah.

Speaker 4:          05:53          Damn.
