Speaker 1:          00:12          Have you ever heard somebody say, I can't watch black and white movies, I have a problem with this, not because some of the most important movies are in black and white, but because black and white can do just as much, if not more than color. The best place to prove this point is film noir, a style of filmmaking that continues to influence modern cinematography everywhere, including breaking bad, but I'm getting ahead of myself. I want to focus on film the war as a style to make the case for black and white film making. The first question is, what is film noir? I actually don't think it requires a concrete definition because it's something you can feel, especially in modern parodies by saying, I see what this is going. Chicago know the conversation that predictable. Only one. I can tell what you're going to do next.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Maybe my favorite parody of the style is Calvin and Hobbes. Comic Strip can perfectly embodied the cinematography of film noir, the contrast of light and black, the white trail of cigarette smoke, the long shadows, and the dramatic morally ambiguous narrative, but let's unpack that to start. Let's consider black and white on Rob Snl parodied Casa Blanca recently and shot in black and white, rigid. They are parenting this. See notice a difference in the look of each shot in the snl sketch. The contrast is extremely low. If I take a sample of the darkest shade in the shot and compare it to the lightest shade in the shot, you see there isn't much difference between the two. Compare that difference to the difference in Casa Blanca. The darkest shade on screen is nearly black, while the brightest shade on screen is nearly white. This dynamic range of shading makes for a more interesting shot composition and it really showcases how black and white can make such an interesting look with higher contrast.

Speaker 1:          01:43          I know I'm comparing Casa Blanca to a sketch comedy TV show, but it does show how black and white Kim look boring and I think a lot of people see black and white this way. Let's see the beauty of black and white in an experiment. Let's take a stock photo in color of a stage picture that's got the film noir style. Let's try de Saturating it. Upping the contrast and adding some shadow. Now look at it. The background is it distracting from the subject. The shadows from the blinds are more pronounced, more focus is placed on her facial features like lips and eyebrows. The simplicity of black and white means that the I can observe more key features in the shock colors, great, but sometimes simple is better in the age of color. Filmmakers going for that noir feel. Have two options. The first is mimic in our budding color.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Blast the screen with bright, vibrant colors to give the same level of contrast and aesthetic as black and white movies, or do the opposite film in color, but make the coloring so monochromatic that it almost looks black and white. You can see this in many gritty movies like seven inbound, black and white filming emphasizes contrast, so it can be used for visual storytelling. The classic blind shot shows a character that is literally dark and light. Lighting is filmed in extremes. One side of the character is brightly lit. The other side is completely black. They've got a good side and a dark side. You may not actively acknowledged these details, but they subtly remind the viewer through lighting that the character might have a dark side, or at least it makes the scene much more threatening. Black and white film making gave cinema these techniques. We still see them in color and they work well, but black and white has a much stronger look because of the contrast.

Speaker 1:          03:05          This sequence in breaking bad screams film noir. If I make this black and white, you could even confuse it as an old flick. I'm not saying breaking bad should have been filmed in black and white, but what I am saying is that breaking bad's gorgeous cinematography owes itself to the techniques that shine the strongest in black and white movies. Actually breaking bad has filmed noir lighting everywhere. The blinds, the good side, and the dark side, high contrast and smoking smoke looks gorgeous in a black and white movie. The movie, the Big Combo shows all the beauty of black and white in this shot. Silhouettes, smoke high contrast. It looks fantastic. So if you want to convince somebody that black and white has merrick, give them a movie that shows off what high contrast and low key lighting can do. Show them a film noir, strong lights, strong blacks, strong picture. So Scott, the thing or the blacks are like, really? Really, really thanks for watching.

Speaker 2:          03:55          Slightly full. Just a bit of a break from the norm. Just to break the monotony of all that.
