Speaker 1:          00:00          The politicians can pretend it's something else, but Donald Trump calls it radical Islamic terror. Right now, I don't want to talk politics. I don't want to talk about who you should vote for or whose campaign ads are more effective. What I do want to talk about is how campaign ads brainwash you using 100 year old film making techniques. The technique is called the montage, and it was one of the first visual storytelling techniques and film to start. Let's watch the most famous montage of all time. So here's the question. Do we ever actually see Marion Crane get stabbed? The closest contact the knife makes is right here. That's it, but with montage, with a series of images moving rapidly across the screen, you can convince the viewer they see her stabbed repeatedly. The scene consists of quick shots of the knife, Marion's body and Marion struggling and screaming when seeing those images all at once, we associate the images with each other and create a story in our brains of what we saw. Essentially we got brainwashed.

Speaker 2:          01:15          Now the third way is what one might call pure shit. Imagine the assembly. All all bill and how come beat chain to create a different idea.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Here's another montage in citizen Kane. In 1941, it tells the story of Susan Cain being forced to perform across the country under the pressure of her husband, Charles.

Speaker 3:          01:40          Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:47          here's a more contemporary montage with two people shooting up heroin. We didn't actually see anyone do the drug, but the assembly of the images told the story for us.

Speaker 2:          02:02          Now we have a closed up. They would show what he listens to. You saw a woman holding a baby, and now we come back to his reaction to what is smile now? What is he as a character? He's a kindly man is sympathetic,

Speaker 1:          02:24          so let's see how campaign ads do it. The world a president has to grapple with. Sometimes you can't even imagine. That's the job and she's the one who's proven. She can get it done. Securing a massive reduction in nuclear weapons. In Hillary Clinton's new world campaign ad, we cut from the White House and it's long white pillows to Hillary Clinton walking in front of more long white pillars to her walking off the plane to her talking with Vladimir Putin. Now these editors have thousands and thousands of pictures of Hillary Clinton to choose from. For this commercial, it is no coincidence that they chose an image of the White House and then three clips of common activities and locations we associate with presidents, the walking by the White House pillars, the leaving Air Force One, the talking with other world leaders all reinforced with the use of the phrase that's the job. These editors are using a montage of images to make us Imagine Hillary Clinton as president. When we see her working hard in these familiar spaces, we imagined her filling those same shoes and see her as a president in a positive, familiar way, but montage and campaign ads can also go from positive to threatening.

Speaker 2:          03:26          Now, let's take the middle piece of film away. The woman with the child, but leave his two pieces of promos. They will. Now we'll put in a piece of film of a girl in a bikini. He looks good in a bikini. You smile. What is he now? A dirty old man. He's no longer a little bit nine gentleman who loves baby. That's different. That's what film can do for you.

Speaker 4:          03:58          All right? More not just abroad, but here at home with the clear and present threat of radical Islamic terrorism. On the march, we must secure our borders. Washington continues to fail us with groups like the gang of eight that support amnesty and allow sanctuary cities.

Speaker 1:          04:14          This video shows radical terrorists and illegal immigrants in a menacing, dark green tint, followed by the capital in front of a thunderstorm, followed by Marco Rubio. This montage, along with the tent and grainy found footage. Look cinematically associates, Marco Rubio with something Americans fear the most terrorism. The montage manipulates the audience to see Rubio at has policies as terrorist friendly. What immediately follows is Ted Cruz in bright saturated light speaking in front of a large crowd, surfing as a metaphorical savior to Marco Rubio. In the first half of the Commercial

Speaker 4:          04:44          America needs Ted Cruz. The one proven conservative for president,

Speaker 1:          04:49          uh, Donald Trump ad uses a similar technique by fading out from Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to Muslim looking people and an ambulance carrying an injured person in the background. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          04:58          the politicians can pretend it's something else, but Donald Trump calls it radical Islamic terror.

Speaker 1:          05:03          These montages are carefully assembled to associate Clinton and Obama with terrorism, with the right images in the right order. You can create whatever emotional response that you want. I want to make it clear that this video is supposed to be nonpartisan. Republican ideology allows for more brutal campaign ads because they want to show Democrats are soft on terrorism, democrats to be just as brutal because also portray Republicans as vicious warmongers. Think about it,

Speaker 5:          05:26          I would bomb the out of home. One of these republicans carpet bomb them into oblivion, could actually be president.

Speaker 1:          05:34          Here we see a montage generalizing the Republican candidates, keeping them in low saturation, low quality footage, and physically shrinking them in small aspect ratios, and of course Hillary's clips are bright and take up the whole street aid who can stop them? Hillary Clinton. I wouldn't be surprised if Hillary campaigners made a montage of wounded soldiers like Nixon did in one campaign out in 1968, never had so much military and

Speaker 6:          05:58          diplomatic power been used so ineffectively as in Vietnam.

Speaker 1:          06:04          The point is that the assembly of images is extremely powerful. Everybody does it, and it's not just limited to movies. This form of cinematic brainwashing happens all the time, not only in campaign ads but also other commercials. Beer commercials don't sell beer. They sell an idea and that idea is conveyed through a montage of people smiling, being social, and having fun, so know that more goes into campaign ads than you might've thought, and remember not to just vote for the candidate who's editor. Put images together the best. My name is Jack Newton and I approved this message. Thanks for awhile.

Speaker 7:          06:36          Slightly full. Just a bit of a break from the norm. Just a little slot in the break, but may not need a ball bat hot.
