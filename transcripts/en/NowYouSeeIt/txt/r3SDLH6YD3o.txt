Speaker 1:          00:10          Welcome to. Now you see it.

Speaker 1:          00:14          Disney films have made great strides in their portrayal of women from the entirely domestic and dependence snow white in 1937 Oh to the adventurous and unconstrained Maretta in 2012 a princess just not please her weapons on the team. It's hard to go a single day on the Internet without finding yet another blog post about free spirited women in Disney movies, especially the Disney princesses. They all praised Disney movies for making great steps towards women's rights in our society. But who cares? These are just movies. Shouldn't we stop relying on fictional storytelling to comment on reality? I want to argue the film is in fact, one of the best methods of commenting on a society and a Disney princess can have more influence on the society than any politician or leader women. Every popular film to some extent conforms with the society. It was maiden. Think about it.

Speaker 1:          01:01          If a movie was released this year that generalized all African Americans as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards women and also made out the Klu Klux Klan is heroes, would it be a commercial success? Probably not that wouldn't conform to the values of our present society, but in the early 19 hundreds this kind of film could be a critical hit because that's society conform to those beliefs. And it was in 1915 the birth of a nation was released and became the highest grossing film of the year despite generalizing African Americans as unintelligent. And the KKK is heroes. What I'm saying is people don't like seeing movies that greatly contradict their views. So the most commercially successful movies generally avoid so much controversy that nobody pays to see the movie. In other words, commercially successful movies or a commentary on what the popular beliefs were at the time of its making.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Of course, there are plenty of thought provoking society critiquing movies out there, but we certainly don't see them topping the box office. So where do the Disney princesses fit into this? Disney produces some of the most popular films of all time with 13 of the 25 highest grossing films in history from The Walt Disney Corporation, the Disney princess films, or some of their most successful. Let's take a look at how Disney films can form with the societies they were made in snow white takes place in Germany in the 15 hundreds but it's very much a portrayal of life for women in America when it was made in 1937 women at this time, we're taught that their place was in the home and snow white is a perfect representation of that view. For her, a home is the only safe place. The outside world is scary. Her safety is in a house where she fees, cooks and cleans for others and her life is eventually saved by a man.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Snow white is more telling a description of the societal perceptions of women at that time been any textbook through fiction. We get a taste of reality area reflects society's portrayal of women during the creation of the little mermaid. In 1989 America has accepted the deviation from the nuclear family and a woman's role outside of the home area leaves her home. The ocean inserts for her destiny, but what does she in search for? A man, 1989 America still believes a woman's main goal is to find a husband and start a family. Society has not yet reached the milestone of seeing women independent of a man. And that is reflected in the popular cinema of that era. Maretta and brave show society's current view of winning. She is fierce, independent, and doesn't need a man. In fact, she outperforms other men in her world, in our society.

Speaker 1:          02:58          We now recognize women can do anything a Manton do and don't need men in their lives to be happy. Women can now choose their own faith. When you see a film, it may take place in the past or the distant future. But the film has always subtly commenting about the society. It was maiden. Wally is about a future where humans had to escape an inhabitable planets. But it's really a commentary about how we mistreat the environment today, who long it takes place in ancient China. But it's about how masculine qualities are not exclusive to men in our current society. So here's a question. Films are influenced by society's views, but can society's views be influenced by film? They reach such a wide audience and can provide such powerful messages that they change society's views in radical ways. Like when jaws led to a huge drop in beach tourism when men started forming their own fight clubs after fight club or when a movie inspires some southerners to bring back the KKK. Philadelphia is such an important film because it was the first production to portray on man with the HIV virus and it was a major inspiration for the founding of an international AIDS Awareness Association in 1997 Philadelphia touch the hearts of Americans and brought an awareness to the struggles of the disease. In a way, a simple awareness campaign never could have.

Speaker 1:          04:02          What makes Disney princesses so important is that they're marketed towards families and especially children, children specifically. Girls idolize these princesses. They dress up like them, they mimic them. They act just like them. Don't we want to raise girls who become women with strong views of themselves. If Disney princesses presented meaning domesticating values for women, then women will become that through mimicking that behavior. Disney princesses shaped the character of the children that watch because girls want to be the princesses they see on screen. So what characters should we show them? Thanks for watching.
