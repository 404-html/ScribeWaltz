Speaker 1:          00:00          What a character chooses to drink says a lot about them, about teenage shaken. If they get a shot of whiskey, they're cool. If they order a fine chardonnay, they're probably trying to go for class, but there's wondrich used in cinema that requires a bit of explanation as to drinking 1% is that because you think you're fat? Probably the first thing that comes to mind when you think of milk is youth and innocence. When a 16 year old uses his charm and grace to mimic being a pilot, we're reminded of his age by his drink of choice. Would you like a drink after takeoff milk in a clockwork orange, the adolescent streak mill, a gentle reminder that all this mayhem is being caused by kids. James Deane, famously nurses, a bottle of milk in such a way that we get a visual cue of his conflicts between maturity and adulthood.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Of course, if you don't drink milk, then your manly, Oh God, am I outside them? I I got a bowler nails for breakfast this morning. Yes, so without an ame milk, the right this wig, sorry to keep you waiting. If you want to go for a deep reading, you could say that Kevin's spilling milk in home alone is a symbol of his lack of maternal nourishment. Or You could say John Hughes just wanted the visual joke of everybody crying over spilled milk, but this only scratches the surface. Many adults also drink milk and that's where it gets more complicated. Milk is a symbol of childishness, so it's humorous to see Leon, the professional, a hypermasculine assassin, drinking it throughout the movie. It fits into the comedic moments of the movie, but it also sheds light on his maternal side as he takes Matilda under his wing. In this instance, drinking milk is a joke, but many times drinking milk has the opposite intent.

Speaker 1:          01:29          It's creepy. There's something off about a grown man drinking milk and filmmakers seem to be well aware of this intuition in hitchcock suspicion. The audience suspects that the milk may be poisoned. It's an eerie choice to have milk, a drink we associate with innocence and purity be the drink that may be poisoned. I don't think it would have had nearly the same effect if it were a cup of coffee or a shot of whiskey. There's something delightful about making milk threatening. We see this again and inglorious bastards. Colonel Hans Londa chugs a glass of milk from Lofa deeds farm and it has the creepy factor, but there's more to it than that. I quote a social theorist, Roland barthes and his take on milk. It's purity associated with the innocence of a child is a token of strength of a strength, which is not revulsive, not congestive, but calm white, lucid. The equal of reality.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Me, you have a wash should cover.

Speaker 1:          02:19          So when a villain grabs the glass of milk, it's creepy, but it also shows their power. They're conquering the pure and innocent by consuming it and there's a strength to that. When I saw Mad Max fury road in theaters, the only time people audibly cringed in the crowd wasn't during an action sequence. It was when this happened,

Speaker 1:          02:38          Western culture has an aversion to breastmilk, seeing it as taboo to drink as an adult. It's a little wonky. That's because that's from Debbie's left breast. Greg, the choice to harvest breast milk in the movie further alienates the post apocalyptic world from our own. In short, Mad Max fury road is a movie about fluids. Women are exploited for their breast milk. Men are exploited for their blood and the populous is exploited by controlling the water supply. The complete control of these liquids by a Wharton Joe shows his dominion over his world and the milk is no exception. In fact, his sons drink the milk to keep up their muscle mass. Reinforcing the idea that consuming milk is a sign of strength. What's so great about using these liquids in the film is that it allows mad max to introduce plot points and character arcs non verbally. After Mad Max performance, his first selfless act for Furiosa, he washes himself with milk symbolizing the start of his transformation from a selfish man only looking for survival to one who cares in nurtures for others, the turn to completely trusting Furiosa is symbolized by him giving her his blood. Another liquid symbol, mad max fury road is a prime example of milk. Enhancing the visual storytelling of a movie. Milk is a powerful storytelling device. It can show someone as a child, but it can also be used to unsettle show character strength or give information about the plot. So the next time you see a character drinking something, ask yourself, thanks for one,

Speaker 3:          03:53          whoever it is, a cool, slightly trends full, just a bit of a break from the norm. Just a little slump in the break from monotony of all that hard.
