Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, there they are, Shira Mr Creeps in his partner, Mr Kroll.

Speaker 2:          00:04          I've been asked to make a video on plot twists and it's just about the beginning of this channel, but I was always hesitant to do it because I didn't want to spoil a bunch of major plot twists. I stood by this principle until I came across an interesting study conducted by UC San Diego. Researchers had one group of participants read several famous books after the researchers spoiled their endings while another group read the books. Normally after reading each group noted how much they liked each book. Based on the results, it turns out that if the ending is spoiled to you before you read a book, you actually end up liking the book more. Not only do I think this study perfectly explains what makes a plot twist great. I also like it because it helps me justify spoiling some movies. I'll have to spoil. Now you see me and primal fear with the prestige having only very minor spoilers. If you haven't seen one, consider what the study says and use this video as an opportunity to recreate the experiment. So let's get spoiling.

Speaker 1:          00:52          We are going to follow those dirty, find that data.

Speaker 2:          00:56          The common definition of a plot twist is a totally unexpected outcome to a story, and now you see me. Dylan roads is an FBI agent trying to track down the four horsemen, but in a shocking twist, it turns out he was the fifth horseman all along. While I do think the rest of the movie is pretty fun, there's one key reason that this plot twists doesn't really work.

Speaker 3:          01:14          Now you and our shipping shoddily a bomb goes off. I'm the FBI, got past him not once, not twice, but consistently, almost as if they were on the in. A lot of the audience had seen five or 10 seconds or shock. Even though the original shows are pretty simple and predictable, scooby doo actually adheres to an important principle of good plot twists. The final payoff always follows the established logic. At the beginning of each episode,

Speaker 1:          01:54          they were trying to scare all the years off the island. Then no one would spend the night and they would keep control of a fortune.

Speaker 3:          02:02          We get just enough information in the beginning so that when the twist does happen, it's satisfying. Since there was always that looming feeling that you know who did it, creeps and crawls, they sure picked the right lawyers for this job.

Speaker 2:          02:14          Can you see me? Twist has this element missing. It follows very little established logic. The complete rewriting of the character from a clumsy FBI agent to accounting genius means there was really no way to see this plot twists coming and that's why it's not very satisfying and relies too heavily on shock. The Prestige is the perfect balance between the shock value of the. Now you see me twists and the predictable but logical twists of Scooby Doo. Twenty minutes into the movie, we've technically been told enough to predict the plot twist, but Christopher Nolan leaves just enough information out to make the ending. An amazing shock that still follows established logic.

Speaker 3:          02:47          You do the sheen over again, but we tell the audience a bomb underneath this table is going to five limit. You're looking for the secret, but you won't volunteer because you're coke's not really.

Speaker 2:          03:01          Plot twist is the one that can create the biggest surprise without ruining the established logic because at the end of the day, the twisted, now you see me, isn't actually that satisfying. It's a complete rewrite of his character for a cheap surprise. It's not particularly interesting to change 100 percent of a character's personality that has been built up throughout the whole movie, so how do you do this in a surprising but also entertaining way and primal fear. The plot twist is similar, but with one key difference in the movie and alter boy is accused of murdering and archbishop and the lawyer gets him off not guilty by reason of insanity, because the boy test positive for multiple personality disorder. The film ends with the final scene before the altar boy is moved to a psychiatric hospital. Here he reveals, he faked it the whole time. To get a short sentence, there never was an aaron counselor.

Speaker 2:          03:46          It may seem like pure shock, but this ending is actually carefully woven into the logic of the story throughout the movie. We're not sure which personality he is or what he's about to change his identity, so we've always had this feeling that he wasn't who he says he was, but the shock is still fantastic because we go from being on his side to him, tricking everybody in the story, including us and switching to an antagonist. At the very end. We got the information, but it's still a surprise and it's what separates the good plot twists from the bad ones

Speaker 4:          04:12          in order to provide the audience with a certain amount that had for me.

Speaker 2:          04:18          Come on, Marty. I thought you had it figured out.

Speaker 4:          04:20          Yeah, and leave the rest of it to their own imagining, but to tell you the truth, I'm glad you figured it.

Speaker 2:          04:27          I have been dying to tell you, give them just enough to see it coming, but not enough to expect it. I think the best way to test a good plot twist is if the movie is re watchable because once you know the twist ending, if the ending is a good one, then it's just as fun. If not more fun to go back and see where they hint at that twist ending. Totally. I think that's why the studies shows how spoiling a book before reading it makes it more enjoyable. This expense of the ending makes the path getting there that much more exciting and maybe that's why lots of stories spoiled the ending at the very beginning

Speaker 3:          05:03          and me, I'm the damn

Speaker 2:          05:06          for the charter because as much as it's about the plot twists, it's about how you get there, so feel free to watch something even if you know how it ends, because who knows? Maybe you'll like it even more.

Speaker 3:          05:15          They bring the dog and come in the waiting in. Thanks for watching.
