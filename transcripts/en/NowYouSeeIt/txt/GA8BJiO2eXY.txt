Speaker 1:          00:00          I mean the guys in that Prince Movie, Purple Rain, that shit was so gay fucking 80 style. It was sitting and I was gone. What about the time? There's no doubt that every era of movies looks back on previous era's one full generation before. It's far enough back to reflect on while still being fresh. So it's pretty common for directors and producers to make movies and TV shows that take place in that previous generation in the generation they grew up in. It's a wonderful life goes from the forties to the twenties back to the future goes from the eighties to the fifties and that's 70 show goes from the two thousands to the seventies and the same thing goes for the 2010 looking back on the 1980s but this era seems to have more of a craze than a simple Omaj to the eighties countless movies and TV shows, gift, meticulous detail to the movies, video games, and overall style of that era, all to critical acclaim and box office success.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Nothing encapsulates our current obsession with the 1980s more than ready player one a novel turned movie about a future world where people use virtual reality to relive old eighties pop culture and media. It doesn't get more eighties obsessed than that. I think there are several reasons. The eighties phenomenon is so much more prominent than the nostalgia of other generations. For one thing, the eighties was the birth of audio visual entertainment with the music video creating a whole new art form that continues to influence movies today. It was also the golden age of TV movies. The teens watching those movies have since become the movie creators and creating thematically complicated teenagers paved the way for casting more kids in lead roles. But I want to focus on the eighties phenomenon for another reason, entirely the perfect timing of the 80s created movies designed to be Omaj to later on movies begging to be revisited, and that's because of how the directors and producers made them.

Speaker 1:          01:37          And to understand the eighties creators, you have to understand where they came from. Mid Sixties till late seventies films in a period referred to as new age Hollywood. We're defined by deviation from classical cinematic norms. These films questioned the Hollywood system, creating more experimental movies, movies that challenge John or norms, conventional filming techniques and the Hollywood production code. Maybe the pinnacle of new age. Hollywood was Bonnie and Clyde, a movie with insane violence, sexually confused characters and counterculture sentiment. And in this hotbed of cinematic experimentation came the pioneers of the 80s blockbuster, the creative talent with a hyper awareness of Hollywood conventions, conventions. They themselves knew how to abide by when they wanted and break when they didn't. So the eventual leaders of the 80s blockbuster where the first generation of filmmakers to grow up during classical Hollywood and then rise to the top during a period of extreme experimentation.

Speaker 1:          02:26          So their film language is based on previous films and their style is driven by how they follow or break film conventions. And how do I know that's how they made their movies? Because online there's a transcript of perhaps the two most important eighties directors conceiving the idea for one of the best movies of the 1980s Steven Spielberg and George Lucas Discussing Indiana Jones, raiders of the lost Ark. A lot of people enjoy reading the banter between the two directors and how they thought of the iconic sequences in the movie. But I want to discuss these transcripts with a new Hollywood eighties Omaj perspective because as you read it, you realize how their entire means of communicating comes from building off of previous movies. Lucas pitched the movie as a Spaghetti Western or James Bond, but in the 30s they describe me, Indiana Jones by comparing him to other movie characters, he's professional like me, food aid from the seven Samurai, he has to go against people like Eli Wallace from the good, the bad and the ugly.

Speaker 1:          03:14          He's a John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Sean Connery, kind of professional but scruffy like Humphrey bogart in treasure of Sierra Madre. The action should be like the wind and the lion and the jungle is King Kong ish. There. Language is built on entirely Oman and in doing so, they create a completely fresh character and story by using old movies. But it's more than just using old to create new. These creators also want it to capture the spirit of movies before new age Hollywood movies with less social commentary and more classic Hollywood find a movie to instill. The eighties mindset was undoubtedly star wars in 1977 George Lucas describes the phenomenon himself. My main reason for making star wars was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life. The kinds my generation had. We had westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie ever made.

Speaker 1:          04:00          He criticized the 70s TV shows at the time, like Kojak and the 6 million men that were popular and well made, but also extremely bleak and almost too realistic. Basically they missed out on the fun. So the 80s blockbuster brought back what made movies entertaining in the first place? James Cameron's the terminator is inspired by 1950 Psi Phi and the outer limits, uh, 1960 Scifi show, as are a lot of other eighties movies like e t and ghostbusters. And notice how these later movies don't make aliens horrific or bleak. They make aliens whimsical and fun. Even the princess bride, a fantasy movie seems to perfectly capture the George Lucas and Steven Spielberg spirit. Many sixties and seventies teen movies are defined by their oversized characters or plots with extreme sexual deviations. This is Robinson you're trying to seduce. John Hughes was one of the first to create an honest portrayal of teenagers, one defined by clumsy romance and entertaining hi-jinks.

Speaker 1:          04:49          I think Roger Ebert sums up what these eighties creators accomplished in his review of Indiana Jones. This movie celebrates the stories we spent our adolescent searching for in the pulpit adventure magazines in the novels, in comics, even in the movies. So I think that's the biggest reason why eighties movies are so popular today and why stranger things has dozens of eighties movies. References. San Junipero won two emmy's and it is the highest grossing horror movie of all time. The movies of the 80s capture the spirit of entertainment and these modern Oh matias want to do the same when you watch another 80s movie made in the present day, notice how there's almost always some shot where we see what blockbuster is currently out in theaters at the time. Eighties movies reinvigorated that Hollywood blockbuster and that's why we look back to that time period when we're trying to do the same today. So the next time you see a big budget eighties movie coming out, remember there's some part of that director trying to capture the spirit that made 80s movies so timeless and fun to watch because they really did have everything

Speaker 2:          05:39          sporks in it. I you kidding? Same Shane fighting torture, revenge, giant monsters, chases, escapes, troll love miracles. Those are some too bad we're trying to stay away.
