Speaker 1:          00:00          Alright, think hard. What is circle close spot,

Speaker 2:          00:10          definitely wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:15          Let's see, I showed you two shapes, sheep, one in shape too, and then I asked you would you be shapes matches the word Boba and which matches the word Kiki for 98 percent of people shape one is Kiki and shaped to his Boba and it doesn't matter if you're from America, India, or your two and a half years old. This result is extremely consistent across all cultures and languages, and so what does it mean? I want to suggest that with this study we can see how the brain gives abstract meaning too many different shapes in a consistent way, and filmmakers use this phenomenon to tell their story. The best place to see this idea has to be animation were animators can make objects and characters from any shape they want. Let's start with the basics. Circle, square and triangle. This may seem reductive, but these shapes say a lot more than you may think. Evil characters are drawn like Kiki. They have sharper features pointing noses, ears in long curly fingers, and the lovable characters are designed like Boba soft and round. Is it a coincidence that the fluffiest and least threatening character in animation is named balloon? To me, this whole concept makes intuitive sense. Our brains are designed to c sharp and pointy things is more threatening.

Speaker 1:          01:11          It just stood around on the top. It needs to be pointed around. It's not scary scary.

Speaker 2:          01:17          Notice how I can draw the nicest and most recognizable character in animation with three circles and notice how the devil is commonly represented as a collection of triangles, but do it a little more subtly and you're able to emit an emotional response to the viewer without them even noticing. It happens during one of my favorite movie moments of all time when we see the wicked villain transformed from Kiki into around vulnerable Boba.

Speaker 2:          01:45          You may think this only applies to animation, but is it a coincidence that darth vader's mask has this shape and Lord dark helmet? The cartoonish and comedic parody of Darth vader has this shape. One of the sharpest villains is maleficent, and they even tried to keep her pointy jaw line and eyebrows in the live action remake. Following these same principles, what does it mean when you call somebody a square? It means they're boring. Maybe they're old fashioned, but a square can also symbolize something that is sturdy and from sound familiar. Squares are rigid and slow to change if the world is and how they want it to be. Maybe they get a little angry. If you really want to think abstractly, the world of film exists inside a rectangular shape. A lot of important geometry comes from framing. The most significant framing to look for is probably the frame within the frame. This is used to show a character trapped in their current situation. Another less common, but equally important frame with it. The frame is the circle which gives the geometric impression of surveillance and spying to go a step deeper than the frame within the frame. You can use lines to create a visual jail cell in the frame, whether it's through blinds in an office or even a computer screen. A collection of vertical and horizontal lines can indicate a character is not only trapped but held prisoner in their current lifestyle.

Speaker 2:          03:08          These shots used geometry as a means of visual storytelling as far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster and how does even noticing it? Framing is filled with lines. Geometry is everywhere, and the same principles apply. Triangles can emphasize power dynamics. Linear framing can show physical separation. We're straight lines can guide our eyesight, so the next time you rewatch your favorite movie, try analyzing the geometry of the framing and characters. If you do that, then you're in good shape.

Speaker 1:          03:32          What's this one

Speaker 2:          03:38          couple of wavy lines. Sorry. This isn't your lucky day. Thanks for watching.

Speaker 3:          03:45          Slightly. Just a bit of a break from just a little slot in the break. The monotony of all that hardcore.

Speaker 2:          03:53          I want to think good blood for giving me this idea in the first place with his amazing crash bandicoot video. I highly recommend it.
