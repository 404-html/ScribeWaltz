Speaker 1:          00:00          Sure, pictures they make these days roll into TV. Cut, cut, cut, cut. The opening shot of a touch of evil was six and a half minutes long. Three or four in a way, set up the whole picture of the one track. Father was a key grip and what about absolute beginners? That was an extraordinary shocked. The hell is that I've never heard of it.

Speaker 2:          00:21          Now you see it aren't long. Takes awesome. I'm talking about the huge ones, the masterpieces where all the technical camera work, special effects and carefully choreographed movement pushes the boundaries of cinema as an art form and leaves us thinking, Holy Shit. If you want to read more about how awesome they are, I recommend that these three articles or even these tech. How about 25? What I'm saying is we're all well aware of how long it takes work. They dazzled, they entertain, they pushed film to its limits, but I want to make a quick video essay that explores one way long takes might people limited in their storytelling abilities to start. Let's hear from someone familiar who doesn't like long takes.

Speaker 3:          01:01          Don't know why I really dialed in the stump. I can only call it a stunt

Speaker 2:          01:09          it. Rope rope was hitchcock's attempt at a movie taking place in real time in one long take. Originally a play. Hitchcock kept every action and reaction in the frame and let the camera roll. Cameras at the time could only film 20 minutes per reel, so we had to hide cuts in between scenes when he needed to. What are you worrying about, Philip? After all the result is something hitchcock didn't think was all that great. He comments on what it was missing in a French interview with the truffaut, which explains the French translator in the background.

Speaker 3:          01:37          When I look back of it was quite nonsense. Memorials, Joe Bosco. I was breaking all my own simplicity to of film. The Samuel just fill me in on the cutting of film to tell the story. A lot of people think the cotton is St Montage or assembly is taking a man from one place, Jordan Adler and jumping into a closeup of him which griffith invented. It's true, but to me it goes much deeper.

Speaker 2:          02:16          So that's what long takes. Can Miss Editing. In many ways, hitchcock was simply filming a play, but if it was something originally a play, you can use editing to tell a story and hitchcock things. Editing is a strong storytelling device that was missing with his movie. How could rope have used editing to tell its story? 12, angry men originally a teleplay and then a stage play also has a limited set and heavy dialogue, but the editing tells us everything. I'm like rope, which has no Arabic. The beginning shots are wide uncomfortable. There's actually a six minute long take in the beginning where conversation is light and everyone looks at ease in the early scenes, most of the dialogue features multiple people that takes are relatively long and shots of single people aren't too close as the movie progresses. Intense scenes have super close ups of characters and the are much quicker by allowing the camera to cut quickly from closeup too. Closeup editing showcases the intensity of this

Speaker 4:          03:05          seat

Speaker 2:          03:15          guilty not to mention the Erie overhead lighting, the performances and the rain in the background. The cuts are very important here too quickly and efficiently. Move from the action to the reaction as opposed to a long take where the camera has to either whip around or we see action and reaction at the same time, which gives them both equal weight to the viewer, but that's not to say filmmakers can't direct our eyes without using cuts. On the contrary, director's guide our eyes with the right lighting, camera, movement and frame composition. The University of Edinburg developed a visual tools that track eye movement so they can show people a movie clip and track what they look at in this scene in there will be blood. The person talking is important to the viewer according to where they're looking, but I movement also shifts when someone moves to smoke a cigarette or starts leaving the frame. There's lots of ways to direct the eye like what's in focus where everybody is looking lights and geometry. You may not notice it consciously, but directors are telling you where to look, especially in flashy long takes. The long battle scene in the revenue is chaos, but it's directed chaos. You look from one person to another or at that specific era whizzing past the camera, but according to hitchcock along take, just can't beat the intensity, speed and storytelling power of an effective cut.

Speaker 3:          04:22          Copping five. It really should be called a hem.

Speaker 2:          04:32          When clips are assembled together through editing, they create a new story for the viewer. If you cut from one clip to another, your mind associates the clips with each other and creates the idea. Of course, the classic example is the psycho shower scene, but it works in a variety of movies in the Godfather. Coppola cuts from the spiritual cleansing of Michael's son through baptism to the violent cleansing of mafia leaders. One cleanses with holy water. The other one

Speaker 4:          04:54          blood.

Speaker 2:          05:01          You could write a book on what this editing choice means in the context of the film, but one thing is very clear. The editing is what establishes this symbolic connection and a take just doesn't have the ability to automatically associate two different ideas in a way as effective as these edits.

Speaker 3:          05:16          I mean the film which moved in rapid succession for the. I create an idea

Speaker 2:          05:29          I love long takes, anybody can appreciate them for how beautiful they are, but they are limited in their storytelling power. They give us more choices in what to look at compared to cutting from face to face or object to object. This has its advantages with more to look at. We can be more overwhelmed, more taking it back, more amazed, but a cut forcing us to look at one thing that can be intense and has the kind of emphasis a big shot doesn't have. Sometimes an edit works, sometimes a long take works. It just depends on how you look at it. Of course, a difference, how long it takes. Supposedly we do it in five minutes, so what? Let's take an hour ballgame doesn't start till 8:00. If you wish, this video was longer, you're in luck because all time movies has a great video that focuses on how directors pull off these intricate long takes and sometimes long takes are hidden in plain sight. Watch Tony [inaudible] video on the Spielberg one or to learn more about that. Both these videos are in the description. Thanks for watching.
