Speaker 1:          00:09          You'll have, and I see your Schwartz is his biggest mind. That must be Lord far. Quads castle. That's the place. Do you think maybe he's compensating for something?

Speaker 2:          00:31          Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:38          Oh, oh God. I just. I remembered there's just this teeny tiny thing. No, no, no. Sexual comedy is one of the most universal and popular genres of comedy in cinema pds. Sorry, Tourette's. Notice. She has it too. It's something pretty much every adult can relate to and has the potential for big laughs while often used for comedic effect. I want to look at how sexual imagery, specifically phallic symbols can be used to achieve dramatic effects. Filmmakers can use phallic symbols to tremendously contribute to the visual storytelling of a film. Penis shapes are everywhere and while not always acknowledged, there's no doubt that skyscrapers, he went to a funny match go up guns

Speaker 1:          01:31          or even a pipe, so at a certain point he brings out this pipe and what pipe does he bring out? It brings out the Sherlock Holmes pipe one. You can say it's a sexual thing because my life is bigger than yours. All right, and can be treated as phallic symbols. Psychologist Sigmund Freud is famous for theorizing that we noticed these objects are phallic on a subconscious level in a similar way of thinking. Filmmakers use phallic symbols in place of actual sex to get a subconscious emotional reaction from the viewer. The simplest and most noticeable use of a phallic symbol is to imply sex in film. Sexist more often imply been actually shown, especially with strict censorship during the golden age of cinema. That band showing sex on screen, so instead of actual sex, we see sex represented in a phallic

Speaker 2:          02:12          take me to work going black.

Speaker 1:          02:21          The object can be anything from a bedpost in the birth of a nation, a train entering a tunnel in north by northwest, a man pumping gas into a woman's car and written on the window or a gun, and Bonnie and Clyde drove phallic symbol. We see there's some kind of sexual relationship or desired sexual relationship between the two characters. Another common form of Phallic symbol is to show masculinity. A gun is a powerful phallic symbol that indicates the masculinity of a character. A big gun means your manly and the heroes and classic action movie seemed to always have ridiculously sized weapons. If a girl has a big gun, we know she's reversing gender roles and taking on masculine qualities. Small guns, on the other hand, are a sign of weakness or vulnerability.

Speaker 3:          03:06          That's what I'm talking about. Noisy cricket.

Speaker 1:          03:12          Okay. No, no. Come on man. You get a series. We atomize. I get a little midget cricket. The gun sights issue even gets addressed in the James Bond Film. Dr. No as a spy bond has to conceal a small gun, but the film makes it clear that it's still mainly with the delivery, like a brick through a plate glass window. Another example is written on the wind. When Kyle Threatens Mitch with a pistol, the small size of the gun further reinforces the idea that kyle is cowardly week and feminine. He doesn't appear threatening with such a small weapon. This parallels nicely with the fact that Kyle's impotent and so he's missing a major aspect of being a man. Phallic symbols can also be used to convey domination and control. We see this symbolism hyperbolically in a clockwork orange, a clockwork orange conveys the idea that if you can expose someone sexually, you have complete and utter domination over them. So when Alex, where's the Phallic Mask and beats the couple with a phallic stick or uses a phallic statue to toy with an old lady, he's asserting his complete control over them. It shows that to physically dominate someone is to also sexually dominated someone. Sex and violence go hand in hand. Phallic symbols. Eight, the visual storytelling of the film because they help show Alex go from dominating to being dominated. He goes from overpowering everyone to literally being squished by authority.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Alien uses phallic symbols to convey fear. The writer of the film intentionally made alien contain rape imagery to make the film more terrifying.

Speaker 3:          04:37          One thing that people are all disturbed about if sex, everybody is always all in a not about sex. I said, that's how I'm going to attack the audience. I'm going to attack them sexually and I'm not going to go after the women in the audience. I'm going to attack the men and I'm going to put in every image. I can think of that. I know will make them in the audience, cross their legs, homosexual, rl, right, birth the thing, laser tags down your throat, the whole number,

Speaker 1:          05:05          the parallels between the alien attacks in real life rape, make the alien attacks more horrific, getting raped as a scary thing, and the writers use the horrors of rape to make the alien a scarier villain. The design of the alien is very phallic in the set pieces look equally as valid and vaginal. This design was done very intentionally by set designer hr Geiger kegers work with sexual, and that's the most mild thing you can say about it. It's the opening of the alien ship. Looks like two giant Vaginas on a 60 foot and set. We built that set. It wasn't a miniature show, my God from direct mouth inside alien to the face hugger laying eggs orally to the phallic chest. Buster, the whole alien is Phallic. You're looking at this sort of gray penis. Can I say that, but instead of using phallic symbols to show manliness or domination, alien uses phallic symbols to show us being sexually dominated by the alien.

Speaker 1:          05:56          The Phallic symbols evoke terror by making the human sexual victims to the alien. The Phallic symbols add to visual storytelling in the film by making the alien attacks visually and emotionally similar to sexual assault. Phallic symbols work even when they're subtle. A film like the social network is a perfect opportunity to use phallic symbols because the whole film revolves around the fight for power, sex, and high social status. The winklevoss twins take mark Zuckerberg to their final clubhouse as a way to show off their high status and power in order to help convince mark to work for them. They offer him a sandwich to further show off their luxuries and the way it's presented to them is just so oddly family

Speaker 4:          06:33          and then he holds it like this,

Speaker 1:          06:35          and then after mark questions, their idea and internally thinks of a better one, he holds the sandwich like this request,

Speaker 4:          06:43          myspace or friendster.

Speaker 1:          06:44          Is it just a coincidence? Maybe, but maybe not. There's definitely a point where the analysis of Phallic symbols becomes overkill. Sigmund Freud once said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Not everything that looks valic has some sexual meaning, but when used intentionally, a phallic symbol can be a powerful visual that adds meaning to what's happening on screen. So the next time you watch a film with your friends and notice a phallic symbol, feel free to point it out. Just don't be a huge dick about it.

Speaker 5:          07:09          You don't have to be a history major or a political scientist to see the bigger dick foreign policy theory. It sounds like this, what they have bigger dicks

Speaker 2:          07:20          bob

Speaker 5:          07:23          course, the bombs and the rockets and the bullets are all shaped like Dick. It's a subconscious need to project the penis into other people's affairs.

Speaker 4:          07:36          It's called fucking thanks for watching.
