Speaker 1:          00:13          Welcome to now you see it brought forth in art form, centered around seeing motion on the screen, but film is far more than only visual music plays a huge role in that heightened realism of what the fuck that means. Different film scores can completely alter the mood of a scene and filmmakers carefully pick their soundtracks or film scores to convey certain emotions or ideas. I want to look at the psychology of music, how our brains respond to different auditory stimulation in movies to talk about music in a film, I should distinguish between a soundtrack and a score. A film score is written specifically for what's happening on a screen while the soundtrack contained songs independent from the movie itself that weren't made only for the movie. Most films have both and one example is forest gump, which has a soundtrack of songs not solely associated with the movie and a film score with music written specifically and only for that to really understand the importance of the music in a film, you should compare final cuts of movies with the intended film score and cuts with removed or edited music. The famous psycho shower scene is so much less frightening without a score.

Speaker 1:          01:56          My favorite example to show the importance of music in a film is the altering of this scene in the pirates of the Caribbean, depending on the music, the seem to become triumphant, creepy or comical. Using music to psychologically altruist scene has been around the silent era. Silent movies used to be accompanied with a live piano player who would play along with the movie. At first, the music didn't interact with the movie at all and was only there to avoid silence in the theater, but later piano players would either improvise a lot with the movie or receive sheet music to play. Along with the psychology of the accompaniment was pretty straightforward. When the screen shows a villain, the piano player plays a diminished minor chord, which sounds Erie and unnerving. Heroes get uplifting anthems. Chase scenes have a fast tempo and sad scenes are slow and early. Psychological musical techniques set the standard for film scores in modern cinema, and while the orchestras have gotten bigger and the score is more effective, the general ideas of silent film, piano, a company might have remained the same.

Speaker 1:          04:43          The shower scene in psycho is a perfect example of the psychology of music in film. In the scene, Mary Crane gets stabbed to death in the shower, and the scene features one of the most effective film scores in history. This screeching sound of the violin mimic sounds we biologically associate with stress and danger. The sound mimics cry for help. A study by the University of California in 2010 found that nonlinear alarm sounds give us an emotional response that instinctively unsettles us psychologically, Bernard Herman, that composer of psycho purposefully constructed the film score to mimic these unsettling noises and the effect makes the scene significantly scarier and more unsettling.

Speaker 2:          05:17          Right?

Speaker 1:          05:23          In Jaws, we hear the music before we see any danger. This technique unsettles us in a different way. The anticipation of the danger is what makes each scene so scary. The fact that we know something bad is about to happen and the characters in the movie don't know, add suspense to the scene. We are warned of the danger through the film score and have no choice but to watch the horror unfold as the music slowly speeds up, so does the camera and we feel psychological terror from the disorder of the music and the anticipation of the inevitable.

Speaker 1:          06:00          The majority of film scores, though purposefully stay in the background and only provide subtle cues to the audience. Film score pioneer Aaron Copland gave five ways a score serves the screen and most of them stay in the background. The first is to create a more convincing atmosphere of time. Place. This one is pretty self explanatory. Many genres and settings have their own style of music to go with. The style of the film score puts us into a particular setting or genre. A classic example would be the Western, which has a very distinct sound, so when bill and Ted go back in time to the west, the music changes along with them. How's it going on Western?

Speaker 2:          06:35          Just like friends

Speaker 1:          06:37          cheerla. Yeah. Second music can underline psychological refinements, unspoken thoughts or unseen, dangerous get shown or reinforced through the music. We may not see the danger, but the music reminds us. It's their traced. The call is coming from inside though

Speaker 2:          06:57          to cut and edit any muggins you just.

Speaker 3:          07:04          That's weird. Yesterday I went food shopping for like 15 minutes. I used a computer before I went to the store and when I came back, my history, it was gone. The cash was cleared and the cookies had been reset.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Third is to build a sense of continuity. It's the music between shots or scenes is the same. We relate those scenes to each other. This includes montages or flashbacks.

Speaker 2:          07:29          Excellent

Speaker 1:          07:32          citizen king uses musical cues as an indicator of a flashback. He was with Mr Kane and me the first day Mr Kane took over the choir in. Catch me if you can. The music is acute that the chase is on. Fourth is to give a sense of finality, copland's notes that this takes place usually at the end of the film or after some major trial. The triumph that sound of the music psychologically links us to the triumph on screen, and finally Coplin says, sometimes music is just there to fill the silence. Interestingly, he states that this is the hardest films court to do because the audience shouldn't notice it. Holiday that recognizes that May 21st

Speaker 4:          09:11          other mother's Day. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          09:19          Thanks.

Speaker 1:          09:25          In a clockwork orange, Kubrick has uplifting orchestra music play while extreme acts of violence occur on screen, the contradiction between comfort and classical music and destruction that adds tension and to scores enhance the emotion of a scene, but sometimes directors choose to not use any music in this can work just as well. In no country for old men, the vast majority of the movie has no music but mostly dialogue in ambient noise and it totally works. Hearing nothing but a man's struggle for his life is pretty menacing. The storming of the beach scene and saving private Ryan overwhelms the senses with the sounds of gunshots. Explosions and cries for help

Speaker 2:          10:11          instead of a film score.

Speaker 1:          10:27          Our brains often subconsciously react differently to a visual given the music playing behind it. I think it's really interesting because of how subtle film scores can be and yet how vital they are to a movie. The psychology of music is one of the most important cinematic techniques and fill the emotional infomatic potential of these techniques is limitless, and I've only scratched the surface. So take your favorite film, watch it again, and pay close attention to the music and how it enhanced the film. Maybe without you even noticing. How does that sound? Thanks for watching.

Speaker 2:          10:58          I love the books that I recommended, even if he didn't. Glen funding dream.
