Speaker 1:          00:00          In 1922 Soviet filmmakers, Iga bear 12 wrote about his hatred of dw Griffith and other popular directors at the time for making movies that he called carbon copies of novels in theater. The camera is a boring objective. Spectator watching the action unfolds and there must be a plot relate to the viewer with title cards. He calls it leprose mortally dangerous and contagious. His response was a man with a movie camera, a documentary that changed the way people made movies forever. The caber becomes a character in the movie showing us how we pulls off his different shots. He made strides in slow motion, double exposure and split screens. He makes his goal very clear in the title sequence. No sets, no actors, no scripts, no title cards, only the absolute language of cinema on the basis of its complete separation from the language of theater and the novel and it's in this way of thinking that he used the then experimental Dutch angle, which shows him several times in the movie along with the other camera innovations.

Speaker 1:          00:49          And while he was not the first to use the Dutch angle, he knew exactly how to do it. The Dutch angle exploded in the 90s and early two thousands appearing just about everywhere from action movies to soak commercials. The problem comes from using the shot as a crutch to make a boring shot. Interesting. Just tilt the camera. Battlefield Earth was over 90% Dutch angles as Roger Ebert put it. The director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why the tradition goes right up to four in 2011 director Kenneth Brando says he was going for a comic book look, but I think there's more to looking like a comic book than adding Dutch angles to half the movie. I also can't help but find it kind of cheesy when it's used to make the villains crooked, and that's probably because of where that idea first came from.

Speaker 1:          01:32          The dynamic joe at the school. What I'm trying to say is these movies don't capture the spirit of the shot. The most important movie for Dutch angles is arguably the cabinet of Dr Caligari in 1920 the movie was years ahead of American cinema at the time. It's incredible use of shadows and light, angular set pieces and twist. Ending brought expressionism from literature and paintings to the big screen. This daring German style quickly found its way into American cinema. The extreme lighting defined the film noir and the horror elements found their way into all kinds of blockbusters.

Speaker 2:          02:01          I had a quad strong German and crunch by walking up the poop. A is burned it

Speaker 1:          02:08          fluence goes right up to Tim Burton set pieces and character design. He never directly sites German influence, but there's no doubt his work screams expressionism and even he mixes in the Dutch angle and his expressionistic movies. I like when you sit to exaggerate the mundane like losing your bicycle.

Speaker 1:          02:27          The most crucial aspect of the cabinet of Dr Caligari is the introduction of subjective filmmaking. This movie was the first twist ending in film history when Francis is actually in an insane asylum and his experiences are delusions. The movie presents its world in a subjective way. What we see is not reality, but actually the subjective experience of the narrator. So all the movie doesn't have explicit camera tilts. The tilting of the set and the tilting of the narrative introduces the idea that movies can be hyper realistic and more than filming traditional set pieces. Movies can be subjective, so really the Dutch angle arises out of two movements, the Soviet experimental documentary and German expressionism. One movement introduced the innovative camera techniques focusing entirely on the cinematic aspects and the other focused on how the theatrical and artistic elements could be subjective and unique. Maybe the perfect use of the Dutch angle comes into third man and incredible Nawar about the black market in post World War II Vienna, the landscape of Vienna is the German expressionist vision come to life with its Jari angles and rooms landscape.

Speaker 1:          03:23          You can't help but notice the similarities in the crooked ruins of Vienna and the bizarre set pieces of the cabinet of Dr Caligari in the third man, the camera itself acts as another tilt in the already crooked world of post World War II vianna and sometimes the camera doesn't even need to tell because the street does it by itself within the frame lines of all sorts of angles. Add to the angle created from the camera tilts. The Dutch angle contributes to the distortion already on screen giving cinema a way of adding uncertainty that no other art form can do, not in theater and not in the novel, but the crooked angles do more than enhance the landscape. During Holly's questioning of each witness, the crooked angles make their confessions feel a bit off and reminds you never to be quite sure who to believe. During Harry's monologue, the ferris wheel tilts while the camera holds steady creatively integrating Dutch angles into the shot.

Speaker 1:          04:09          If fits nicely with Harry's personality as his dialogue quickly switches from playful justin to threatening murder. Okay, so look for a bullet wound up to that ground. The crooked vianna landscape, ambiguous characters, extreme lighting and plot twist, echo the design of German expressionism in the experimentation of the Soviet documentary. It's a movie begging to have Dutch angles. Many more recent movies used to shot in similar ways and die hard villain. Hans Gruber pretend he's just a civilian during his back and forth with John mcclane, every shot is at least a little bit tilted. This medium shot on Hans is the most tilted in the scene. His shadow is long and exaggerated. The camera is off center and the tension is perfect. As soon as John mcclane gives them a gun, the seem feels just like the third man. The Dutch angle tilt adds to the uncertainty of the moment. We know something and we're not sure John McLean has any idea and for all we know he could get killed any second. Maybe I prefer this reveal over lameness because it's so obvious in Lima's they're villains. The Dutch angle feels forced. The shots seems to fit better in moments of tension and uncertainty when things aren't as they should be. It's no coincidence that a movie with many great Dutch angles is called [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          05:10          I liked the way they make you feel. It's been a bit of controversy about them as people feel that they call too much attention to themselves. But actually, you know, I just watch all the movies that are filled with Dutch angles and you don't realize it because they use them so much. It doesn't particularly mean anything.

Speaker 1:          05:25          And even all these years later, the movies with well thought out Dutch angles still have the expressionism then out in back of the same apartment buildings with these German expressionistic alleys and they also have the experimentation

Speaker 3:          05:39          in a producer's came in and said lucky and I also got to shoot it four square in case this doesn't work. Which I certainly couldn't blame them for doing what I ended up liking it very much. They even put it in the trailer.

Speaker 1:          05:52          The kind of Dutch angles I enjoy seem to be the ones that stay true to where the shot came from. The English shows what makes filmmaking unique through its emotional manipulation of a scene. So when your moment features the classic unsettling nature of the cabinet of Dr Caligari, then it's perfect. And when you use it just because it looks cool, it seems to lose some weight, but I'm not trying to say that there's some obvious way to use the Dutch angle. It's a very emotional shot. You may enjoy how it feels and movies that I don't, and we're both right or you could say I'm looking too far into the shot and the Dutch angle is just a way to tilt the camera to make us seem interesting. But I think if you look more closely, you can see how the shot means quite a lot. The shot in many ways represents the original intent of directors to use filmmaking as a unique art form. That tilting of the camera is the purest form of subjective filmmaking. The unease of the Dutch angle makes cinema special because you can't do it in theater or the novel, and when it's used, it pushes boundaries for what movies are capable of. So what I'm saying is the Dutch angle is a perfect representation of what makes movies better than all that other crap.
