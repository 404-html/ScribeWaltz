Speaker 1:          00:03          Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You ain't heard nothing yet. You ain't heard nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:08          You want it. This moment in the jazz singer in 1928 led to standing ovations in movie theaters. The first moment of dialogue marked at the beginning of a boom in the motion picture industry improving sales from 1928 to 1929 despite the beginning of the Great Depression.

Speaker 1:          00:27          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Warner brothers surged and profits from 2 million to 14 million a year as millions flock to these talkies, which for the first few years consisted mostly of musicals. Talking provided a layer of realism missing and movies by allowing more character development and plot innovation in radio and television writing paved the way for strong dialogue driven movies. 12 angry men is written in such a way that you can follow the entire story with your eyes closed.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Oh can to chalk and told even when it's an open and shut case like this one image of the innocent which drug about no. Well I guess their own title,

Speaker 2:          00:57          Nick tensity and pace. That's impossible for a completely silent movie to achieve. I want to talk about dialogue and look at how dialogue enhances the story while also seeing its limitations. Probably the biggest immediate benefit of dialogue is it's just so damn efficient.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Hello, are you captain with me? Whatever you're doing in Arizona, I'm joining Richard Lord Vick. He's there with his truth. The lock narrowed and accurate with Mallory, he's been I to have to drive far right. That's the next top of the stage coach. You'll be with your husband in a few hours

Speaker 2:          01:25          from 10 seconds of dialogue. We know who lucy is, where she is, where she's going and why she's going there, what her husband does, where her husband is, where the stage coach stops next and how long it should take until the couple is reunited. Dialogue is quick and easy, but exposition through dialogue runs the risk of being boring like when we have to sit through a villain monologuing his evil plan through a computer. I think voiceover narration can be a lazy substitute for strong, efficient dialogue on screen, although sometimes there is no other way to do it. There are right and wrong ways to do exposition dialogue. Let's say a character, his parents died. Shit dialogue. Tell us like this. Oh, well mama good. I don't know. They're, they're gone. They died when I was three. Remember? Or like this, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:05          leave it. Both

Speaker 2:          02:11          mom would allow it. Expositions should be descriptive and also not completely plain. It's the difference between saying something and revealing something. I call it the dead parent test for dialog because so many movies seem to have trouble telling us a parent isn't around anymore. My mother's name was Susan. She was killed in a car accident with my father and they're both dead. So stop trying to bring up dialogue. Should reveal a character isn't in the picture. Instead of just saying it out loud, it doesn't always have to be through dialogue and it can even be comedic. Oh. And she inexplicably mails me a cactus every Valentine's Day and I'm like, thanks to heat, coyote ugly. This cactus Graham stinks. Even worse than your abandonment, but it just has to reveal something instead of saying it, it passes the dead parent test if it's not completely dry. Because frankly just saying is lazy writing. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:08          And with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned, forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone on board.

Speaker 2:          03:16          I think the same idea goes for dialogue that explores the movie's made sure ideas. Interstellar is a gorgeous movie, but this dialogue is very heavy handed and just being set

Speaker 3:          03:24          is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that even if we can't understand it yet,

Speaker 2:          03:37          maybe it's better to have themes hidden and more ordinary dialogue

Speaker 1:          03:40          and fuck the Air Force Academy. If I want to fly, I'll find a way to fly

Speaker 2:          03:46          or revealing the teams through visuals. Dialogue always serves a narrative or comedic purpose. No matter how random it feels, impulse fiction, the dialogue feels meaningless, but it sets up major plot points and conflict. Vinson and jewel's have a 10 minute conversation about whether or not it's cheating for a man to give a woman a foot rub

Speaker 1:          04:01          and look, I can even a million ladies and then your foot massages and they all meant something. Or we act like they don't, but they do. I mean, it's just so fucking cool. That is a centralist thing going on where where you know you don't talk about it, but you know what? She knows it. Fuck Marcella. Snoop and Antwan should've fucking better known better

Speaker 2:          04:19          this conversation while at the surface, very casual reinforces that Marcellus walls is not to be trifled with as Vincent spends his night with Mrs. Wallace, that earlier conversation reminds us that the stakes are high and Vincent May or may not be overstepping his boundaries.

Speaker 1:          04:32          Well Dan, you're going to shit. Good night. I've had a very lovely walk out the door and get in the car, go home, jerk off and I saw you going to do

Speaker 2:          04:42          Tarantino uses dialogue to show character flaws. Jolson, Vincent, get a Great Cup of coffee and praise it in an attempt to be polite to Jimmy. All it does is make him mad cause jewels and Vincent are not focused on the crisis they just created. But you know what's on my mind right now. It ain't the coffee in my kitchen. It's the dead nigger in my garage. Their signature swab and charming dialogue failed them. But Winston Wolfe, he knows the appropriate way to respond because he's the wolf.

Speaker 2:          05:12          Terentino's dialogue has masterfully layer. They may be talking about nothing, but in actuality the dialogue foreshadows the major conflicts in the rest of the movie. You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize. Don't listen to anybody that says dialogue is bad and visuals are always better in film. It's just false. Dialogue is beautiful, revealing at hilarious. Just know when to use it. I am the Walrus. Shut the fuck up. Donnie, the island and bladder Murry Elliot Joliet off the fuck is he talking about? If you like this topic, you should check out channel Creswell's video on the same idea. He talks about dialogue with even more depth than I did. Also a big thanks to all my patrion supporters and follow me at my ridiculous twitter handle. Swag thug for life. Thanks for watching.
