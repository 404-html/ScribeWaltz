Speaker 1:          00:00          Fear of terrorism is widespread in America. Many Americans have actually changed how they live their daily lives. A significant number of Americans say they avoided sporting events, concerts, and other public events because of their fear of terrorism.

Speaker 2:          00:15          Let me ask you a question. What are people most afraid of? You may think it's insects or natural disasters or even public speaking, but an extensive survey conducted by Chapman University in Twenty 15 said the biggest fears and Americans are cited as the quote manmade disasters. These fears include bio warfare, terrorism, and nuclear attacks. Forty four percent of Americans are afraid or very afraid of terrorist attacks. Compare that to 28 percent for public speaking and 25 percent for insects. Fear of terrorism actually peaked following nine slash 11, as the majority of Americans will worried that they or someone they knew would be a victim of a terrorist attack. I want to suggest that what the public fears is mirrored in Hollywood cinema, especially the Zombie movies directly following nine slash 11. But to start, we have to go back in time to the horror movies of the 19 fifties. So let me rephrase the first question. What were people most afraid of? Insane. Nineteen 51.

Speaker 1:          01:03          We all know the atomic bomb is very dangerous that may be used against us. We must get ready for it.

Speaker 2:          01:09          With the Korean War, Soviet nuclear testing and mccarthyism in full force. In 1950 polls showed an astounding 68 percent of Americans thought the Soviet Union would use an atomic weapon against the United States. This fear was even used later as a scare tactic in an infamous campaign ad by Lyndon Johnson showing just how powerful the fear was on the pump.

Speaker 3:          01:28          What are the stakes? And all of God's children are to go into the dark. We must either love each other are we must die.

Speaker 2:          01:44          So how did horror movies reflect this fear? The 19 fifties brought on a wave of disaster movies were aliens are monsters attack like war of the worlds, the Blob, and the thing from another world. When you watch battle scenes from the original war of the worlds or attack of the 50 foot woman or Godzilla, you notice the parallels between these horror movies and the destructive nature of the atomic bomb. In fact, the director of Godzilla was very blunt about his intentions with the now iconic monster. He said, quote, the theme of the film from the beginning was the tear of the bond. Mankind had created the bottom and now nature was going to take revenge on mankind for Americans. However, the fear was channeled towards the Soviet Union, our biggest global threat at the time, in the same way that Godzilla stomps on buildings and is immune to bullets, so to win an atomic bomb, wipe out cities and be entirely unstoppable by us.

Speaker 2:          02:29          Maybe it's no coincidence that the Japanese film Godzilla was such a huge success in America. The Japanese fear of the bomb was just as relevant to Americans at the time. Now, let's jump to the 21st century. We're no longer threatened by a huge visible global superpower. Actually, the fear of terrorism is quite the opposite. It's nothing like Godzilla. A giant monster who drops in on a city, a terrorist hides in the shadows, disguise themselves as an everyday citizen and causes society to collapse from the inside out. So here's my point. It doesn't. The method of destruction for a terrorist sound a like the method of destruction for Izombie. First, it's important to note the explosion of the Zombie Genre. Io Nine posted a nice graph showing a boom in Zombie movies in the early two thousands paralleling with mainstream video games like resident evil and call of duty and spilling into other media like the TV show, the walking dead.

Speaker 2:          03:14          There's no doubt that zombies have infected the public conscience. Twenty eight days later is one of the first successful Zombie movies to come out following nine slash 11, and it highlights contemporary fears of terrorism and decay of social order. The scene that most strongly ties the movie to terrorist fears is actually the very first scene. The deadly virus is created in a lab by making chimpanzees watch footage of Arabic mobs, fighting police, burning cars and beating each other up. This virus is literally created from Arabic violence. I particularly like this shot, which makes the human look like it's regressing back into a terrifying animal. An important element of the Zombie genre is that the enemy comes inside a community and spreads from person to person. This sounds eerily similar to the method of attack for a terrorist. Sleeper cell hides within our board was ready to strike and once we can finally spot it, it's too late to stop. I think another key difference between fifties, monster movies and Zombie movies is the role of the government. In monster movies, the government often fights against the enemy, but in 28 days later, the government hasn't

Speaker 4:          04:09          abandoned them. There's no government horses to go home and there's always a government during a bunker or plane. There's no government police.

Speaker 2:          04:22          Not only that, but in the movie, the soldiers actually fight against the protagonist. In the 21st century with the controversial invasion of Iraq and government surveillance, terrorism has brought on a distrust of our own government where the 19 fifties government was always joining in the fight against a common enemy. It appears that during a Zombie apocalypse, we shouldn't count on any government to protect us. What's so special about cinema is that it's such a democratic art form when it comes to art forms like painting, music or creative writing. The message is only channeled through one person, but with cinema, the final work is the product of dozens of people. Not only that, but a production process as expensive as making a movie requires that mainstream movies appeal to as many people as possible. As a result, movies tend to be a window into the general mindset of the society it was made in.

Speaker 2:          05:04          This means that the subject matter of the successful horror movie has in its subtext, a reflection of the general fears of the environment it was made in. There are things that regardless of time period and society, humans are scared of. The dark is a universal fear because we can't identify the threat. So a movie like don't breed seems to do well because like jaws and the ending of silence of the lambs, it's scary when the threat can see you, but you can't see that it's a timeless fear. But what about fears that do change over time? I talked about monster movies versus Zombie movies, but I also think mainstream horror movies about religion or another perfect example, religion is at an all time low in the United States. More importantly, the fear of damnation is low, meaning that religious groups tend to spend less time on the pain and torment of hell in their teachings and more time on the love and forgiveness that comes from salvation.

Speaker 2:          05:50          This idea is especially true in the Catholic Church who revised their catechism in 1994 to remove the literary fire and description of hell in favor of a metaphorical place, symbolizing the loss of one's faith. So how is this idea shown in modern movies around 40 or so years ago? Most movies about the supernatural centered around religion. The devil is often the center villain. In successful movies like Rosemary's baby, the omen and the exorcist nowadays, those supernatural beings are still present, but religion is largely ignored. The ghost is a former mental patient or some unexplained being. The exorcist is about a child being possessed by the devil or Finn has a very similar premise, a child who is acting strangely, but religion is hardly even mentioned. The fact is that people don't find the devil as scary as they used to, partly due to less religion and partly due to a conscious choice to focus less on damnation in religious doctrine. There's no doubt that there are detectable trends in what horror movies choose to find scary. If you want to know what people are afraid of, you could run an expensive and time consuming statistical study, or you could just look at what horror movies they find scary, so the next time someone says, don't be scared, it's just a movie. Don't believe them. Thanks for watching.

Speaker 5:          06:57          Slightly full break from the norm. Just a little slot in the need of all back home.
