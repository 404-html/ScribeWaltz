Speaker 1:          00:00          Nope. Yes. Stupid Pass. Then you've got the arms left. Yes, I have

Speaker 2:          00:05          just a flesh wound in life. When somebody gets injured, it's just a stroke of bad luck. But in movies, it's never an accident. An injury is a calculated and meaningful choice by a writer or director to tell us more about a character or reinforce certain thematic ideas. Each injury, whether it's blindness or becoming handicapped, represents the symbolic handicap captain who they are as a character. And many of the most memorable characters and movie moments were greatly enhanced by this literary concept. So let's give some characters at diagnosis. Oh No, I just keep bringing it up. What do you get back in again? First, I have to convince you that injuries are much more than just physical in the film. So let's say we have a character returning from combat adjusting to civilian life. How do we show his inner conflict symbolically? Give him a limp. A limp literally hinders his mobility, reflecting his struggle to adapt to this new lifestyle. Um, I know that you'll therapist thing, so limp psychosomatic, correct camera, right? So when he gets the thrill of the chase and the limp finally goes away, we know what that means.

Speaker 3:          00:59          You said you forgot this.

Speaker 2:          01:03          The ability to stand and walk normally is a symbol of strength and self confidence. Why do you think the secret service didn't allow any pictures taken of FDR in a wheelchair? Walking or the lack of it makes for a powerful image in forrest gump. Lieutenant Dad's character arc. It gets represented through his injuries. He wants to die a hero on the battlefield. When he fails, he loses the ability to walk. His injury directly contrasts forrest who went from handicap to always running in later scenes. Lieutenant Dans frustration is always shown through his reliance on others to move because he can't move himself where he wants to be. When he finally gets as close as he can to the heavens, challenging the fate he was supposed to have. That's when he finally moves on his own and eventually I got new legs custom made titanium alloy.

Speaker 2:          01:46          The fixing of an injury always reflects the way a character, his inner self is being fixed too. If you want to character to have a crutch in their psyche, give them a literal one. There will be blood starts with theory scenes depicting the dangerous world of drilling underground. Daniel plainview breaks is like falling into a well and has to crawl all the way from the well in the middle of nowhere to the nearest town through an injury and how he beats it. We learned about his ruthlessness better than dialogue could ever tell us. It's in a way that justifies his actions in the movie as much of a bastard as this man proves himself to be that courage that it would have taken to do that actually gives him the heroic right for almost everything that he does throughout the rest of the movie. But it doesn't always have to be grandiose. You can even give a character a fake injury to play with our expectations.

Speaker 2:          02:45          Bonnie and Clyde Clyde cutoff his toe to get out of doing work in prisons, and this impairment relates directly to sexual impotence with Bonnie in literature and film. A physical ailment can often indicate a sexual element. For a man, he's limped in more ways than one. I ain't much of a loverboy in rear window. Jeff is physically bound to a wheelchair. He doesn't want to marry you. Lisa and his physical restrictions from his injury compliment his view that he's perhaps being sexually restricted as well off to act, but what about characters like professor x and Yoda? They both have issues with walking, but there's some of the most powerful characters in their worlds. I think a lot of mentors have physical handicaps because it reflects how they pay for mind over body. They've transcended physical limitations to the point where it doesn't reflect weakness, a similar injury, his blindness, this trope goes as far back as oedipus rex when the blind man can tell the future.

Speaker 2:          03:35          While oedipus is the ones seeing things incorrectly in movies, not being tricked by the world around you seems to give you a spiritual wisdom instead. Also, have you ever noticed that every superhero has a movie where they lose their powers, they can't shoot webs, they don't have their suit or they get blasted with Kryptonite? It's because when your life is threatened to when you're no longer invincible, benny become relatable because what's more human than being mortal when to pretty much invincible superheros fight. It's kind of boring. Where are the stakes? How can we relate to them? Iti was such a revolutionary movie because for the first time the Ilien wasn't a giant monster, huge impenetrable creature. He was innocent and most importantly he could get sick making him human. I think one of my favorite examples of bringing out humanity through injuries is in terminator two Arnold Schwarzenegger is an emotionless robot, but by the end of the movie he grows on you and it comes from his selflessness and how he lets himself get hurt.

Speaker 2:          04:22          Even with no sympathetic dialogue and no discernible emotion and a murderer streak. The terminators still gets a hug in the end and we empathize with him because he got hurt. You know what? Here's the thing about die hard, die hard one. The original John McLean, just this normal guy, you know, he's just a normal New York City cop who gets his feet cut and gets beat up, but he's an everyday guy and die hard for, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter air, you know, he's invincible. At the end of the day, major injuries reminds you of your mortality and may make you reconsider what's important to you and film the same principles apply. So the next time somebody gets hurt, remember that it's never just a flesh wound.

Speaker 4:          05:04          Come back here and take off kind of by though. Thanks for watching.

Speaker 5:          05:12          You said.
