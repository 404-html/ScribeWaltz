Speaker 1:          00:00          At 3:00 in the morning, I didn't know he was sending me to get on at first.

Speaker 2:          00:04          The setup for this is that is that his limo driver says he's got to stop somewhere, so he stops in the ghetto. It's Dave in the ghetto. In a limo. Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 3:          00:13          Huh.

Speaker 1:          00:17          That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:17          But the thing is that you do exactly what I what a honky would do in the ghetto.

Speaker 3:          00:25          Right?

Speaker 1:          00:26          Right. And I was crack the window a little bit. The job starts out in a limousine. I knew he was taking to the ghetto because I'm looking out the window. I'm like gunstock, snow and snow. So. Okay. There's a little statement, but it's not preachy. It's not painting the picture. Paint a picture. Right. Then we get to the ghetto. That was in Washington. I saw some kids running around playing and I was like, who has the kids just running out on the streets like this and this. Maybe it could be in trouble. He might need my help. I got to do something, but I wasn't gonna get out the car. Okay. True Story. Now did the baby talk to me? No, was was selling weed. No, what? I was making a point and here I am a black man in a limousine, now we're getting into the class issues right in the ghetto. So it's true than just I pride myself on saying real shit that people don't even notice I'm saying, but they feel it because when people come up to me, they they say that I love. I love that they can feel it, but I don't think they really know. So when you pointed that out, I was very impressed. Man. Was your early comedy autobiographical? It's yes, but never directly. I don't want to give away my secret recipe. Want to know what happened to me

Speaker 4:          02:00          on the new season of the sopranos or the Dave Chappelle, so received.

Speaker 1:          02:05          If the $5,000,000

Speaker 3:          02:13          shit on TV though

Speaker 4:          02:16          Chappelle supposedly had it all, a $50,000,000 contract from comedy central, a hit TV show, best selling dvds on April 28th of last year. Dave abruptly walked away not only from the set of the show but for $50, million dollars, which he left his fans shock and most everyone completely puzzled.

Speaker 2:          02:37          One of the most promising comedians of recent history have left a successful television series. How could he have walked away from a $50,000,000 contract?

Speaker 1:          02:46          Hey, where do you start telling them this story and when I'm walking down the street and be like, Hey, this right. You tell it how it is. Not really. I don't really know what it is. I just say what it feels. I'll tell you what happened, but I can't say it directly.

Speaker 5:          03:04          There's a book

Speaker 1:          03:06          to me that encapsulates my entire experience before I left the show.

Speaker 1:          03:13          In the book is called Pimp, written by a black American who was a pimping the forties. He describes in detail how these men break women so that they will give them the money that they make with their own bodies because a guy that generates money, people have a vested interest in controlling. There's a story in his so cold. It makes me shudder to think about it. The iceberg slim is trying to control the woman that he finds uncontrollable. I will go to work on this show and I felt awful. Every day felt like some kind of prostitute or something like that, but I feel so bad. Why keep showing up to this place? So he asked older how it can rein her in and the older pimps says, oh, that's easy iceberg. All you have to do is beat that bitch with a coat hanger. I felt like, you know, in a lot of instances I was deliberately being put the stress and then run her bath and give him some pills. Have you tried to get me to take psychotic medication? She'll be so grateful that you fixed the shoe for good. You will the motherfucker that beat them in the first place. I forgot the hostility of the environment of Showbiz. Maybe there's something else going on. Maybe these rapes aren't even the worst of it. Wouldn't that be something?

Speaker 5:          04:33          Wouldn't that be something? Now?

Speaker 1:          04:36          End of this book, Iceberg Slim tells the story is kind of the crescendo of the book iceberg. Slim's bottom bitch is at the end of a mileage. Choose bubbling. You could see she was going crazy. They had to let it go. It's hard to let it go, a bottom bitch go and he wasn't ready to let it go because it's organization couldn't handle losing her for days released and it fits all these incredible records. Know like how many central was a hot place to be. When I showed up there, he said, okay, this guy in an hotel across the street, it's waiting for you in room number seven when should go over there and I want you to fuck them, but before you do and he to put some of this stuff in this drink.

Speaker 6:          05:14          I slept a small vial of mineral oil into her poem. I told her it was chloral hydrate, only two drops. We're not to suck out.

Speaker 1:          05:23          She said, I did everything you said, but. But then Mandel look right some wrong. Daddy, do you mean something's wrong? Bitch? Did you put that stuff in his drink? She said, I did everything. He said that I put all of it in his drink. He said, wait a minute, bitch, wait a minute. You put all of it in his drink.

Speaker 6:          05:38          I knelt beside him, blocking her view with my back. I wiped my brow and turned my face to water. My eyes were wide and alarm. I said, baby,

Speaker 1:          05:51          he's dead. I think. All right, bitch. Let me think.

Speaker 6:          05:58          I can fix this for you. She squeezed tightly against me. I kept telling her she had nothing to worry about. After all, we went together for life and her secret would always be safe with me. She found out about the hoax years later.

Speaker 1:          06:16          That's how the whole shit works. Ladies, you understand? This bitch was at the end of the mileage. She was at four 98. She ended up triggering for iceberg for another six months. She must have done another 200 tricks for them. Do you understand? No like the whore that they turned us into, jumped on that plane and left my father's bedside, which are granted his day and I went out and I sat with these people in this room and

Speaker 6:          06:42          you got to make them have hard and fast to stick them for the long scratch. Quip. So slim, be as sweet as scratch. No sweeter and always stick a hole for bundle before you sexy. Oh, Ho ain't nothing but a trick to a pimp

Speaker 1:          07:01          whole Dave chappelle thing is going to end, but I feel like I'm going to be some kind of parable by either what you're supposed to do with what you nasty. Well, I'm going to be something. I'm either going to be a legend or just that tragic story, but I'm going full throttle. I'm going on way. I want to. I'm. I'm eager to find out how this will resolve itself. The idea of being courageous is that even though you're scared, you just do the right thing. Anyway, so in 2004, I walked away from $15,000,000 and in November I made a deal for $60,000,000. Are you having fun this time around? I am making a point to have fun in the store. Yes.
