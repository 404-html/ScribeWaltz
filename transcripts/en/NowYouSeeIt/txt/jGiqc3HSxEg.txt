Speaker 1:          00:00          You are tearing me apart, Lisa, when you think of so bad, it's good. You probably think of some movie with laughably horrible acting and writing a movie that's so bad. It becomes really fun to watch you watch it and make fun of it with your friends because such a bad movie takes itself so seriously, so bad. It's good. Movies go as far back as the b movies of the forties and fifties the concept has always been the same. They're guilty pleasure movies where you enjoyed the movie because of its excessive use of movie tropes. Pour over the top acting and terrible camera work and it makes sense. It's not hard to see the similar laugh ability of robot monster in 1953 and shark NATO. The problem is analysis of so bad. It's good. Usually stops there, but I think you can go much deeper than that. I want to talk about what's at the core of this phenomenon and make the case that the techniques of so bad, it's good, are present in tons of critically acclaimed movies and almost all the time it's done on purpose. So let me explain

Speaker 2:          00:51          Michael. Walk with me

Speaker 1:          00:54          so bad. It's good. Movies are an extreme version of the idea that audiences enjoy theatrical and over the top movies that's still take themselves seriously. This concept is called camp and it's another tool at the disposal of a filmmaker. When you think of campy movies, you may think they're always made unintentionally, like Tommy Wise Owl China film a serious movie and accidentally creating the ultimate camp classic. But that's actually not the case. Doctors constantly pretend to take their dumb movie seriously to create a whole new level of entertainment. But if everybody is earnest and serious and treating it like it's a, you know, a regular earthquake or it's you know, an alien invasion, whatever it is, yeah. Then then that sincerity kind of translate it so then you can go even further with your villain, which is the shark. Naomi do crazy stuff and that makes it even more funny.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Yeah. Camp isn't necessarily a genre of movies. Some movies can have elements of camp without exclusively considering themselves so bad. It's good. Maybe the perfect balance of camp and sincerity is the princess bride. The movie is actually smartly written and well executed while also having a ton of campy and corny moments is similar. This fellow, I hate Tequila. You seem decent fan. I hate to die. The source site blurs the line between cartoonish and serious. The stakes are high and the scene is expertly choreographed, but they also do random flips. Campton makes the princess bride fun to watch without making it a movie. People make fun of. It's over the top, but never too much so, and it always treats itself seriously. Camp can actually sometimes save a movie. Johnny Depp's performance turns the pirates of the Caribbean from a derivative action flick to a charming and hilarious franchise and it's because of his can't be exaggerated but grounded performance.

Speaker 2:          02:27          You want without doubt the worst pirate type of what you have heard of it.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Wes Anderson is a champion of camp. His set pieces are famously symmetrical to the point of impossibility. The camera constantly spins from one character to another. He loves using outdated cartoonish, special effects. Any awkwardly cuts conversations at the end of each sentence. Why do you consider me your enemy? Cause your girlfriend's stemming back. Lefty scissors. She's my wife now. Congratulations. Anderson creates charming and critically acclaimed films. Despite breaking countless film conventions, can't be film techniques, give movies that extra flair that makes them fun and devastating me. Rewatch Hubble can't be filmmakers strike the balance between the impossible and the realistic so that movies have elements of camp while also having just a hint of seriousness so they don't seem like they're trying too hard.

Speaker 3:          03:18          Well, for me, the Reno Rafe is playing a real person and making him a real person. And um, even though the context is this sort of invented country in this invented version of history and so on, I sorta feel like we just try to make it as realistic as it can be given, given what it is. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Saturated and campy filmmaking happens all the time. So this becomes this,

Speaker 4:          03:50          this becomes this

Speaker 1:          03:58          Quintin Tarantino loves camp. If you have a villain, make it a school girl and give her a flail as a weapon. His love for the theatrical and exaggerated shows in the fact that in all of his movies, characters pretend to be somebody, they're not. Come on, get care. The result is hilariously over the top, but serious moments of poor or flashy acting.

Speaker 3:          04:17          I leave it there. I leave it itchy and either that or we ever, Derek

Speaker 1:          04:22          camp is also extremely common in dialogue. So many movies have characters say things nobody says in real life. This is one doodle that can't be undid ohms skillet, but that doesn't make the dialogue bad. Well, sometimes it does. I did not hit her. It's not true. It's bullshit. I did not have her. I did not. Oh, hi mark. But it's also a way to make movies fun. Aaron Sorkin is one of the best screenwriters in cinema, and he loves campy dialogue. In many scenes, he favors exaggerated dialogue over what someone would actually say. Yes, sir. Punch me in the face. Go ahead, Aaron. Sorkin's famous walk and talk style from West Wing feels extremely theatrical and contrived. It's been reused to the point that it's been parodied in just about every TV Sitcom. He even parodies at himself. Walk with me. Amerisource Sorkin, his snappy dialogue also gets reused to an amazing degree, which is you and me talking. Dana, I'm not other people. I'm not other people. I'm not other paper. I'm not. Other people don't talk to me like I'm other people, but it's not bad writing. It actually takes a very talented writer to create a style that's so easy to parody, but remains fascinating to watch. He's not technically original, but he still keeps it fresh. We can feel his classic style, but we don't load it. We embrace it to a crazy amount. Actually, it's almost worshiped to the point where they make actors recreates sorkin style on talk shows.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Camp is letting movies, b movies, and it's a concept we feel everywhere. Basically whenever a movie does something over the top, that would never happen in real life, but the movie still executes it. Sincerely. Malaise and the room fits quite nicely into these concepts of exaggerated and entertaining filmmaking. What makes the movie stand out is that it's one of the few campy movies that took itself completely seriously without having any idea just how over the top it was. It's still camp, but it's so unique because of how blissfully unaware it is.

Speaker 5:          06:16          Hi doggy. You're my favorite customer. Thanks a lot. Bye.

Speaker 1:          06:19          Brings me to the most important component of camp camp defies binary thinking in movies because it's both bad and good. It objectively breaks many of the principles of filmmaking, unrealistic acting, cheesy dialogue and extreme filming techniques are almost always frowned upon, but the crazy thing is camp is not bad. Sometimes it's actually extremely entertaining, perhaps the most entertaining kind of films that exist because many directors can be serious and many directors can be funny, but not many can be so serious. It's funny, I embrace camp because movies shouldn't always play it straight if they don't want to. On the contrary camp, let's movies be what they were meant to be entertaining, so the next time you watch a movie, don't just consider whether it's good or bad. Consider if you like it for it's guilty pleasures. Consider that it's so bad, but that's not a bad thing. It's actually a great thing. It's so good that it's bad.

Speaker 5:          07:05          Do you want me to order a pizza or whatever? I don't care. I already ordered a pizza. You're thinking about everything. Thanks for watching. Slightly trends full. Just a bit of a break from the norm, just a little slot and the break, the monotony of all that hard.
