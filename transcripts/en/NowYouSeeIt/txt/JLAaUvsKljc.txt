Speaker 1:          00:00          I'll be home at six sharp. If you need anything, call. I mean you can love you. Sweet Mimi. Mimi call if you need it. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:25          they bought it. Pardon me? Why I have a strange envelopes. I you a couple of baboons. What are you looking at breaking the fourth wall. It's one of the most unique, the devices at the disposal of a filmmaker. Most cinematic techniques pull us into a story and make us forget we're watching a film, but breaking the fourth wall does the opposite. It reminds us we're actually an audience member watching what's happening on screen.

Speaker 3:          00:55          I can't believe we're paying. It's he jumped in. We get on TV for free. If you, me, everybody in this theater is a giant sucker. It's your,

Speaker 2:          01:06          the technique can contribute to the visual storytelling of the film in many different ways depending on how it's presented. To really understand the power of breaking the fourth wall, we have to look at its inception and theatrical performance. It's crazy. Now a formal definition for breaking the fourth wall would be a dramatic technique and a work of fiction where characters display an awareness that they are in such a work. You might say every one of us is a fiddler on the roof. The technique goes as far back as ancient Greece and continue to through Shakespeare time and well into postmodern. A theater, especially in musicals, the term first arose after the use of box sets became popular in the 18 hundreds when sets were constructed with three walls. The fourth wall being the imaginary wall between the audience and the performers on stage. So whenever a character acknowledged the audience's presence, the fourth wall was

Speaker 1:          01:59          rope.

Speaker 2:          02:06          The technique has been used since the silent era and Charlie Chaplin played around extensively with fourth wall breaks in his films. With the introduction of sound and the popularity of the musical genre, fourth wall breaks became more common to contribute to the spectacle of film. And over the next 70 years, fourth wall breaks have made their way into a variety of film genres with a variety of thematic effects. Do you all see me all dancing crab? The most popular use of this technique is for comedy and the comedy stands out by creating some of the most memorable punchlines in cinematic history.

Speaker 4:          02:38          Oh, do you? Yeah. That's funny because I happen to have mister McLuhan right here, so, so yeah, just let me, let me, let me come over here second. Oh, I heard what you were saying. You, you know nothing at my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing. Boy, if life were only like this, right,

Speaker 2:          02:58          there's something really surprising and hilarious

Speaker 1:          03:00          about reminding us that we're in the middle of watching a film. No matter how many times I watch a movie break the fourth wall, the joke can still catch me by surprise.

Speaker 2:          03:13          The joke has to step out of the film to deliver the punchline, and there's really no other type of joke like it. Every other joke is enclosed within the imaginary world of the art form. Taking that step out of a movie is what makes a good fourth wall joke. So satisfying and creative. That's where I see things just a little differently contract or no, I will not bow to any sponsor. I do want to note that breaking the fourth wall, it doesn't automatically make you a comedic genius. The setup and delivery of a fourth wall break has to be at least somewhat surprising are the joke can come off as kind of Lazy Jay and Silent Bob Movie, Eh, I suggest you don't worry about this sort of thing and just enjoy ourselves. That goes for you all to yes, Eh, what it was. Now be miles. I bought hello, good evening and welcome to the middle of the film. Much better. You can't talk about breaking the fourth wall without mentioning Mel Brooks. He broke the fourth wall in the most extreme ways possible.

Speaker 1:          04:28          We see the script.

Speaker 2:          04:32          His films go so far as to actually have the main characters watch themselves within the movie.

Speaker 2:          04:50          What the hell am I looking at? When does this happen in the movie? Where all, what do you want to do now? Come home. Let's check out the end of the, Gee, I sure hope there's a happy ending. Well, his films are funny because of the ridiculousness. There's definitely some method to his madness. I like a blazing saddles uses fourth wall breaks to poke fun at the western genre as a whole. It really points out how unrealistic Hollywood films were in their portrayal of life in the West. In reality, western films were nothing but actors in a studio acting and fake towns and eventually getting into a car to drive off the sec. Blazing Saddles is a not so subtle reminder that film as an art form has its limitations at portraying reality. Mel Brooks made a statement by pointing out the lack of realism in the western films.

Speaker 2:          05:32          Western films of the forties 50s and 60s almost completely ignore racism, xenophobia and other ugly parts of the West and blazing saddles breaks the fourth wall in an insane way to remind us we're watching a dramatize film. Not Reality. Could've thought of another way to get us here. There we go again. We're wrong. Perhaps what makes breaking the fourth wall the most intriguing is that depending on context, the act of acknowledging the audience can actually push us into the film. Instead of pulling us out. There's a sort of intimacy to a character speaking directly to us in road to Morocco, bing crosby and Bob Hope. Make lighthearted jokes straight to the audience and even to remind us that they're going to end up fine on their adventure.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Who's we may meet. We haven't any paramount, well pro tech does cause we're signed for five more years.

Speaker 2:          06:23          We know from the casual and inviting fourth wall break set. This is a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and will provide light conservative entertainment. Fourthwall breaks can be a way to welcome us into this story and this variation of the technique is definitely indicative of a more casual movie

Speaker 5:          06:39          morale.

Speaker 2:          06:47          A fourth wall break can make us intimate with a character as well as with the story. There's really no stronger way to show a character's motives. Then by having them look right at us and save them.

Speaker 6:          06:57          I go for 10 I'm probably going to have to barf up the lung. I better make this one count.

Speaker 2:          07:01          It's a great way to show us what's going on in the character's head and is comparable to an aside in feeder. Frank Underwood addressing us directly is the foundation for so much of the energy in house of cards. Good and Donald don't let this get you down. Why together we're going to do more than you've been able to do in 25 years. I left the scenes where he says one thing to another character and then looks at us and reminds us what he's really after two things and now irrelevant. I don't blythe and Donald Blinds, new drafts. Eventually I have to rewrite the bill myself forward. That is the battle cry. Leave ideology to the armchair general was does mean no final great effect of breaking the fourth wall is to unsettle. There's nothing scarier than feeling safe and removed from the villain in a movie and then having that villain look directly at you. I hope they are watching.

Speaker 6:          07:53          They have c see, and they'll know and they'll say,

Speaker 2:          07:57          hi, Shane. Look, Nathan Hammons, decks, comedy, satire, intimacy, and fear can all be accomplished just from a look to the camera. So don't forget the great potential of fourth wall break can have. And thanks for what

Speaker 7:          08:12          w. W what were you doing in here? This is my room. Get Out, get out and making the video. Get Out. Hello. What does the guy have to do to get some privacy around here?
