Speaker 1:          00:00          This is a hub us. So Darla, y'all can't be seen in this. Behind every memorable character is a meticulously chosen wardrobe. Whether the costume is extremely flashy or completely blends in. Costume design provides an amazing opportunity to give us insight into a character and the world around them because just like in the real world, what you wear says a lot about you. I'm always said there's an awful lot you can tell about it. Posting by those shoes. I want to take a look at costume design as a tool for filmmakers to tell their story. In many of cinemas, most important movies, costume designers are the secret heroes, the people who immerse us within a world seamlessly and effectively without getting nearly the same recognition as actors or directors. So let's get sketching the plus to hod dialing. The word costume invariably gets associated with how the wean dress up and pretending to be somebody else.

Speaker 1:          00:47          And sometimes that's the function of clothing. In a movie, he was, didn't pick a moon, but the majority of costume design operates on completely opposite principles. Their goal is to create authentic and realistic people on the screen. Not Actors playing dress up. Oh, it's not a costume. Costume design is an added layer towards the immersive magic of film period. Clothing is meant to place you in the time period of the movie. Gone with the wind is famous for its engaging costume design of while there is some 1930s flare in the hairstyle, the clothes still manage to immerse the audience in the civil war era and accurately reflect scarlet's fall from grace. The way she designs her own clothing also serves as a nice metaphor for the need to literally and figuratively reconstruct herself after the war. At its best. Costume design is a vital layer of world building and it works well in totally foreign places.

Speaker 1:          01:34          When people talk about the original star wars, they usually praise the plot characters or special effects with the costume design was also fantastic. It combines what we're used to seeing with the completely alien princess layers. Costume design is right in the middle of looking like she's from a foreign planet and looking like royalty as we understand it. And all the designs, the robots, generals and soldiers, their wardrobe is alien enough to transport us to an exciting and different worlds, but familiar enough to keep us grounded. And while we already understand our immersive costuming is more difficult than you may think edith had the winner of eight Oscars for costume design and the inspiration for edna mode designed for many movies taking place in present day. So she just dressed her characters in the style of her time. Problem is by the time the movie was shot, edited and released, the style would change and the dresses became tacky.

Speaker 1:          02:18          So she had to anticipate the future and make something look modern but not tied down to a specific trend. And she was one of the first to address this issue. That's still shows up today, striking the balance between looking too dated or too generic. So a movie made in the 70s might have generic costuming, but a movie about the seventies embraces the old school style to bring about the nostalgia of a loss time. It's why eight mile looks like you could have taken place at any time, but rappers look ridiculous in their music videos that came out the same year. Fashion is not the primary. The primary effort in motion pictures is to tell a story. The plane hoodie works as a blank slate, emphasizing mnms quest to succeed purely on talent and nothing flashy while also attention on his face. Either way, costuming is supposed to compliment the style of your film, whether you're going for realism or something more flashy.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Along with our immersion, many costume choices are to make characters stand out of their worlds. Willy Wonka's introduction takes place over 30 minutes into the movie and the praise always goes to gene wilder is amazing performance, but it's also an example of great costume design while all the other characters dressing clothing stylized from the late 18 hundreds or as cowboys and other characatures won because wardrobe is a hybrid of the Victorian jacket tail. And buttoning of the 19th century, but the collar and color scheme all embody the style of the 1970s so we get a character who visually stands out as both out of his world and ahead of his time. The costuming in the remake emphasizes the out of this world part, but it has no grip in reality, so it makes him seem more like a cartoon caricature than an out of touch visionary Bonnie and Clyde takes place in the 1930s but their style, wardrobe and obsession with the media put them right into the 1960s it helps make them appear antiestablishment much like the young people in the real worlds during the making of this film in 1967 Michael Corleone, where's his military uniform to stand out amongst the classy gangster suits, but as he gets sucked into the life, his clothing makes the appropriate transition for gangsters.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Wardrobe indicates a transition into the Mafia. This example of costume design actually does play into the initial concept of wearing a costume. The gangster gets new attire to try to fit into high society, but no matter what they stand out as gangsters. In many movies you can tell they aren't really high society. They're just playing dress up

Speaker 2:          04:29          gangster

Speaker 1:          04:30          like other gangsters. Walter White place dress up to help him feel like a gangster, but eventually he becomes the gangster. He was only imitating before costumes. Give us insight into the character wearing it. Luke skywalker's wardrobe has the visual aesthetic of martial arts gear implying he's undergoing training. Obi wan Kenobi is dressed like a monk because he's doing the teaching in the force awakens the roles that have reversed and so have the costume choices, new teacher, new students, the shoes and the opening of strangers on a train tell us which character is more well off and which character is more of an every man. It may just be me, but the black and white shoes looked somewhat menacing. They really stand out in the frame by being so bright and flashy. Tyler durden is costume design in fight club always contrast the color Palette of the setting and other characters almost like he isn't supposed to be there in the first place.

Speaker 1:          05:12          Along with actor personality and direction, color scheme and costume design is an impressive and effective way to make a character stand out or blend in in 500 days of summer. The opening title sequence establishes the wardrobe color for the two characters, Brown for Tom and blue for summer. Throughout the movie, the coloring shifts around them. When summer enters Tom's world, the setting is colored Brown. While summer's world is blue, the dance sequence has all the actors dressed in blue to represent Tom. Thinking about summer costume coloring gives us mental cues as to how the story is progressing. And by the end of the movie we realize their colors don't mix and they part ways. Movies become classics when all of the production elements come together to make something great. And that includes costuming. So when you look back at your favorite characters, think about what they're wearing. And of course remember the most important rule of costume design, not kicks. Thanks for watching. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          05:58          slightly trends full, just a bit of a break from the norm, just a little slot in the break. The monotony of all that.
