Speaker 1:          00:03          When you hear the word improvisation, what do you think of? You May 1st think of Improv comedy.

Speaker 2:          00:08          You see, what I did is acting.

Speaker 1:          00:13          You may have also thought of improvised jazz breaks, freestyle rap, or even improvised explosive.

Speaker 2:          00:22          The reason

Speaker 1:          00:22          each of these things still counts as Improv is because Improv isn't defined by the product, but rather the process for making the product improvising is creating and performing spontaneously and without any preparation. So in film, any dialogue, camera shot, or even a reaction that's unrehearsed or unprepared can be improv. Anthony Hopkins got an unrehearsed reaction out of Jodie foster when he went off script to make fun of her accent Gfr, the Dag a coal mine, I mean just tingling and Alan Rickman surprised expression in die hard comes from the stuntmen dropping him on the count of two, not three. There is no doubt that improv leads to hilarious performances. You don't know you're gay. How I saw you make a spinach dip and a Lopa sourdough bread once and actors intuition can make for the best laughs, tears or surprises, no matter how subtle, like the improvised clapping of the joker.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12          In this essay, I want to talk about the strengths and limitations of Improv and why filmmakers use different cinematic techniques to make their films appear improvised. The best improvisation is when actors play the game of the scene. In any improvised scene. Each actor has certain rules for how to act and react based on their character's personality, and what roles do is they free us up to improvise, right? By giving ourselves these constrictions that guide our impulses, it funnels our creative process into some kind of product. The process of improvisation and those rules help us create something. The rules the actor must follow along with the conflict between characters makes an improvised scene work well. Good at Improv stems from conflict and personality with each character playing the game. Hey, when you hear the most annoying sound in the world, Dustin Hoffman's reaction was improvised. When an actual taxi driver drove onset during the filming of midnight cowboy

Speaker 3:          02:13          boy

Speaker 1:          02:17          reaction completely embodies his character. The conflict is realistic and it adds to his character showing he's not as smooth and cool as tries to appear. The same applies to dramatic Improv. Robert De Niro perfectly embodies travis is loneliness, isolation, paranoia, and aggression. With this improvised scene,

Speaker 2:          02:34          you talking to me, talking to me,

Speaker 1:          02:40          play the game, follow the rules. Improvisation doesn't work when characters don't play the game in pixels. Adam Sandler has a meeting with the president and other executives and out of nowhere he just starts going around the room insulting people. The conflict makes no sense and the insulting doesn't go along with Sandler's personality. I'm convinced Adam Sandler partially improvise the scene and it's painful to watch because it doesn't come close to playing the game.

Speaker 2:          03:02          GRANDPA, I'll see you around maybe a nursing home.

Speaker 1:          03:06          One limitation of improvisation is oftentimes the lack of a resolution to the scene referred to as the button. The button is the final moment before the end of the scene that resolves the conflict with a final joke or comment key, and peele very consistently has the button at the end of their sketches that neatly ends the game. For example, they have a sketch where college football players state their names and the game is that their names get more and more ridiculous. Call royal smoochy walls versus Meyer. The button is a resolution to the chaos of the names and ends the sketch perfectly. Dan Smith, Byu. Some improvise scenes don't have the button. The result is seems that either go too long or have an unsatisfying ending. Director. Judd apatow has great improvised scenes with great jokes, but the drawback is the scenes don't really end. They sometimes kind of just stopped. The nature of spontaneity means an improvised scene can't always be structured as well as a scripted scene. This isn't always the case for improvisation though sometimes the ending is perfect, but it's not a certainty with a scene that's entirely improvised. Why don't you just make 10 louder and make tend to be the top number and make that a little loud?

Speaker 2:          04:13          These cards are 11

Speaker 1:          04:14          Martin Scorsese likes to mimic improvisation in his films. Despite them actually being scripted. He makes the scenes look like a documentary as if they're unrehearsed to the point where he blurs the line between documentary and fiction. The effect is films that seem extremely realistic and spontaneous means streets appears very improvised. The opening title sequence in a home video aspect ratio has characters act very naturally. The camera shots are all handheld. The music is to sal chick and even the text was super imposed using blown up typewriter text. A method commonly reserved for documentaries and home videos. The opening sequence shows everyday life for this group of Italian Americans in New York. The use of footage and action that looks improvised makes the movie seem more casual and realistic. Contrast this movie with something like the Godfather with an epic score, dramatic deaths, intense acting and cryptic dark lighting and you see how mimicked improvisation gives a totally different mood to a movie.

Speaker 1:          05:06          The fictional documentary style goes as far back as citizen Kane when the news on the march sequence recreated real life new segments making Charles Kane seemed like a real world figure while also establishing the contrast between his public and private life. My wife used to farm and she was nervous. She had also, it's a wonderful, amazing cuisines. She used to fall asleep. Improv does more than just make us laugh. Improvisation is a process that makes for great scenes. Sometimes an actor's best tool is getting into character and seeing what can happen spontaneously and even when it's imitated. The improvised documentary look, adds realism to a film. So don't forget, an actor can give a great performance based solely on the process they go through. Internally. Masa Graham, much. I gray, I'm Martha Graham or Twyla Twyla Twyla are Michael [inaudible]. Michael Kid might go, kid Michael, kid on Madonna, Madonna, Madonna, but you keep it all inside. Thanks for watching.
