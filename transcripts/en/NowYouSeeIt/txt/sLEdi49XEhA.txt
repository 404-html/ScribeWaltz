Speaker 1:          00:01          Man, I am sick and tired of being treated like I don't exist you to do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it. And I don't complain all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:12          So important about a dinner scene and why would a director waste their time on something so simple? That's what we're going to focus on today. So welcome tonight.

Speaker 2:          00:27          Don't interrupt me. We're done a drink. I think dinner scenes are some of the most powerful and revealing scenes in the film. They always show much more than people eating. They she'll communion. When I say communion, I mean an act of sharing and peace between the people at the dinner table. Directors use the dinner scene to show us relationships between each character, how they get along or how they don't. I got to reply for you, Andrew. You think Carlton football's a joke. Come play with us. Four words you will never hear from the NFL, but I think even more is going on. We all know the process of eating a typical dinner you eat, talk about your day, make a few jokes and call it a night. So when a meal goes wrong in a film, we especially noticed because we're used to dinners going a certain way and that's what gives it dinner scene. So much potential either for Kuma or for drama. I think that's funny, Huh? I think that's funny. Let's look at what dinner scenes can accomplish in three sections. Humans eat the conflict and the unexpected.

Speaker 2:          01:40          Whether you're a contract killer or a demigod, you have to eat and that makes you human. It was drawing [inaudible]. I know. It's great, right? Showing characters, eating makes them human like us. It puts us into their world. It makes us relate with them. We can't relate to stealing. Diamonds are getting shot, but we can relate to getting in an argument at the table. Dinner scenes make us empathize with characters. Tarantino uses the dinner scene very well and reservoir dogs and pulp fiction to pull us into the world of his films. When these characters who we just saw have a friendly meal, start getting shot and robbed the restaurant, it's that much more shocking because we saw them as who they were people, people who eat just like we do. When people come together for dinner. It's supposed to be a peaceful communion, but it doesn't always go that way. Dinner scenes are perfect ways to show conflict. When people storm out,

Speaker 1:          02:23          Tom, don't go there. So my best friend, okay, Jesus, wait dishes, get left alone. Not you know, you'll be doing the dishes alone. That says a lot about the characters without having to tell us, and so a successful meal means just the opposite time. Time to shove off moby and margie, let me just simply, no, just

Speaker 2:          02:51          dinner doesn't always go smoothly. It doesn't for us in real life and it certainly doesn't for the characters in a movie, since we can relate to how awkward and meal can be, it can be much funnier when a dinner scene doesn't go as expected. I have no idea you could milk a cat. Oh yeah, you can milk anything with nipples. I have nipples. Greg, could you milk me or it can be that much more dramatic to go from the familiar dinner scene to an alien. Busting out of somebody's chest really adds to the horror dinner. That's just a dinner would be boring. A director wouldn't waste to scene with something as simple as people eating if it wasn't to show something more important. That's what I love about film. A film doesn't have to tell us something. It doesn't have to tell us, this person doesn't get along with this person or this person is human just like you. It can just show us,

Speaker 1:          03:45          hey Richard, good to see you.

Speaker 2:          04:01          Showing rather than telling is what makes a film go from good to great and at dinner scene can be quite the show and another thing from now on, we're going to alternate our dinner music because frankly, and I don't think I'm alone here, I'm really tired of this lawrence welk. Shit. Thanks for watching.
