Speaker 1:          00:03          I'm fascinated with chess and movies and not just because I played chess in middle school and competitively in high school and college. Chess is so interesting because of how much meaning it can have in film, whether it's through analogy, metaphor, or even a plot device. Filmmakers love using the game to add to their stories in a way no other game can. So let's play teach y'all. If y'all want to lie, man. Nah, come on right in the middle of the most basic use of tests for an analogy, it's usually to associate something with patients or precision, you know, picked my punches to take him down. Pendants state sets up the main character as a tress player and he references the game throughout film. Firstly, strategical position to pieces and when the timing's right, you strategy, the next step is to use chest to show somebody as smart.

Speaker 1:          00:46          And this is where filmmakers get clever in 2001 a space Odyssey House intelligence is established in his ability to be humans in chess. The importance of this scene is somewhat lost on modern movie goers because computers have been beating the best chess players for the last 20 years, but in 1968 it showed that how was not only intelligent but very powerful. If you look at the scene more closely, it also foreshadows and important plot point. When this super computer tells the human the better choice. I'm sorry frank, I think you missed it. Waned to bishop. Bishop takes. Queen takes bishop night, chest. We see the computer disagreeing with the human and making a better move for him, showing very subtly that the computer can conflict with and outsmart. Hit this for shout as the plot quite nicely and sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.

Speaker 1:          01:32          How actually makes a mistake while talking about the game, his suggestion queen to Bishop three is impossible in this position, so how does have the force checkmate, but he's declaring it incorrectly. Now you could say this was either a mistake on Kubrick's part or more. Interestingly, Kubrick is very subtly foreshadowing house eventual breakdown. The Duel Between Hal and frank. Poole brings me to my third point. Chess books nicely to represent a battle between two people. This can be as discreet or symbolic as you like. In Sherlock Holmes, the montage of the chess game with an actual conflict makes the idea of pretty obvious. It's a battle of wits, but the events of the game almost always stands for something more. Chess is a very versatile game. Pixar made short with the entire plot revolving around a chest battle. For example, it's popular to use chest to show a person sacrifice. Maybe the most literal instance of this is Harry Potter. Sherlock goes for a queen sacrifice in his game directly. Mirroring Sherlock's plan to stop moriarty

Speaker 2:          02:24          are winning. Strategy sometimes sacrifice

Speaker 1:          02:27          to go one step further. You can even let the chest pieces themselves serve as metaphors for what's happening in the movie. Mag. Needle fights with the powerful rook and night pieces, but professor x winds by sacrificing his powerful pieces and using his bonds to checkmate. These moves reflect each player's worldview. Magneto. Strong pieces represent him fighting with mutans against the humans. While professor x fights with the ponds showing his desire to work with and trust the humans. This metaphor serves the movie nicely because in chess, upon can actually mutate into a night or rook, and this metaphor is further supported when humans are referred to as ponds. The exponent

Speaker 3:          03:02          interest, the poem scuffs.

Speaker 1:          03:05          I think chess metaphors are most powerful when they add to the story in the people versus Oj Simpson. Shapiro and Johnny Carson both have chest sets in their offices during the episode where they decide to make their defense arguments center around race in one shot. The chess set is right in the foreground. Here we see an obvious choice to have this chest set as the focal point in the shot, and I think it may mean something. Of course I hesitate to read too far into this, but it's worth noting that chess is a battle between black and white pieces and in the context of this scene about black versus white people. That makes for a powerful visual and adds to the idea that this trial was a battle centering on race. Maybe the perfect summation of all these techniques comes from this chest scene in the TV show. The wire d essentially uses chest to explain the drug trade, the Brookside, the stash. The queen is the muscle and the king is top dog. He even goes so far as to naming the pieces after actual people in their gang. What he ain't got no hustle, but the rest of these motherfuckers on the chain, they got his back when they run so deep,

Speaker 3:          03:59          he really ain't gotta do shit. But like your uncle? Yeah, like mom. The Pantera

Speaker 1:          04:04          described as the soldiers and in reality these kids are the soldiers in their gang and so they naturally identify with the ponds. What's interesting is what Wallace. His question is after he learns about the pond,

Speaker 3:          04:14          they liked the front lines. They'd be out in the field. So how do you get to be the king and he liked that. See the Qing state of King. Alright. Anything stay who he is

Speaker 1:          04:25          as the ponds. They always have to serve the king no matter what. Even if they get to the other side of the board,

Speaker 3:          04:30          catch the other dudes king and trap it, then you would all right, but it will make it to the end. I'm top dog now, Yo, it ain't like that

Speaker 1:          04:41          trust. We learn about the drug trade and how its hierarchy is that strict as the rules of a board game. No matter what. These characters are trapped in their roles with no way to escape. They get sacrificed for the king and no matter how they play, they never get to be in charge ponds. Man

Speaker 3:          04:54          in the game, they get cab quick, maybe out of the game early, less they some smart ass poems

Speaker 1:          05:04          and movies that use to most games is one dimensional. Bingo is there to establish. You're in a retirement home. If you're playing dungeons and dragons, the characters are stereotyped as nerdy, but with chest there's almost always more to analyze, so get out there and make a move.

Speaker 4:          05:16          That's his majesty. King is playing chess. Chess. Hey, thanks for slightly just a bit of a break from the norm. Just to break the monotony of all that hard.
