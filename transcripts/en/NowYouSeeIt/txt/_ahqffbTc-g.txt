Speaker 1:          00:00          It opened its wings like this and hovered above me skinny chicken.

Speaker 2:          00:08          Now you are vampires,

Speaker 1:          00:12          and it was Peter.

Speaker 3:          00:15          The vampire is perhaps the most universally recognizable character in all of cinema. The most famous interpretation comes largely from Bela Lugosi's Dracula in 1931 where we got the classic accent and widow's peak, the high collar, and Kate came from the vampire in theater and the sharp canines were popularized by Christopher Lee's horror of Dracula known as just Dracula in the UK in 1958 and it's a combination of these features that leads us to the image of the vampire we're most familiar with. It's the vampire that shows up in cereal boxes, Geico commercials, and sesame street greetings. I am the count, but in reality, the design of the vampire varies drastically depending on the movie count or lock in those Fra to looks like an evil monster. But Edward Kulin and twilight is basically a perfect version of a human. Each vampire is actually carefully engineered to serve a certain purpose in each movie, and many scholars have studied the meaning of different vampires over time.

Speaker 4:          01:09          Hey, my name's Stanley's to panic. I teach at the University of Virginia. I'm an associate professor currently, but I've taught a number of things I've taught and I'm currently teaching a film course. Russian film, Eastern Europe came down, but my big courses called Dracula live, it's about vampires and bunch of other things.

Speaker 3:          01:23          There's been a fair amount of research on the vampire in academia, which makes sense considering Dracula is the second most popular character in cinematic history behind the only sherlock holmes. And that's not including the majority of vampire films that don't even have a dracula ASCII character. One of the reasons why the vampire is so popular amongst filmmakers is its versatility as a creature. Since the beginning of the vampire onscreen directors have always made creative changes to their vampires to suit their particular movie.

Speaker 4:          01:48          For example, the vampire, it's called con aural lab, not contracting and original. And it comes from the Dutch, which means war, you know? So obviously there's some connection there with, with war and the laws that, you know, Mike, in particular, young men for Germany during World War One and the rest of our team. So wars obvious there. Um, yeah. And it's also clear assemble like foreign intervention or a fear of name of grants, a Jewish immigration maybe or Jewish influence and we know be unfortunate finishing the bat and then you had this thing that, especially in that case, which is a human leg, but it's like it's so foul looking and it spreads disease that then it really reiterates the negative connotations about being Jewish.

Speaker 3:          02:25          Much of the design of Count Orlok is antisemetic. He has many features also present in Jewish characatures including the association between Jewish people and rats. The filmmakers changed or exaggerated some designs of the original Dracula to make the creature more relevant to the fears of post World War One. Germany

Speaker 4:          02:40          in particular, they changed the location because it based and Dracula, they've changed it from Transylvania for London, Transylvania to Germany. Right. So obviously they're making connections to their own college and things that it represent that. Yeah. In that case, you know, it's something to be feared because when it's representing is something that certain people, when you've been like

Speaker 3:          02:58          in filmmakers always

Speaker 5:          03:00          customize, they're vampires to represent something different. [inaudible] was a way to symbolize German fears at the time that largely included antisemitism. But the vampire can do much more than that since vampires aren't technically human directors have historically used them to show behavior that would be too weird or controversial if it were done by actual humans. In the 1930s, homosexuality was essentially banned on the big screen in America by a series of moral guidelines called the hays code. But the vampire found a way to work around that. Starting With Dracula in 1931 vampires quickly switched from disgusting monsters of Count Oarlock to sex symbols like Bela Lugosi, showing just how easily the vampire can change and how the vampire can mean something sexual. Some of the images that we have in western culture of things that are horrific are also basically sexual. Basically, vampirism is just sex from the neck up. You're penetrating a passive person. Um, it's just, it really is a very sexual sort of monster.

Speaker 3:          03:56          Throughout the filming of Dracula's daughter in 1936, universal pictures was well aware of the lesbian implications of a female vampire gazing at and biting a partially nude woman. They changed the script to make lily clothed and had the camera cut away, but either with these changes, the homosexuality is pretty obvious. The vampire allowed a depiction of lesbian ism decades before humans could do it themselves, even though it isn't explicit ends. Oleska is also interested in guys in the film with Vampires. Controversial topics are much easier to discuss when you compare movies about the same topic that came out around the same time. Vampires offer enough removal from actual humans that they can go much further with the topic. Philadelphia is about a homosexual suing a company for wrongly terminating him because he has aids as the first mainstream big budget movie focusing on a homosexual.

Speaker 3:          04:40          The movie approaches the subject very carefully and Tribeca is written very sympathetically, always nice in the camera, shows it nearly every scene gives us a shot from his perspective with closeups and we even get home footage to show how ordinary he is. In contrast, the bad guys are films speaking almost exclusively in racist and homophobic slurs often shot from far away, often shot from behind back. It doesn't express his sexuality much. He never kisses his partner and the ones scenes showing two men sharing a bed together was cut for the theatrical release. In many ways it has to water down so many aspects of homosexuality to show it as completely normal. You survived what I assumed to be your first gay party and tech. Now I'm not trying to say that Philadelphia should have pushed more boundaries because then it might not have done well during the time that it came out. What I am saying is a vampire movie could do much more interview with the vampire came out one year later and there's an incredible difference in how far it goes in portraying homosexuality on screen.

Speaker 4:          05:31          It seemed goes farther. Yeah. Yeah. It shows you like you know where they almost kiss and stuff and gets really, really, you know, sexually tans in a number of scenes. So for example, near of Yam, whenever I'm on, just so you know, with Louie and that our gallery and Louie draws him really close. I mean, they're like, you know that it's clicks and then let's start and the way he's connected to Louie and then they get this daughter or you know, I mean it's representing two gay guys. So they've essentially, and talking about a child in the back of nearly 90 it's like I can remember that being a controversy this guys, but they liked it. Right. And again, it's, it makes us like August to vampires though, right? You know, it's, it's, it's like right there but not officially saying it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          06:07          When it's pampers, you can hide your meaning in a symbol. Then the movie can have more nuanced characters in discussions. The movie doesn't need to have to give us any lectures about homosexuality. Like Philadelphia does interview with the vampire marks, the first piece of work with a first person perspective of the vampire and it focuses more on the relationship between vampires over time. Not to mention the bitey scenes are extremely erotic, more erotic than a movie like Philadelphia was capable of doing with real people. But maybe my favorite example of using a vampire to be ahead of the times, his death dream originally titled dead of Night, a lesser known movie about a soldier who dies in Vietnam and returns home as a creature like a vampire. The director cleverly uses the vampire to show what it was like for a veteran to return home after combat as a totally different person, a shadow of their former self,

Speaker 6:          06:50          like Zombie, like looking corpse thing that is like near Dad and many before he looks in the home will be boise sunglasses. How many acts weird out in public and his way of responding is very dead. Like whenever his ex girlfriend or the girl I used to days talking to me now that's at one particular scene. It's really telling where she says, you know, I hope you're not, you're not mad or anything,

Speaker 7:          07:10          says

Speaker 6:          07:13          Ronnie, which is a really dead response as if you suck, you know, sort of symbolizing that plight of the Vietnam vet who's like emotionally dead

Speaker 3:          07:21          as he fights his friends and family. His actions directly mere how Vietnam veterans were rejected by society and the media when they came back from war. It's a powerful message and the director created a berry humanlike but emotionally stunted kind of vampire to show his message. It's not much different from a movie like Rambo, but with a vampire death dream came out eight years before Rambo and just one year after the Vietnam War. In many ways, the vampire movies are ahead of the Times. The vampire was also ahead of its time in race relations. The first black horror movie was Black Ula and it was a box office hit in the movie. Dracula strips prince mom Waldy of his power when he tries to abolish the slave trade, cursing him as a vampire. The movie becomes a quest for black ula to regain his power and identity. Any partially does so by fighting off white policemen attacking a black community. Here we see a movie in 1972 already showing the issues of racial profiling in the fantasy of black Americans to fight back, making it way ahead of its time.

Speaker 4:          08:11          The thing that makes that film boundary breaking right is that you're getting vampire, but he likes it. Right? Saint Catherine White people watching that and then they identify with what's going on with number Waldo and how that relates to racial relations. Right. Whereas if you showed, you know, bunch of, you know, African Americans and packing the police, then you met, you're probably gonna have some white people. It'd be like, I don't like that. Same thing happens today whenever the black lives matter. Talking about police intervention in black communities, stuff like that, that when you got to have an empire and they're sort of bridges that gap and brings people together in a different way.

Speaker 3:          08:37          And so the modern vampire carries all these past iterations of the vampire with it. This may seem silly to even talk about, but even a kid show on Disney channel uses the symbol of vampires to talk about human issues.

Speaker 4:          08:58          I mean, it's obvious right there what that shows is doing. It's basically symbolizing a different culture or a different race. They were character. That's fun so that kids can understand it better.

Speaker 8:          09:09          No, I've always thought they were the greatest metaphor for the outsider in all of us. I felt like an outsider growing up. I miss fed. I think a lot of people did or do it sometime in their life feel like outsiders, outkast and the vampire is a great way to talk about that. He's, he's a larger than life, mythic hero who is looks human and can talk to you like a human being, but it's actually a monster and he's immortal. He's outside of life and I think that's a great metaphor for human beings.

Speaker 3:          09:38          The show has episodes where neighbors come to terms with the odd van stereotypes this family follows. Using a vampire makes it simple for kids to understand, and it's not controversial. It would be a little trickier to address black or Asian stereotypes to a little kid in a TV series, but if fake creature is a lot easier, it's actually a great example of why more complicated ideas like homosexuality, race relations in the effects of war or more easily discussed using a vampire instead of a human. I'll go for one more example. That's a bit out there. Why did twilight do so well? It's definitely not the writing. The book copies a very common storyline in tons of female, young adult literature. A story of an attractive bad boy with a bad background who is dangerous in some way, whether it's from drugs or abuse, and he meets a girl who changes him.

Speaker 4:          10:20          Typically it's through some very average girl that he becomes a better pair of Stan because of law, right? And that's the idea that love, we can change the world and there's this guy out there that's going to pick me, right? And no one else notices me and this guy's going to pick me and he's totally awesome, but I'm the one that's going to lead to that totally awesome because he's going to be on me.

Speaker 3:          10:40          Twilight follows this storyline extremely closely, as have dozens of novels before it, but making the bad boy of empire is actually kind of creative. That creature is perfect for that fantasy. They're usually attractive, at least in some modern movies. They don't age and they can't be killed, but at the same time, vampires are dangerous. They could hurt you in. They're extremely strong.

Speaker 4:          10:58          There's that famous scene whenever they're about the case and he jumps back because he's afraid of going too far because he could end up harming, harsh and see us, you know, even vague. So that danger that he represents is this bad boy image. It's not really his fault so to speak, which is what makes him a little more sellable to because he just needs to be like find the right human being.

Speaker 3:          11:17          So that movie and novel craft of Vampire that works as a bad boy and young girls identify with the girl. It's a fantasy for young girls that's always been around. But the vampire gives it a new spin and allows the fantasy to be explored a little deeper because at the end of the day, the bad boy fantasy isn't real. That's not how real life works. So using a fake creature instead of a human, let's you go further with the fantasy just like you can with other complicated issues as a great sum up of Vampires over time, the company, what we do in the shadows helps us understand the power of the vampire as a symbol overall. The van in the movie are all from different time periods and to influences. Peter's Terrifying Monster Portrayal Echoes Count Oarlock in Nosferatu Flautas lavs teams influenced by Vladislav in Dracula,

Speaker 2:          12:00          Si, Si,

Speaker 3:          12:06          and nick has similarities to Edward from twilight even admitting it himself,

Speaker 2:          12:09          they'll maybe twilight if you say no, I'm the main guy, twilight

Speaker 3:          12:14          mockumentary. We follow around these vampires in their everyday lives and in a weird way, the format and style actually teaches us a lot about vampires in media.

Speaker 4:          12:22          We get documentaries when we think about it. It's worthy of a documentary, so I'll make it about a serious good product and therefore you'll learn about the nature of the product by studying the series. This film, it is really doing something quite special. It's saying you can learn just as much by studying something lousy.

Speaker 3:          12:37          When you're a vampire you become very sexy. This movie shows us what it would really be like if vampire's existed. It wouldn't be epic like and all these other movies. It would actually be ridiculous. They would have to find a place to live. They would have to clean their flat and biting someone wouldn't always be dramatic and theatrical. Sometimes it would just be silly. What we do in the shadows shows how every other vampire movie artificially creates a vampire to suit their own meaning by showing us every vampire in film history, in one movie, we realize just how different they all are, and it's true. Some vampires look disgusting to show fears of disease and antisemitism summer basically perfect versions of humans, and there's everything in between. And the traits of the vampire always means something.

Speaker 4:          13:15          It represents not really human problems in a way that makes it accessible because it's fine. I vampires are fun and it makes it indirect so that it's kind of save it and discuss it. You now, when you're talking about a band pie that symbolizes racial identity and of talking about those issues in a direct way

Speaker 3:          13:30          and that little bit of distance from actual human floods, the vampire really pushed boundaries and be ahead of its time. So the next time you watch a vampire movie, maybe you can see a powerful message based on what they do or don't do. Vampires don't do dishes, and maybe you'll learn about vampires in a new and different way, which is what these videos are supposed to be all about.

Speaker 4:          13:48          Oh, I bet like this the better. Because students like his stuff more and you know it's, it's it, it encapsulates more information to share now stays and so it's where things are going, but it's in academia just doesn't want to shift. Yeah, it's starting to, but it really needs to, you know? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 3:          14:02          One of the most important novels for the vampire is I am legend. The original book has the first scientific vampire, one that's not supernatural, but caused by an actual disease. It's a big influence for night of the living dead. A movie that paves the way for the modern Zombie. So yes, that means the zombies we see today partially originate from vampires.
