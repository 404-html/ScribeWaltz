Speaker 1:          00:10          Welcome to now you see this video of a train was first screen to a group of people in France in January of 18, 96. Legend has it that the viewers of the film were so overwhelmed by what looked like a train coming right at them that many hid under their seats or ran to the back of the room in fear of getting hit. The truth of the story is debated, but what's certain is that seeing a video for the first time have a train coming towards you would probably leave you pretty shocked and amazed. So the question is even more than a century later, can we be just as moved by film or are we desensitized because we know that things on screen aren't actually happening.

Speaker 1:          00:45          I want to explore the war film because we're films have such great potential to shock and amaze us through their sheer scope and powerful subject matter. How can film to portray war and what techniques do filmmakers used to picked war and the soldiers that fight them can film portray war realistically. Let's take a look at two types of war films, probe war and Anti War French filmmaker friends, swatch Hifu is often attributed with saying there's no such thing as an antiwar film. While Steven Spielberg said in an interview with Newsweek magazine, of course every movie good or bad is an antiwar movie, so who's right. I want to argue that while neither of these statements is correct, they do give insight into the nature of film, but before arguing, if a film is pro or anti war, we have to define pro and anti war. A definition like antiwar portrays war in a bad light and pro war portrays we're in a good light is somewhat of an oversimplification.

Speaker 1:          01:33          A lot of war films show a combination of positive and negative aspects of war. They were expendable. For example, shows Japanese airplanes blowing up a US pt boat and killing a soldier. Look at this shot of John Wayne collapsing at the side of the boat way down by his combat boots, the camera following him to the ground. This scene reflects wars, cruel, dangerous, and dead. But if we look at the movie as a whole, it's definitely a pro war propaganda film. Look at this shot up, General Macarthur commander of the army, he towers over the camera, speaks little and is treated by the soldiers as a celebrity please. He's looked at as a hero and savior up for the United States and this and along with lots of pro war sentiment in the film shows that they were expendable as much more pro war than Antigua. I think a better definition for a pro war film would be a film that shows the benefits of war outweighing the cost and an antiwar film shows the cost of war outweighing the benefits. A modern example of a probe war film is American sniper. Clint Eastwood makes the claim that the film is antiwar and it definitely has a lot of aspects of an antiwar film. The film shows that word isn't always black and white and can cause serious emotional trauma. But what makes it pro war is that Chris Kyle believes he did the right thing.

Speaker 2:          02:39          I'll just protect them. My Gosh, they were trying to kill our soldiers. And, uh, I'm willing to meet my creator and as for every shot that I took,

Speaker 1:          02:47          the film is pro war because it conveys that despite all the trauma of war war,

Speaker 3:          02:53          I'm blessed with the gift of aggression. Overpowering need to protect the flock,

Speaker 1:          03:00          rare breed live to confront the wolf. They were the sheepdog. The benefits of war outweigh the costs and worry is unnecessary evil against those who caused terror. It's with films like American sniper where I think Spielberg is wrong in his statement about war. Films or films normally don't make out war as something to look forward to, but they can certainly make wore out as necessary. Pro War films use heroes and an idea of the greater good to convey the message that war is necessary. It's antiwar film, showcase the brutality and cruelty of war to portray combat negatively. To get a look at how filmmakers you send them a tography to have an antiwar film show the horrors and realities of combat. One has to look no further than the DJ scene in saving private Ryan.

Speaker 1:          03:47          The transition from the old man in the opening scene to the beaches of Normandy is done with a jarring smash cut. We don't fade. We don't zoom in. It's a fast and abrupt transition. It gives the effect of being forced into the scene without adequate preparation. The shot of the endless rows of anti landing barriers on the beach looks eerily similar to the rows of tombstones in the graveyard. We just saw in the earlier scene a foreshadowing of what's to come. We get several closeups of soldiers and they certainly aren't the typical war heroes. The first image of our hero is his hand shaking, a sign of fear. Compare that to the grand introduction of John Wayne on a squadron of pt boats that are basically showing off to the camera or even American sniper where Chris Kyle first gets shown with this huge, powerful sniper rifle.

Speaker 1:          04:26          The Omaha beach scene shows a war fought by the terrified not by the heroic or masculine. The killing on the beach is best described as pure chaos. The camera shake point of view shots and minimal movement blur all work together to pull the viewer onto the battlefield alongside the other soldiers. With all these effects, this scene definitely conveys that the costs of war outweighed the benefits. A great way for a film to Portray Warren in negative way is to make war scenes as realistic as possible by putting us in the real world. We feel the terror and get a sense that war may not be worth all the turmoil it causes. Waltz with Bashir is another great example of pulling us into the action and showing how work could have such devastating effects. The movies and animation war, film and the resulting effect is that were removed from the reality and the film because it's animated and doesn't look realistic.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Then in the last minute or so, the film quickly cuts to actual footage of the aftermath of the massacres in Lebanon. The result is heart wrenching. It jars us from the spectacle of the animation into the harshness of reality. We see widows crying dead bodies and it's all thrown at us with no preparation for the transition from cartoons to reality. The effect is extremely powerful and we realized that what we were originally seeing only an animated characters is in fact exactly the reality of war and that reality is horrific suffering. If that's not an antiwar film, then I don't know what it is. I do see where the food is coming from when he says there's no such thing as an antiwar film. He's saying that film by nature contained spectacle. Since we're not actually on the battlefield and our safe in our movie theater seats, we don't completely feel exactly like the soldiers do because we're removed from the reality.

Speaker 1:          05:55          This removal makes it difficult to construct a film that truly leaves people, discussed it at war because we're safe from it. We can enjoy watching the destruction of film in the theater. Famous director, Samuel Fuller, upon watching the very antiwar, full metal jacket stated that it was just another goddamn recruiting film. Even when films try to criticize war, sometimes they can still give the effect of making more glamorous cinema as an art form is limited because no matter how John we are to the movie, there's always that barrier from reality. A train on screen doesn't frighten us like it would in real life, so maybe we are a little desensitized by the screen. We aren't shocked like the viewers of the train were back in 18, 96. Some may say that's a limitation to film, but to others it's a challenge. It's a challenge all filmmakers have to tackle. They have to surprise and astonish us even when we're used to watching film and maybe not every blockbuster these days can blow you away, but every once in a while if you're lucky, you get to see a film that hits you like a free
