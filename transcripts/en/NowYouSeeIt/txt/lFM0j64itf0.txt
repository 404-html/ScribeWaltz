Speaker 1:          00:01          Not Bad words. No words are bad, but some people start using them a lot to hurt other people and then they become bad. It'd become a hard, there's words that I love that I can't use because other people use them wrong to hurt other people. Like the word cons is a beautiful word

Speaker 2:          00:13          to me. Beauty forward and I don't, I mean aesthetically it has like chocolate and around on the ends. I just liked, I just liked the way it sounds and I don't use it as an insight.

Speaker 1:          00:27          I'm alone in my laundry. I'm like tones.

Speaker 2:          00:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37          Words hold a lot of weight. When you give a guy in particular swear words, while people may just consider them a way to make something funny or to show someone's, Matt actually goes a lot deeper than that. I want to explore swear words, see how they're used and how they reveal a lot more than you may think. That's awesome. I want to know where swearing came from. One has to look no further than the word itself. The word swearing and cursing are biblical in origin. The first words that were taboo where words that said the Lord's name in vain way back in the day, swearing on the Bible was a big deal because people really thought perjury undetected by the legal system would be punished by an ease dropping and easily offended God. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but similarly a curse on someone was not only serious but also deadly. Nowadays our society has lessens the power of those vulgarities and focused more on the taboos of sex and bodily functions.

Speaker 2:          01:40          She looked me in the eyes and said, mom is making a pub salad and I need some sets, own dressing, but I think

Speaker 1:          01:46          it's a common misconception to think we've become completely desensitized from swears in the 21st century. Sure. Plenty of movies swear like crazy, but swear words still hold that element of taboo to prove my point. God, I haven't been fuck like that since grade school. Would this line have had the same effect if it was, I haven't made love this intensely. People may associate swearing with somebody who's out of control, swearing in rage. But what's interesting in cinema is that it can often be the opposite. The person who swears is the one that's actually in control of the scene. Jerry [inaudible] guard in Fargo is constantly sworn at by people he hires and fucking wife, you know, or your fucking wife, Cherry strangers through a bald face, liar, fucking liar and his own son.

Speaker 1:          02:32          And when he gets pushed too far, he finally curses back. But it's hilariously lane Darren two-toned port until yet he's an extremely weak character who constantly gets pushed around and the swear words reveal how everyone in his life can talk down to him and control him. The one who swearing is the one dominating the scene. It's almost like a verbal way of marking your territory. You'll notice in the opening of reservoir dogs that white is the only one who gets this weird directly at the boss showing not only that they have a more casual relationship, but that Mr. White is willing to stand up to it. My full time shit fucking here and y'all give it back to you. Swear words carry a lot of weight. The most famous line in cinema, right. My hair, I don't give a damn, would not be the same without the swear.

Speaker 1:          03:16          A much bigger deal. Back in 1939 the curse word really embodies how fed up red is with scarlet O'hara and he's not bubbling and anger. It's pure apathy. A place where swearing is controversial is actually stand up comedy. There's that angel debate of vulgarity and whether or not comedians could be just as funny without the constant f bonds. I have the glasses just completely disguised as this guy. And then it was something about meantime, two of them are stuck in a fucking cave every week, you know? And that was the bit, and then I said, well, let me see if it works without the word. Right. And I took the word out, it didn't work. And that's what bothered me. And why do comedians swear? But it's not about the swear word there. It's about, you know, it's about you getting worked up. Yeah, it's about this guy is, he means this.

Speaker 1:          03:58          He's so annoyed. Right. The fucking cave your ass funny. That's contempt that take for example, this swear word that's always bothered me in the titanic, he's got the iceberg warning and it's fucking hand. Excuse me, his hand, it serves no purpose and it's a poor use of vulgarity. Definitely makes anything funny. It does. There's no doubt about it. Once you, once you inject a fuck into your speech, that makes it funnier. It gives it, it gives it an emphasis and it gives it a shock. Just about every swear word in the departed seems to make me laugh.

Speaker 3:          04:26          Green is on a cup of coffee, but spoke with anyone. Just stop now go fuck yourself.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Kidding myself. If sometimes a swear words purpose is just as simple as that, but in the movie they don't just swear leftin write characters. No when it's appropriate or not. Like using a softer word when flirting with someone. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          04:40          just smack. You'll have fun there. I'll break your grades.

Speaker 1:          04:43          You've got her interest. Then you can go in for the sweater.

Speaker 3:          04:46          When's the last time you checked before I went to a second topic

Speaker 1:          04:50          is 40 Melissa McCarthy essentially cameos as the character that swears nonstop and it's just dumped. Don't get me wrong, I love a good improvised moment and swear words can be really funny, but this scene makes no sense in its context. Yo, you're a horrible fucking woman. This is why everybody hates you, Jill. This kind of shit. I mean, they're in a principal's office and they just met and she's going to talk like this. It's not realistic and frankly it's boring. None of this talk is productive, but how about this? Let's try something a little more complex. What does this swear word accomplish?

Speaker 4:          05:19          Okay. Tell me, what did you mix say to hear multiple migs and the next step is to do, what did he say? He said, I can smell your content. I see.

Speaker 1:          05:35          Misuse of swearing has many layers to it. At first it seems like a way to make clarissa uncomfortable. Hannibal obviously heard what makes that and he just wants her to have to say it, so she's embarrassed, but with every insult and humiliating comment he spits at her, she stays strong. Continuing to act polite, insincere, see a lot doc. I think it's partly Hannibal's admiration for her strength and a sense of pity that causes him to help. At the end of the scene, there's a certain duality to swear words. On one hand they're funny, but on the other hand, they're deadly. Nothing captures this idea more than movies like full metal jacket and whiplash where authority figures yellow verbal abuse. That's funny, but also deeply manipulative and cruel.

Speaker 5:          06:10          What have we got here? I'm fucking comedian. I admire your honesty. Hell, I like you can come over to my house and fuck my sister.

Speaker 1:          06:20          I know that's a lot of ways to use swear words, but what ties them all together is that a swear word always reveal something. It reveals control, a relationship or even some manipulation. There's that saying sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me. After watching this video. Do you still think that's true?

Speaker 6:          06:34          Maybe, maybe not, maybe fuck yourself

Speaker 5:          06:39          slightly trends, just a bit of a break from the norm. Just a little slot in the break. The monotony of all that hard.
