Speaker 2:          00:33          gangster is deeply ingrained in American cinema. The gun slinging bad asses of the criminal underworld have had enormous success since their inception in the silent era, but how is it that the American gangster I character still violent, profane and cruel. It's so glorified on the big screen. I want to explore a cycle analytic approach to this question and see how the American gangster embodies and nate and universal human desires. Let's start with a simple question. Who was the original gangster? Where did this larger than life persona come from? With this question, you run into problems. I personally consider Rico Band Delo in Little Caesar to be the first true gangster, one of the first talking gangsters. He's also the first to have the iconic accent, indistinct speech role. Now very familiar with

Speaker 3:          01:12          massage. A shirt my way out of it, like a joke for the Naga afterwards.

Speaker 2:          01:17          The promise that he isn't really a gangster. He's actually inspired to become a gangster from a newspaper article about Pete Montana to try to enter the gangster world. He's a copycat. The very first gangster film is the musketeers of pig alley, and the name of the film originates from a newspaper article about the shooting of a gambler on quote, New York's other side. Perhaps the actual original depiction of gangsters was in a collection of photographs of the slums by Jacob Reese with the famous photo bandits roost in 1890. The problem with the gangsters genre begins here. This photo is staged, constructed the shot to have its trademark level of fear and fascination that we know and love today, and gangsters and the influence of this picture on the gangsters genre is seen up and into the 21st century. This brings me to my first point. There is no original gangster. Pretty much every gangster we know and love is a copycat. Michael Corleone, military uniform and original distaste for gang life borrows straight from Mike powers in the public enemy, and this shot in pulp fiction eludes directly to the Godfather. Tommy's erratic behavior in Goodfellas, echoes cody Jarret in white heat. Scarface is a remake, and even the modern hood gangster doesn't completely depart from conventional gangsters. They kept me in the hospital a week or so. I mostly stayed up thinking about my cousin watching old games,

Speaker 3:          02:29          the movies, some identification. How about Miami? This guy,

Speaker 2:          02:36          and of course the sopranos is famous for referencing multiple gangster movies in pretty much every episode. Shimmy up a

Speaker 3:          02:43          what? I thought I was out separate buckets. Every iconic gangster movie is in some way copycat to make up. What was your conversation with yourself about how the violence should be? I confess that I was very impressed with Arthur pens, a Bonnie and Clyde and thought about that when watching sonny corleone get shot without a doubt, and I thought that the effects of violence and money, I'd always had an imaginative and I'd like to think a good fellas comes out of the tradition of something as extreme

Speaker 2:          03:28          as the roaring twenties in scarface. What's important to note here is that every gangster borrowed something from older gangsters, and if you go back far enough, the gangster isn't based in reality at all. There's only the artificially constructed idea of the gangster. This is a key point in understanding American obsession with the gangster. We're not actually obsessed with being the leader of the criminal underworld. We're obsessed with what being a gangster represents. Now we have to go back to the question at hand. What does it gangster represent and why do we like them so much? What does the gangster even if you think it's just money or women than you're wrong, forgetting all about the money and everything. The best thing is we can find out what a gangster wants because they tell us, I don't want to be a product of my environment. I want my environment to be a product of meat.

Speaker 2:          04:16          So what does that mean? That line describes the desire that any human fields and understands if you watch any gangster movie, each one has this similar idea. I don't want to dance around other people. They to understand what this idea means. You have to take a trip into the human psyche. I point to a quote from psychologist, Adam Phillips. We wouldn't think of anything as a tragedy if we did not have a deeply ingrained sense of order already there to be a frontier when we're angry. It's because something doesn't happen in the way we want it to. Even when you get mad at something as simple as losing your keys, it means your fantasy of an ideal world. A world where everything is available to you at your fingertips was disrupted in the ideal life. The rest of the world revolves entirely around you. Would you like to go walking in the dining room with the donor?

Speaker 2:          04:56          So Dallas, Dallas, wearing a nice silk dress? Never everybody waiting on you do like it. The gangster is the perfect embodiment of this fantasy. The world operates how the gangster wants it to operate. He can give us with the twitch of his fingers when he walks into a room, people offering them a place to sit, to do business. All he has to do is not disability of the gangster, transcends simple money or sex or respect. It is the idea that the gangster has complete dominion over his world. I want to make them an offer in the Godfather. What's the first thing Vito Corleone asks? Please come to me first. In this scene, America Bonasera acts as a threat to the gangsters. All powerful reach bonus here it goes to the police first showing that he believes more in the American justice system than in Beto. Even the lighting has bonused.

Speaker 2:          05:39          Sarah's face looked like a rat, making him visually appear like a trader. He doesn't buy into the Godfather's power, but of course the godfather winds from over in all of media. That gangster is perhaps the closest embodiment to a guy. Superheros come close, but even they have to fight villains and save the world. Gangsters have nothing to worry about. The appeal of the gangster is not that he's a gangster, it's that he is all knowing and all powerful. If he doesn't want to pay the tab, he doesn't have to imagine being able to live like that. I think in the movies, the worst part about the gangsters. Downfall isn't the actual death. It's much worse than that. It's one of the gangster goes back to being just like us, powerless and unable to control his world. This idea goes as far back as the public enemy. When the very physical and expressive Tom Powers gets physically restrained and mummified when he dies, it's most present in goodfellas. When Henry Hill goes into witness protection program, everybody had their hands out, everything was for the taking, and now it's all over and becomes just like you and me have to wait around like everyone else and as he closes the door, we hear the sound of jail, cell bars closing, symbolizing his loss of the all powerful aura of the game.

Speaker 4:          06:46          Of

Speaker 2:          06:46          course, I haven't mentioned one crucial detail about the gangster, the over the top violence houses, genres so successful with such violence. In one episode of the Sopranos, Tony Takes his daughter to visit colleges on the way he recognized the rat hudson down and strangles the rat to death with a wide. The creators of the show were hesitant to make this episode because of its hyper violence, but made it anyway and it's brutal. The shots are extremely close up and it follows the strangling to the bitter end. The episode was praised by critics and went on to win two entities, which begs the question, why do we like this horrific violence? The answer comes from the idea of the taboo, something taboo is untouchable and there's a fascination with things that cannot be touched. Subjects like drugs and violence are taboo, but the fact that they cannot be touched gives them a level of power.

Speaker 2:          07:28          If you refuse to touch something and you have to be at some level obsessed with it, if that thing didn't matter to you, then you wouldn't care if you touched it. For some, the taboo is rooted in superstition. Mike and Aversion to peg boards or black magic. With that obsession comes a desire to observe the taboo from a distance. Naturally, there's a draw to look at something that holds so much power over us. I know there are women like my best friend, but would've gotten out of bed the minute that boyfriend gave them a gun to hide.

Speaker 2:          07:57          I got to admit the truth. It turned me on. Speaking of rats in Victorian Society, they were inexplicably taboo. They were a symbol of the unclean and we're certainly untouchable, but a sociologist at the time wrote detailed accounts of street performers who are trained in handling and touching super rents, spectators would watch and discuss, but also wonderment at the performance ability to put his hand in a cage of rafts without getting bit. That performer in many ways had a mystical power to be able to handle something that was so taboo and people in the crowd at something. They also found so repulsive and doesn't it sound a lot like the gangster, don't they have a certain power to do things? We would never have the guts to do ourselves by participating in the taboo, sex violence and the criminal life. They have an appeal to them and the distance between the movie screen and us is the perfect amount of distance where we get to observe but not touch the taboo. The gangster is certainly a complex character, but we're not all that different from. We all want that respect, status and controls. The only difference is we don't have the guts to do anything about it. We're satisfied with seeing it on the big screen and maybe that's a good thing. Or maybe

Speaker 5:          08:56          we're all a bunch of suckers and they've been right all along. As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.

Speaker 3:          09:10          No, I would only,

Speaker 5:          09:23          uh.
