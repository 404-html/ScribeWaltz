Speaker 1:          00:10          And now our feature presentation Lawrence of Arabia, presented in its original ultra cinema scope letterbox format. I can't see anything. What's the rather attractive girl on a camel? That's Peter O'toole. I want to make a quick video on the usage of aspect ratios as a thematic device in film. While the first 40 years of film were limited to one ratio for length and width of a screen. Modern filmmakers have several aspect ratios to choose from and each one can have a different emotional effect for the viewer. Let's look at why filmmakers choose the ratios they choose and explore the emotional effect of changing aspect ratio. During a film. The oldest aspect ratio is the four by three academy ratio and it lost its popularity after the introduction of 16 by nine ratio in the 19 fifties. Directors still use this ratio sometimes though to make the film feel like it's from an older time period. A great example is the Grand Budapest hotel, but she switches to academy. When the story goes back to the 19 forties, the begins of course with

Speaker 1:          01:12          the aspect ratio change is a great way to emotionally transport us to the time period. When this ratio was popular, we associate the aspect ratio with old timey movies and it helps pull us into the old timey style, quirkiness, manners, and culture that the Grand Budapest hotel has 500 days of summer uses polaroid square ratio as a way to show a glamorized, reminiscent past. This time capsule look coincides nicely with Tom's old fashioned unrealistic view of love. Towards the end of the movie, though, this polaroid look is eventually pushed off screen. As Tom realizes the expectation of this old fashioned outlook does not coincide with reality.

Speaker 1:          01:50          two point three, five ratio is ultra wide screen and it gives the look of an epic big budget drama or a Scifi film. I like how Auntie Donna uses it for over the top drama. My theses. So good, but compared to you such doodles of robot games,

Speaker 3:          02:05          I mean he is the APP.

Speaker 1:          02:13          The ratio is reserved for extremely epic movies. A movie like Napoleon dynamite would look kind of off in this extreme ratio, but a movie like star wars wouldn't look nearly the same without it. Portraying space is commonly associated with big aspect ratio changes. Interstellar switches to imax footage when the shots are of space, and it goes back to 16 by nine for shots of the spaceship. What better way to make space look bigger than my literally adding to the screen? The same has done in apollo 13 in galaxy quest to show the huge scope of space

Speaker 1:          02:47          aspect ratio changes to add scope aren't exclusive to space movies though right before the Bain verse Batman Fight and the Dark Knight rises, for example, the camera transitions to figure imax footage. This change has a great subconscious emotional effect. It reminds us subtly that we're about to watch an intense epic seen hunger games also does a good job of adding anticipation by slowly expanding into IMEX footage before the fighting begins. The right aspect ratio can contribute to the realism of a film. A scripted film that's supposed to look like a documentary has to be 16 by nine or else it won't emotionally feel like a documentary. The opening scene in the incredibles purposefully looks like 16 millimeter, six by nine ratio film and the effect adds realism, so the movie feels less like a cartoon and more like a realistic action film. Catch me if you can cleverly use this aspect.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Ratio change to show frank is contained. He starts on TV in the small academy ratio and then he's next shown through a small slit in a wall. He is literally being squished in the frame. It gives the emotional feeling that frank is trapped. The most ambitious aspect ratio changes or when the ratio is ignored, completely life of Pi has the fish that literally jumping out of the frame and asked the great and powerful does the same with a burst of flame. It's a really immersive technique and makes for a great visual aspect. Ratios have a chance to greatly contribute to the visual storytelling of the film. Whether they indicate time period intensity or added realism aspect ratios are another clever tool at the disposal of the modern director. If you want to fully understand the style of the film, the film's aspect ratio is a great frame of reference. Thanks for watching.
