1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.210
<v Speaker 1>What a character chooses to drink says a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about them,</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>about teenage shaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they get a shot of whiskey,</v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.700
<v Speaker 1>they're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they order a fine chardonnay,</v>

4
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>they're probably trying to go for class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's wondrich used in cinema that</v>

5
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>requires a bit of explanation as to</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking 1% is that because you think</v>

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>you're fat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the first thing that comes to</v>

7
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>mind when you think of milk is youth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence.</v>

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>When a 16 year old uses his charm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>grace to mimic being a pilot,</v>

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>we're reminded of his age by his drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>of choice.</v>

10
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Would you like a drink after takeoff</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk in a clockwork orange,</v>

11
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>the adolescent streak mill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gentle reminder that all this mayhem</v>

12
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>is being caused by kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Deane,</v>

13
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>famously nurses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bottle of milk in such a way that we</v>

14
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>get a visual cue of his conflicts</v>
<v Speaker 1>between maturity and adulthood.</v>

15
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't drink milk,</v>

16
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>then your manly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

17
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>am I outside them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I I got a bowler nails for breakfast</v>

18
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

19
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>so without an ame milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right this wig,</v>

20
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.340
<v Speaker 1>sorry to keep you waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to go for a deep reading,</v>

21
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>you could say that Kevin's spilling milk</v>
<v Speaker 1>in home alone is a symbol of his lack of</v>

22
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>maternal nourishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say John Hughes just wanted</v>

23
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>the visual joke of everybody crying over</v>
<v Speaker 1>spilled milk,</v>

24
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>but this only scratches the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many adults also drink milk and that's</v>

25
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>where it gets more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milk is a symbol of childishness,</v>

26
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>so it's humorous to see Leon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the professional,</v>

27
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>a hypermasculine assassin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking it throughout the movie.</v>

28
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>It fits into the comedic moments of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

29
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>but it also sheds light on his maternal</v>
<v Speaker 1>side as he takes Matilda under his wing.</v>

30
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>In this instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking milk is a joke,</v>

31
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>but many times drinking milk has the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite intent.</v>

32
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something off about a grown man</v>

33
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>drinking milk and filmmakers seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>well aware of this intuition in</v>

34
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>hitchcock suspicion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The audience suspects that the milk may</v>

35
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>be poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an eerie choice to have milk,</v>

36
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>a drink we associate with innocence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>purity be the drink that may be</v>

37
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would have had nearly</v>

38
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>the same effect if it were a cup of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee or a shot of whiskey.</v>

39
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>There's something delightful about</v>
<v Speaker 1>making milk threatening.</v>

40
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>We see this again and inglorious</v>
<v Speaker 1>bastards.</v>

41
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Colonel Hans Londa chugs a glass of milk</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Lofa deeds farm and it has the</v>

42
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>creepy factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to it than that.</v>

43
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I quote a social theorist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roland barthes and his take on milk.</v>

44
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>It's purity associated with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence of a child is a token of</v>

45
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>strength of a strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not revulsive,</v>

46
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>not congestive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but calm white,</v>

47
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>lucid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The equal of reality.</v>

48
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a wash</v>

49
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 2>should cover.</v>

50
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>So when a villain grabs the glass of</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk,</v>

51
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.530
<v Speaker 1>it's creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also shows their power.</v>

52
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>They're conquering the pure and innocent</v>
<v Speaker 1>by consuming it and there's a strength</v>

53
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I saw Mad Max fury road in</v>

54
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only time people audibly cringed in</v>

55
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:33.460
<v Speaker 1>the crowd wasn't during an action</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence.</v>

56
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.390
<v Speaker 1>It was when this happened,</v>

57
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Western culture has an aversion to</v>
<v Speaker 1>breastmilk,</v>

58
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>seeing it as taboo to drink as an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little wonky.</v>

59
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>That's because that's from Debbie's left</v>
<v Speaker 1>breast.</v>

60
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the choice to harvest breast milk in the</v>

61
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>movie further alienates the post</v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalyptic world from our own.</v>

62
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mad Max fury road is a movie about</v>

63
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>fluids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are exploited for their breast</v>

64
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are exploited for their blood and</v>

65
00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>the populous is exploited by controlling</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water supply.</v>

66
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>The complete control of these liquids by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Wharton Joe shows his dominion over</v>

67
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>his world and the milk is no exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

68
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>his sons drink the milk to keep up their</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle mass.</v>

69
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Reinforcing the idea that consuming milk</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a sign of strength.</v>

70
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>What's so great about using these</v>
<v Speaker 1>liquids in the film is that it allows</v>

71
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>mad max to introduce plot points and</v>
<v Speaker 1>character arcs non verbally.</v>

72
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>After Mad Max performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his first selfless act for Furiosa,</v>

73
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 1>he washes himself with milk symbolizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the start of his transformation from a</v>

74
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>selfish man only looking for survival to</v>
<v Speaker 1>one who cares in nurtures for others,</v>

75
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>the turn to completely trusting Furiosa</v>
<v Speaker 1>is symbolized by him giving her his</v>

76
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another liquid symbol,</v>

77
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>mad max fury road is a prime example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>

78
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Enhancing the visual storytelling of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

79
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Milk is a powerful storytelling device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can show someone as a child,</v>

80
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be used to unsettle show</v>
<v Speaker 1>character strength or give information</v>

81
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>about the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the next time you see a character</v>

82
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>drinking something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>

83
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.330
<v Speaker 1>thanks for one,</v>

84
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.270
<v Speaker 3>whoever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cool,</v>

85
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.380
<v Speaker 3>slightly trends full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a bit of a break from the norm.</v>

86
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Just a little slump in the break from</v>
<v Speaker 3>monotony of all that hard.</v>
