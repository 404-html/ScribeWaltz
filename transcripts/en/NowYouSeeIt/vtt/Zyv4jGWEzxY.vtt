00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>In a few moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will have written the funniest joke</v>

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:08.031
<v Speaker 1>in the world and as a consequence he</v>
<v Speaker 1>will die laughing.</v>

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Ah Ha.</v>

4
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it's wrong to say either style</v>
<v Speaker 3>of comedy is better.</v>

5
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 3>I find it kind of annoying when people</v>
<v Speaker 3>say British comedy is always smarter,</v>

6
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 3>or whittier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen arrested development or 21</v>

7
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 3>jump street or even a spongebob episode?</v>

8
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick.</v>

9
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Being an artist is a heavy</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

10
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Each work of art is like a child and</v>
<v Speaker 1>must be treated as such.</v>

11
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>It was just going to draw a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you say so?</v>

13
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.870
<v Speaker 3>This definitely very smart writing on</v>
<v Speaker 3>both sides of the Atlantic,</v>

14
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't answer the question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes them different?</v>

15
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 3>After weeks of research?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My answer is still.</v>

16
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:06.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's give it a shot.</v>

17
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>No one could read it and live.</v>

18
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

19
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

20
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

21
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 3>I didn't change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the difference,</v>

22
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we're talking about the big to</v>

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 5>Britain and America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

24
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 5>rest of the world.</v>

25
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 3>I think the first step is to take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>British comedy and see how it's American</v>

26
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 3>adaptation changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the difference between David,</v>

27
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 3>Brent and Michael Scott by season to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>US office begins its movement away from</v>

28
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 3>the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Originally we even see a subtle</v>

29
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 3>cinematic change by brightening the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lights in the office while originally</v>

30
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 3>just a way to differentiate it from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>UK version.</v>

31
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 3>The added brightness seems to serve as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>nice metaphor for the adaptation as a</v>

32
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 3>whole,</v>

33
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 5>but the big differences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Americans are more optimistic and</v>

34
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and last due to the fact that Americans</v>

35
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 5>are told they can become the next</v>
<v Speaker 5>president of United States and</v>

36
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 5>British people to told it won't happen</v>
<v Speaker 5>to you.</v>

37
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 5>And they carry that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I carry that with them.</v>

38
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt that America lightened</v>
<v Speaker 3>up the show.</v>

39
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 3>Michael Scott had his failures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a hope to it.</v>

40
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 3>In one episode he wasn't invited to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim's party,</v>

41
00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:33.790
<v Speaker 3>but shows up anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genuinely hurt and bitter.</v>

42
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who opened the morgue for this thing?</v>

43
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 3>He picks a duet song and no one will</v>
<v Speaker 3>sing it with him.</v>

44
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 3>Reluctantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim joints in giving Michael a big</v>

45
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:44.620
<v Speaker 3>cheesy smile and an overall happy ending</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the episode.</v>

46
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 3>But when David Brent performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still funny,</v>

47
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 3>but at different kinds of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody pities him or cheers them on.</v>

48
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 3>They all just watched you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Been embarrassing.</v>

49
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 3>There's no happy ending and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hopeful.</v>

50
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Or look at how both characters wrap up</v>
<v Speaker 3>their time on the shelf.</v>

51
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Spoiler alert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Scott clits to move with his</v>

52
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:14.120
<v Speaker 3>fiance to call Rato and David Brent begs</v>
<v Speaker 3>for his job back.</v>

53
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.250
<v Speaker 3>I will try twice as hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

54
00:03:16.251 --> 00:03:20.240
<v Speaker 3>well I not being complacent and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>turn this place around if we just say</v>

55
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.840
<v Speaker 3>that it's not definite now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And of course this doesn't include the</v>

56
00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Christmas special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a lot happier.</v>

57
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 5>Put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The American coming here like John</v>

58
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.240
<v Speaker 5>Belushi or someone like that is do you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know that scene in a animal house where</v>

59
00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 5>the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fellow playing folk music on a guitar</v>

60
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.340
<v Speaker 5>and John Belushi picked up the guitar</v>
<v Speaker 5>and destroys it and the cinema just</v>

61
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:46.470
<v Speaker 5>smashes it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then where goes his eyebrows up a</v>

62
00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:47.840
<v Speaker 5>camera and I want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

63
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.020
<v Speaker 5>he's so great with a British comedian</v>
<v Speaker 5>would want to play the focusing.</v>

64
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.970
<v Speaker 3>We want to play the failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get an engine started near the</v>

65
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.660
<v Speaker 3>five by five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe the difference is the</v>

66
00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:08.720
<v Speaker 3>optimistic American dream versus the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dark British reality.</v>

67
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.490
<v Speaker 3>At least that's what many people think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

68
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Europe is just basically a gene pool of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people whose answers to said,</v>

69
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.373
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

70
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can risk their are risk</v>
<v Speaker 3>of America is a gene pool of people say,</v>

71
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.823
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's risky,</v>

72
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 3>but I think that answer is too easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to ignore the fact that</v>

73
00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Americans love the failures like Sean</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Shaun of the dead and plenty of</v>

74
00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:32.150
<v Speaker 3>modern American sitcoms feature losers</v>
<v Speaker 3>who never get their redemption.</v>

75
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an outdated theory.</v>

76
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 3>The past television era of married with</v>
<v Speaker 3>children and Seinfeld and friends always</v>

77
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 3>featured the classic wise guy who always</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the funny one liner for every moment</v>

78
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how to take the reservation.</v>

79
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 3>You just don't know how to hold it.</v>

80
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I think in the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're starting to see a self awareness</v>

81
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:59.460
<v Speaker 3>of this American dream optimism style of</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

82
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.040
<v Speaker 3>and it's always sunny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There certainly is that feeling of hope</v>

83
00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:03.930
<v Speaker 3>in the characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think they can accomplished</v>

84
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:06.150
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they always take it way too far by</v>

85
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 3>becoming violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cruel,</v>

86
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 3>and hilariously backstabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost a critique on American</v>

87
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.380
<v Speaker 3>optimism in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to succeed,</v>

88
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 3>but at what cost?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely gone.</v>

89
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 3>We're definitely gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Need a silencer gun?</v>

90
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Find no guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no guns up.</v>

91
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Piano wire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

92
00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we can use the panel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

93
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be The guy to pull the trigger on this</v>

94
00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 3>thing to mention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always fail in face the</v>

95
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:30.780
<v Speaker 3>consequences and it seems like not one</v>
<v Speaker 3>single thing ever works out for Larry</v>

96
00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:34.340
<v Speaker 3>and curb your enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to step out of the car please.</v>

97
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

98
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did episode of Louie ends with his date</v>

99
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:41.580
<v Speaker 3>running into a helicopter to escape?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't get more pathetic than that.</v>

100
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.540
<v Speaker 3>So maybe some American comedy pokes fun</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the hope and lighthearted nature of</v>

101
00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:48.270
<v Speaker 3>past sitcoms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe American comedy is even</v>

102
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:51.960
<v Speaker 3>shifting towards that British cynicism</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe will always hold that American</v>

103
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:55.590
<v Speaker 3>optimism in our hearts and even in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>millennial generation where the American</v>

104
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:57.470
<v Speaker 3>dream seems to do nothing but screw</v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

105
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 3>It'll always be ingrained in our culture</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mindset to shrug it off and keep on</v>

106
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 3>trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna take no for an answer</v>

107
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 3>because I just refuse to do that because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a winter and winter is we don't</v>

108
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 3>listen to words like like no or or don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>or stop.</v>

109
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Those words are just not in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>vocabulary.</v>

110
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 3>I know this is a topic a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>get passionate about it,</v>

111
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 3>but I hope the comment section doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get too heated.</v>

112
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 3>At least I don't expect some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spanish influence.</v>

113
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for watching.</v>

114
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.590
<v Speaker 6>Just a bit of a break for just a little</v>
<v Speaker 6>above that.</v>
