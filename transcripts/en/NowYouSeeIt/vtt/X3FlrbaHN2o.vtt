1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures they make these days roll into</v>

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.773
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cut,</v>

3
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Speaker 1>cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut,</v>

4
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opening shot of a touch of evil was</v>

5
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>six and a half minutes long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three or four in a way,</v>

6
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>set up the whole picture of the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>

7
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Father was a key grip and what about</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute beginners?</v>

8
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>That was an extraordinary shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hell is that I've never heard of it.</v>

9
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Now you see it aren't long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Takes awesome.</v>

10
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the huge ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the masterpieces where all the technical</v>

11
00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 2>camera work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>special effects and carefully</v>

12
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 2>choreographed movement pushes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries of cinema as an art form and</v>

13
00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:33.610
<v Speaker 2>leaves us thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

14
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 2>If you want to read more about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome they are,</v>

15
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I recommend that these three articles or</v>
<v Speaker 2>even these tech.</v>

16
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.710
<v Speaker 2>How about 25?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is we're all well aware</v>

17
00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:49.870
<v Speaker 2>of how long it takes work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They dazzled,</v>

18
00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:52.090
<v Speaker 2>they entertain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pushed film to its limits,</v>

19
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.330
<v Speaker 2>but I want to make a quick video essay</v>
<v Speaker 2>that explores one way long takes might</v>

20
00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>people limited in their storytelling</v>
<v Speaker 2>abilities to start.</v>

21
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Let's hear from someone familiar who</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't like long takes.</v>

22
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Don't know why I really dialed in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stump.</v>

23
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I can only call it a stunt</v>

24
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rope rope was hitchcock's attempt at a</v>

25
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 2>movie taking place in real time in one</v>
<v Speaker 2>long take.</v>

26
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Originally a play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitchcock kept every action and reaction</v>

27
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 2>in the frame and let the camera roll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cameras at the time could only film 20</v>

28
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 2>minutes per reel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had to hide cuts in between scenes</v>

29
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 2>when he needed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you worrying about,</v>

30
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Philip?</v>
<v Speaker 2>After all the result is something</v>

31
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 2>hitchcock didn't think was all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

32
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 2>He comments on what it was missing in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>French interview with the truffaut,</v>

33
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 2>which explains the French translator in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the background.</v>

34
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 3>When I look back of it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite nonsense.</v>

35
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Memorials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Bosco.</v>

36
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.550
<v Speaker 3>I was breaking all my own simplicity to</v>
<v Speaker 3>of film.</v>

37
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 3>The Samuel just fill me in on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting of film to tell the story.</v>

38
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people think the cotton is St</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montage or assembly is taking a man from</v>

39
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 3>one place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan Adler and jumping into a closeup</v>

40
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 3>of him which griffith invented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true,</v>

41
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.800
<v Speaker 3>but</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it goes much deeper.</v>

42
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 2>So that's what long takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Miss Editing.</v>

43
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.970
<v Speaker 2>In many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitchcock was simply filming a play,</v>

44
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.890
<v Speaker 2>but if it was something originally a</v>
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

45
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 2>you can use editing to tell a story and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitchcock things.</v>

46
00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Editing is a strong storytelling device</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was missing with his movie.</v>

47
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 2>How could rope have used editing to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>its story?</v>

48
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry men originally a teleplay and then</v>

49
00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:38.230
<v Speaker 2>a stage play also has a limited set and</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy dialogue,</v>

50
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.660
<v Speaker 2>but the editing tells us everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like rope,</v>

51
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:43.030
<v Speaker 2>which has no Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The beginning shots are wide</v>

52
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a six minute long take</v>

53
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning where conversation is</v>
<v Speaker 2>light and everyone looks at ease in the</v>

54
00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:51.070
<v Speaker 2>early scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the dialogue features multiple</v>

55
00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 2>people that takes are relatively long</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shots of single people aren't too</v>

56
00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 2>close as the movie progresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intense scenes have super close ups of</v>

57
00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 2>characters and the are much quicker by</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing the camera to cut quickly from</v>

58
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 2>closeup too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Closeup editing showcases the intensity</v>

59
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 2>of this</v>

60
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.243
<v Speaker 4>seat</v>

61
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 2>guilty not to mention the Erie overhead</v>
<v Speaker 2>lighting,</v>

62
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 2>the performances and the rain in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

63
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 2>The cuts are very important here too</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly and efficiently.</v>

64
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Move from the action to the reaction as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to a long take where the camera</v>

65
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 2>has to either whip around or we see</v>
<v Speaker 2>action and reaction at the same time,</v>

66
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>which gives them both equal weight to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the viewer,</v>

67
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's not to say filmmakers can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>direct our eyes without using cuts.</v>

68
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 2>On the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>director's guide our eyes with the right</v>

69
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.431
<v Speaker 2>lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>camera,</v>

70
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 2>movement and frame composition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The University of Edinburg developed a</v>

71
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 2>visual tools that track eye movement so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can show people a movie clip and</v>

72
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 2>track what they look at in this scene in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be blood.</v>

73
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 2>The person talking is important to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>viewer according to where they're</v>

74
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 2>looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I movement also shifts when someone</v>

75
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 2>moves to smoke a cigarette or starts</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving the frame.</v>

76
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 2>There's lots of ways to direct the eye</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's in focus where everybody is</v>

77
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 2>looking lights and geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may not notice it consciously,</v>

78
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 2>but directors are telling you where to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

79
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 2>especially in flashy long takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The long battle scene in the revenue is</v>

80
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's directed chaos.</v>

81
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 2>You look from one person to another or</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that specific era whizzing past the</v>

82
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 2>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but according to hitchcock along take,</v>

83
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 2>just can't beat the intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed and storytelling power of an</v>

84
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:21.844
<v Speaker 2>effective cut.</v>

85
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 3>Copping</v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

86
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.650
<v Speaker 3>It really should be called a hem.</v>

87
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.350
<v Speaker 2>When clips are assembled together</v>
<v Speaker 2>through editing,</v>

88
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 2>they create a new story for the viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you cut from one clip to another,</v>

89
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:41.400
<v Speaker 2>your mind associates the clips with each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other and creates the idea.</v>

90
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic example is the psycho shower</v>

91
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.230
<v Speaker 2>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it works in a variety of movies in</v>

92
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:48.150
<v Speaker 2>the Godfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coppola cuts from the spiritual</v>

93
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:51.450
<v Speaker 2>cleansing of Michael's son through</v>
<v Speaker 2>baptism to the violent cleansing of</v>

94
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:53.850
<v Speaker 2>mafia leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One cleanses with holy water.</v>

95
00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:54.450
<v Speaker 2>The other one</v>

96
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.283
<v Speaker 4>blood.</v>

97
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 2>You could write a book on what this</v>
<v Speaker 2>editing choice means in the context of</v>

98
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one thing is very clear.</v>

99
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 2>The editing is what establishes this</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolic connection and a take just</v>

100
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically associate two different</v>

101
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 2>ideas in a way as effective as these</v>
<v Speaker 2>edits.</v>

102
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean the</v>
<v Speaker 3>film which moved in rapid succession for</v>

103
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.260
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I create an idea</v>

104
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.120
<v Speaker 2>I love long takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody can appreciate them for how</v>

105
00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:34.280
<v Speaker 2>beautiful they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are limited in their</v>

106
00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:36.920
<v Speaker 2>storytelling power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give us more choices in what to</v>

107
00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:40.040
<v Speaker 2>look at compared to cutting from face to</v>
<v Speaker 2>face or object to object.</v>

108
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.350
<v Speaker 2>This has its advantages with more to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at.</v>

109
00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:44.510
<v Speaker 2>We can be more overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more taking it back,</v>

110
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 2>more amazed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a cut forcing us to look at one</v>

111
00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:51.200
<v Speaker 2>thing that can be intense and has the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of emphasis a big shot doesn't</v>

112
00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:53.150
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes an edit works,</v>

113
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.420
<v Speaker 2>sometimes a long take works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just depends on how you look at it.</v>

114
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.231
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a difference,</v>

115
00:05:57.231 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 2>how long it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly we do it in five minutes,</v>

116
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 2>so what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take an hour ballgame doesn't</v>

117
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 2>start till 8:00.</v>
