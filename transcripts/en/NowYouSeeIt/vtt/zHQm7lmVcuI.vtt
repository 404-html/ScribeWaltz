00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.883
<v Speaker 1>MMM,</v>

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.830
<v Speaker 1>we've all had daydreams about being able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fly.</v>

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>We can't defy the laws of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can still dream about it.</v>

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean when a character in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a film gets to fly?</v>

6
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a classic example in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>adults of the community showing</v>

7
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:21.080
<v Speaker 1>conformity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostility to anything new,</v>

8
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.930
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicion and a lack of imagination or</v>

9
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>bearing down on our young heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've even set up a roadblock at just</v>

10
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>the moment when things look worse to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bicycles.</v>

11
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Leave the earth and with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earthbound grownups we see escape,</v>

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 1>wonder magic and freedom through flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flying is freedom.</v>

13
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's do some closer readings of flying</v>
<v Speaker 1>and film.</v>

14
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Jenny and forrest gump wants to be free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wants to fly away from her troubles.</v>

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>She has a sexually abusive alcoholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.210
<v Speaker 1>She praised a flyaway,</v>

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>but does she get her wings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of.</v>

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>The police do take her to her</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandmother,</v>

19
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>so she's technically free from her</v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

20
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>but this camera shot tells a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

21
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>The camera moves up into the sky and</v>
<v Speaker 1>birds fly away with us,</v>

22
00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:03.940
<v Speaker 1>but Jenny stays put on the ground in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>literal sense.</v>

23
00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>She does get freed from her father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but figuratively,</v>

24
00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 1>she's still stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't fly away from the emotional</v>

25
00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 1>damage her father cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the shot of her as an adult</v>

26
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>still falling to the ground at the sight</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her old house.</v>

27
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.930
<v Speaker 1>The camera shot is placed firmly at</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground level reflecting that she still</v>

28
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:18.730
<v Speaker 1>grounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She failed to free herself from the</v>

29
00:01:18.731 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>shackles of her past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the movie,</v>

30
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>we see her trying to fly away and fail</v>
<v Speaker 1>each time.</v>

31
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I think I a flap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bridge,</v>

32
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>the closeup on her shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows Jenny trying to leap out of them,</v>

33
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>but she can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She stuck later.</v>

34
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>She tries to using drugs to forget her</v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse and fly away.</v>

35
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 1>The song freebird playing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background during this scene is</v>

36
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>definitely no coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when she wants to fly,</v>

37
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:41.110
<v Speaker 1>she's higher up in a building and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing high heels,</v>

38
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:43.720
<v Speaker 1>but no matter how much she tries</v>
<v Speaker 1>extending herself upwards,</v>

39
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 1>she's still slips and facing the reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she can't fly.</v>

40
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>She can't escape the scars of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>

41
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>only when Jenny goes back home to forest</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she start to emotionally recover.</v>

42
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can fly away from their past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can confront it,</v>

43
00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>accept and move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She dies,</v>

44
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 1>but she doesn't die alone are trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She dies in the company of people she</v>

45
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>loves and that's when she truly becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>free like a bird.</v>

46
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes in film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the character does feel like they're</v>

47
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>flying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see parallels between Jenny's</v>

48
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>attempted fight and roses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flight and titanic in the beginning.</v>

49
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Suicide off the back of the titanic</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be the only chance of escape.</v>

50
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Rose has from her rich plain lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unwanted marriage with Jack.</v>

51
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can now embrace a new found beauty</v>

52
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>in her life at the front of the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the difference between these</v>

53
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:30.320
<v Speaker 1>static dark closeups on the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ship and the sweeping shots of color in</v>

54
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>the later seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We perceive some innate beauty to the</v>

55
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 1>idea of flying that's reflected in</v>
<v Speaker 1>titanic.</v>

56
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Birdman has such an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayal of flight because in the film</v>

57
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>are hero Reagan Thompson rejects flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He chooses to stay on the ground and</v>

58
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>perform his play in Birdman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flight is still a symbol of freedom,</v>

59
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's a freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan wants to avoid.</v>

60
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Reagan wants to stay grounded and face</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

61
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 1>His place seeks to comment on the issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being human.</v>

62
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 1>With flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A person escapes the struggles of being</v>

63
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so flight means we no longer need the</v>

64
00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>philosophical discussions being human</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we've escaped the need for them,</v>

65
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>rick and wants to stay on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he wants to make art.</v>

66
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>That actually means something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he flies and makes superficial</v>

67
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>superhero movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll be unable to make any profound</v>

68
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>commentary on the human condition</v>
<v Speaker 1>because through flight he has escaped</v>

69
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stays on the ground so he can comment</v>

70
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>on the struggles of being grounded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his play.</v>

71
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>So what about the flight at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film?</v>

72
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a different kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>flight,</v>

73
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>mainly because it's not just him that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees it.</v>

74
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>His daughter does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By this time in the film,</v>

75
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Reagan has overcome the need to please</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

76
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>He does is play and does what he wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>purely for himself.</v>

77
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>He transcended our needs as humans to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit in and please others,</v>

78
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>and we see this transcendence</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented through flight.</v>

79
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>He achieved a higher sense of being both</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally and symbolically,</v>

80
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>so maybe we can't defy the laws of</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics and fly,</v>

81
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>but if you manage to figure out yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your place in the universe,</v>

82
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.463
<v Speaker 1>it's sure</v>

83
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.290
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is falling with style.</v>

84
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>
