00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>How are you feeling now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun Back at work.</v>

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>What line of work are you in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waste Management.</v>

3
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:13.404
<v Speaker 1>Consultant</v>

4
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.750
<v Speaker 2>gangster is deeply ingrained in American</v>
<v Speaker 2>cinema.</v>

5
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 2>The gun slinging bad asses of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal underworld have had enormous</v>

6
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 2>success since their inception in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>silent era,</v>

7
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 2>but how is it that the American gangster</v>
<v Speaker 2>I character still violent,</v>

8
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 2>profane and cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so glorified on the big screen.</v>

9
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I want to explore a cycle analytic</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach to this question and see how</v>

10
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:54.500
<v Speaker 2>the American gangster embodies and nate</v>
<v Speaker 2>and universal human desires.</v>

11
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Let's start with a simple question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was the original gangster?</v>

12
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Where did this larger than life persona</v>
<v Speaker 2>come from?</v>

13
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.850
<v Speaker 2>With this question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you run into problems.</v>

14
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 2>I personally consider Rico Band Delo in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little Caesar to be the first true</v>

15
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 2>gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first talking gangsters.</v>

16
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 2>He's also the first to have the iconic</v>
<v Speaker 2>accent,</v>

17
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 2>indistinct speech role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now very familiar with</v>

18
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 3>massage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A shirt my way out of it,</v>

19
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 3>like a joke for the Naga afterwards.</v>

20
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 2>The promise that he isn't really a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gangster.</v>

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 2>He's actually inspired to become a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gangster from a newspaper article about</v>

22
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Pete Montana to try to enter the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gangster world.</v>

23
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 2>He's a copycat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The very first gangster film is the</v>

24
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 2>musketeers of pig alley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the name of the film originates from</v>

25
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 2>a newspaper article about the shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a gambler on quote,</v>

26
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 2>New York's other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps the actual original depiction of</v>

27
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 2>gangsters was in a collection of</v>
<v Speaker 2>photographs of the slums by Jacob Reese</v>

28
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 2>with the famous photo bandits roost in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1890.</v>

29
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the gangsters genre</v>
<v Speaker 2>begins here.</v>

30
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 2>This photo is staged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constructed the shot to have its</v>

31
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 2>trademark level of fear and fascination</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we know and love today,</v>

32
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 2>and gangsters and the influence of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture on the gangsters genre is seen</v>

33
00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 2>up and into the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This brings me to my first point.</v>

34
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 2>There is no original gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much every gangster we know and</v>

35
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 2>love is a copycat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Corleone,</v>

36
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 2>military uniform and original distaste</v>
<v Speaker 2>for gang life borrows straight from Mike</v>

37
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 2>powers in the public enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this shot in pulp fiction eludes</v>

38
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 2>directly to the Godfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy's erratic behavior in Goodfellas,</v>

39
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 2>echoes cody Jarret in white heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scarface is a remake,</v>

40
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 2>and even the modern hood gangster</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't completely depart from</v>

41
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>conventional gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kept me in the hospital a week or</v>

42
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mostly stayed up thinking about my</v>

43
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 2>cousin watching old games,</v>

44
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.270
<v Speaker 3>the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some identification.</v>

45
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 3>How about Miami?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy,</v>

46
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 2>and of course the sopranos is famous for</v>
<v Speaker 2>referencing multiple gangster movies in</v>

47
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shimmy up a</v>

48
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I was out</v>

49
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 3>separate buckets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every iconic gangster movie is in some</v>

50
00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 3>way copycat to make up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was your conversation with yourself</v>

51
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.950
<v Speaker 3>about how the violence should be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I confess that I was very impressed with</v>

52
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Arthur pens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Bonnie and Clyde and thought about</v>

53
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 3>that when watching sonny corleone get</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot without a doubt,</v>

54
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 3>and I thought that the effects</v>
<v Speaker 3>of violence and money,</v>

55
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I'd always had an imaginative</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd like to think a good fellas</v>

56
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 3>comes out of the tradition of something</v>
<v Speaker 3>as extreme</v>

57
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 2>as the roaring twenties in scarface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's important to note here is that</v>

58
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 2>every gangster borrowed something from</v>
<v Speaker 2>older gangsters,</v>

59
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 2>and if you go back far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gangster isn't based in reality at</v>

60
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only the artificially</v>

61
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 2>constructed idea of the gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a key point in understanding</v>

62
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 2>American obsession with the gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not actually obsessed with being</v>

63
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 2>the leader of the criminal underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're obsessed with what being a</v>

64
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 2>gangster represents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have to go back to the question</v>

65
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 2>at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it gangster represent and why</v>

66
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 2>do we like them so much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does the gangster even if you think</v>

67
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 2>it's just money or women than you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

68
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 2>forgetting all about the money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

69
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 2>The best thing is we can find out what a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gangster wants because they tell us,</v>

70
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a product of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

71
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 2>I want my environment to be a product of</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

72
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That line describes the desire that any</v>

73
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 2>human fields and understands if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch any gangster movie,</v>

74
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 2>each one has this similar idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to dance around other</v>

75
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They to understand what this idea means.</v>

76
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 2>You have to take a trip into the human</v>
<v Speaker 2>psyche.</v>

77
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 2>I point to a quote from psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam Phillips.</v>

78
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't think of anything as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy if we did not have a deeply</v>

79
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 2>ingrained sense of order already there</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a frontier when we're angry.</v>

80
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 2>It's because something doesn't happen in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we want it to.</v>

81
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Even when you get mad at something as</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple as losing your keys,</v>

82
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 2>it means your fantasy of an ideal world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A world where everything is available to</v>

83
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 2>you at your fingertips was disrupted in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideal life.</v>

84
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.430
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the world revolves entirely</v>
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>

85
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to go walking in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dining room with the donor?</v>

86
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 2>So Dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dallas,</v>

87
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 2>wearing a nice silk dress?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never everybody waiting on you do like</v>

88
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gangster is the perfect embodiment</v>

89
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 2>of this fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world operates how the gangster</v>

90
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 2>wants it to operate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can give us with the twitch of his</v>

91
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 2>fingers when he walks into a room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people offering them a place to sit,</v>

92
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 2>to do business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All he has to do is not disability of</v>

93
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 2>the gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transcends simple money or sex or</v>

94
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 2>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the idea that the gangster has</v>

95
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 2>complete dominion over his world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make them an offer in the</v>

96
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Godfather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the first thing Vito Corleone</v>

97
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 2>asks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please come to me first.</v>

98
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>In this scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America Bonasera acts as a threat to the</v>

99
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 2>gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All powerful reach bonus here it goes to</v>

100
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 2>the police first showing that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>believes more in the American justice</v>

101
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:39.500
<v Speaker 2>system than in Beto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the lighting has bonused.</v>

102
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Sarah's face looked like a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making him visually appear like a</v>

103
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:44.280
<v Speaker 2>trader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't buy into the Godfather's</v>

104
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.170
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course the godfather winds from</v>

105
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 2>over in all of media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gangster is perhaps the closest</v>

106
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>embodiment to a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Superheros come close,</v>

107
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 2>but even they have to fight villains and</v>
<v Speaker 2>save the world.</v>

108
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Gangsters have nothing to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The appeal of the gangster is not that</v>

109
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 2>he's a gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that he is all knowing and all</v>

110
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:01.060
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't want to pay the tab,</v>

111
00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have to imagine being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>live like that.</v>

112
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 2>I think in the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst part about the gangsters.</v>

113
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Downfall isn't the actual death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much worse than that.</v>

114
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the gangster goes back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>being just like us,</v>

115
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 2>powerless and unable to control his</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

116
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 2>This idea goes as far back as the public</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy.</v>

117
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 2>When the very physical and expressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom Powers gets physically restrained</v>

118
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>and mummified when he dies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's most present in goodfellas.</v>

119
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 2>When Henry Hill goes into witness</v>
<v Speaker 2>protection program,</v>

120
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>everybody had their hands out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was for the taking,</v>

121
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 2>and now it's all over and becomes just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you and me have to wait around like</v>

122
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 2>everyone else and as he closes the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hear the sound of jail,</v>

123
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 2>cell bars closing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolizing his loss of the all powerful</v>

124
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:41.530
<v Speaker 2>aura of the game.</v>

125
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.690
<v Speaker 4>Of</v>

126
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.060
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't mentioned one crucial detail</v>

127
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:51.800
<v Speaker 2>about the gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the over the top violence houses,</v>

128
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.390
<v Speaker 2>genres so successful with such violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In one episode of the Sopranos,</v>

129
00:06:55.391 --> 00:06:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Tony Takes his daughter to visit</v>
<v Speaker 2>colleges on the way he recognized the</v>

130
00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:01.720
<v Speaker 2>rat hudson down and strangles the rat to</v>
<v Speaker 2>death with a wide.</v>

131
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.720
<v Speaker 2>The creators of the show were hesitant</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make this episode because of its</v>

132
00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:07.120
<v Speaker 2>hyper violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but made it anyway and it's brutal.</v>

133
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.030
<v Speaker 2>The shots are extremely close up and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>follows the strangling to the bitter</v>

134
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:11.920
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The episode was praised by critics and</v>

135
00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:14.530
<v Speaker 2>went on to win two entities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which begs the question,</v>

136
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.220
<v Speaker 2>why do we like this horrific violence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer comes from the idea of the</v>

137
00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:20.500
<v Speaker 2>taboo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something taboo is untouchable and</v>

138
00:07:20.501 --> 00:07:22.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a fascination with things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot be touched.</v>

139
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Subjects like drugs and violence are</v>
<v Speaker 2>taboo,</v>

140
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.510
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they cannot be touched</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives them a level of power.</v>

141
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.280
<v Speaker 2>If you refuse to touch something and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be at some level obsessed with</v>

142
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.000
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that thing didn't matter to you,</v>

143
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.530
<v Speaker 2>then you wouldn't care if you touched</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

144
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.870
<v Speaker 2>For some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the taboo is rooted in superstition.</v>

145
00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Mike and Aversion to peg boards or black</v>
<v Speaker 2>magic.</v>

146
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.170
<v Speaker 2>With that obsession comes a desire to</v>
<v Speaker 2>observe the taboo from a distance.</v>

147
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a draw to look at something that</v>

148
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:49.900
<v Speaker 2>holds so much power over us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there are women like my best</v>

149
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:52.990
<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but would've gotten out of bed the</v>

150
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.120
<v Speaker 2>minute that boyfriend gave them a gun to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hide.</v>

151
00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I got to admit the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned me on.</v>

152
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of rats in Victorian Society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were inexplicably taboo.</v>

153
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.360
<v Speaker 2>They were a symbol of the unclean and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're certainly untouchable,</v>

154
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.690
<v Speaker 2>but a sociologist at the time wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed accounts of street performers</v>

155
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.960
<v Speaker 2>who are trained in handling and touching</v>
<v Speaker 2>super rents,</v>

156
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 2>spectators would watch and discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also wonderment at the performance</v>

157
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:19.610
<v Speaker 2>ability to put his hand in a cage of</v>
<v Speaker 2>rafts without getting bit.</v>

158
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.930
<v Speaker 2>That performer in many ways had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mystical power to be able to handle</v>

159
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:25.840
<v Speaker 2>something that was so taboo and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the crowd at something.</v>

160
00:08:25.841 --> 00:08:29.170
<v Speaker 2>They also found so repulsive and doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sound a lot like the gangster,</v>

161
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.940
<v Speaker 2>don't they have a certain power to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>things?</v>

162
00:08:30.941 --> 00:08:34.360
<v Speaker 2>We would never have the guts to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves by participating in the taboo,</v>

163
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.900
<v Speaker 2>sex violence and the criminal life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have an appeal to them and the</v>

164
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:41.080
<v Speaker 2>distance between the movie screen and us</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the perfect amount of distance where</v>

165
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:43.330
<v Speaker 2>we get to observe but not touch the</v>
<v Speaker 2>taboo.</v>

166
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 2>The gangster is certainly a complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

167
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.490
<v Speaker 2>but we're not all that different from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all want that respect,</v>

168
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:51.220
<v Speaker 2>status and controls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only difference is we don't have the</v>

169
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:53.980
<v Speaker 2>guts to do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're satisfied with seeing it on the</v>

170
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 2>big screen and maybe that's a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

171
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe</v>

172
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.680
<v Speaker 5>we're all a bunch of suckers and they've</v>
<v Speaker 5>been right all along.</v>

173
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 5>As far back as I can remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always wanted to be a gangster.</v>

174
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

175
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 3>would only,</v>

176
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 5>uh.</v>
