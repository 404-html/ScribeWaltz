00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>This is Jack Nugen and you're watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you see it.</v>

2
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about how the film inglorious</v>
<v Speaker 1>bastards is actually making fun of you.</v>

3
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tarantino is one of the most popular and</v>

4
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.310
<v Speaker 1>consistently violent mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 1>directors.</v>

5
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>His films focus on people committing</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Criminals who killed contract killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a black market gun runner who killed a</v>

7
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>former assassin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing for revenge,</v>

8
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>a special Walmart two unit who's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal is killing nets,</v>

9
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 1>more contract killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally his newest film,</v>

10
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:43.670
<v Speaker 1>the hateful eight coming out fall 2015</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll start Samuel L.</v>

11
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you guessed it,</v>

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>as contract killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that Terentino's films,</v>

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>especially as higher budget ones display</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of hyper violence with</v>

14
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>numerous and exaggerated deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vanity Fair made a nice chart telling</v>

15
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>each duck in a tarantino film at how</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person died.</v>

16
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Showing just a file.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

17
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.490
<v Speaker 1>scopes can be Terentino's eighth till</v>
<v Speaker 1>inglorious bastards.</v>

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Ace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no exception.</v>

19
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>The film needs 57 killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not cleaning the 340 teeth deaths from</v>

20
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fear at the end of the film is</v>

21
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Speaker 1>averages to one kristen to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About every two and a half minutes.</v>

22
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.823
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

23
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Even with all this violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inglourious basterds was a huge</v>

24
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>financial and critical success earning</v>
<v Speaker 1>over $300 million in eight academy award</v>

25
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>nominations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The majority of Terentino's films did</v>

26
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 1>well in the box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

27
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.690
<v Speaker 1>of the nine films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>charity Tino has directed eight have</v>

28
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 1>earned a triple their original budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does it say about us,</v>

29
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 1>the viewers who pay to see and enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terentino's films?</v>

30
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Do we like violence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it wrong for us to enjoy movies where</v>

31
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Speaker 1>people die left and right turn to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:41.150
<v Speaker 1>realize is this chuck position and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean goes so far as to criticize us,</v>

33
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>the viewers for finding hyper violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his,</v>

34
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so entertaining.</v>

35
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at inglorious bastards</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see how we critique an audience that</v>

36
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>glamorizes violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inglorious bastards is about a World War</v>

37
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.530
<v Speaker 1>II special unit named the bastards whose</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission is to blow up a cinema where</v>

38
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>dozens of high ranking Nazi soldiers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lead watcher I propaganda film,</v>

39
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>including killer himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film shown at the cinema is about</v>

40
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:07.491
<v Speaker 1>Friedrich solar and Nazi soldier who</v>
<v Speaker 1>single handedly kills 215 brushings from</v>

41
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>a guard tower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film titled Nation's Pride is</v>

42
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 1>extremely violent from what we see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film consist of little more than</v>

43
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>shots of Friedrich's older shooting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing thousands of Russian soldiers.</v>

44
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 1>The crowd of Nazis loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cheer and laugh at each step of</v>

45
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>praising the film hill even tells the</v>
<v Speaker 1>director of the film,</v>

46
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>this is your best film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet we can't help but look at the</v>

47
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:29.280
<v Speaker 1>audience watching nuisance priding find</v>
<v Speaker 1>them a bit humorous and ridiculous.</v>

48
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>They do this repetitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasteless and unnecessarily killing,</v>

49
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>entertaining and well made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To us.</v>

50
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>It appears to be nothing but a cheap</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacle movie.</v>

51
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>But think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound familiar.</v>

52
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>The Nazi viewers or audience members</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a film,</v>

53
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>but so are we watching inglorious</v>
<v Speaker 1>bastards.</v>

54
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a film with NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't we react with similar praise to</v>

55
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>quint Terentino's hyper violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psalms 20 where the audience members,</v>

56
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I want to suggest to the Terentino's is</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to say us viewing inglorious</v>

57
00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>bastards is similar to the Nazis viewing</v>
<v Speaker 1>nation's pride.</v>

58
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>We cheer a death even when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasteless and glorifies unnecessary</v>

59
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see just as much excessive violence</v>

60
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.540
<v Speaker 1>inglorious bastards as the Nazis do when</v>
<v Speaker 1>nations pri,</v>

61
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>while the bastards are in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their plan to blow up the building,</v>

62
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>the owners of the cinema in a separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack like the whole cinema on fire and</v>

63
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>lock the exit doors so the Nazi crowd is</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped in burnt alive.</v>

64
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Even though the bathrooms mission to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill everyone in the cinema is</v>

65
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still shoot into the crowd of</v>

66
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More unnecessary violence and blogged a</v>

67
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>cinema even more unnecessary violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's ridiculous files throughout the</v>

68
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People caught off scalps get beat to</v>

69
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>death with baseball bats and get shot in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the testicles.</v>

70
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Both nation's pride and inglorious</v>
<v Speaker 1>bastards contain excessive violence.</v>

71
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Similarities don't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both protagonists.</v>

72
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Carve Nazi symbols with a knife and are</v>
<v Speaker 1>overly faithful to their country.</v>

73
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Even the shots and nations private</v>
<v Speaker 1>inglorious bastards are similar.</v>

74
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shot of a person flying out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the exploding cinema.</v>

75
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Notice the similarities between this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot and these shots of soldiers falling</v>

76
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>out of buildings during nation's pride</v>
<v Speaker 1>chair.</v>

77
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Tino is showing that his movie is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>far off from nation's pride.</v>

78
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Even the film titles are comparable</v>
<v Speaker 1>where inglorious bastards is the exact</v>

79
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>opposite meaning of nations pri.</v>

80
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>These films are similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so are their respective audiences.</v>

81
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>US viewing inglorious bastards and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis viewing nations pri,</v>

82
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>we both praise the violence in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both cheer on death.</v>

83
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>We both get desensitized to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutality of it.</v>

84
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>By comparing us to the Nazi viewers</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terentino's criticizing our love for</v>

85
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>excessive violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a bunch of easy to please</v>

86
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 1>dimwitted audience members who find</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment and senseless gruesome</v>

87
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>killings in the same way that the Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewers are portrayed as simple minded</v>

88
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 1>audience members find entertainment in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the over to top violence and nations</v>

89
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's poking fun at us.</v>

90
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>He's saying where as ridiculous as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi viewers are looking at other</v>

91
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>instances of it sort violence and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is by no means limited to include as</v>

92
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either Tarantino does this in all</v>

93
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:41.500
<v Speaker 1>of his other films as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sometimes even use his death for</v>

94
00:04:41.501 --> 00:04:42.334
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

95
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I said</v>
<v Speaker 2>goodbye,</v>

96
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.230
<v Speaker 2>but I'm as you got to have an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

97
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>do you think that God came down from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Heaven and stop</v>

98
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.190
<v Speaker 2>an accident?</v>

99
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.180
<v Speaker 1>It takes skill to pawn audience into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>world where killing can make up a</v>

100
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.820
<v Speaker 1>punchline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to it than that.</v>

101
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.700
<v Speaker 1>The screen desensitizes us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can remove ourselves from the</v>

102
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:12.900
<v Speaker 1>realities of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we watch a film and terrence,</v>

103
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The extent we can see death as a joke</v>

104
00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 1>though is worth making fun of and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>

105
00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Pri provides a good allegory for how</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous we can be.</v>

106
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Is it hypocritical that we can praise</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence in a film yet to announce it in</v>

107
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:25.640
<v Speaker 1>reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One final anecdote about the two films</v>

108
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 1>and their audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While nation's pride is playing shows,</v>

109
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.580
<v Speaker 1>sauna kills the real friedrich solar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody in the audience notices</v>

110
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.350
<v Speaker 1>because they're so engrossed in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence up to fill.</v>

111
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.470
<v Speaker 1>They think the gunshot noise is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>another sound effect is Tarantino making</v>

112
00:05:36.471 --> 00:05:39.470
<v Speaker 1>your commentary about how we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>address or notice deaths in reality and</v>

113
00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:41.450
<v Speaker 1>only pay attendance to the ones in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies we adore.</v>

114
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Glorious bastards is not the only felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>to critique it's viewers,</v>

115
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.550
<v Speaker 1>which I need to film that features an</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

116
00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Consider if the directors making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary about the audience actually</v>

117
00:05:49.551 --> 00:05:51.110
<v Speaker 1>watching the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolf of Wall Street.</v>

118
00:05:51.111 --> 00:05:53.420
<v Speaker 1>It's about the rise and fall of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt businessman named Jordan</v>

119
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Belfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's unfaithful to his wife,</v>

120
00:05:55.281 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>steals money from thousands of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has no one who truly loves him and</v>

121
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>spends years in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logically,</v>

122
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 1>we should look at Jordan Belfort as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dishonest,</v>

123
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>despicable man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at the audience in the final</v>

124
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>shot of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they look like they despise him?</v>

125
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.160
<v Speaker 1>They adore him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to be just like him,</v>

126
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>rich and famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much dishonesty and</v>

127
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 1>stealing it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like inglorious bastards.</v>

128
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>The director of showing the flaws of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an audience is Jordan Belfort.</v>

129
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Really the type of person we should</v>
<v Speaker 1>strive to be like a clever director can</v>

130
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>use audiences or even crowds of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a way of generalizing a society as a</v>

131
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's most interesting.</v>

132
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the commentary is centered on the</v>

133
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>viewers of the film who are far from</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

134
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>So the next time you see any movie that</v>
<v Speaker 1>features an audience,</v>

135
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they making fun of me?</v>

136
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
