1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll be home at six sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you need anything,</v>

<v Speaker 1>call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can</v>

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet Mimi.</v>

4
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Mimi call if you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.880
<v Speaker 2>they bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pardon me?</v>

6
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:33.881
<v Speaker 2>Why I have a strange envelopes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I you a couple of baboons.</v>

7
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 2>What are you looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking the fourth wall.</v>

8
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most unique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the devices at the disposal of a</v>

9
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 2>filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most cinematic techniques pull us into a</v>

10
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 2>story and make us forget we're watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>a film,</v>

11
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 2>but breaking the fourth wall does the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

12
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 2>It reminds us we're actually an audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>member watching what's happening on</v>

13
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 2>screen.</v>

14
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.820
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe we're paying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's he jumped in.</v>

15
00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 3>We get on TV for free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

16
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.830
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody in this theater is a giant</v>

17
00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 3>sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your,</v>

18
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 2>the technique can contribute to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>visual storytelling of the film in many</v>

19
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 2>different ways depending on how it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>presented.</v>

20
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 2>To really understand the power of</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking the fourth wall,</v>

21
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 2>we have to look at its inception and</v>
<v Speaker 2>theatrical performance.</v>

22
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now a formal definition for breaking the</v>

23
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 2>fourth wall would be a dramatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique and a work of fiction where</v>

24
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 2>characters display an awareness that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are in such a work.</v>

25
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 2>You might say every one of us is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiddler on the roof.</v>

26
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 2>The technique goes as far back as</v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient Greece and continue to through</v>

27
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 2>Shakespeare time and well into</v>
<v Speaker 2>postmodern.</v>

28
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 2>A theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in musicals,</v>

29
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 2>the term first arose after the use of</v>
<v Speaker 2>box sets became popular in the 18</v>

30
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 2>hundreds when sets were constructed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>three walls.</v>

31
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 2>The fourth wall being the imaginary wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the audience and the performers</v>

32
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 2>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whenever a character acknowledged the</v>

33
00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 2>audience's presence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fourth wall was</v>

34
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.873
<v Speaker 1>rope.</v>

35
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.520
<v Speaker 2>The technique has been used since the</v>
<v Speaker 2>silent era and Charlie Chaplin played</v>

36
00:02:09.521 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 2>around extensively with fourth wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks in his films.</v>

37
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 2>With the introduction of sound and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>popularity of the musical genre,</v>

38
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 2>fourth wall breaks became more common to</v>
<v Speaker 2>contribute to the spectacle of film.</v>

39
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 2>And over the next 70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth wall breaks have made their way</v>

40
00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 2>into a variety of film genres with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of thematic effects.</v>

41
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Do you all see me all dancing crab?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most popular use of this technique</v>

42
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 2>is for comedy and the comedy stands out</v>
<v Speaker 2>by creating some of the most memorable</v>

43
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 2>punchlines in cinematic history.</v>

44
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you?</v>

45
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's funny because I happen to have</v>

46
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Speaker 4>mister McLuhan right here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

47
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.870
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just let me,</v>

48
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 4>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me come over here second.</v>

49
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard what you were saying.</v>

50
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.170
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know nothing at my work.</v>

51
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.670
<v Speaker 4>You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How you ever got to teach a course in</v>

52
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:56.590
<v Speaker 4>anything is totally amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>

53
00:02:56.591 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 4>if life were only like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

54
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 2>there's something really surprising and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious</v>

55
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>about reminding us that we're in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of watching a film.</v>

56
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>No matter how many times I watch a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>break the fourth wall,</v>

57
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>the joke can still catch me by surprise.</v>

58
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 2>The joke has to step out of the film to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver the punchline,</v>

59
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 2>and there's really no other type of joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

60
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Every other joke is enclosed within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>imaginary world of the art form.</v>

61
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Taking that step out of a movie is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a good fourth wall joke.</v>

62
00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 2>So satisfying and creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I see things just a little</v>

63
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 2>differently contract or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not bow to any sponsor.</v>

64
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I do want to note that breaking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth wall,</v>

65
00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:39.110
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't automatically make you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedic genius.</v>

66
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.440
<v Speaker 2>The setup and delivery of a fourth wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>break has to be at least somewhat</v>

67
00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:47.441
<v Speaker 2>surprising are the joke can come off as</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of Lazy Jay and Silent Bob Movie,</v>

68
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suggest you don't worry about this</v>

69
00:03:55.071 --> 00:04:00.071
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing and just enjoy ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That goes for you all to yes,</v>

70
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.020
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it was.</v>

71
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Now be miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought</v>

72
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.420
<v Speaker 2>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good evening and welcome to the middle</v>

73
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 2>of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much better.</v>

74
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 2>You can't talk about breaking the fourth</v>
<v Speaker 2>wall without mentioning Mel Brooks.</v>

75
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 2>He broke the fourth wall in the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme ways possible.</v>

76
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.663
<v Speaker 1>We see the script.</v>

77
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.620
<v Speaker 2>His films go so far as to actually have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main characters watch themselves</v>

78
00:04:36.621 --> 00:04:37.760
<v Speaker 2>within the movie.</v>

79
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.270
<v Speaker 2>What the hell am I looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When does this happen in the movie?</v>

80
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Where all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want to do now?</v>

81
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Come home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's check out the end of the,</v>

82
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sure hope there's a happy ending.</v>

83
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his films are funny because of the</v>

84
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:04.790
<v Speaker 2>ridiculousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely some method to his</v>

85
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:07.080
<v Speaker 2>madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a blazing saddles uses fourth</v>

86
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:10.370
<v Speaker 2>wall breaks to poke fun at the western</v>
<v Speaker 2>genre as a whole.</v>

87
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.210
<v Speaker 2>It really points out how unrealistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood films were in their portrayal</v>

88
00:05:14.211 --> 00:05:16.040
<v Speaker 2>of life in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In reality,</v>

89
00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:19.790
<v Speaker 2>western films were nothing but actors in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a studio acting and fake towns and</v>

90
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:22.460
<v Speaker 2>eventually getting into a car to drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the sec.</v>

91
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Blazing Saddles is a not so subtle</v>
<v Speaker 2>reminder that film as an art form has</v>

92
00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:30.110
<v Speaker 2>its limitations at portraying reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mel Brooks made a statement by pointing</v>

93
00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 2>out the lack of realism in the western</v>
<v Speaker 2>films.</v>

94
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Western films of the forties 50s and 60s</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost completely ignore racism,</v>

95
00:05:36.891 --> 00:05:40.940
<v Speaker 2>xenophobia and other ugly parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>West and blazing saddles breaks the</v>

96
00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:45.230
<v Speaker 2>fourth wall in an insane way to remind</v>
<v Speaker 2>us we're watching a dramatize film.</v>

97
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Not Reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could've thought of another way to get</v>

98
00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:50.720
<v Speaker 2>us here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we go again.</v>

99
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.010
<v Speaker 2>We're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps what makes breaking the fourth</v>

100
00:05:55.011 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 2>wall the most intriguing is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on context,</v>

101
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 2>the act of acknowledging the audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>can actually push us into the film.</v>

102
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Instead of pulling us out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a sort of intimacy to a</v>

103
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 2>character speaking directly to us in</v>
<v Speaker 2>road to Morocco,</v>

104
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 2>bing crosby and Bob Hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make lighthearted jokes straight to the</v>

105
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 2>audience and even to remind us that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to end up fine on their</v>

106
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:13.544
<v Speaker 2>adventure.</v>

107
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Who's we may meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't any paramount,</v>

108
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.720
<v Speaker 1>well pro tech does cause we're signed</v>
<v Speaker 1>for five more years.</v>

109
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.610
<v Speaker 2>We know from the casual and inviting</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth wall break set.</v>

110
00:06:26.611 --> 00:06:29.820
<v Speaker 2>This is a movie that doesn't take itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>too seriously and will provide light</v>

111
00:06:29.821 --> 00:06:32.550
<v Speaker 2>conservative entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fourthwall breaks can be a way to</v>

112
00:06:32.551 --> 00:06:36.150
<v Speaker 2>welcome us into this story and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>variation of the technique is definitely</v>

113
00:06:36.151 --> 00:06:38.220
<v Speaker 2>indicative of a more casual movie</v>

114
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.953
<v Speaker 5>morale.</v>

115
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.060
<v Speaker 2>A fourth wall break can make us intimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a character as well as with the</v>

116
00:06:51.061 --> 00:06:52.930
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really no stronger way to show a</v>

117
00:06:52.931 --> 00:06:55.660
<v Speaker 2>character's motives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then by having them look right at us and</v>

118
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:56.494
<v Speaker 2>save them.</v>

119
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.520
<v Speaker 6>I go for 10 I'm probably going to have</v>
<v Speaker 6>to barf up the lung.</v>

120
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.450
<v Speaker 6>I better make this one count.</v>

121
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a great way to show us what's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on in the character's head and is</v>

122
00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:08.250
<v Speaker 2>comparable to an aside in feeder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frank Underwood addressing us directly</v>

123
00:07:08.251 --> 00:07:11.220
<v Speaker 2>is the foundation for so much of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy in house of cards.</v>

124
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.110
<v Speaker 2>Good and Donald don't let this get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

125
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Why together we're going to do more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been able to do in 25 years.</v>

126
00:07:16.141 --> 00:07:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I left the scenes where he says one</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to another character and then</v>

127
00:07:18.841 --> 00:07:23.070
<v Speaker 2>looks at us and reminds us what he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really after two things and now</v>

128
00:07:23.071 --> 00:07:25.510
<v Speaker 2>irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't blythe and Donald Blinds,</v>

129
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.570
<v Speaker 2>new drafts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually I have to rewrite the bill</v>

130
00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:30.450
<v Speaker 2>myself forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the battle cry.</v>

131
00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Leave ideology to the armchair general</v>
<v Speaker 2>was does mean no</v>

132
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.090
<v Speaker 2>final great effect of breaking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth wall is to unsettle.</v>

133
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.270
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing scarier than feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe and removed from the villain in a</v>

134
00:07:45.271 --> 00:07:47.910
<v Speaker 2>movie and then having that villain look</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly at you.</v>

135
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.480
<v Speaker 2>I hope they are watching.</v>

136
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 6>They have c see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they'll know and they'll say,</v>

137
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.701
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane.</v>

138
00:07:58.701 --> 00:07:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>intimacy,</v>

141
00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 2>and fear can all be accomplished just</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a look to the camera.</v>

142
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 2>So don't forget the great potential of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth wall break can have.</v>

143
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.533
<v Speaker 2>And thanks for what</v>
