00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they are,</v>

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Shira Mr Creeps in his partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Kroll.</v>

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 2>I've been asked to make a video on plot</v>
<v Speaker 2>twists and it's just about the beginning</v>

4
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 2>of this channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was always hesitant to do it</v>

5
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't want to spoil a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of major plot twists.</v>

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 2>I stood by this principle until I came</v>
<v Speaker 2>across an interesting study conducted by</v>

7
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 2>UC San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Researchers had one group of</v>

8
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 2>participants read several famous books</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the researchers spoiled their</v>

9
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 2>endings while another group read the</v>
<v Speaker 2>books.</v>

10
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Normally after reading each group noted</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much they liked each book.</v>

11
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Based on the results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that if the ending is</v>

12
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 2>spoiled to you before you read a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually end up liking the book</v>

13
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only do I think this study perfectly</v>

14
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 2>explains what makes a plot twist great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also like it because it helps me</v>

15
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 2>justify spoiling some movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to spoil.</v>

16
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 2>Now you see me and primal fear with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>prestige having only very minor</v>

17
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 2>spoilers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you haven't seen one,</v>

18
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 2>consider what the study says and use</v>
<v Speaker 2>this video as an opportunity to recreate</v>

19
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 2>the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's get spoiling.</v>

20
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>We are going to follow those dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find that data.</v>

21
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 2>The common definition of a plot twist is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a totally unexpected outcome to a story,</v>

22
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 2>and now you see me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dylan roads is an FBI agent trying to</v>

23
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 2>track down the four horsemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a shocking twist,</v>

24
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 2>it turns out he was the fifth horseman</v>
<v Speaker 2>all along.</v>

25
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 2>While I do think the rest of the movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pretty fun,</v>

26
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 2>there's one key reason that this plot</v>
<v Speaker 2>twists doesn't really work.</v>

27
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 3>Now you and our shipping</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoddily a bomb goes off.</v>

28
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got past him not once,</v>

29
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.190
<v Speaker 3>not twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but consistently,</v>

30
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 3>almost as if they were on the in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the audience had seen five or</v>

31
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 3>10 seconds or shock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though the original shows are</v>

32
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 3>pretty simple and predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scooby doo actually adheres to an</v>

33
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 3>important principle of good plot twists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The final payoff always follows the</v>

34
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.280
<v Speaker 3>established logic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the beginning of each episode,</v>

35
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to scare all the years</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the island.</v>

36
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Then no one would spend the night and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would keep control of a fortune.</v>

37
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 3>We get just enough information in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning so that when the twist does</v>

38
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's satisfying.</v>

39
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Since there was always that looming</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling that you know who did it,</v>

40
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 3>creeps and crawls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sure picked the right lawyers for</v>

41
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:14.094
<v Speaker 3>this job.</v>

42
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Can you see me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twist has this element missing.</v>

43
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 2>It follows very little established</v>
<v Speaker 2>logic.</v>

44
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 2>The complete rewriting of the character</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a clumsy FBI agent to accounting</v>

45
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 2>genius means there was really no way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see this plot twists coming and that's</v>

46
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 2>why it's not very satisfying and relies</v>
<v Speaker 2>too heavily on shock.</v>

47
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 2>The Prestige is the perfect balance</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the shock value of the.</v>

48
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 2>Now you see me twists and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>predictable but logical twists of Scooby</v>

49
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Doo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty minutes into the movie,</v>

50
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:40.430
<v Speaker 2>we've technically been told enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>predict the plot twist,</v>

51
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.730
<v Speaker 2>but Christopher Nolan leaves just enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>information out to make the ending.</v>

52
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 2>An amazing shock that still follows</v>
<v Speaker 2>established logic.</v>

53
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.050
<v Speaker 3>You do the sheen over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we tell the audience a bomb</v>

54
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 3>underneath this table is going to five</v>
<v Speaker 3>limit.</v>

55
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 3>You're looking for the secret,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you won't volunteer because you're</v>

56
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.300
<v Speaker 3>coke's not really.</v>

57
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Plot twist is the one that can create</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest surprise without ruining the</v>

58
00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:06.270
<v Speaker 2>established logic because at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day,</v>

59
00:03:06.271 --> 00:03:07.410
<v Speaker 2>the twisted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you see me,</v>

60
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 2>isn't actually that satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a complete rewrite of his character</v>

61
00:03:10.801 --> 00:03:13.440
<v Speaker 2>for a cheap surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not particularly interesting to</v>

62
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:16.710
<v Speaker 2>change 100 percent of a character's</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality that has been built up</v>

63
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:19.440
<v Speaker 2>throughout the whole movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do you do this in a surprising</v>

64
00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:21.540
<v Speaker 2>but also entertaining way and primal</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

65
00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.990
<v Speaker 2>The plot twist is similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with one key difference in the movie</v>

66
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:28.590
<v Speaker 2>and alter boy is accused of murdering</v>
<v Speaker 2>and archbishop and the lawyer gets him</v>

67
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:32.190
<v Speaker 2>off not guilty by reason of insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the boy test positive for</v>

68
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.340
<v Speaker 2>multiple personality disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The film ends with the final scene</v>

69
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:38.040
<v Speaker 2>before the altar boy is moved to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychiatric hospital.</v>

70
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Here he reveals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he faked it the whole time.</v>

71
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:44.931
<v Speaker 2>To get a short sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there never was an aaron counselor.</v>

72
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.290
<v Speaker 2>It may seem like pure shock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this ending is actually carefully</v>

73
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.020
<v Speaker 2>woven into the logic of the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the movie.</v>

74
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:54.930
<v Speaker 2>We're not sure which personality he is</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what he's about to change his</v>

75
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:57.150
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've always had this feeling that he</v>

76
00:03:57.151 --> 00:04:00.180
<v Speaker 2>wasn't who he says he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the shock is still fantastic because</v>

77
00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 2>we go from being on his side to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tricking everybody in the story,</v>

78
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.970
<v Speaker 2>including us and switching to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>antagonist.</v>

79
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.100
<v Speaker 2>At the very end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got the information,</v>

80
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:11.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's still a surprise and it's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>separates the good plot twists from the</v>

81
00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:12.330
<v Speaker 2>bad ones</v>

82
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.950
<v Speaker 4>in order to</v>
<v Speaker 4>provide the audience with a certain</v>

83
00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:18.140
<v Speaker 4>amount that had for me.</v>

84
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.121
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marty.</v>

85
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 2>I thought you had it figured out.</v>

86
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and leave the rest of it to their own</v>

87
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:25.640
<v Speaker 4>imagining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to tell you the truth,</v>

88
00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:26.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad you figured it.</v>

89
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 2>I have been dying to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them just enough to see it coming,</v>

90
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:37.261
<v Speaker 2>but not enough to expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the best way to test a good plot</v>

91
00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:42.120
<v Speaker 2>twist is if the movie is re watchable</v>
<v Speaker 2>because once you know the twist ending,</v>

92
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 2>if the ending is a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's just as fun.</v>

93
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 2>If not more fun to go back and see where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hint at that twist ending.</v>

94
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why the studies shows how</v>

95
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 2>spoiling a book before reading it makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>it more enjoyable.</v>

96
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 2>This expense of the ending makes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>path getting there that much more</v>

97
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 2>exciting and maybe that's why lots of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories spoiled the ending at the very</v>

98
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:03.514
<v Speaker 2>beginning</v>

99
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.020
<v Speaker 3>and me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the damn</v>

100
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.750
<v Speaker 2>for the charter because as much as it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the plot twists,</v>

101
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.860
<v Speaker 2>it's about how you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so feel free to watch something even if</v>

102
00:05:12.861 --> 00:05:14.570
<v Speaker 2>you know how it ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because who knows?</v>

103
00:05:14.571 --> 00:05:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'll like it even more.</v>

104
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 3>They bring the dog and come in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>waiting in.</v>

105
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for watching.</v>
