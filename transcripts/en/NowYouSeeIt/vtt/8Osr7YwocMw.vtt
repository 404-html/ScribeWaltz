1
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>History has not been kind to horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people talk about the 600,000</v>

2
00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>people killed in the American civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some overlook that the horse and</v>

3
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>mule death toll is over 1 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Victorian England.</v>

4
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:22.960
<v Speaker 1>It was not uncommon for trolleys and</v>
<v Speaker 1>factories to work horses until they</v>

5
00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>dropped dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in the middle of busy streets,</v>

6
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.810
<v Speaker 1>up and into the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horses brutally stood with a side by</v>

7
00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>side in war time and in civilian life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even today where the average person</v>

8
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.260
<v Speaker 1>almost never interacts with horses in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their everyday lives.</v>

9
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>We still see the horse constantly in art</v>
<v Speaker 1>and media for every culture with horses,</v>

10
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>there's a different meaning applied to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

11
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.750
<v Speaker 1>In Ancient Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animal was a sign of aspiration and</v>

12
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>connection to the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we can see most clearly.</v>

13
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 1>In Pegasus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nordic people believed in horses for</v>

14
00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>day and night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called her and factsy and skin foxy,</v>

15
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.980
<v Speaker 1>who traversed the land and sea and moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the wind.</v>

16
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Gandalf's horse shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fax was directly influenced by this</v>

17
00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>norse mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this video,</v>

18
00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about a specific course</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology,</v>

19
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.570
<v Speaker 1>the American version one deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingrained in the modern American</v>

20
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 1>conscious American cinema has</v>
<v Speaker 1>historically used the horse as a symbol</v>

21
00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>of status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity,</v>

22
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Speaker 1>and mastery over nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to explore this particular meaning</v>

23
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>of the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historians don't have to look at ancient</v>

24
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 1>paintings and stories like with older</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations.</v>

25
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.610
<v Speaker 1>We can actually very clearly see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolism of horses in the movies and TV</v>

26
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:24.670
<v Speaker 1>have the last 100 years up in into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>current day.</v>

27
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 1>So what do I mean by the Horse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a symbol of mastery,</v>

28
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.940
<v Speaker 1>the horse provides the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to show mans control over</v>

29
00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:31.960
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For one thing,</v>

30
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>horses are very wild and unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're too large to keep in the home</v>

31
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>like a dog and strong enough to easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill a human,</v>

32
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>so they are a worthy opponent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

33
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Bronc riding reminds us of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength because they're genuinely</v>

34
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:46.510
<v Speaker 1>dangerous in certain contexts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite these characteristics,</v>

35
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 1>we still manage to tame them on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive scale.</v>

36
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.820
<v Speaker 1>We are able to control them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send them into battle and use them as</v>

37
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:55.840
<v Speaker 1>tools more so than any other animal of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that size and unlike cattle or other</v>

38
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can easily be mounted.</v>

39
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that shows mastery over</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature more than being on top of a large</v>

40
00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 1>wild beast directing it where you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to go.</v>

41
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Riding at a higher vantage point than</v>
<v Speaker 1>pedestrians to showcase my point.</v>

42
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>How did the creators of the planet of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the apes series show that the monkeys</v>

43
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>are dominating the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are no longer simply wild animals and</v>

44
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>are taking charge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This simple image tells us everything we</v>

45
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>need to know about how much the monkeys</v>
<v Speaker 1>are evolving and that's because of all</v>

46
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Speaker 1>the meaning associated with riding a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

47
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Some of the earliest forms of cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see how the horse human</v>

48
00:02:27.551 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 1>relationship reinforce this horse riding</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a symbol of mastery in 18,</v>

49
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>78,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edward more bridge rigged.</v>

50
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four cameras on a racetrack with</v>
<v Speaker 1>trip wires that went off as a horse</v>

51
00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 1>galloped by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to see if all four of the</v>

52
00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Speaker 1>horse's feet come off the ground at once</v>
<v Speaker 1>during Gallup.</v>

53
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Something that happens too quickly for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human eye to see on its own.</v>

54
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>This experiment tries to master the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement of the Horse in a way more.</v>

55
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Bridge was taming the wild unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of horseback riding and turning</v>

56
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>them into something controllable by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera and by humans.</v>

57
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 1>The camera man is a master of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>around him capturing the horse as he</v>

58
00:02:58.331 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>wants to make an part of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

59
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>this experiment became one of the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive forms of a motion picture and</v>

60
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>it paved the way for cinema to contain</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wild nature of the horse.</v>

61
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>From then on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horse in movies reflected a thing to</v>

62
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>master a wild beasts to represent who</v>
<v Speaker 1>could control it and who couldn't.</v>

63
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>These early ideals of horseback riding</v>
<v Speaker 1>found their way into Hollywood,</v>

64
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the western genre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In these movies,</v>

65
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>the horse showcases the mastery and</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the typical western hero.</v>

66
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>The horse is an extension of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>masterful writers who could effortlessly</v>

67
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>handled their horses in dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

68
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>A classic example of control through</v>
<v Speaker 1>horseback riding comes from John Wayne</v>

69
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>in stagecoach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the movie,</v>

70
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>the people writing the stage coach are</v>
<v Speaker 1>being controlled by others.</v>

71
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>They either change plans to avoid an</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apache attack or because of the military</v>

72
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>made them do so symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that these two outside</v>

73
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>forces would control the fate of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stagecoach.</v>

74
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Both the Apache and the military are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>men actually riding on horseback.</v>

75
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the stage coach where the horses</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in front pulling the people behind</v>

76
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

77
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne famously abandons the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stagecoach to ride one of the horses</v>

78
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving the visual cue that he is now</v>

79
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>taking control by becoming a man on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

80
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.200
<v Speaker 1>In this final battle scene in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>military and stage,</v>

81
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>coach members shoot the Apache off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their horses,</v>

82
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>indicating that now the Apache are no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer in control.</v>

83
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a running gag and</v>
<v Speaker 1>American westerns where men are dragged</v>

84
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>by horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we see a complete reversal of the</v>

85
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>traditional roles because the horse is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in control instead of the man.</v>

86
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>This trope is always reserved for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters not in control.</v>

87
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 1>The ones without the swab and mastery of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditional American hero.</v>

88
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Either they can't control their horse or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ride the horse in a bastardized</v>

89
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're too short to ride the</v>

90
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>horse themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they have to fake writing altogether.</v>

91
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>You'll never see John Wayne riding a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse in any way other than one that</v>

92
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>shows cool manly control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings up another key aspect of</v>

93
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 1>horseback riding in American cinema.</v>

94
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>In the real worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horseback riding is one of the most</v>

95
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>gender neutral competitions to exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>today in the Olympics.</v>

96
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Equestrian events or some of the few</v>
<v Speaker 1>where men and women compete against each</v>

97
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in American cinema,</v>

98
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>that is not the case with some notable</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptions.</v>

99
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Women on horses are few and far between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at the peak of the western</v>

100
00:04:57.581 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>genre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This phenomenon is historically</v>

101
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the men had the agency money and</v>

102
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>land to own their own horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can still feel this masculine</v>

103
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 1>perception of horseback riding in modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

104
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>It explains why this joke work.</v>

105
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Anything is possible when your man</v>
<v Speaker 2>smells like old spice and not a lady.</v>

106
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm on a horse.</v>

107
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.600
<v Speaker 1>The ideal man is one that rides a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any movie that puts women on a horse</v>

108
00:05:17.601 --> 00:05:22.520
<v Speaker 1>usually challenges this norm of men on</v>
<v Speaker 1>horseback in Brokeback Mountain Lorraine</v>

109
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.100
<v Speaker 1>First Sees Jack while she's riding a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse and he's on foot already</v>

110
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.830
<v Speaker 1>establishing a reversal of gender roles</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the horse.</v>

111
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:31.430
<v Speaker 1>She physically towers over him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This role reversal continues when she</v>

112
00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:35.000
<v Speaker 1>approaches him at the bar to hit on him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and act traditionally done by the man</v>

113
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.220
<v Speaker 1>throughout the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their positions in the marriage get</v>

114
00:05:37.221 --> 00:05:39.470
<v Speaker 1>challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the one operating the company with</v>

115
00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:42.860
<v Speaker 1>the traditional office desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While he fights for control in the home,</v>

116
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the initial power dynamic of her on</v>
<v Speaker 1>horseback establishes masculinity in the</v>

117
00:05:46.761 --> 00:05:48.350
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She rides the show horse,</v>

118
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:49.430
<v Speaker 1>showing her power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>

119
00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:51.500
<v Speaker 1>and control ball jackets thrown off a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl,</v>

120
00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:54.650
<v Speaker 1>showing his lack of control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to hint at his non traditional male</v>

121
00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Westworld shows just how much the hosts</v>

122
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 1>breaking the rules by having Dolores</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adaas Aisle,</v>

123
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>female character become a horse riding</v>
<v Speaker 1>gunslinger with horses so closely</v>

124
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>associated with masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and power.</v>

125
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>It's no surprise that characters will</v>
<v Speaker 1>also kill other people's horses to</v>

126
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>assert dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This power grab gets done most famously</v>

127
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>in the godfather and the public enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a horse shows control,</v>

128
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>killing the horse removes the control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also racial undertones to</v>

129
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>horseback riding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was illegal for black people to buy a</v>

130
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>horse in many parts of the antebellum</v>
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>

131
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Such a loss seems unnecessary because</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind people did not have the money or</v>

132
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 1>agency to own a horse in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

133
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>This redundancy implies that the law</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed as a symbolic gesture,</v>

134
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 1>a reminder by white southerners that</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people should not have the status</v>

135
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>and power associated with riding a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

136
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Django unchained touches on the racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues of horseback riding.</v>

137
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>The simple act of being black into on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse challenges traditional portrayals</v>

138
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>of men on horseback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a great movie because it lets</v>

139
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>minority characters have the same cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>mastery and control that was originally</v>

140
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 1>reserved for white men.</v>

141
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>The movie perfectly showcases horseback</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding as a power dynamic.</v>

142
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Right in the first scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a power reversal where a horse</v>

143
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>immobilizes a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of a man controlling the</v>

144
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many times in the movie,</v>

145
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 1>weaker characters are either thrown off</v>
<v Speaker 1>their horse or shot off their horse,</v>

146
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 1>but never django.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we watch the movie,</v>

147
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 1>we never consciously observe who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding the horse well or not,</v>

148
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>but these images play into subconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>American ideas of mastery.</v>

149
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Through mastery of the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can feel how much more controlled</v>

150
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Django has compared to the other white</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters apart from Dr. King Shults,</v>

151
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.460
<v Speaker 1>who can command his horses that will add</v>
<v Speaker 1>fits.</v>

152
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.960
<v Speaker 1>We can feel how much more controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>Django has compared to the other white</v>

153
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 1>characters the KKK members can't see for</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

154
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 1>so they let the horse take control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see you can't see.</v>

155
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.800
<v Speaker 1>So what all that matters is can the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fate.</v>

156
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>This KKK charge feels like a comedic</v>
<v Speaker 1>revision of a similar scene in the birth</v>

157
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 1>of a nation filmed in 1915.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dw Griffith portrays these KKK members</v>

158
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 1>much differently than the easy to trick</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiots in Django Klansmen,</v>

159
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 1>charged into town on a horseback to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rescue llc from the hands of black men</v>

160
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 1>on screen by epic and skillful riding on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a horse transforms these klansmen from</v>

161
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 1>an unruly mob into hero saving the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This movie uses horses to show the KKK</v>

162
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 1>members as heroic end to end control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they disturbingly used their mastery</v>

163
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>to attack and suppress black people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>

164
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>The cruelest irony in both the birth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nation and Django unchained is that</v>

165
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>horses themselves are slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were tamed,</v>

166
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>enforced to work historically for white</v>
<v Speaker 1>men in the cinematic sphere.</v>

167
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Controlling the horse shows if their</v>
<v Speaker 1>handler is a good master with Django as</v>

168
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:30.650
<v Speaker 1>a former slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His role as a horseback rider and master</v>

169
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:33.590
<v Speaker 1>is confusing since it's a slave</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling a slave.</v>

170
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 1>This unnatural relationship confuses</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters throughout the movie.</v>

171
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Django repeatedly does things a master</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do like whipping people and</v>

172
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>manipulating people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I sound like a fucking slave?</v>

173
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 1>The horse symbolizes his new role as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>master of his domain,</v>

174
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>but I want to go further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to suggest that in some cases,</v>

175
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>this symbolism of horse riding exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>past just the movies.</v>

176
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It bleeds into real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that it is special election day</v>

177
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>and we do</v>

178
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 3>expect to see a Senate candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roy Moore,</v>

179
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 3>arriving by horseback to the polls.</v>

180
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Is it a coincidence that really more a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative Republican rode a horse to</v>

181
00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:07.100
<v Speaker 1>the polls during his campaign in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alabama?</v>

182
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He rode that horse when he didn't have</v>

183
00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:11.030
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a symbolic gesture.</v>

184
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.900
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to evoke American</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions of the West ones of mastery</v>

185
00:09:14.901 --> 00:09:15.830
<v Speaker 1>and control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

186
00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that riding a horse to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the polls is necessarily a bad thing,</v>

187
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.990
<v Speaker 4>lucy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that men on horseback,</v>

188
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.400
<v Speaker 4>particularly when embodying old ideas of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the American cowboy evoke concepts of</v>

189
00:09:25.401 --> 00:09:28.820
<v Speaker 4>domination and masculinity that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>inherently problematic in certain</v>

190
00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:29.654
<v Speaker 4>contexts.</v>

191
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.180
<v Speaker 3>A state of emergency has been declared</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the US state of Virginia.</v>

192
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Jefferson were protesting the plan</v>
<v Speaker 3>removal of a confederate monument from a</v>

193
00:09:38.831 --> 00:09:39.970
<v Speaker 3>city park.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Confederate.</v>

194
00:09:39.971 --> 00:09:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Statues were taken down in New Orleans</v>
<v Speaker 3>after two years of court battles and a</v>

195
00:09:43.781 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 3>heated public debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Protest.</v>

196
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.820
<v Speaker 3>Violence is extremely painful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in tears yesterday to see that it</v>

197
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.670
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It hurts.</v>

198
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I want American cars.</v>

199
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.940
<v Speaker 1>America has debated the removal of</v>
<v Speaker 1>confederate monuments around the country</v>

200
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:04.820
<v Speaker 1>for the last several years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opponents of the statues claimed that</v>

201
00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:06.560
<v Speaker 1>these statues were not built as</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorials,</v>

202
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:10.040
<v Speaker 1>but rather to intimidate black people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to reaffirm white supremacy.</v>

203
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.400
<v Speaker 1>One aspect of these statutes rarely</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned is the fact that these men are</v>

204
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:16.340
<v Speaker 1>very commonly on horseback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to have these people</v>

205
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:18.590
<v Speaker 1>standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that they are on horseback,</v>

206
00:10:18.591 --> 00:10:21.920
<v Speaker 1>it gives them a certain mythological</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority like a John Wayne Western</v>

207
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.320
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man on horseback symbolizes a man in</v>

208
00:10:24.321 --> 00:10:26.180
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a master of his domain,</v>

209
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.900
<v Speaker 1>a person of wealth and status physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>above the pedestrians around him,</v>

210
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but the mythologizing of these men</v>
<v Speaker 1>disguises a sinister history.</v>

211
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Though some Americans may look to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>statutes and be reminded of admire</v>

212
00:10:36.741 --> 00:10:39.590
<v Speaker 1>herbal western heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other Americans may look at them and see</v>

213
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:43.100
<v Speaker 1>a reminder of the men on horses who</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought to keep their ancestors in</v>

214
00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:43.670
<v Speaker 1>chains.</v>

215
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.280
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horse is itself a slave taken from</v>

216
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:49.700
<v Speaker 1>the wild and teams to work as a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rider is his master,</v>

217
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.570
<v Speaker 1>whether you feel it consciously or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A confederate white man riding a horse</v>

218
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.980
<v Speaker 1>on a monument evokes slavery imagery and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a historical look at writing in American</v>

219
00:10:57.981 --> 00:11:01.490
<v Speaker 1>cinema shows how the design of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>statutes makes them aggressive tools for</v>

220
00:11:01.491 --> 00:11:03.440
<v Speaker 1>intimidation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what should we do about them?</v>

221
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Polls show America is torn on whether to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take them down,</v>

222
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.140
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to consider than simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they should stay the same or</v>

223
00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:10.250
<v Speaker 1>whether they should go away.</v>

224
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.700
<v Speaker 4>So there's a third option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The third option is we engage our</v>

225
00:11:13.701 --> 00:11:17.270
<v Speaker 4>contemporary artists of this time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have the mics sculptures that exist</v>

226
00:11:17.271 --> 00:11:21.170
<v Speaker 4>in the communities that they live in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We present those sculptures in the same</v>

227
00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:24.920
<v Speaker 4>community squares where these Robert e</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lee sculptures exists.</v>

228
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.400
<v Speaker 4>We pull those least sculptures down from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pedestal,</v>

229
00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:32.060
<v Speaker 4>bring them at the same level as these</v>
<v Speaker 4>new contemporary works and we forced</v>

230
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:34.160
<v Speaker 4>these works to engage one another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richmond,</v>

231
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:36.800
<v Speaker 4>Virginia has five confederate leaders on</v>
<v Speaker 4>Monument Avenue,</v>

232
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.890
<v Speaker 4>including Jefferson Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robert e Dot Lee and stonewall Jackson.</v>

233
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.400
<v Speaker 4>But one other monument company falls</v>
<v Speaker 4>under the radar when talking about these</v>

234
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.720
<v Speaker 4>iconic centerpieces,</v>

235
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.220
<v Speaker 1>tennis legend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arthur Ashe also has his own statue on</v>

236
00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Monument Avenue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite a much more design than his</v>

237
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>confederate counterparts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their proposal of his statue sparked a</v>

238
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:59.470
<v Speaker 1>racial debate at the time of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>erection in the 19 nineties.</v>

239
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.360
<v Speaker 1>This statue is a step in the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

240
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 1>challenging monument avenue as a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>reserved for white confederate leaders.</v>

241
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Even so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Richmond has an opportunity in</v>

242
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:10.600
<v Speaker 1>the current political climate to add</v>
<v Speaker 1>other more challenging monuments.</v>

243
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Monument Avenue Falls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tradition of white men in art</v>

244
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 1>aristocrats in the 18th century commonly</v>
<v Speaker 1>commissioned portraits of themselves on</v>

245
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 1>horseback to signify their importance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>

246
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:20.220
<v Speaker 1>and power.</v>

247
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.960
<v Speaker 5>It's designed for domination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

248
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.550
<v Speaker 5>it's a language designed to make the</v>
<v Speaker 5>sitter feel as though he could ride this</v>

249
00:12:26.551 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 5>steve and control it with a pinky</v>
<v Speaker 5>controlled with the sheer will of his</v>

250
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:33.840
<v Speaker 5>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a propaganda act</v>

251
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 1>in response to these traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>portraits artists can handle.</v>

252
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Wiley has a piece titled Napoleon</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading the Army over the Alps,</v>

253
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Wiley's piece recontextualizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous Napoleon painting by</v>

254
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 1>replacing him with a black man in</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary clothing.</v>

255
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Critiquing the historical tradition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ignoring the black cultural experience.</v>

256
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 5>It crystallized something that I had</v>
<v Speaker 5>been thinking about for a very long</v>

257
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:56.050
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is that black men have been giving</v>

258
00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 5>very little in this world and that I as</v>
<v Speaker 5>an artist,</v>

259
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.930
<v Speaker 5>have the power and the potential and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>will to do something about it</v>

260
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.180
<v Speaker 1>because it's not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These confederate heroes invoke slavery</v>

261
00:13:08.181 --> 00:13:10.280
<v Speaker 1>imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another opportunity with the</v>

262
00:13:10.281 --> 00:13:13.580
<v Speaker 1>debate over these statues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to make heroes out of</v>

263
00:13:13.581 --> 00:13:13.770
<v Speaker 1>people</v>

264
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.360
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that have historically been put to the</v>

265
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:19.860
<v Speaker 5>side and we go into the front entrance</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the museum and there's that amazing</v>

266
00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:23.130
<v Speaker 5>sculpture of Teddy Roosevelt out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys know which one I'm talking</v>

267
00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:24.750
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Teddy Roosevelt,</v>

268
00:13:24.751 --> 00:13:29.670
<v Speaker 5>this in there with one hand on the horse</v>
<v Speaker 5>fall strong sleeves rolled up.</v>

269
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:31.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he's bare chested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it kinda feels like it.</v>

270
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:39.000
<v Speaker 5>And on the left hand side of him is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>native American walking and on the right</v>

271
00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:41.430
<v Speaker 5>hand side of him it was an African</v>
<v Speaker 5>American Walker.</v>

272
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.910
<v Speaker 5>And as we're moving up the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting closer to the sculpture,</v>

273
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.820
<v Speaker 5>my oldest son who's nine says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dad,</v>

274
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.380
<v Speaker 5>how come he gets to ride and they have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to walk.</v>

275
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I think an artist can handle wiley or</v>
<v Speaker 1>titus Kaphar could create a great</v>

276
00:14:01.171 --> 00:14:04.890
<v Speaker 1>addition to monument avenue with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>statue that rethinks who gets to ride on</v>

277
00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:07.260
<v Speaker 1>horseback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying you should feel bad</v>

278
00:14:07.261 --> 00:14:10.770
<v Speaker 1>for liking classic cowboy movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those movies are amongst the</v>

279
00:14:10.771 --> 00:14:12.990
<v Speaker 1>greats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am saying that the horse rider</v>

280
00:14:12.991 --> 00:14:16.440
<v Speaker 1>relationship deserves a closer look</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it reveals subtleties in our</v>

281
00:14:16.441 --> 00:14:19.200
<v Speaker 1>media and how we can make more powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and challenging art.</v>

282
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done preaching this stuff.</v>

283
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll get off my high horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is one thing I won't get off</v>

284
00:14:23.881 --> 00:14:25.710
<v Speaker 1>my high horse about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As some of you might know,</v>

285
00:14:25.711 --> 00:14:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually a software developer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm not making videos,</v>

286
00:14:28.261 --> 00:14:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing code and logging in and out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tons of applications and websites.</v>

287
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I keep all my passwords secure and out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mind.</v>

288
00:14:34.231 --> 00:14:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Using dashlane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dashlane is a secure and easy to use</v>
