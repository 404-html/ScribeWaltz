1
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.260
<v Speaker 1>In a womb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a world world or old world.</v>

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>make sure your phone's turned off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're getting some feedback out</v>

4
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:20.061
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A trailer boils down to four main</v>

5
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plot,</v>

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>

7
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>and the cliffhanger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

8
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>each trailer is its own unique short</v>
<v Speaker 1>story that happens to pull all its clips</v>

9
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>from one movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only real difference between a</v>

10
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>trailer and a short story is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliffhanger.</v>

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>A trailer's main goal is to get people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to see the movie.</v>

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>The cliffhanger is basically what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing from the trailer,</v>

13
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>the part that has to be enjoyed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>purchasing an $11 ticket to see the</v>

14
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>movie yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you make a trailer that's so</v>

15
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's safe to say the movie will do well</v>

16
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Safety first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Safety is safety is first.</v>

18
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the history of trailers</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and see why.</v>

19
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some trailers are still pretty</v>

20
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>forgettable since the 1950s trailers had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a narrator basically just tell us the</v>

21
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>four elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd say who the characters were,</v>

22
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>what the conflict was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plot,</v>

23
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>and whatever makes the movie worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing.</v>

24
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Now here at Connie Tam and all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful people and this unforgettable</v>

25
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clips from the movie only accompany the</v>

26
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>narration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the majority of cinematic</v>

27
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trailer was more or less a sales</v>

28
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>pitch by some narrator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell us the character,</v>

29
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>tell us the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell us why it's worth seeing and show a</v>

30
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>few clips to keep us from getting bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe throw in some silly music if it's</v>

31
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>a comedy or something epic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's action or drama.</v>

32
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Although some trailers from this time</v>
<v Speaker 1>were very well made.</v>

33
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>The psychos trailer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's narrated by Alfred Hitchcock as he</v>

34
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>walks through the bates motel and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this house,</v>

35
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>the most die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a horrible event took place.</v>

36
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>But as trailers had to get shorter to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit into TV commercial breaks,</v>

37
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.900
<v Speaker 1>they became more formulaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the stereotypical inner</v>

38
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>worlds trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a narrator telling us the</v>

39
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>characters telling us the plot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conflict,</v>

40
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>and the cliffhanger at new door cop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John McLean to see his wife</v>

41
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just for action movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedies have a similar formula.</v>

42
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Tell us everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sprinkle in some jokes along the way.</v>

43
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Her name is Samantha Baker and today is</v>
<v Speaker 1>her 16th birthday.</v>

44
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>The problem arose when this format</v>
<v Speaker 1>became predictable and boring.</v>

45
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>The inner world style of trailer now</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets parodied more often than actually</v>

46
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>used in a world where laughter was king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

47
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a world.</v>

48
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have to be careful generalizing</v>

49
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>though because while the majority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trailers did follow the formula,</v>

50
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>there have always been trailers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stands out.</v>

51
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

52
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I need to talk to Mary came over last</v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

53
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I want a salad last night because I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset that Joe was getting married and</v>

54
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 2>before I knew what we were kissing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationally short we did it,</v>

55
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>they take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually even the average trailer</v>

56
00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.560
<v Speaker 1>started getting more creative and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly more efficient.</v>

57
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>The short story of the trailer is</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited to around two minutes.</v>

58
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>If there's any way to say more in less</v>
<v Speaker 1>time than perfect.</v>

59
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>First cut out the narrator and</v>
<v Speaker 1>incorporate voiceovers from characters</v>

60
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This change makes the most sense.</v>

61
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>If we use character voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for,</v>

62
00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>we could have plot and conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced while also introducing the</v>

63
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to have to science the shit</v>

64
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:00.184
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

65
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.450
<v Speaker 1>we don't need the character telling us</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cliffhanger show,</v>

66
00:03:02.451 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>the cliffhanger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to see light sabers if we're</v>

67
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>seeing a star wars movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the best way to make a trailer for</v>

68
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>star wars tease us and to the trailer</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before the light sabers hit,</v>

69
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>the trailer is sending a message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pay for a ticket,</v>

70
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:17.851
<v Speaker 1>you will get to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third is the built start with something</v>

71
00:03:18.651 --> 00:03:20.720
<v Speaker 1>familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something normal then disrupted.</v>

72
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Does it live on the Great Plains of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa?</v>

73
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.030
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

74
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.740
<v Speaker 1>make the clips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get faster,</v>

75
00:03:27.741 --> 00:03:30.950
<v Speaker 1>the music louder and then peak followed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by some resolution.</v>

76
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Many early trailers never did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's since become the norm,</v>

77
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These techniques have become so normal</v>

78
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.050
<v Speaker 1>that they aren't enough to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trailer stand out anymore.</v>

79
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.260
<v Speaker 1>The vague dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the over the top music,</v>

80
00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:51.210
<v Speaker 1>it's very familiar to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that last line of the trailer</v>

81
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.360
<v Speaker 1>that's supposed to be really epic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so vague that it hardly makes</v>

82
00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:54.720
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>

83
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 3>Since I saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believed it was side.</v>

84
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 3>It's something new can come into this</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

85
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.940
<v Speaker 1>One way trailers combat with monotony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's through making more unique trailers</v>

86
00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:10.880
<v Speaker 1>where the sequence of shots gives the</v>
<v Speaker 1>four main elements instead of a</v>

87
00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 1>voiceover telling us the conflict and</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling us the plot with the right clips</v>

88
00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:18.110
<v Speaker 1>from the movie in the right order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see the plot and conflict in the</v>

89
00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:21.290
<v Speaker 1>American sniper trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kyle has his sights on a child he</v>

90
00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 1>may have to shoot to protect his team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kyle's internal conflict,</v>

91
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.010
<v Speaker 1>not addressed in voiceover but in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence of clicks</v>

92
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>and the cliffhanger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he pulls the trigger,</v>

93
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe show a scene between the two main</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters in their secret identities</v>

94
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>and cut back and forth between their</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk and them as superheroes.</v>

95
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 4>I have a bad history with stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like clowns</v>

96
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.720
<v Speaker 1>show an entire scene in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not with cut after cut and not with</v>

97
00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:59.120
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous music and voiceover in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

98
00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Just a good scene that makes for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorable trailer and partly why the</v>

99
00:05:02.571 --> 00:05:05.030
<v Speaker 1>furious seven trailer one the golden</v>
<v Speaker 1>trailer award.</v>

100
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I think in a lot of ways movie trailers</v>
<v Speaker 1>are like car commercials.</v>

101
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.460
<v Speaker 1>The majority of commercials are</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively the same.</v>

102
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Show the car driving around and looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

103
00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:16.370
<v Speaker 1>While a narrator brags about the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half the car stop announced its name and</v>

104
00:05:16.371 --> 00:05:19.250
<v Speaker 1>show the brand logo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this type of commercial gets</v>

105
00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:22.040
<v Speaker 1>car salt because it's used all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's boring.</v>

106
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.710
<v Speaker 1>It may be cheaper and easy to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so familiar.</v>

107
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the unique car commercials that go</v>
<v Speaker 1>viral or are really funny or different</v>

108
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.730
<v Speaker 1>that are probably the most valuable</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they create buzz and get shared</v>

109
00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>all across social media.</v>

110
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.390
<v Speaker 4>Pauline,</v>

111
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe most trailers will continue with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>more formulaic presentation of the four</v>

112
00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:42.330
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those ones that stand out,</v>

113
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.460
<v Speaker 1>the cool trailers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to share on facebook and</v>

114
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:46.860
<v Speaker 1>talk about with their friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones with the bank for</v>

115
00:05:46.861 --> 00:05:47.694
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

116
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>
