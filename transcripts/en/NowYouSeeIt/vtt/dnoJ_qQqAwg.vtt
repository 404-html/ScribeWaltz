1
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Let me start by saying there is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest movie of all time.</v>

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.070
<v Speaker 1>The question is just too difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really answer,</v>

3
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>but I still think it's the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important question in cinema.</v>

4
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.340
<v Speaker 1>What makes a movie great?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a number of concrete aspects</v>

5
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>of a movie that turned them from good</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies to movies with the legacy.</v>

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Speaker 1>The first is cinematic influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did the movie changed the way movies</v>

7
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:31.550
<v Speaker 1>are made?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read anything about citizen Kane,</v>

8
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>you'll realize that it's probably the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most innovative movie of all time and</v>

9
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a big reason why a tops every all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

10
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Movie List Citizen Kane highlights a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear distinction between two areas</v>

11
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>of filmmaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in it's cinematography.</v>

12
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Silent films were very economical with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their editing.</v>

13
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>They either showed their actors on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple two dimensional plane or used</v>

14
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>montage cuts to quickly associate one</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea with another,</v>

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>and one sound was introduced in the late</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 twenties.</v>

16
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>The first instinct for many directors</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just filming dialogue,</v>

17
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse shot with shallow focus,</v>

18
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.693
<v Speaker 1>and it was boring.</v>

19
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Here's your price</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it,</v>

20
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 2>or a steven from the hands of the lady</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a blackout on today.</v>

21
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 2>That's my quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lost results,</v>

22
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 2>our guy,</v>

23
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>but Orson Welles and Gregg toland</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the game in 1941 by bringing</v>

24
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>back traditional theatrical staging onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen.</v>

25
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>The use of deep focus camera allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters to be staged in interesting</v>

26
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>and revealing way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are the sole owner showing power</v>

27
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>dynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transitions of power,</v>

28
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>complex visual storytelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and giving the viewer active</v>

29
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>participation in the seed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing the viewer to choose what to</v>

30
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of having a close up force you</v>

31
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>to watch one character at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wells and tollens weren't the first to</v>

32
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>use this technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they executed it so effectively that</v>

33
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>they started a movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Iconic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep focused and sharp lighting.</v>

35
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>A film noir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies all influenced from citizen Kane,</v>

36
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.933
<v Speaker 1>not to mention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>his use of sound to transition from one</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene to another,</v>

38
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>which is basically in every single movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

39
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>not to mention the makeup which had</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been done so extensively.</v>

40
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention it's extensive use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>flashback and unreliable narration,</v>

41
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>which had only been done majorly in</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

42
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Once you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no question of its greatness.</v>

43
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Great movies change things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star wars ended a streak of dreary and</v>

44
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated movies in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

45
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>The Blair witch project changed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>horror genre for good and it looks like</v>

46
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>deadpool's going to change the game when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to marketing a movie and we'll</v>

47
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>probably see a lot more r rated comedies</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future because of it.</v>

48
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>If a movie changed what other filmmakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing,</v>

49
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be at least a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

50
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>The second measure of greatness is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural impact.</v>

51
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>How did the movie change the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

52
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>It was made it not just the world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema,</v>

53
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>like when jaws made beach attendance</v>
<v Speaker 1>plummet,</v>

54
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>or when fight club made an actual fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>club spring up around the US.</v>

55
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if the movie fight club inspired</v>

56
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>you to start your own fight club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're totally misreading the</v>

57
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a topic for another time.</v>

58
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>All I'm saying is movies aren't in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble.</v>

59
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Movies can make laws get enacted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can spread awareness on a massive</v>

60
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>scale to billions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that catch the attention of</v>

61
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>enough people are great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's just bringing back folk</v>

62
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>music</v>
<v Speaker 1>was</v>

63
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>the third and final way is personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact.</v>

64
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>It's the way that movie changes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the most overlooked</v>

65
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>aspect of a great movie because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to measure,</v>

66
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>but I've always been a big believer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies can tell us more about how to</v>

67
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>live our lives than the real world does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Juno explores abortion in a more</v>

68
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>accessible way than any abortion</v>
<v Speaker 1>pamphlet or any talk show host and she</v>

69
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:21.941
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

70
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies have fingernails,</v>

71
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>fingernails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that ability to tap into</v>

72
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>reality through a story makes a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the greats,</v>

73
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's the underlying beauty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema.</v>

74
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 1>A movie doesn't have to change cinema</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever and it doesn't have to change</v>

75
00:03:39.891 --> 00:03:42.170
<v Speaker 1>the world forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it changes you forever,</v>

76
00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:44.570
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this video is going more</v>

77
00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:47.240
<v Speaker 1>sentimental than usual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but greatness is hard to discuss</v>

78
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:49.580
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly measurable cinematic</v>

79
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:52.280
<v Speaker 1>techniques to judge for greatness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

80
00:03:52.281 --> 00:03:54.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the way movies touched us</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>

81
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:56.720
<v Speaker 1>That makes them great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People pick different movies as their</v>

82
00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:58.550
<v Speaker 1>favorite because at that point in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

83
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.910
<v Speaker 1>that was the movie they needed to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help them out or just to astound them</v>

84
00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:03.980
<v Speaker 1>the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be as simple as a movie that</v>

85
00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:06.620
<v Speaker 1>makes you laugh a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that if I really liked the movie,</v>

86
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I think about it constantly after I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen it 500 days of summer really helped</v>

87
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:13.760
<v Speaker 1>me with a bad relationship because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like the movie was talking about me</v>

88
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 1>and explaining everything I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently feeling so perfectly.</v>

89
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.060
<v Speaker 1>So how about this and normally terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>at keeping up with social media,</v>

90
00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:26.540
<v Speaker 1>but tweet about your favorite movie to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my twitter at swag thug for life and</v>

91
00:04:26.541 --> 00:04:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll respond to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about great movies and while</v>

92
00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I did start by saying there is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest movie of all time.</v>

93
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely the princess bride</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack,</v>

94
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.780
<v Speaker 1>which Tammy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>
