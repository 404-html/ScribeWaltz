1
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.720
<v Speaker 1>You ain't heard nothing yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ain't heard nothing.</v>

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 2>You want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This moment in the jazz singer in 1928</v>

4
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 2>led to standing ovations in movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>theaters.</v>

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 2>The first moment of dialogue marked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of a boom in the motion</v>

6
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:22.041
<v Speaker 2>picture industry improving sales from</v>
<v Speaker 2>1928 to 1929 despite the beginning of</v>

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.533
<v Speaker 2>the Great Depression.</v>

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.953
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Warner brothers surged and profits from</v>
<v Speaker 2>2 million to 14 million a year as</v>

10
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 2>millions flock to these talkies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which for the first few years consisted</v>

11
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 2>mostly of musicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking provided a layer of realism</v>

12
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 2>missing and movies by allowing more</v>
<v Speaker 2>character development and plot</v>

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 2>innovation in radio and television</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing paved the way for strong</v>

14
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 2>dialogue driven movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 angry men is written in such a way</v>

15
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 2>that you can follow the entire story</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your eyes closed.</v>

16
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh can to chalk and told even when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an open and shut case like this one</v>

17
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>image of the innocent which drug about</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

18
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess their own title,</v>

19
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Nick tensity and pace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's impossible for a completely</v>

20
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 2>silent movie to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk about dialogue and look</v>

21
00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 2>at how dialogue enhances the story while</v>
<v Speaker 2>also seeing its limitations.</v>

22
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Probably the biggest immediate benefit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dialogue is it's just so damn</v>

23
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>

24
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you captain with me?</v>

25
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you're doing in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm joining Richard Lord Vick.</v>

26
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>He's there with his truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lock narrowed and accurate with</v>

27
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Mallory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been I to have to drive far right.</v>

28
00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the next top of the stage coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be with your husband in a few</v>

29
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>hours</v>

30
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 2>from 10 seconds of dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know who lucy is,</v>

31
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.720
<v Speaker 2>where she is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where she's going and why she's going</v>

32
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what her husband does,</v>

33
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 2>where her husband is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the stage coach stops next and how</v>

34
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 2>long it should take until the couple is</v>
<v Speaker 2>reunited.</v>

35
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Dialogue is quick and easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but exposition through dialogue runs the</v>

36
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 2>risk of being boring like when we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sit through a villain monologuing his</v>

37
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 2>evil plan through a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think voiceover narration can be a</v>

38
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 2>lazy substitute for strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient dialogue on screen,</v>

39
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.180
<v Speaker 2>although sometimes there is no other way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

40
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 2>There are right and wrong ways to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposition dialogue.</v>

41
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Let's say a character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his parents died.</v>

42
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Shit dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell us like this.</v>

43
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well mama good.</v>

44
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

45
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 2>they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They died when I was three.</v>

46
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like this,</v>

47
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.353
<v Speaker 1>leave it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both</v>

49
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 2>mom would allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Expositions should be descriptive and</v>

50
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 2>also not completely plain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the difference between saying</v>

51
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 2>something and revealing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it the dead parent test for</v>

52
00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 2>dialog because so many movies seem to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have trouble telling us a parent isn't</v>

53
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 2>around anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mother's name was Susan.</v>

54
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.830
<v Speaker 2>She was killed in a car accident with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>father and they're both dead.</v>

55
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 2>So stop trying to bring up dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should reveal a character isn't in the</v>

56
00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 2>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of just saying it out loud,</v>

57
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't always have to be through</v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue</v>

58
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 2>and it can even be comedic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

59
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 2>And she inexplicably mails me a cactus</v>
<v Speaker 2>every Valentine's Day and I'm like,</v>

60
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 2>thanks to heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coyote ugly.</v>

61
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 2>This cactus Graham stinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even worse than your abandonment,</v>

62
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 2>but it just has to reveal something</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of saying it,</v>

63
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 2>it passes the dead parent test if it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not completely dry.</v>

64
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Because frankly just saying is lazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>

65
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>And with the number of lifeboats times</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capacity you mentioned,</v>

67
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>forgive me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems that there are not enough</v>

68
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>for everyone on board.</v>

69
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I think the same idea goes for dialogue</v>
<v Speaker 2>that explores the movie's made sure</v>

70
00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:21.590
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interstellar is a gorgeous movie,</v>

71
00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:24.320
<v Speaker 2>but this dialogue is very heavy handed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just being set</v>

72
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.090
<v Speaker 3>is the one thing we're capable of</v>
<v Speaker 3>perceiving that transcends dimensions of</v>

73
00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:34.091
<v Speaker 3>time and space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we should trust that even if we</v>

74
00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:36.170
<v Speaker 3>can't understand it yet,</v>

75
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's better to have themes hidden</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more ordinary dialogue</v>

76
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.240
<v Speaker 1>and fuck the Air Force Academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I want to fly,</v>

77
00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll find a way to fly</v>

78
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.920
<v Speaker 2>or revealing the teams through visuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dialogue always serves a narrative or</v>

79
00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:52.080
<v Speaker 2>comedic purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter how random it feels,</v>

80
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.270
<v Speaker 2>impulse fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dialogue feels meaningless,</v>

81
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.550
<v Speaker 2>but it sets up major plot points and</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

82
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Vinson and jewel's have a 10 minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation about whether or not it's</v>

83
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:01.410
<v Speaker 2>cheating for a man to give a woman a</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot rub</v>

84
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.570
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can even a million ladies and then</v>

85
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>your foot massages and they all meant</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

86
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Or we act like they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do.</v>

87
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so fucking cool.</v>

88
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:13.290
<v Speaker 1>That is a centralist thing going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>where where you know you don't talk</v>

89
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

90
00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:16.530
<v Speaker 1>She knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Marcella.</v>

91
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Snoop and Antwan should've fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>better known better</v>

92
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 2>this conversation while at the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very casual reinforces that Marcellus</v>

93
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 2>walls is not to be trifled with as</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vincent spends his night with Mrs.</v>

94
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Wallace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that earlier conversation reminds us</v>

95
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 2>that the stakes are high and Vincent May</v>
<v Speaker 2>or may not be overstepping his</v>

96
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.434
<v Speaker 2>boundaries.</v>

97
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Well Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to shit.</v>

98
00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Good night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a very lovely</v>

99
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 1>walk out the door and get in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go home,</v>

100
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.500
<v Speaker 1>jerk off and I saw you going to do</v>

101
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino uses dialogue to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>character flaws.</v>

102
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.711
<v Speaker 2>Jolson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vincent,</v>

103
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:48.980
<v Speaker 2>get a Great Cup of coffee and praise it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an attempt to be polite to Jimmy.</v>

104
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.890
<v Speaker 2>All it does is make him mad cause jewels</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Vincent are not focused on the</v>

105
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.920
<v Speaker 2>crisis they just created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what's on my mind right</v>

106
00:04:54.921 --> 00:04:57.440
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.</v>

107
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 2>It's the dead nigger in my garage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their signature swab and charming</v>

108
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.290
<v Speaker 2>dialogue failed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Winston Wolfe,</v>

109
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.840
<v Speaker 2>he knows the appropriate way to respond</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's the wolf.</v>

110
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Terentino's dialogue has masterfully</v>
<v Speaker 2>layer.</v>

111
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 2>They may be talking about nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in actuality the dialogue</v>

112
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:20.100
<v Speaker 2>foreshadows the major conflicts in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the movie.</v>

113
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.640
<v Speaker 2>You shoot me in a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better wake up and apologize.</v>

114
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Don't listen to anybody that says</v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue is bad and visuals are always</v>

115
00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:31.800
<v Speaker 2>better in film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just false.</v>

116
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Dialogue is beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>revealing at hilarious.</v>

117
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.600
<v Speaker 2>Just know when to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the Walrus.</v>

118
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up.</v>
