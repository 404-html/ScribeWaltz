1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think hard.</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 1>What is</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle</v>

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>close spot,</v>

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.240
<v Speaker 2>definitely wrong.</v>

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed you two shapes,</v>

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 2>sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one in shape too,</v>

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 2>and then I asked you would you be shapes</v>
<v Speaker 2>matches the word Boba and which matches</v>

8
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 2>the word Kiki for 98 percent of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape one is Kiki and shaped to his Boba</v>

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't matter if you're from</v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or your two and a half years old.</v>

11
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 2>This result is extremely consistent</v>
<v Speaker 2>across all cultures and languages,</v>

12
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 2>and so what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to suggest that with this study</v>

13
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 2>we can see how the brain gives abstract</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning too many different shapes in a</v>

14
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 2>consistent way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and filmmakers use this phenomenon to</v>

15
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 2>tell their story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best place to see this idea has to</v>

16
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 2>be animation were animators can make</v>
<v Speaker 2>objects and characters from any shape</v>

17
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 2>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's start with the basics.</v>

18
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>square and triangle.</v>

19
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 2>This may seem reductive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these shapes say a lot more than you</v>

20
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 2>may think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evil characters are drawn like Kiki.</v>

21
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 2>They have sharper features pointing</v>
<v Speaker 2>noses,</v>

22
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 2>ears in long curly fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lovable characters are designed</v>

23
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 2>like Boba soft and round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a coincidence that the fluffiest</v>

24
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 2>and least threatening character in</v>
<v Speaker 2>animation is named balloon?</v>

25
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole concept makes intuitive</v>

26
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our brains are designed to c sharp and</v>

27
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 2>pointy things is more threatening.</v>

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Speaker 1>It just stood around on the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be pointed around.</v>

29
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not scary scary.</v>

30
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Notice how I can draw the nicest and</v>
<v Speaker 2>most recognizable character in animation</v>

31
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 2>with three circles and notice how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>devil is commonly represented as a</v>

32
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 2>collection of triangles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do it a little more subtly and</v>

33
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 2>you're able to emit an emotional</v>
<v Speaker 2>response to the viewer without them even</v>

34
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 2>noticing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens during one of my favorite</v>

35
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 2>movie moments of all time when we see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wicked villain transformed from Kiki</v>

36
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 2>into around vulnerable Boba.</v>

37
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 2>You may think this only applies to</v>
<v Speaker 2>animation,</v>

38
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 2>but is it a coincidence that darth</v>
<v Speaker 2>vader's mask has this shape and Lord</v>

39
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.540
<v Speaker 2>dark helmet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cartoonish and comedic parody of</v>

40
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Darth vader has this shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the sharpest villains is</v>

41
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 2>maleficent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they even tried to keep her pointy</v>

42
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 2>jaw line and eyebrows in the live action</v>
<v Speaker 2>remake.</v>

43
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Following these same principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean when you call somebody</v>

44
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 2>a square?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means they're boring.</v>

45
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're old fashioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a square can also symbolize</v>

46
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 2>something that is sturdy and from sound</v>
<v Speaker 2>familiar.</v>

47
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Squares are rigid and slow to change if</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world is and how they want it to be.</v>

48
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they get a little angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to think abstractly,</v>

49
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:22.100
<v Speaker 2>the world of film exists inside a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rectangular shape.</v>

50
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 2>A lot of important geometry comes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>framing.</v>

51
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 2>The most significant framing to look for</v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably the frame within the frame.</v>

52
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.650
<v Speaker 2>This is used to show a character trapped</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their current situation.</v>

53
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Another less common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but equally important frame with it.</v>

54
00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:43.060
<v Speaker 2>The frame is the circle which gives the</v>
<v Speaker 2>geometric impression of surveillance and</v>

55
00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:48.061
<v Speaker 2>spying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go a step deeper than the frame</v>

56
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:54.610
<v Speaker 2>within the frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can use lines to create a visual</v>

57
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 2>jail cell in the frame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's through blinds in an office</v>

58
00:02:57.611 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 2>or even a computer screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A collection of vertical and horizontal</v>

59
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 2>lines can indicate a character is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>only trapped but held prisoner in their</v>

60
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 2>current lifestyle.</v>

61
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 2>These shots used geometry as a means of</v>
<v Speaker 2>visual storytelling as far back as I can</v>

62
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to be a gangster and how</v>

63
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>does even noticing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Framing is filled with lines.</v>

64
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Geometry is everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same principles apply.</v>

65
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Triangles can emphasize power dynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Linear framing can show physical</v>

66
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>separation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're straight lines can guide our</v>

67
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 2>eyesight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the next time you rewatch your</v>

68
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 2>favorite movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try analyzing the geometry of the</v>

69
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 2>framing and characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do that,</v>

70
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 2>then you're in good shape.</v>

71
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.503
<v Speaker 1>What's this one</v>

72
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.280
<v Speaker 2>couple of wavy lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

73
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 2>This isn't your lucky day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>

74
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Slightly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a bit of a break from just a little</v>

75
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:52.970
<v Speaker 3>slot in the break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The monotony of all that hardcore.</v>

76
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I want to think good blood for giving me</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea in the first place with his</v>

77
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:58.530
<v Speaker 2>amazing crash bandicoot video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I highly recommend it.</v>
