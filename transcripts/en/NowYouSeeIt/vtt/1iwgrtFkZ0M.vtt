00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.220
<v Speaker 1>What's your favorite movie memory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean is what's your fondest</v>

2
00:00:03.221 --> 00:00:06.010
<v Speaker 1>memory while watching a movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question came to me this morning</v>

3
00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:09.140
<v Speaker 1>when I was watching the episode of Louis</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ck is horace and Pete,</v>

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a TV show that he produced on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>website and it's great.</v>

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.870
<v Speaker 1>There's this interesting segment where</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old man enters their bar.</v>

6
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let the whole scene play</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I really encourage you to get the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

8
00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:18.824
<v Speaker 1>If you enjoy this.</v>

9
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 2>My mother would send me here for a Pail</v>
<v Speaker 2>of beer for my dad.</v>

10
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.690
<v Speaker 1>We used to sell beer pills out the bank.</v>

11
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

12
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came here to get my first beer and I</v>

13
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 2>met my wife here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was sitting</v>

14
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.130
<v Speaker 2>in that stool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 2>And we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were married for</v>

16
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 2>years and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was happy and then I heard that she</v>

17
00:00:55.811 --> 00:01:00.811
<v Speaker 2>was sleeping with my best friend and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed up here one night and she was</v>

18
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.540
<v Speaker 2>sitting in that stool again with my best</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend kissing her and I just shot them</v>

19
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 2>both dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

20
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.250
<v Speaker 2>that was back in 1961.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got to go to jail today.</v>

21
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 3>That guy really there</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want a beer?</v>

22
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>So here's my question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that segment tragic or funny?</v>

23
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>I think the first instinct is to find it</v>
<v Speaker 1>morbid.</v>

24
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Certainly a man murdering his wife and</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending his life in prison is tragic,</v>

25
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>but the way it's presented is also</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedic.</v>

26
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a rollercoaster of events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was choking on my morning Bagel from</v>

27
00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 1>laughter at how his story got absurdly</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse and worse.</v>

28
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer that the funniest</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments are the ones that are also the</v>

29
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 1>saddest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched daddy's home the other day and</v>

30
00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had some good labs,</v>

31
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 1>but with comedies like daddy's home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always something missing and</v>

32
00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:20.680
<v Speaker 1>that brings me to my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The funniest movies are also the saddest</v>

33
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the tragicomedy hear me out on this</v>

34
00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd venture to say that the vast</v>

35
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:28.510
<v Speaker 1>majority of comedy these days contains</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters who served no other purpose</v>

36
00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:29.560
<v Speaker 1>but to make us laugh.</v>

37
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like bridesmaids and spaceballs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're great.</v>

38
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Those are classics and I think Mel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooks is a genius,</v>

39
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's something inherently shallow</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the comedy.</v>

40
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.540
<v Speaker 1>All we got was laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with this moment from horace and</v>

41
00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's such a huge spectrum of emotion.</v>

42
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.610
<v Speaker 1>It goes from a laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he met his wife there and</v>

43
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:47.890
<v Speaker 1>caught her cheating there to a very sad</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

44
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.250
<v Speaker 1>a homicide to a final resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pete offering him a drink.</v>

45
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>That rollercoaster is just well better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means more that way.</v>

46
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.820
<v Speaker 1>It really lingers with me afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I experience multiple emotions in</v>

47
00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>one moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just laughter and it's different</v>

48
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>from dark comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark comedy is when you make comedy out</v>

49
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>of something that's supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>taboo,</v>

50
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>but tragic comedy is when you let the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad moments be genuinely sad,</v>

51
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>and the funny moments as a result are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more genuinely funny.</v>

52
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>This scene brought me back to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite memory of watching a movie.</v>

53
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I was watching little Miss Sunshine with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>

54
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Dad and sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this scene came up.</v>

55
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Slight spoilers ahead in this scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwayne finds out he can't fulfill his</v>

56
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:21.860
<v Speaker 1>dream of becoming a</v>

57
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 4>pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cannot fly jets</v>

58
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.630
<v Speaker 1>rewatching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly a tragic scene,</v>

59
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here we see another essential moment</v>

60
00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:34.400
<v Speaker 1>of tragic comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The funniest moments are also the</v>

61
00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:36.320
<v Speaker 1>saddest moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as he found out he was</v>

62
00:03:36.321 --> 00:03:38.000
<v Speaker 1>colorblind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started getting emotional,</v>

63
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.590
<v Speaker 1>but then frank has his perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

64
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.640
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got An emergency</v>

65
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.890
<v Speaker 1>and at this point my mom busts out</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing and all of a sudden I do too.</v>

66
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Uncontrollable laughter and my sister</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dad think we're crazy.</v>

67
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.690
<v Speaker 1>So is the scene funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.890
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tragic,</v>

69
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.690
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes it is fight.</v>

70
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.580
<v Speaker 1>The lows are low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the highs are high.</v>

71
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Steve Carell is a master of comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he earns his last by also having</v>

72
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:04.554
<v Speaker 1>his sad side</v>

73
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.630
<v Speaker 6>and that's when I decided to check out</v>
<v Speaker 6>early.</v>

74
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

75
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.830
<v Speaker 6>and I failed at that as well.</v>

76
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>He has that perfect balance throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>

77
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed his best movies put him as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pathetic character while the movies</v>

78
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:21.930
<v Speaker 1>where he's always goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have that spark any ads.</v>

79
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>His talent to my favorite movie memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every character choice makes this seem</v>

80
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Way Dwayne maniacally punches the</v>

81
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>side of the car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car horn honking randomly.</v>

82
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:33.570
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Richard Texas watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>argues that they don't have time to pull</v>

83
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>over Dwayne's reaction is priceless.</v>

84
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be good</v>

85
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in tears,</v>

86
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.170
<v Speaker 1>sad tears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also laughing hysterically.</v>

87
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.360
<v Speaker 1>The climax of the scene is pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

88
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.640
<v Speaker 1>My Dad and sister were looking at my mom</v>
<v Speaker 1>and me dumbfounded.</v>

89
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 1>How could we be so cruel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>insensitive?</v>

90
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Can't they see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is tragic.</v>

91
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not tragic.</v>

92
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>It's better than tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tragic comedy because last time I</v>

93
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:05.940
<v Speaker 1>checked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is tragic and funny,</v>

94
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but 99 percent of movies are either one</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the other and the ones that you both</v>

95
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>are the diamonds in the rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you noticed this type of movement,</v>

96
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but appreciate it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more.</v>

97
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.180
<v Speaker 1>So that became my favorite movie memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing and crying at the same time</v>

98
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:20.670
<v Speaker 1>with my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a treat those movies that genuinely</v>

99
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:23.100
<v Speaker 1>capture the human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's tragic.</v>

100
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.990
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

101
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
