1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.330
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Stupid Pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got the arms left.</v>

3
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.443
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have</v>

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 2>just a flesh wound in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When somebody gets injured,</v>

5
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 2>it's just a stroke of bad luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in movies,</v>

6
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 2>it's never an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An injury is a calculated and meaningful</v>

7
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 2>choice by a writer or director to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>us more about a character or reinforce</v>

8
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 2>certain thematic ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each injury,</v>

9
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 2>whether it's blindness or becoming</v>
<v Speaker 2>handicapped,</v>

10
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>represents the symbolic handicap captain</v>
<v Speaker 2>who they are as a character.</v>

11
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 2>And many of the most memorable</v>
<v Speaker 2>characters and movie moments were</v>

12
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 2>greatly enhanced by this literary</v>
<v Speaker 2>concept.</v>

13
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 2>So let's give some characters at</v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosis.</v>

14
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just keep bringing it up.</v>

15
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 2>What do you get back in again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

16
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I have to convince you that injuries are</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more than just physical in the</v>

17
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say we have a character</v>

18
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 2>returning from combat adjusting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilian life.</v>

19
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 2>How do we show his inner conflict</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolically?</v>

20
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Give him a limp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A limp literally hinders his mobility,</v>

21
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 2>reflecting his struggle to adapt to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>new lifestyle.</v>

22
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that you'll therapist thing,</v>

23
00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 2>so limp psychosomatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct camera,</v>

24
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he gets the thrill of the chase</v>

25
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 2>and the limp finally goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what that means.</v>

26
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.750
<v Speaker 3>You said you forgot this.</v>

27
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 2>The ability to stand and walk normally</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a symbol of strength and self</v>

28
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 2>confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think the secret service</v>

29
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 2>didn't allow any pictures taken of FDR</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a wheelchair?</v>

30
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 2>Walking or the lack of it makes for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful image in forrest gump.</v>

31
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Lieutenant Dad's character arc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets represented through his</v>

32
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 2>injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to die a hero on the</v>

33
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 2>battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he fails,</v>

34
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 2>he loses the ability to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His injury directly contrasts forrest</v>

35
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 2>who went from handicap to always running</v>
<v Speaker 2>in later scenes.</v>

36
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Lieutenant Dans frustration is always</v>
<v Speaker 2>shown through his reliance on others to</v>

37
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 2>move because he can't move himself where</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to be.</v>

38
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 2>When he finally gets as close as he can</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the heavens,</v>

39
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 2>challenging the fate he was supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

40
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.920
<v Speaker 2>That's when he finally moves on his own</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually I got new legs custom</v>

41
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 2>made titanium alloy.</v>

42
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 2>The fixing of an injury always reflects</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way a character,</v>

43
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 2>his inner self is being fixed too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to character to have a</v>

44
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 2>crutch in their psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them a literal one.</v>

45
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 2>There will be blood starts with theory</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenes depicting the dangerous world of</v>

46
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 2>drilling underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel plainview breaks is like falling</v>

47
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 2>into a well and has to crawl all the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the well in the middle of nowhere</v>

48
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 2>to the nearest town through an injury</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how he beats it.</v>

49
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 2>We learned about his ruthlessness better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than dialogue could ever tell us.</v>

50
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 2>It's in a way that justifies his actions</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the movie as much of a bastard as</v>

51
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:20.061
<v Speaker 2>this man proves himself to be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>courage that it would have taken to do</v>

52
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:28.791
<v Speaker 2>that actually gives him the heroic right</v>
<v Speaker 2>for almost everything that he does</v>

53
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 2>throughout the rest of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't always have to be</v>

54
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 2>grandiose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can even give a character a fake</v>

55
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 2>injury to play with our expectations.</v>

56
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Bonnie and Clyde Clyde cutoff his toe to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of doing work in prisons,</v>

57
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 2>and this impairment relates directly to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual impotence with Bonnie in</v>

58
00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:55.600
<v Speaker 2>literature and film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A physical ailment can often indicate a</v>

59
00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 2>sexual element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a man,</v>

60
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 2>he's limped in more ways than one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ain't much of a loverboy in rear</v>

61
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff is physically bound to a</v>

62
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.800
<v Speaker 2>wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to marry you.</v>

63
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Lisa and his physical restrictions from</v>
<v Speaker 2>his injury compliment his view that he's</v>

64
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 2>perhaps being sexually restricted as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

65
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 2>off to act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what about characters like professor</v>

66
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 2>x and Yoda?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both have issues with walking,</v>

67
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 2>but there's some of the most powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>characters in their worlds.</v>

68
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of mentors have physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>handicaps because it reflects how they</v>

69
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 2>pay for mind over body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've transcended physical limitations</v>

70
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 2>to the point where it doesn't reflect</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness,</v>

71
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 2>a similar injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his blindness,</v>

72
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 2>this trope goes as far back as oedipus</v>
<v Speaker 2>rex when the blind man can tell the</v>

73
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

74
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 2>While oedipus is the ones seeing things</v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrectly in movies,</v>

75
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 2>not being tricked by the world around</v>
<v Speaker 2>you seems to give you a spiritual wisdom</v>

76
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 2>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

77
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>have you ever noticed that every</v>
<v Speaker 2>superhero has a movie where they lose</v>

78
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 2>their powers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't shoot webs,</v>

79
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 2>they don't have their suit or they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>blasted with Kryptonite?</v>

80
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 2>It's because when your life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>threatened to when you're no longer</v>

81
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 2>invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>benny become relatable because what's</v>

82
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 2>more human than being mortal when to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much invincible superheros fight.</v>

83
00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are the stakes?</v>

84
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 2>How can we relate to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iti was such a revolutionary movie</v>

85
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:05.790
<v Speaker 2>because for the first time the Ilien</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a giant monster,</v>

86
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 2>huge impenetrable creature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was innocent and most importantly he</v>

87
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 2>could get sick making him human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of my favorite examples of</v>

88
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 2>bringing out humanity through injuries</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in terminator two Arnold</v>

89
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Schwarzenegger is an emotionless robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by the end of the movie he grows on</v>

90
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 2>you and it comes from his selflessness</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how he lets himself get hurt.</v>

91
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Even with no sympathetic dialogue and no</v>
<v Speaker 2>discernible emotion and a murderer</v>

92
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 2>streak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The terminators still gets a hug in the</v>

93
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 2>end and we empathize with him because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>got hurt.</v>

94
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing about die hard,</v>

95
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 2>die hard one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The original John McLean,</v>

96
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 2>just this normal guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

97
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 2>he's just a normal New York City cop who</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets his feet cut and gets beat up,</v>

98
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 2>but he's an everyday guy and die hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

99
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.640
<v Speaker 2>he is jumping a motorcycle into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>helicopter air,</v>

100
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's invincible.</v>

101
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>major injuries reminds you of your</v>

102
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 2>mortality and may make you reconsider</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's important to you and film the</v>

103
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 2>same principles apply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the next time somebody gets hurt,</v>

104
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 2>remember that it's never just a flesh</v>
<v Speaker 2>wound.</v>

105
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.890
<v Speaker 4>Come back here and take off kind of by</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

106
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.343
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for watching.</v>

107
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.510
<v Speaker 5>You</v>
<v Speaker 5>said.</v>
