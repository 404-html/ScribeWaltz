1
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood is a crazy world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even crazier history.</v>

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 2>It's conniving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive and above all risky.</v>

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 2>I think to analyze movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to understand the context</v>

5
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:19.240
<v Speaker 2>surrounding the production of the movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's mentioned.</v>

6
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 2>It's also extremely interesting,</v>

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 2>separate Hollywood's life into five</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinct areas and see the thievery,</v>

8
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 2>desperation and failure in the industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starting with</v>

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 2>the first movies actually began far away</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Hollywood,</v>

10
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All movies before 1911,</v>

11
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 2>like the great train robbery in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first Frankenstein movies were filmed</v>

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 2>entirely on the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

13
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 2>the all too familiar term cliffhanger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely,</v>

14
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 2>originates from a series called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>peril of poly in 1914,</v>

15
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 2>which was filmed in the former motion</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture capital of the country,</v>

16
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Fort Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey.</v>

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 2>The move to Hollywood happened for</v>
<v Speaker 2>several reasons.</v>

18
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 2>It was cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nice weather year round in</v>

19
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provided a lot of distinct film</v>

20
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 2>locations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing illustrates this better than</v>

21
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 2>paramount's description of the region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One reason hardly talked about,</v>

22
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the fact that these million dollar</v>

23
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 2>motion picture industries were fleeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to California so they could more easily</v>

24
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 2>break the law in 1891.</v>

25
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Edison patented the kinetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>breath that technology used to film</v>

26
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 2>movies with his patent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a legal monopoly on the entire</v>

27
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 2>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even at control over movie projectors</v>

28
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 2>and film distributors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edison aggressively sued many people</v>

29
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 2>using his adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going so far as to hiring thugs to smash</v>

30
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 2>cameras and rate independent studios.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Filmmakers like Fox and paramount had to</v>

31
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 2>flee to the west coast so they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>make their movies outside of Edison's</v>

32
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 2>influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So technically any movie made before</v>

33
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 2>1917,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not from Thomas Edison's production</v>

34
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 2>company was completely illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 1917,</v>

35
00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 2>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supreme court ruled his monopoly</v>

36
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 2>unlawful and against public interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting how an industry founded</v>

37
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 2>on breaking the rules is now</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressively taking video essays down on</v>

38
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Youtube despite their obvious fair use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I digress.</v>

39
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.193
<v Speaker 3>Shall we try it right?</v>

40
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 2>In the late 19 tents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America cinema transitioned into what</v>

41
00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 2>we're familiar with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the booming Hollywood industry.</v>

42
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150
<v Speaker 2>The industry skyrocketed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A key innovation was the addition of</v>

43
00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 2>dialogue in the late 19 twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which kept the industry afloat popular</v>

44
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 2>and innovative throughout the Great</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depression.</v>

45
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 2>The era between 1917 in the late 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>forties is commonly referred to as</v>

46
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 2>studio system Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one production companies had</v>

47
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.460
<v Speaker 2>decade long contracts with actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>directors,</v>

48
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:35.260
<v Speaker 2>and writers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think the movie industry has</v>

49
00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:38.020
<v Speaker 2>monopolized now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that five studios had control of</v>

50
00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Speaker 2>absolutely everything in the 19 forties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each major company had ownership of</v>

51
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 2>actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>directors,</v>

52
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:45.610
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even the movie theaters.</v>

53
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Creators could only make it an industry</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they stuck with one company for</v>

54
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 2>almost their entire careers by signing</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm and sometimes very unfair</v>

55
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:56.740
<v Speaker 2>contracts out of this era came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Classics such as Gone With the wind,</v>

56
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Snow White and the seven dwarves and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>original Kong.</v>

57
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 2>One interesting aspect of this time</v>
<v Speaker 2>period is that with so many movies being</v>

58
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>made and so many people flocking to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>theater movie,</v>

59
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 2>companies could afford producing movies</v>
<v Speaker 2>with medium sized budgets and scripts</v>

60
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 2>that weren't necessarily blockbuster</v>
<v Speaker 2>material like citizen Kane and Casa</v>

61
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.331
<v Speaker 2>Blanca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays,</v>

62
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 2>big companies pull most of their time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and resources into several big budget</v>

63
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.960
<v Speaker 2>movies a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite a shame.</v>

64
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 2>The end of this era came from another</v>
<v Speaker 2>battle with the courts.</v>

65
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 2>The Supreme Court ruled against</v>
<v Speaker 2>paramount pictures saying ownership of</v>

66
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 2>the theaters and distribution of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>films was a restriction of fair trade.</v>

67
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 2>This loss of control of distribution</v>
<v Speaker 2>protected independent filmmakers,</v>

68
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 2>but meant to decline in the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

69
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 2>The next hit to movie popularity was</v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

70
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Television hurt the industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since many people could stay at home to</v>

71
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:47.750
<v Speaker 2>get their entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movie viewership plummeted in the 30,</v>

72
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 2>60 percent of people went to the movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>theaters at least once a week,</v>

73
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 2>but since the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number has consistently stuck around</v>

74
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 2>only 10 percent to combat TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Movies had to do what?</v>

75
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 2>TV couldn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big screens and big budgets.</v>

76
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 2>The Hollywood epic came into fruition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is when movies got absolutely</v>

77
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cinema scope lenses stretched the screen</v>

78
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 2>to almost twice the size of conventional</v>
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>

79
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 2>There were movies like Cleopatra in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1963,</v>

80
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 2>which was the highest grossing film of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year and still didn't make back its</v>

81
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 2>budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of its huge hundred foot set pieces</v>

82
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 2>had to be built twice in two separate</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries because the lead Elizabeth</v>

83
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Taylor got sick</v>

84
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.230
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new Hollywood era broke through.</v>

85
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Starting with Bonnie and Clyde,</v>
<v Speaker 2>film school trained directors gained</v>

86
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 2>major influence in the industry as</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to the producers of old</v>

87
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood with low budget hits like jaws</v>
<v Speaker 2>by Steven Spielberg,</v>

88
00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Star Wars by George Lucas and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Godfather,</v>

89
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Francis Coppola.</v>

90
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Producers gave more control to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>filmmakers who in turn produced more</v>

91
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:44.910
<v Speaker 2>provocative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diverse,</v>

92
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:46.650
<v Speaker 2>and innovative movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>

93
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I find this atmosphere the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>conducive to amazing filmmaking,</v>

94
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.840
<v Speaker 2>but it came at a price with such</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>

95
00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Several films got way out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many directors took their power too far</v>

96
00:04:55.381 --> 00:04:57.600
<v Speaker 2>and movie budget skyrocketed out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

97
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 2>Apocalypse now as an extreme example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a documentary on the production</v>

98
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:04.710
<v Speaker 2>process of the movie called heart of</v>
<v Speaker 2>darkness that I absolutely recommend I</v>

99
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:08.160
<v Speaker 2>cannot come close to describing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mayhem of making that movie in such a</v>

100
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:10.920
<v Speaker 2>short video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurricanes heart attacks a coup in the</v>

101
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:11.760
<v Speaker 2>country they filmed.</v>

102
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.290
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy with apocalypse now in 1979</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the box office bombed heaven's gate</v>

103
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 2>in 1980 bankrupting a huge production</v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

104
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Producers tighten their grip on</v>
<v Speaker 2>filmmakers,</v>

105
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 2>which makes absolute sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what happened was in the seventies,</v>

106
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:26.100
<v Speaker 2>all those filmmakers that dig a final</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut,</v>

107
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.000
<v Speaker 2>the budgets grew and grew and each one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one after the other had a financial</v>

108
00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:32.820
<v Speaker 2>disaster that almost tore down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>studios.</v>

109
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.100
<v Speaker 2>If you treat the movie industry like an</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual business,</v>

110
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.970
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely one of the riskiest one</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie the public hates and it cripples</v>

111
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:41.100
<v Speaker 2>the company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millions are on the line and with</v>

112
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:44.310
<v Speaker 2>continuously decreasing ticket sales</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies had to adapt.</v>

113
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Now we're at the movie industry as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know it today with home video in the</v>

114
00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:51.390
<v Speaker 2>nineties and streaming services like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix.</v>

115
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:54.420
<v Speaker 2>It's hardly worth it to drive all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to a movie theater anymore,</v>

116
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 2>so companies make a handful of movies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and promote them.</v>

117
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 2>Crazy superheros and fantasy movies</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominate box office sales because those</v>

118
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 2>are the movies that are worth seeing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big screen.</v>

119
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Movies like pop star in the nice guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>bond this year because they're light</v>

120
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 2>comedies and frankly I'm willing to wait</v>
<v Speaker 2>for them to come to Netflix and a couple</v>

121
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:10.970
<v Speaker 2>of months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's amazing about this era is that it</v>

122
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 2>gets easier and easier to make feature</v>
<v Speaker 2>length movies.</v>

123
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 2>I bought a used dslr camera tripod,</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory card case,</v>

124
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:20.680
<v Speaker 2>and editing software for less than $600.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a huge movie of</v>

125
00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 2>conglomerate to get your voice heard and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your art noticed.</v>

126
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood becomes more and more obsolete</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

127
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.020
<v Speaker 2>So pick up your iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit record,</v>

128
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>action.</v>

129
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.083
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>

130
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 4>Just</v>
<v Speaker 4>need a ball bat.</v>
