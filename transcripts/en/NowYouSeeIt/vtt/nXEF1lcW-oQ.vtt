1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Urban dictionary defines a jump scare as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a technique used by unimaginative</v>

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.640
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers as a cheap method of</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightening the audience.</v>

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>And judging by a lot of comments on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>last video,</v>

4
00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>people tend to agree with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I agreed that the jump scare has lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>its former glory,</v>

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>not only our movie saturated with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think many filmmakers are using them</v>

7
00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>completely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But where I disagree with a lot of</v>

8
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>people is that I think there's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope for the jump scare and people don't</v>

9
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>give them nearly enough credit for how</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing they can beat.</v>

10
00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 1>So let's see what they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't handle all the jump</v>

11
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.870
<v Speaker 1>scares why you are nothing but a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>big coward,</v>

12
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>you Roy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and its simplest form,</v>

13
00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>a jump scare is a jarring cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually accompanied by a frightening</v>

14
00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To illustrate this technique,</v>

15
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>let's look at an example that's not from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a horror movie</v>

16
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 2>shoots</v>
<v Speaker 2>ticket one time.</v>

17
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.483
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

18
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Now what makes this more than a cheap</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump scare?</v>

19
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>What's important is that it not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>scares,</v>

20
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>but it outlines a major plot point that</v>
<v Speaker 1>resonates throughout the Lord of the</v>

21
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>rings trilogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a jump scare.</v>

22
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>We see how the ring can turn the kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>bilbo into an evil and terrifying</v>

23
00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A jump scare was without a doubt the</v>

24
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>best way to show the terrors of the ring</v>
<v Speaker 1>firsthand.</v>

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>So now for the rest of their adventure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that jumps gear sticks with us and</v>

26
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>reminds us how high the stakes are and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how powerful the ring is.</v>

27
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think jumps gears are misunderstood,</v>

28
00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 1>is that they're supposed to do much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than just give us a simple startle.</v>

29
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>A jump scare should add tension to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the movie by making us distrust</v>

30
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>any moment where we feel safe after</v>
<v Speaker 1>being startled,</v>

31
00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 1>once were put on high alert and with</v>
<v Speaker 1>every long pause or dark shadow we</v>

32
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 1>experience afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a heightened suspense and</v>

33
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:42.610
<v Speaker 1>alertness because now we question</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we see.</v>

34
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.030
<v Speaker 1>This is where many filmmakers use the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump scare rung when used correctly.</v>

35
00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>The technique makes the call moments of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie scary too.</v>

36
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Places down it can wander in and out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>any panic night</v>

37
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>scare should function like real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once he gets scared.</v>

38
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Once you're scared for the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

39
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>they're great movies like the witch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>use very subtle and infrequent jump</v>

40
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>scares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't scary themselves,</v>

41
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.760
<v Speaker 1>but the quick cuts in change in sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>still add to the overall suspense of the</v>

42
00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:15.761
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The technique is done wrong when it's</v>

43
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>used too often and isn't punctuated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspiciously calm and suspenseful scenes</v>

44
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>like when silent hill revelation makes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump scare out of literally everything</v>

45
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 1>including a pop tart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

46
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I take it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use a toaster for an effective</v>

47
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the great buildup that does it</v>

48
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.733
<v Speaker 3>trick.</v>

49
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Another misunderstanding is that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what makes a jump scare good.</v>

50
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Take this of the technique from watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mojo's video on the top 10 jump scares</v>

51
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a one two punch of a scary face and</v>

52
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>a loud noise and that's exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it jump scare.</v>

53
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>So effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a completely wrong way to</v>

54
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>analyze jump scares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important part is not the scare</v>

55
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the 30 seconds of buildup before</v>

56
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>the scare buildup is what separates the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good jump scare from the cheap one.</v>

57
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Here's a simple example from the sixth</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

58
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 1>the 10 opens at the top left of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame and moves to the bottom right</v>

59
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>along with the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This framing guides our eyes towards the</v>

60
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.790
<v Speaker 1>bottom right where a jump scare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>

61
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:29.624
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

62
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.733
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

63
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>This is a jump scare that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>require a fast cut or even any jarring</v>

64
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 1>movement to be scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the buildup from the slow camera</v>

65
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>movement that did the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare that to the laziest jump scare</v>

66
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad guys showing up through the</v>

67
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:45.694
<v Speaker 1>bathroom mirror.</v>

68
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

69
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no time for the buildup and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge cliche.</v>

70
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.180
<v Speaker 1>The predictable jump scare scenarios are</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving the whole technique of bad</v>

71
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:56.370
<v Speaker 1>reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best ones should go against our</v>

72
00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:58.260
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not appeal to them.</v>

73
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.220
<v Speaker 1>This jump scare and insidious feels so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh because we unconsciously expected</v>

74
00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:05.670
<v Speaker 1>the scared to come from the flashback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not from where she's telling the story.</v>

75
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this scene in jaws,</v>

76
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.170
<v Speaker 1>we expected the scariest part to be when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he found the tooth,</v>

77
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:18.270
<v Speaker 1>but there's actually something much</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse waiting.</v>

78
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

79
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>good jump scare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot like a magic trick.</v>

80
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>It's all about the showmanship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's use the prestige and a jump scare</v>

81
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>from the original poltergeist to outline</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea</v>

82
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 3>if magic trick consists of three parts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First part is called the pledge</v>

83
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 3>competition shows you some old Larry</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bird or Ma Pepsi all shipped to Japan.</v>

84
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Did you say you usually date real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.273
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

86
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.080
<v Speaker 3>Coach probably isn't too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second age is called the term</v>

87
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.380
<v Speaker 3>magician takes the old shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might just do salad.</v>

88
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.660
<v Speaker 3>You're looking for the secret,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you weren't falling because she</v>

89
00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:35.540
<v Speaker 3>cooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

90
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look to be full.</v>

91
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you wouldn't clap yet because making</v>

92
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:54.571
<v Speaker 3>something disappear isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to bring it back.</v>

93
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.153
<v Speaker 3>That's why</v>

94
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.870
<v Speaker 1>every magic trick I said Third Act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

95
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>this part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part we call press.</v>

96
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.083
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

97
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's face it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump scares usually suck,</v>

98
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.680
<v Speaker 1>but don't write them off just yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when used,</v>

99
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:16.510
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty great and don't worry,</v>

100
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I won't end this video with a jump scare</v>
<v Speaker 1>or will I?</v>

101
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>
