00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>In 1993 Steven Spielberg directed</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schindler's list.</v>

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>The film he considers the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his career.</v>

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>The movie shows his mastery of visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagery.</v>

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the most famous symbol in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie is the little girl in the red coat</v>

5
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>wandering aimlessly during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>liquidation of the Krakow ghetto.</v>

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg said she symbolizes how</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious the Holocaust was.</v>

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Yet nobody did anything to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always obvious as a little girl</v>

8
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>wearing a red coat walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>When he talks about the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he mentions the impact of having a color</v>

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>show up in the middle of a black and</v>
<v Speaker 1>white movie,</v>

11
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't mention the color itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which begs the question,</v>

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>why does red work so well in this scene?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If all that matters is having color show</v>

13
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>up in black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the symbolism wouldn't be the same if</v>

14
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>her coat was blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but blue drastically changes the feeling</v>

15
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>of the scene as would any other color.</v>

16
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Each color is packed with its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolism.</v>

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Filmmakers may not know all the nuances</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a colors,</v>

18
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>history and meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they understand each colors</v>

19
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>emotional payoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what symbolism is unique to the color</v>

20
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do some filmmakers make such</v>

21
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>pointed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Careful use of red.</v>

22
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>The color definitely has a very unusual</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological effect on humans.</v>

23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>It evokes all sorts of passionate</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

24
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>When we feel angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed,</v>

25
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>or flirtatious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we literally get red in the face.</v>

26
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>If two boxers of equal skill fight each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

27
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>the one in red is actually more likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to win.</v>

28
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Several studies suggest that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>color people look most attractive</v>

29
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's even an urban legend that red</v>

30
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>cars are more likely to get pulled over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red stands out amongst other colors,</v>

31
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>and filmmakers have always understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>this phenomenon.</v>

32
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>The screenwriters of the wizard of Oz</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to show off the beauty of</v>

33
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>technicolor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they had to change the plain silver</v>

34
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>slippers from the novel the sought after</v>
<v Speaker 1>and powerful slippers did not become</v>

35
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>emeralds green or bright yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One color suited them best.</v>

36
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>If something is important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read gets the job done on its own.</v>

37
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.700
<v Speaker 2>We use the color red to indicate</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything in the real world that has been</v>

38
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 2>tainted by the other world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And red is you specifically to connote</v>

39
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 2>really explosively emotional moments and</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

40
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>It's no surprise that red is mankind's</v>
<v Speaker 1>original color.</v>

41
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Not only was it the first color used in</v>
<v Speaker 1>art in cave paintings,</v>

42
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>but nearly every western language has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>name for it before any other color</v>

43
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>before Newton's rainbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Early philosophers put red in the middle</v>

44
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>of the color spectrum directly in</v>
<v Speaker 1>between black and white,</v>

45
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>so it's no surprise that many filmmakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an instinct to place black,</v>

46
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and red together.</v>

47
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>It seems like reducing the color</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum exponentially enhances the</v>

48
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>symbolic weight of these three colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snow White,</v>

49
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>the evil queen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed in black,</v>

50
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>the red apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think to really get at the meaning</v>

51
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>of such a unique and important color and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why a scene like in Schindler's list</v>

52
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>would use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to look at its historical</v>

53
00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The perception of color is not just a</v>

54
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>biological phenomenon but a cultural one</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's symbolic.</v>

55
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Power comes from two objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and blood,</v>

56
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>two elements always associated with red</v>
<v Speaker 1>and universally encountered by every</v>

57
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>society throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>

58
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>whenever a dictionary defines red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they typically use fire and blood in</v>

59
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>their explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between red and blood</v>

60
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since all living vertebraes,</v>

61
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>half dried blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the association of red with fire is</v>

62
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>less clear after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire isn't exactly read but more of an</v>

63
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>orange or yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we culturally link read it with</v>

64
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>the color of fire?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historians argue it's because many</v>

65
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>ancient societies soft fire as a living</v>
<v Speaker 1>being it's domestication was the</v>

66
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.320
<v Speaker 1>symbolic birth of civilization and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sun.</v>

67
00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It is a source of life by providing</v>
<v Speaker 1>light and heat.</v>

68
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Blood and fire were always at the center</v>
<v Speaker 1>of early religious traditions.</v>

69
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Animal blood sacrifices were thought to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead to good harvest and many beliefs.</v>

70
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Fire was passed down from the gods like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when prometheans stolen in Greek</v>

71
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>

72
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>A key component of these two elements is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there symbolism of both life and death.</v>

73
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>On one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire keeps you warm,</v>

74
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>protects you from predators and lights</v>
<v Speaker 1>up your home,</v>

75
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>but once it's out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire leads to death and destruction.</v>

76
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood is a source of human life,</v>

77
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>but the sight of blood indicates injury</v>
<v Speaker 1>and too much means death.</v>

78
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Christian stories clearly reflect our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient contradictory relationships with</v>

79
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>fire and blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one hand,</v>

80
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>God uses fire to communicate with Moses</v>
<v Speaker 1>three burning Bush,</v>

81
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>but fire also symbolizes the eternal</v>
<v Speaker 1>tormenting of hell,</v>

82
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>explaining why hell is always read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does represent Jesus as gruesome</v>

83
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>crucifixion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cardinals reappropriated that</v>

84
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>meaning it to something positive by</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing red as a symbol of Jesus's blood</v>

85
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Symbolism varies wildly depending on</v>

86
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>the time and place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it always ties back to these core</v>

87
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red is a symbol of love and passion,</v>

88
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>but it also became a symbol of</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitution and illicit sex in the</v>

89
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>middle ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing the pitfalls of too much passion</v>

90
00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>of getting too close to the flame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

91
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Red was the symbol of the French</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and from that on the color</v>

92
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>became a sign of extreme political</v>
<v Speaker 1>upheaval.</v>

93
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violet always passionate,</v>

94
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and filled with life.</v>

95
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a critic looks at read through the</v>

96
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Lens of its origins in fire in blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the symbolic power of red becomes</v>

97
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>much more obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many movies used red to tap into these</v>

98
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 1>powerful historical roots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red is heat.</v>

99
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It is a symbol of life and light in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise desolate and cold world.</v>

100
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 1>It adorns energetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youthful characters.</v>

101
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 1>What's Anderson gloves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It because injects visual life into his</v>

102
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Retta often sexualizes female characters</v>

103
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>echoing it's association with love and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lust,</v>

104
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.930
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes red goes to,</v>

105
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.760
<v Speaker 3>are you listening to me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neil,</v>

106
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.530
<v Speaker 3>what were you looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The woman in the red dress I was with</v>

107
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.373
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

108
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.400
<v Speaker 1>as much as red indicates life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just as easily signals death and</v>

109
00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:28.890
<v Speaker 1>horror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was one's passion becomes obsession</v>

110
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:32.640
<v Speaker 1>to the point of self destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No color better captures youth and</v>

111
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:36.600
<v Speaker 1>sexuality and the boys have a clockwork</v>
<v Speaker 1>orange represent this sexuality to a</v>

112
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:39.960
<v Speaker 1>dangerous extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes a red car is just an easy way</v>

113
00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:42.630
<v Speaker 1>to indicate speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sometimes goes deeper than that.</v>

114
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Cameron's dad loves his red car to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme more so than even his own son.</v>

115
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.250
<v Speaker 1>The Carton Boyz in the hood is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>illuming sign of death that appears out</v>

116
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there is no escape for</v>

117
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:54.870
<v Speaker 1>these characters gets reinforced in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening shot.</v>

118
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>An example of red as the color of</v>
<v Speaker 1>warning and danger movies also channeled</v>

119
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>the religious significance of the color</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mean streets.</v>

120
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Charlie holds his hand over flames in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of personal penance,</v>

121
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 1>a nod to his fear of the flames of hell.</v>

122
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>It's no coincidence that Tony's Bart is</v>
<v Speaker 1>bathed in red and indication at the</v>

123
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 1>place contains sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and violence.</v>

124
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world's Charlie wants to escape.</v>

125
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the most powerful use of red is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when filmmakers can juxtapose.</v>

126
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>It's positive and negative symbolism</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing the two kinds of red side by</v>

127
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ending of don't look now has a</v>

128
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>bizarre montage revealing the true</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity of the girl in the red coat.</v>

129
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Part of the horror of the finale is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrast of different classic red</v>

130
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That youthful coat followed by his</v>

131
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then sex and even a flames in a church.</v>

132
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>All these images mixed together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disorients the viewer through the</v>

133
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:45.161
<v Speaker 1>unusual pairings of Red Schindler's list</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly embodies all the symbolic uses</v>

134
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 1>of red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's origins in fire and blood.</v>

135
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>The religious significance developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>from pagan rituals all the way to</v>

136
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and the harnessing of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>colors,</v>

137
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:55.844
<v Speaker 1>dual meanings.</v>

138
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>The movie begins with the lighting of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>flame.</v>

139
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:01.250
<v Speaker 1>As a Jewish family celebrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sabbath color fades away when the</v>

140
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>fire goes out and the story descends</v>
<v Speaker 1>into Krakow,</v>

141
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Poland during World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right from the beginning,</v>

142
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:09.680
<v Speaker 1>the film establishes fire as a symbol of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish tradition and to the</v>

143
00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 1>extinguishing of the flame for shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of Jewish life in Poland,</v>

144
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 1>the recurring flames throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie symbolize both danger and life.</v>

145
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 1>In one scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg super imposes a burning flame</v>

146
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 1>on to Oskar Schindler's chests to</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolize his gradual transformation</v>

147
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>from a greedy businessman to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolent savior.</v>

148
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 1>The flames of his factory are a source</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life as he saves Jewish people from</v>

149
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>extermination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In contrast to the flames from the</v>

150
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>pressure of labor camp burn bright and</v>
<v Speaker 1>harsh in the foreground as the Nazis</v>

151
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>walk into the factory in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A reminder of the death and destruction</v>

152
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>they bring with them at their most</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme flames are associated with</v>

153
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 1>horrific mass graves.</v>

154
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.810
<v Speaker 1>But when Schindler invites his Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers to practice the sabbath,</v>

155
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 1>the flames become color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again in Schindler's factory,</v>

156
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:54.560
<v Speaker 1>the Jewish tradition can continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He provides light in a world surrounded</v>

157
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 1>by darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flames are at the same time a symbol of</v>

158
00:07:57.531 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 1>the Jewish people surviving and a symbol</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their destruction.</v>

159
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 1>In this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and death also go hand in hand</v>

160
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 1>with numerous executions and murders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once he uses blood in a more subtle</v>

161
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 1>but equally disturbing way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Nazis want to separate the</v>

162
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:12.980
<v Speaker 1>healthy from the sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of women in the camp apply their</v>

163
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>own blood as makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're using blood to try to appear</v>

164
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:18.770
<v Speaker 1>more alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a cruel irony that they have</v>

165
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>to bleed to look more lively so they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>intern.</v>

166
00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Avoid a bloody death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self harm is a form of self preservation</v>

167
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 1>in comparison to the rest of the movie.</v>

168
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>This moment may seem benign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it perfectly captures the absurdity</v>

169
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:33.050
<v Speaker 1>of the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How life and death were so disturbingly</v>

170
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>intertwined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blood is death and life all at once.</v>

171
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.140
<v Speaker 1>The red code is an incredible summation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all these ideas.</v>

172
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 1>On one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little girl is youth life and</v>

173
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:44.270
<v Speaker 1>innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The red calls attention to her fiery</v>

174
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:47.120
<v Speaker 1>warmth and young blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once she hides under the bed,</v>

175
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 1>her redcoat loses its color and we see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it later in a whole new deadly context.</v>

176
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>The code is now presumably red with</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood to be disposed of in Schindler's</v>

177
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the girl in the code are the story</v>

178
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>of the color red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are a story of death and life</v>

179
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>coexisting together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The red of Oskar Schindler is the bread</v>

180
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 1>of life surrounded by his red is the red</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Holocaust.</v>

181
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is life.</v>

182
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.700
<v Speaker 4>It's margins nice to company.</v>

183
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Not every instance of the color is as</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme as Schindler's list,</v>

184
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.850
<v Speaker 1>but an overt uses of read the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic principles apply.</v>

185
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.360
<v Speaker 1>It has a powerful and primal response</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the viewer coming from the human</v>

186
00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:31.840
<v Speaker 1>understanding of blood and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filmmakers don't necessarily have</v>

187
00:09:31.841 --> 00:09:34.780
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the actual symbolic history</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different colors,</v>

188
00:09:34.781 --> 00:09:36.970
<v Speaker 1>but the best ones definitely know how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it.</v>

189
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Long before directing artists understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strengths of different colors.</v>

190
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.870
<v Speaker 1>If a calvinist painter wanting to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>prominence to someone in their painting,</v>

191
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.530
<v Speaker 1>all they had to do was add a red sash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any artist can benefit from knowing the</v>

192
00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:50.330
<v Speaker 1>various strengths and weaknesses of each</v>
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>

193
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Olympia's on Yolie is an incredible</v>
