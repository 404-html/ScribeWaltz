1
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated with chess and movies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just because I played chess in</v>

2
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>middle school and competitively in high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and college.</v>

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Chess is so interesting because of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much meaning it can have in film,</v>

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.110
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphor,</v>

5
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:17.080
<v Speaker 1>or even a plot device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filmmakers love using the game to add to</v>

6
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>their stories in a way no other game</v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>So let's play teach y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If y'all want to lie,</v>

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

9
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 1>come on right in the middle of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic use of tests for an analogy,</v>

10
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>it's usually to associate something with</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients or precision,</v>

11
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picked my punches to take him down.</v>

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Pendants state sets up the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>character as a tress player and he</v>

13
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>references the game throughout film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>

14
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>strategical position to pieces and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the timing's right,</v>

15
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next step is to use chest to show</v>

16
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>somebody as smart.</v>

17
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And this is where filmmakers get clever</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2001 a space Odyssey House</v>

18
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:52.880
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is established in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to be humans in chess.</v>

19
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.300
<v Speaker 1>The importance of this scene is somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost on modern movie goers because</v>

20
00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>computers have been beating the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>chess players for the last 20 years,</v>

21
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 1>but in 1968 it showed that how was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only intelligent but very powerful.</v>

22
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the scene more closely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also foreshadows and important plot</v>

23
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When this super computer tells the human</v>

24
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>the better choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry frank,</v>

25
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I think you missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waned to bishop.</v>

26
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Bishop takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queen takes bishop night,</v>

27
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see the computer disagreeing with the</v>

28
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>human and making a better move for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing very subtly that the computer</v>

29
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>can conflict with and outsmart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hit this for shout as the plot quite</v>

30
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>nicely and sorry Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid I can't do that.</v>

31
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>How actually makes a mistake while</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the game,</v>

32
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>his suggestion queen to Bishop three is</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible in this position,</v>

33
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>so how does have the force checkmate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's declaring it incorrectly.</v>

34
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say this was either a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake on Kubrick's part or more.</v>

35
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick is very subtly foreshadowing</v>

36
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>house eventual breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Duel Between Hal and frank.</v>

37
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Poole brings me to my third point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chess books nicely to represent a battle</v>

38
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>between two people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This can be as discreet or symbolic as</v>

39
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Sherlock Holmes,</v>

40
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>the montage of the chess game with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual conflict makes the idea of pretty</v>

41
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a battle of wits,</v>

42
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>but the events of the game almost always</v>
<v Speaker 1>stands for something more.</v>

43
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Chess is a very versatile game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pixar made short with the entire plot</v>

44
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>revolving around a chest battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

45
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>it's popular to use chest to show a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person sacrifice.</v>

46
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the most literal instance of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Harry Potter.</v>

47
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Sherlock goes for a queen sacrifice in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his game directly.</v>

48
00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Mirroring Sherlock's plan to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>moriarty</v>

49
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 2>are winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strategy sometimes sacrifice</v>

50
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 1>to go one step further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even let the chest pieces</v>

51
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.830
<v Speaker 1>themselves serve as metaphors for what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the movie.</v>

52
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Mag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Needle fights with the powerful rook and</v>

53
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>night pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but professor x winds by sacrificing his</v>

54
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>powerful pieces and using his bonds to</v>
<v Speaker 1>checkmate.</v>

55
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 1>These moves reflect each player's</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>

56
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Magneto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strong pieces represent him fighting</v>

57
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 1>with mutans against the humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While professor x fights with the ponds</v>

58
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>showing his desire to work with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust the humans.</v>

59
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 1>This metaphor serves the movie nicely</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in chess,</v>

60
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 1>upon can actually mutate into a night or</v>
<v Speaker 1>rook,</v>

61
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>and this metaphor is further supported</v>
<v Speaker 1>when humans are referred to as ponds.</v>

62
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.303
<v Speaker 1>The exponent</v>

63
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 3>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poem scuffs.</v>

64
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I think chess metaphors are most</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful when they add to the story in</v>

65
00:03:08.691 --> 00:03:11.810
<v Speaker 1>the people versus Oj Simpson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shapiro and Johnny Carson both have</v>

66
00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:15.170
<v Speaker 1>chest sets in their offices during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode where they decide to make their</v>

67
00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:17.870
<v Speaker 1>defense arguments center around race in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one shot.</v>

68
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:19.490
<v Speaker 1>The chess set is right in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreground.</v>

69
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Here we see an obvious choice to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>this chest set as the focal point in the</v>

70
00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:24.830
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it may mean something.</v>

71
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Of course I hesitate to read too far</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this,</v>

72
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:30.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth noting that chess is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle between black and white pieces</v>

73
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.230
<v Speaker 1>and in the context of this scene about</v>
<v Speaker 1>black versus white people.</v>

74
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.710
<v Speaker 1>That makes for a powerful visual and</v>
<v Speaker 1>adds to the idea that this trial was a</v>

75
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:39.950
<v Speaker 1>battle centering on race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the perfect summation of all these</v>

76
00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:42.440
<v Speaker 1>techniques comes from this chest scene</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the TV show.</v>

77
00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:45.590
<v Speaker 1>The wire d essentially uses chest to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain the drug trade,</v>

78
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.700
<v Speaker 1>the Brookside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stash.</v>

79
00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:48.980
<v Speaker 1>The queen is the muscle and the king is</v>
<v Speaker 1>top dog.</v>

80
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.550
<v Speaker 1>He even goes so far as to naming the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces after actual people in their</v>

81
00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:54.230
<v Speaker 1>gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he ain't got no hustle,</v>

82
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of these motherfuckers on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chain,</v>

83
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.210
<v Speaker 1>they got his back when they run so deep,</v>

84
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.790
<v Speaker 3>he really ain't gotta do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like your uncle?</v>

85
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like mom.</v>

86
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 3>The Pantera</v>

87
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>described as the soldiers and in reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids are the soldiers in their</v>

88
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>gang and so they naturally identify with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ponds.</v>

89
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is what Wallace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His question is after he learns about</v>

90
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:13.804
<v Speaker 1>the pond,</v>

91
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 3>they liked the front lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be out in the field.</v>

92
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 3>So how do you get to be the king and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>liked that.</v>

93
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 3>See the Qing state of King.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

94
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Anything stay who he is</v>

95
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 1>as the ponds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always have to serve the king no</v>

96
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they get to the other side of</v>

97
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:30.604
<v Speaker 1>the board,</v>

98
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 3>catch the other dudes king and trap it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you would all right,</v>

99
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 3>but it will make it to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm top dog now,</v>

100
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:40.924
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it ain't like that</v>

101
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.650
<v Speaker 1>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learn about the drug trade and how</v>

102
00:04:42.651 --> 00:04:45.350
<v Speaker 1>its hierarchy is that strict as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of a board game.</v>

103
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.450
<v Speaker 1>No matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These characters are trapped in their</v>

104
00:04:47.451 --> 00:04:50.510
<v Speaker 1>roles with no way to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get sacrificed for the king and no</v>

105
00:04:50.511 --> 00:04:53.300
<v Speaker 1>matter how they play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never get to be in charge ponds.</v>

106
00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Man</v>

107
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.840
<v Speaker 3>in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get cab quick,</v>

108
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.080
<v Speaker 3>maybe out of the game early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less they some smart ass poems</v>

109
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.480
<v Speaker 1>and movies that use to most games is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional.</v>

110
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Bingo is there to establish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in a retirement home.</v>

111
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.360
<v Speaker 1>If you're playing dungeons and dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters are stereotyped as nerdy,</v>

112
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.820
<v Speaker 1>but with chest there's almost always</v>
<v Speaker 1>more to analyze,</v>

113
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>so get out there and make a move.</v>

114
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.200
<v Speaker 4>That's his majesty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>King is playing chess.</v>

115
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 4>Chess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

116
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.070
<v Speaker 4>thanks for</v>
<v Speaker 4>slightly just a bit of a break from the</v>

117
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 4>norm.</v>
