1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's do a psychology experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's show our audience has seen</v>

2
00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:07.090
<v Speaker 1>consisting of eight shots in the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tells is suspicious,</v>

3
00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:10.420
<v Speaker 1>but a little ambiguous and open to</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of girls in her</v>

4
00:00:10.421 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a guy walks suspiciously past her</v>

5
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:14.770
<v Speaker 1>window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes outside to check it out.</v>

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>After the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ask our audience a couple open ended</v>

7
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:19.360
<v Speaker 1>questions and see what they think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

8
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>How did it make them feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they like it?</v>

9
00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Did they not like it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff like that.</v>

10
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Now let's show that same video to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different audience,</v>

11
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>but change one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror every shot,</v>

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 1>so now any movement left to right</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes right to left.</v>

13
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does this edit change anything?</v>

14
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Just character direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect how the audience perceives the</v>

15
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 1>character or the entire scene as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

16
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>The answer is yes and a lot more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

17
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>but why does it matter which way he</v>
<v Speaker 1>went?</v>

18
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>To understand why direction change is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

19
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>We have to talk about the three axes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

20
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>There are three directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Onscreen of character can move right and</v>

21
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:58.520
<v Speaker 1>left up and down and forward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>backward the direction a character moves</v>

22
00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>matters in a scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving towards the camera shows power</v>

23
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 1>domination and aggression and moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>away shows weakness.</v>

24
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters being looked down on appear</v>

25
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>weak and high up characters are much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more dominant.</v>

26
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Rabbi you</v>
<v Speaker 1>our these two explanations make sense.</v>

27
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone low and far away from the camera</v>

28
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>will be perceived differently from</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone high up and close,</v>

29
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

30
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>the final character movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lateral movement going from right to</v>

31
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>left is a lot less obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes one side of the screen</v>

32
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>different from the other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does movement right to left matter?</v>

33
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.110
<v Speaker 1>The answer comes from time and language</v>
<v Speaker 1>in western culture.</v>

34
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Left to right indicates the progression</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time our language reads from left to</v>

35
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Books began from the left and finished.</v>

36
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Once we get to the right in video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play your start on the left side and</v>

37
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 1>finished the level on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On any line.</v>

38
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Graph time increases as we move right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our everyday life.</v>

39
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Movement towards the right indicates</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

40
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>progress and normality and movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the left indicates moving back</v>

41
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:58.520
<v Speaker 1>in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abnormality and regression from this</v>

42
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.760
<v Speaker 1>thinking came the theory amongst film</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars that people will interpret left</v>

43
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>to right movement as more natural and</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal than right to left movement</v>

44
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>because of how our brains naturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>process moving images and this idea of</v>

45
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>time and normality in left to right</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement gets applied in a variety of</v>

46
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

47
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the rings maintains its left to</v>
<v Speaker 1>right movement during the journey from</v>

48
00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:17.720
<v Speaker 1>the Shyer to mount doom.</v>

49
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Left right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movement is maintained during the big</v>

50
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.750
<v Speaker 1>travel shots and it's a subtle visual to</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate the clear goal to reach a</v>

51
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:26.870
<v Speaker 1>specific destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare that clear objective to the last</v>

52
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 1>scene in full metal jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It consists of two shots,</v>

53
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 1>one shot of soldiers moving left to</v>
<v Speaker 1>right past burning buildings,</v>

54
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.750
<v Speaker 1>and another shot of them moving right to</v>
<v Speaker 1>left with burning buildings still in the</v>

55
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>background to be abrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lateral direction change makes it look</v>

56
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 1>as if they randomly switched directions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gives the implication of the</v>

57
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>soldiers are wandering aimlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanley Kubrick uses lateral direction</v>

58
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>change to make some commentary about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>army's unclear objectives and perhaps</v>

59
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 1>commentary on the Vietnam war as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

60
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Lateral character movement can also tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story in one scene,</v>

61
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:57.590
<v Speaker 1>in full metal jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers move to the right towards some</v>

62
00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>combat zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Offscreen and wounded soldiers get</v>

63
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>carried away from the combat zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving from the right side to the left,</v>

64
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a subtle visual reinforcement</v>
<v Speaker 1>here that were the soldiers headed.</v>

65
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Offscreen is where men get brought back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wounded it.</v>

66
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>This lateral technique is similarly done</v>
<v Speaker 1>subtly in platoon and saving private</v>

67
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:13.414
<v Speaker 1>Ryan.</v>

68
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

69
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.570
<v Speaker 1>What you can do so left to right is</v>
<v Speaker 1>observed as positive,</v>

70
00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:35.090
<v Speaker 1>progressive and normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least that's what many film</v>

71
00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:37.640
<v Speaker 1>theorists assumed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only in the last five years or so</v>

72
00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:40.400
<v Speaker 1>that researchers started empirically</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing lateral movement.</v>

73
00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:43.040
<v Speaker 1>In 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cleveland State University conducted an</v>

74
00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:46.220
<v Speaker 1>experiment by showing a sequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight shots to a group of people.</v>

75
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.680
<v Speaker 1>They showed the exact same shots to</v>
<v Speaker 1>another group of people,</v>

76
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:51.680
<v Speaker 1>but reversed all left to right movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>to right to left movement.</v>

77
00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Each group answered several specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and several open ended ones.</v>

78
00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:58.430
<v Speaker 1>About how they felt after watching the</v>
<v Speaker 1>results confirmed what many film</v>

79
00:03:58.431 --> 00:04:01.070
<v Speaker 1>theorists had assumed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but had never had any hard evidence to</v>

80
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:04.850
<v Speaker 1>prove the experimenters analyzed open</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended questions for key words.</v>

81
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.490
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 point eight percent of responders</v>

82
00:04:07.491 --> 00:04:08.690
<v Speaker 1>used anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>

83
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.670
<v Speaker 1>uneasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspenseful to describe the video.</v>

84
00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 1>And 11 point nine percent said fearful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frightened,</v>

85
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:13.700
<v Speaker 1>or scared.</v>

86
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.820
<v Speaker 1>The most statistically significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between the two groups was</v>

87
00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:19.070
<v Speaker 1>what the experimenters called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative effect.</v>

88
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Similar phrases including didn't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clip,</v>

89
00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:22.460
<v Speaker 1>liked the clip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

90
00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:23.330
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

91
00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:25.190
<v Speaker 1>boring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and strong and weak were the phrases</v>

92
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:27.260
<v Speaker 1>that different the most between the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

93
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.830
<v Speaker 1>So for the left to right video members</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently used words like good,</v>

94
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.170
<v Speaker 1>interesting and strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the ones who saw or right to left</v>

95
00:04:33.171 --> 00:04:34.610
<v Speaker 1>use words like bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boring,</v>

96
00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:37.250
<v Speaker 1>and weak audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived left to right movement</v>

97
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.710
<v Speaker 1>positively and right to left movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>negatively.</v>

98
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.670
<v Speaker 1>This study provides a huge opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>for filmmakers by something as simple as</v>

99
00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 1>switching character movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A director can instill a negative or</v>

100
00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:49.070
<v Speaker 1>positive emotional response on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>

101
00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:51.980
<v Speaker 1>but it seems some directors have already</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught onto this difference in left to</v>

102
00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:55.010
<v Speaker 1>right and right to left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going as far back as Alfred Hitchcock,</v>

103
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Alfred Hitchcock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stranger on a train opens with the</v>

104
00:04:57.441 --> 00:05:01.040
<v Speaker 1>protagonist and antagonist showing only</v>
<v Speaker 1>their feet and legs walking.</v>

105
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.610
<v Speaker 1>They walk towards each other as if to</v>
<v Speaker 1>imply their paths will eventually cross.</v>

106
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.120
<v Speaker 1>If our study is true and left to right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement is perceived as more positive</v>

107
00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:10.490
<v Speaker 1>than right to left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then this opening scene has already</v>

108
00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:14.240
<v Speaker 1>subconsciously established that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to left character is an antagonist</v>

109
00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:16.430
<v Speaker 1>and the left to right character is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonist,</v>

110
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.130
<v Speaker 1>so not only can left right indicate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>progression of time,</v>

111
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Speaker 1>it can even indicate something positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>or negative.</v>

112
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Roger Ebert fully supported the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself as he explains in his 2008</v>

113
00:05:25.551 --> 00:05:28.790
<v Speaker 1>article how to read a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Ebert goes further to say even the</v>

114
00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:32.270
<v Speaker 1>left and right sides of the screen are</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived as either more positive or</v>

115
00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:34.310
<v Speaker 1>more negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I character on the right fields more</v>

116
00:05:34.311 --> 00:05:37.010
<v Speaker 1>positive and in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the one on the left seems weaker,</v>

117
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:39.650
<v Speaker 1>perhaps more sinister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a common recurring theme,</v>

118
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good left bad,</v>

119
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.040
<v Speaker 1>and various filmmakers use this</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>

120
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Still smarting from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

121
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.940
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

122
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Infinity Ebert</v>

123
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>makes the claim that these conventions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of right and left extend beyond our</v>

124
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 1>language and culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says that in all his years of</v>

125
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>watching movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian cinema uses similar left versus</v>

126
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>right techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the study supported this belief,</v>

127
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>religious belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right or left hand numbness and race all</v>

128
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>did not significantly affect the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience's perception of lateral</v>

129
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:11.151
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

130
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>there are no absolutes in filmmaking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes what's contrary to the rule</v>

131
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>works just as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way,</v>

132
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.700
<v Speaker 1>this study shows that there really is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between left and right in the</v>

133
00:06:18.701 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only so recently that any empirical</v>

134
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>testing on film techniques has actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>been conducted.</v>

135
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Roger Ebert claims while convincing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're only speculation at the time,</v>

136
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>but have now been proven to an extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I contacted Cleveland State University,</v>

137
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>the ones who publish this study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're still currently conducting</v>

138
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing film theories on audience</v>

139
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 1>members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really exciting to see that even</v>

140
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>after 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still learning new things about</v>

141
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was.</v>

142
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>One speculation has now been followed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with concrete evidence,</v>

143
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>so the next time a character crosses the</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

144
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.563
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself,</v>

145
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.940
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to clarify the video experiment</v>

146
00:06:56.941 --> 00:06:58.950
<v Speaker 1>that I show isn't the original video</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

147
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.540
<v Speaker 1>The original one hasn't been published</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

148
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.730
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't been posted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they published the article.</v>

149
00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:04.320
<v Speaker 1>They haven't posted the video that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>used,</v>

150
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.390
<v Speaker 1>so I just took what they talked about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the article and I recreated it.</v>

151
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.600
<v Speaker 1>I encourage you guys to look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original article.</v>

152
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.550
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes very in depth.</v>

153
00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Talks about things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't talk about Lincoln in the</v>

154
00:07:13.441 --> 00:07:14.640
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

155
00:07:14.641 --> 00:07:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I talk about film theorists in the video</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't refer to specific names,</v>

156
00:07:18.241 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>but really I'm referring to coolest</v>
<v Speaker 1>shop.</v>

157
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.110
<v Speaker 1>He's the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing all this film theory</v>

158
00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:23.520
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the seventies.</v>

159
00:07:23.521 --> 00:07:27.270
<v Speaker 1>He was coming up with these three axes</v>
<v Speaker 1>of movement theory and how people</v>

160
00:07:27.271 --> 00:07:30.330
<v Speaker 1>interpret movement in film and so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage you to look him up.</v>

161
00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:32.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to add some of his writing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the description as well.</v>

162
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Thanks guys.</v>
