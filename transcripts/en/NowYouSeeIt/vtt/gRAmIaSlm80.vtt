00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.200
<v Speaker 1>This is a hub us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Darla,</v>

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>y'all can't be seen in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Behind every memorable character is a</v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>meticulously chosen wardrobe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether the costume is extremely flashy</v>

4
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>or completely blends in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costume design provides an amazing</v>

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to give us insight into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>character and the world around them</v>

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>because just like in the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you wear says a lot about you.</v>

7
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm always said there's an awful lot you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell about it.</v>

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Posting by those shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take a look at costume design</v>

9
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>as a tool for filmmakers to tell their</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>In many of cinemas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important movies,</v>

11
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>costume designers are the secret heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who immerse us within a world</v>

12
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>seamlessly and effectively without</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting nearly the same recognition as</v>

13
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>actors or directors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get sketching the plus to hod</v>

14
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>dialing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word costume invariably gets</v>

15
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>associated with how the wean dress up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pretending to be somebody else.</v>

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that's the function of</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothing.</v>

17
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:49.704
<v Speaker 1>In a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

18
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>didn't pick a moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the majority of costume design</v>

19
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>operates on completely opposite</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>

20
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Their goal is to create authentic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic people on the screen.</v>

21
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Not Actors playing dress up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

22
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not a costume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costume design is an added layer towards</v>

23
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>the immersive magic of film period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clothing is meant to place you in the</v>

24
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>time period of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gone with the wind is famous for its</v>

25
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>engaging costume design of while there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is some 1930s flare in the hairstyle,</v>

26
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>the clothes still manage to immerse the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience in the civil war era and</v>

27
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:22.410
<v Speaker 1>accurately reflect scarlet's fall from</v>
<v Speaker 1>grace.</v>

28
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>The way she designs her own clothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>also serves as a nice metaphor for the</v>

29
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>need to literally and figuratively</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconstruct herself after the war.</v>

30
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>At its best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costume design is a vital layer of world</v>

31
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>building and it works well in totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign places.</v>

32
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>When people talk about the original star</v>
<v Speaker 1>wars,</v>

33
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>they usually praise the plot characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>or special effects with the costume</v>

34
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>design was also fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It combines what we're used to seeing</v>

35
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>with the completely alien princess</v>
<v Speaker 1>layers.</v>

36
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Costume design is right in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking like she's from a foreign planet</v>

37
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>and looking like royalty as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>

38
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>And all the designs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the robots,</v>

39
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>generals and soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their wardrobe is alien enough to</v>

40
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>transport us to an exciting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>different worlds,</v>

41
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>but familiar enough to keep us grounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while we already understand our</v>

42
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>immersive costuming is more difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you may think edith had the winner</v>

43
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>of eight Oscars for costume design and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inspiration for edna mode designed</v>

44
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>for many movies taking place in present</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

45
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>So she just dressed her characters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the style of her time.</v>

46
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Problem is by the time the movie was</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>

47
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>edited and released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the style would change and the dresses</v>

48
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>became tacky.</v>

49
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>So she had to anticipate the future and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make something look modern but not tied</v>

50
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>down to a specific trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was one of the first to address</v>

51
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's still shows up today,</v>

52
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>striking the balance between looking too</v>
<v Speaker 1>dated or too generic.</v>

53
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>So a movie made in the 70s might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>generic costuming,</v>

54
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but a movie about the seventies embraces</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old school style to bring about the</v>

55
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia of a loss time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why eight mile looks like you could</v>

56
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>have taken place at any time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rappers look ridiculous in their</v>

57
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>music videos that came out the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

58
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Fashion is not the primary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The primary effort in motion pictures is</v>

59
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>to tell a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plane hoodie works as a blank slate,</v>

60
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>emphasizing mnms quest to succeed purely</v>
<v Speaker 1>on talent and nothing flashy while also</v>

61
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>attention on his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

62
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>costuming is supposed to compliment the</v>
<v Speaker 1>style of your film,</v>

63
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>whether you're going for realism or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something more flashy.</v>

64
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Along with our immersion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many costume choices are to make</v>

65
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>characters stand out of their worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willy Wonka's introduction takes place</v>

66
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>over 30 minutes into the movie and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>praise always goes to gene wilder is</v>

67
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>amazing performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also an example of great</v>

68
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>costume design while all the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters dressing clothing stylized</v>

69
00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>from the late 18 hundreds or as cowboys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other characatures won because</v>

70
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>wardrobe is a hybrid of the Victorian</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacket tail.</v>

71
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>And buttoning of the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the collar and color scheme all</v>

72
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>embody the style of the 1970s so we get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a character who visually stands out as</v>

73
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>both out of his world and ahead of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

74
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>The costuming in the remake emphasizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the out of this world part,</v>

75
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 1>but it has no grip in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it makes him seem more like a cartoon</v>

76
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>caricature than an out of touch</v>
<v Speaker 1>visionary Bonnie and Clyde takes place</v>

77
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>in the 1930s but their style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wardrobe and obsession with the media</v>

78
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>put them right into the 1960s it helps</v>
<v Speaker 1>make them appear antiestablishment much</v>

79
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>like the young people in the real worlds</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the making of this film in 1967</v>

80
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Michael Corleone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's his military uniform to stand</v>

81
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>out amongst the classy gangster suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as he gets sucked into the life,</v>

82
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>his clothing makes the appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>transition for gangsters.</v>

83
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Wardrobe indicates a transition into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mafia.</v>

84
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>This example of costume design actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>does play into the initial concept of</v>

85
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>wearing a costume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gangster gets new attire to try to</v>

86
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>fit into high society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no matter what they stand out as</v>

87
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many movies you can tell they aren't</v>

88
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>really high society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just playing dress up</v>

89
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.993
<v Speaker 2>gangster</v>

90
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.850
<v Speaker 1>like other gangsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walter White place dress up to help him</v>

91
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 1>feel like a gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually he becomes the gangster.</v>

92
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:39.510
<v Speaker 1>He was only imitating before costumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give us insight into the character</v>

93
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 1>wearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luke skywalker's wardrobe has the visual</v>

94
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:44.850
<v Speaker 1>aesthetic of martial arts gear implying</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's undergoing training.</v>

95
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Obi wan Kenobi is dressed like a monk</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's doing the teaching in the</v>

96
00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>force awakens the roles that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>reversed and so have the costume</v>

97
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new teacher,</v>

98
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.540
<v Speaker 1>new students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoes and the opening of strangers</v>

99
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>on a train tell us which character is</v>
<v Speaker 1>more well off and which character is</v>

100
00:04:57.961 --> 00:04:59.820
<v Speaker 1>more of an every man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may just be me,</v>

101
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:02.100
<v Speaker 1>but the black and white shoes looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat menacing.</v>

102
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 1>They really stand out in the frame by</v>
<v Speaker 1>being so bright and flashy.</v>

103
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Tyler durden is costume design in fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>club always contrast the color Palette</v>

104
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>of the setting and other characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like he isn't supposed to be</v>

105
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:12.540
<v Speaker 1>there in the first place.</v>

106
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Along with actor personality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

107
00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>color scheme and costume design is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive and effective way to make a</v>

108
00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>character stand out or blend in in 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>days of summer.</v>

109
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:24.150
<v Speaker 1>The opening title sequence establishes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wardrobe color for the two</v>

110
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:26.670
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown for Tom and blue for summer.</v>

111
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coloring shifts around them.</v>

112
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.650
<v Speaker 1>When summer enters Tom's world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the setting is colored Brown.</v>

113
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.380
<v Speaker 1>While summer's world is blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dance sequence has all the actors</v>

114
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:37.620
<v Speaker 1>dressed in blue to represent Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about summer costume coloring</v>

115
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:40.230
<v Speaker 1>gives us mental cues as to how the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>is progressing.</v>

116
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.680
<v Speaker 1>And by the end of the movie we realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>their colors don't mix and they part</v>

117
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movies become classics when all of the</v>

118
00:05:45.841 --> 00:05:48.150
<v Speaker 1>production elements come together to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make something great.</v>

119
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.520
<v Speaker 1>And that includes costuming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you look back at your favorite</v>

120
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:51.900
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about what they're wearing.</v>

121
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>And of course remember the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important rule of costume design,</v>

122
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.700
<v Speaker 1>not kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

124
00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.380
<v Speaker 3>slightly trends full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a bit of a break from the norm,</v>

125
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.730
<v Speaker 3>just a little slot in the break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The monotony of all that.</v>
