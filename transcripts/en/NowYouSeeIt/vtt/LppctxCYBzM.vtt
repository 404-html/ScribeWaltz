1
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard somebody say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't watch black and white movies,</v>

2
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because some of the most important</v>

3
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>movies are in black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because black and white can do just</v>

4
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not more than color.</v>

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>The best place to prove this point is</v>
<v Speaker 1>film noir,</v>

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>a style of filmmaking that continues to</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence modern cinematography</v>

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including breaking bad,</v>

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>but I'm getting ahead of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to focus on film the war as a</v>

9
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>style to make the case for black and</v>
<v Speaker 1>white film making.</v>

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>The first question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is film noir?</v>

11
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't think it requires a</v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete definition because it's</v>

12
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:44.590
<v Speaker 1>something you can feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in modern parodies by saying,</v>

13
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>I see what this is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago know the conversation that</v>

14
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>predictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only one.</v>

15
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I can tell what you're going to do next.</v>

16
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Maybe my favorite parody of the style is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calvin and Hobbes.</v>

17
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Comic Strip can perfectly embodied the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematography of film noir,</v>

18
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>the contrast of light and black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white trail of cigarette smoke,</v>

19
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>the long shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dramatic morally ambiguous</v>

20
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's unpack that to start.</v>

21
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's consider black and white on Rob</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snl parodied Casa Blanca recently and</v>

22
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:14.840
<v Speaker 1>shot in black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid.</v>

23
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>They are parenting this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See notice a difference in the look of</v>

24
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>each shot in the snl sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The contrast is extremely low.</v>

25
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>If I take a sample of the darkest shade</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the shot and compare it to the</v>

26
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>lightest shade in the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see there isn't much difference</v>

27
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare that difference to the</v>

28
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>difference in Casa Blanca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The darkest shade on screen is nearly</v>

29
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the brightest shade on screen is</v>

30
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>nearly white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This dynamic range of shading makes for</v>

31
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>a more interesting shot composition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really showcases how black and white</v>

32
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>can make such an interesting look with</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher contrast.</v>

33
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm comparing Casa Blanca to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sketch comedy TV show,</v>

34
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>but it does show how black and white Kim</v>
<v Speaker 1>look boring and I think a lot of people</v>

35
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>see black and white this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see the beauty of black and white</v>

36
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>in an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a stock photo in color of a</v>

37
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>stage picture that's got the film noir</v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

38
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's try de Saturating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Upping the contrast and adding some</v>

39
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now look at it.</v>

40
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>The background is it distracting from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject.</v>

41
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>The shadows from the blinds are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced,</v>

42
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>more focus is placed on her facial</v>
<v Speaker 1>features like lips and eyebrows.</v>

43
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>The simplicity of black and white means</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the I can observe more key features</v>

44
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>in the shock colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

45
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes simple is better in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>age of color.</v>

46
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Filmmakers going for that noir feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have two options.</v>

47
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>The first is mimic in our budding color.</v>

48
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Blast the screen with bright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vibrant colors to give the same level of</v>

49
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>contrast and aesthetic as black and</v>
<v Speaker 1>white movies,</v>

50
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>or do the opposite film in color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but make the coloring so monochromatic</v>

51
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>that it almost looks black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see this in many gritty movies</v>

52
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>like seven inbound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white filming emphasizes</v>

53
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it can be used for visual</v>

54
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The classic blind shot shows a character</v>

55
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>that is literally dark and light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lighting is filmed in extremes.</v>

56
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>One side of the character is brightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>lit.</v>

57
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>The other side is completely black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got a good side and a dark side.</v>

58
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>You may not actively acknowledged these</v>
<v Speaker 1>details,</v>

59
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>but they subtly remind the viewer</v>
<v Speaker 1>through lighting that the character</v>

60
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>might have a dark side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least it makes the scene much more</v>

61
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>threatening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black and white film making gave cinema</v>

62
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>these techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still see them in color and they work</v>

63
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but black and white has a much stronger</v>

64
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>look because of the contrast.</v>

65
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>This sequence in breaking bad screams</v>
<v Speaker 1>film noir.</v>

66
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>If I make this black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could even confuse it as an old</v>

67
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>flick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying breaking bad should have</v>

68
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>been filmed in black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I am saying is that breaking</v>

69
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:18.800
<v Speaker 1>bad's gorgeous cinematography owes</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself to the techniques that shine the</v>

70
00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>strongest in black and white movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually breaking bad has filmed noir</v>

71
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>lighting everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blinds,</v>

72
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>the good side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dark side,</v>

73
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>high contrast and smoking smoke looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous in a black and white movie.</v>

74
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>The movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Big Combo shows all the beauty of</v>

75
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>black and white in this shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silhouettes,</v>

76
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>smoke high contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks fantastic.</v>

77
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to convince somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white has merrick,</v>

78
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>give them a movie that shows off what</v>
<v Speaker 1>high contrast and low key lighting can</v>

79
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show them a film noir,</v>

80
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>strong lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong blacks,</v>

81
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>strong picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Scott,</v>

82
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>the thing or the blacks are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

83
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:51.214
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really</v>

84
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.703
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>

85
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Slightly full.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a bit of a break from the norm.</v>

86
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Just to break the monotony of all that.</v>
