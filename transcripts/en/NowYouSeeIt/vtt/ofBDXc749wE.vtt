00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.270
<v Speaker 1>In 1922 Soviet filmmakers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iga bear 12 wrote about his hatred of dw</v>

2
00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Griffith and other popular directors at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time for making movies that he</v>

3
00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:09.670
<v Speaker 1>called carbon copies of novels in</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater.</v>

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.330
<v Speaker 1>The camera is a boring objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spectator watching the action unfolds</v>

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>and there must be a plot relate to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer with title cards.</v>

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.240
<v Speaker 1>He calls it leprose mortally dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and contagious.</v>

7
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.160
<v Speaker 1>His response was a man with a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>

8
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 1>a documentary that changed the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>people made movies forever.</v>

9
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>The caber becomes a character in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie showing us how we pulls off his</v>

10
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>different shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made strides in slow motion,</v>

11
00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Speaker 1>double exposure and split screens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes his goal very clear in the</v>

12
00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>title sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No sets,</v>

13
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>no actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no scripts,</v>

14
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>no title cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the absolute language of cinema on</v>

15
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>the basis of its complete separation</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the language of theater and the</v>

16
00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 1>novel and it's in this way of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he used the then experimental Dutch</v>

17
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.650
<v Speaker 1>angle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shows him several times in the</v>

18
00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:49.840
<v Speaker 1>movie along with the other camera</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovations.</v>

19
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.970
<v Speaker 1>And while he was not the first to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch angle,</v>

20
00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 1>he knew exactly how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch angle exploded in the 90s and</v>

21
00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.470
<v Speaker 1>early two thousands appearing just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere from action movies to soak</v>

22
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 1>commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem comes from using the shot as</v>

23
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:03.880
<v Speaker 1>a crutch to make a boring shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

24
00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Just tilt the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Battlefield Earth was over 90% Dutch</v>

25
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 1>angles as Roger Ebert put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The director,</v>

26
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Roger Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has learned from better films that</v>

27
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>directors sometimes tilt their cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has not learned why the tradition</v>

28
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>goes right up to four in 2011 director</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenneth Brando says he was going for a</v>

29
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:22.600
<v Speaker 1>comic book look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's more to looking like</v>

30
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 1>a comic book than adding Dutch angles to</v>
<v Speaker 1>half the movie.</v>

31
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I also can't help but find it kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheesy when it's used to make the</v>

32
00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>villains crooked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's probably because of where</v>

33
00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>that idea first came from.</v>

34
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 1>The dynamic joe at the school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to say is these movies</v>

35
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:38.950
<v Speaker 1>don't capture the spirit of the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important movie for Dutch</v>

36
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 1>angles is arguably the cabinet of Dr</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caligari in 1920 the movie was years</v>

37
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>ahead of American cinema at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible use of shadows and</v>

38
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angular set pieces and twist.</v>

39
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Ending brought expressionism from</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature and paintings to the big</v>

40
00:01:51.851 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This daring German style quickly found</v>

41
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:57.350
<v Speaker 1>its way into American cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The extreme lighting defined the film</v>

42
00:01:57.351 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>noir and the horror elements found their</v>
<v Speaker 1>way into all kinds of blockbusters.</v>

43
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 2>I had a quad strong German and crunch by</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking up the poop.</v>

44
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 2>A is burned it</v>

45
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>fluence goes right up to Tim Burton set</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces and character design.</v>

46
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>He never directly sites German</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

47
00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>but there's no doubt his work screams</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressionism and even he mixes in the</v>

48
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Dutch angle and his expressionistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

49
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I like when you sit to exaggerate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mundane like losing your bicycle.</v>

50
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>The most crucial aspect of the cabinet</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Dr Caligari is the introduction of</v>

51
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>subjective filmmaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This movie was the first twist ending in</v>

52
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>film history when Francis is actually in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an insane asylum and his experiences are</v>

53
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>delusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie presents its world in a</v>

54
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>subjective way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we see is not reality,</v>

55
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>but actually the subjective experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the narrator.</v>

56
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.860
<v Speaker 1>So all the movie doesn't have explicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera tilts.</v>

57
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>The tilting of the set and the tilting</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the narrative introduces the idea</v>

58
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>that movies can be hyper realistic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than filming traditional set</v>

59
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movies can be subjective,</v>

60
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>so really the Dutch angle arises out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>two movements,</v>

61
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet experimental documentary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>German expressionism.</v>

62
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>One movement introduced the innovative</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera techniques focusing entirely on</v>

63
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>the cinematic aspects and the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on how the theatrical and</v>

64
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>artistic elements could be subjective</v>
<v Speaker 1>and unique.</v>

65
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the perfect use of the Dutch angle</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes into third man and incredible</v>

66
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Nawar about the black market in post</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War II Vienna,</v>

67
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>the landscape of Vienna is the German</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressionist vision come to life with</v>

68
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>its Jari angles and rooms landscape.</v>

69
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>You can't help but notice the</v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities in the crooked ruins of</v>

70
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Vienna and the bizarre set pieces of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cabinet of Dr Caligari in the third man,</v>

71
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>the camera itself acts as another tilt</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the already crooked world of post</v>

72
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>World War II vianna and sometimes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera doesn't even need to tell because</v>

73
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>the street does it by itself within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame lines of all sorts of angles.</v>

74
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Add to the angle created from the camera</v>
<v Speaker 1>tilts.</v>

75
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch angle contributes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distortion already on screen giving</v>

76
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>cinema a way of adding uncertainty that</v>
<v Speaker 1>no other art form can do,</v>

77
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>not in theater and not in the novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the crooked angles do more than</v>

78
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 1>enhance the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During Holly's questioning of each</v>

79
00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>witness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crooked angles make their</v>

80
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>confessions feel a bit off and reminds</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never to be quite sure who to</v>

81
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During Harry's monologue,</v>

82
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>the ferris wheel tilts while the camera</v>
<v Speaker 1>holds steady creatively integrating</v>

83
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Dutch angles into the shot.</v>

84
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 1>If fits nicely with Harry's personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>as his dialogue quickly switches from</v>

85
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>playful justin to threatening murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

86
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.330
<v Speaker 1>so look for a bullet wound up to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

87
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>The crooked vianna landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambiguous characters,</v>

88
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>extreme lighting and plot twist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>echo the design of German expressionism</v>

89
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>in the experimentation of the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>

90
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a movie begging to have Dutch</v>
<v Speaker 1>angles.</v>

91
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Many more recent movies used to shot in</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar ways and die hard villain.</v>

92
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Hans Gruber pretend he's just a civilian</v>
<v Speaker 1>during his back and forth with John</v>

93
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>mcclane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every shot is at least a little bit</v>

94
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>tilted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This medium shot on Hans is the most</v>

95
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>tilted in the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His shadow is long and exaggerated.</v>

96
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>The camera is off center and the tension</v>
<v Speaker 1>is perfect.</v>

97
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>As soon as John mcclane gives them a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun,</v>

98
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>the seem feels just like the third man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch angle tilt adds to the</v>

99
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty of the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know something and we're not sure</v>

100
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>John McLean has any idea and for all we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know he could get killed any second.</v>

101
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I prefer this reveal over lameness</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so obvious in Lima's</v>

102
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 1>they're villains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch angle feels forced.</v>

103
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 1>The shots seems to fit better in moments</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tension and uncertainty when things</v>

104
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>aren't as they should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no coincidence that a movie with</v>

105
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.530
<v Speaker 1>many great Dutch angles is called</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

106
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.540
<v Speaker 3>I liked the way they make you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been a bit of controversy about</v>

107
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 3>them as people feel that they call too</v>
<v Speaker 3>much attention to themselves.</v>

108
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.800
<v Speaker 3>But actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

109
00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:21.830
<v Speaker 3>I just watch all the movies that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>filled with Dutch angles and you don't</v>

110
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:23.480
<v Speaker 3>realize it because they use them so</v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

111
00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:25.130
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't particularly mean anything.</v>

112
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>And even all these years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movies with well thought out Dutch</v>

113
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:33.301
<v Speaker 1>angles still have the expressionism then</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in back of the same apartment</v>

114
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>buildings with these German</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressionistic alleys and they also</v>

115
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>have the experimentation</v>

116
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.070
<v Speaker 3>in a producer's came in and said lucky</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I also got to shoot it four square</v>

117
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 3>in case this doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which I certainly couldn't blame them</v>

118
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 3>for doing what I ended up liking it very</v>
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>

119
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 3>They even put it in the trailer.</v>

120
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.490
<v Speaker 1>The kind of Dutch angles I enjoy seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the ones that stay true to where the</v>

121
00:05:55.491 --> 00:05:58.030
<v Speaker 1>shot came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The English shows what makes filmmaking</v>

122
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>unique through its emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulation of a scene.</v>

123
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>So when your moment features the classic</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsettling nature of the cabinet of Dr</v>

124
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Caligari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's perfect.</v>

125
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 1>And when you use it just because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks cool,</v>

126
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.360
<v Speaker 1>it seems to lose some weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not trying to say that there's</v>

127
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>some obvious way to use the Dutch angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very emotional shot.</v>

128
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>You may enjoy how it feels and movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I don't,</v>

129
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>and we're both right or you could say</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking too far into the shot and</v>

130
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch angle is just a way to tilt</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera to make us seem interesting.</v>

131
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you look more closely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see how the shot means quite a</v>

132
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shot in many ways represents the</v>

133
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>original intent of directors to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking as a unique art form.</v>

134
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>That tilting of the camera is the purest</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of subjective filmmaking.</v>

135
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>The unease of the Dutch angle makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema special because you can't do it</v>

136
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>in theater or the novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when it's used,</v>

137
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>it pushes boundaries for what movies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of.</v>

138
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.710
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is the Dutch angle is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect representation of what makes</v>

139
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>movies better than all that other crap.</v>

140
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>If you want to learn more about</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematography and how to make your own</v>

141
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:59.210
<v Speaker 1>filming looked like a high budget movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recommend this course by</v>

142
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>cinematographer Ryan Booth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets in depth about how the</v>

143
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>professionals like their scenes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot on location.</v>

144
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>It's actually rare to have someone so</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience get into such detail online.</v>

145
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.720

150
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>If you're not a filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still definitely find a valuable</v>

00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:28.940
<v Speaker 1>course in their thousands of classes.</v>

154
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 4>Just a bit of a break from the norm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a little slot in the break.</v>

155
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 4>The monotony of.</v>
