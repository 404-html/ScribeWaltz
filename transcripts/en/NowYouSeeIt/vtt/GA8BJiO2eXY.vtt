1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guys in that Prince Movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purple Rain,</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.880
<v Speaker 1>that shit was so gay fucking 80 style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sitting and I was gone.</v>

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>What about the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that every era of</v>

4
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>movies looks back on previous era's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>full generation before.</v>

5
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>It's far enough back to reflect on while</v>
<v Speaker 1>still being fresh.</v>

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty common for directors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>producers to make movies and TV shows</v>

7
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>that take place in that previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation in the generation they grew</v>

8
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>up in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a wonderful life goes from the</v>

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>forties to the twenties back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future goes from the eighties to the</v>

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>fifties and that's 70 show goes from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>two thousands to the seventies and the</v>

11
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>same thing goes for the 2010 looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>back on the 1980s but this era seems to</v>

12
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>have more of a craze than a simple Omaj</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the eighties countless movies and TV</v>

13
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:43.741
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gift,</v>

14
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>meticulous detail to the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video games,</v>

15
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>and overall style of that era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all to critical acclaim and box office</v>

16
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

17
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Nothing encapsulates our current</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession with the 1980s more than ready</v>

18
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>player one a novel turned movie about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>future world where people use virtual</v>

19
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>reality to relive old eighties pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and media.</v>

20
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get more eighties obsessed</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I think there are several reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eighties phenomenon is so much more</v>

22
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>prominent than the nostalgia of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

23
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>For one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties was the birth of audio</v>

24
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>visual entertainment with the music</v>
<v Speaker 1>video creating a whole new art form that</v>

25
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>continues to influence movies today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also the golden age of TV movies.</v>

26
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>The teens watching those movies have</v>
<v Speaker 1>since become the movie creators and</v>

27
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>creating thematically complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers paved the way for casting more</v>

28
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>kids in lead roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I want to focus on the eighties</v>

29
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon for another reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely the perfect timing of the 80s</v>

30
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>created movies designed to be Omaj to</v>
<v Speaker 1>later on movies begging to be revisited,</v>

31
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's because of how the directors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and producers made them.</v>

32
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>And to understand the eighties creators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand where they came</v>

33
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mid Sixties till late seventies films in</v>

34
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>a period referred to as new age</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood.</v>

35
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>We're defined by deviation from</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical cinematic norms.</v>

36
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>These films questioned the Hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

37
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>creating more experimental movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies that challenge John or norms,</v>

38
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>conventional filming techniques and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood production code.</v>

39
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the pinnacle of new age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood was Bonnie and Clyde,</v>

40
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>a movie with insane violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually confused characters and</v>

41
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>counterculture sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in this hotbed of cinematic</v>

42
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>experimentation came the pioneers of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>80s blockbuster,</v>

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>the creative talent with a hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness of Hollywood conventions,</v>

44
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They themselves knew how to abide by</v>

45
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>when they wanted and break when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>

46
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So the eventual leaders of the 80s</v>
<v Speaker 1>blockbuster where the first generation</v>

47
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>of filmmakers to grow up during</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical Hollywood and then rise to the</v>

48
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>top during a period of extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimentation.</v>

49
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>So their film language is based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous films and their style is driven</v>

50
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>by how they follow or break film</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions.</v>

51
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And how do I know that's how they made</v>
<v Speaker 1>their movies?</v>

52
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Because online there's a transcript of</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the two most important eighties</v>

53
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>directors conceiving the idea for one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best movies of the 1980s Steven</v>

54
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg and George Lucas Discussing</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indiana Jones,</v>

55
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>raiders of the lost Ark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people enjoy reading the banter</v>

56
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>between the two directors and how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of the iconic sequences in the</v>

57
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I want to discuss these transcripts</v>

58
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>with a new Hollywood eighties Omaj</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because as you read it,</v>

59
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you realize how their entire means of</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating comes from building off of</v>

60
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>previous movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucas pitched the movie as a Spaghetti</v>

61
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Western or James Bond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the 30s they describe me,</v>

62
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Indiana Jones by comparing him to other</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie characters,</v>

63
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>he's professional like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food aid from the seven Samurai,</v>

64
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>he has to go against people like Eli</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wallace from the good,</v>

65
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:14.134
<v Speaker 1>the bad and the ugly.</v>

66
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>He's a John Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clint Eastwood,</v>

67
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Sean Connery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of professional but scruffy like</v>

68
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Humphrey bogart in treasure of Sierra</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madre.</v>

69
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>The action should be like the wind and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion and the jungle is King Kong</v>

70
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:23.951
<v Speaker 1>ish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

71
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Language is built on entirely Oman and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in doing so,</v>

72
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>they create a completely fresh character</v>
<v Speaker 1>and story by using old movies.</v>

73
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>But it's more than just using old to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create new.</v>

74
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>These creators also want it to capture</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of movies before new age</v>

75
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood movies with less social</v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary and more classic Hollywood</v>

76
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>find a movie to instill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eighties mindset was undoubtedly</v>

77
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>star wars in 1977 George Lucas describes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenon himself.</v>

78
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 1>My main reason for making star wars was</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give young people an honest,</v>

79
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>wholesome fantasy life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kinds my generation had.</v>

80
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 1>We had westerns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirate movies,</v>

81
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of great things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are the romance,</v>

82
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>the adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fun that used to be in</v>

83
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>practically every movie ever made.</v>

84
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>He criticized the 70s TV shows at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

85
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>like Kojak and the 6 million men that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were popular and well made,</v>

86
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>but also extremely bleak and almost too</v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic.</v>

87
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Basically they missed out on the fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the 80s blockbuster brought back what</v>

88
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>made movies entertaining in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>

89
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>James Cameron's the terminator is</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired by 1950 Psi Phi and the outer</v>

90
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:18.561
<v Speaker 1>limits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 1>1960 Scifi show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as are a lot of other eighties movies</v>

92
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>like e t and ghostbusters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And notice how these later movies don't</v>

93
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>make aliens horrific or bleak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make aliens whimsical and fun.</v>

94
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Even the princess bride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fantasy movie seems to perfectly</v>

95
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>capture the George Lucas and Steven</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg spirit.</v>

96
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Many sixties and seventies teen movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>are defined by their oversized</v>

97
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 1>characters or plots with extreme sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>deviations.</v>

98
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.000
<v Speaker 1>This is Robinson you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>seduce.</v>

99
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>John Hughes was one of the first to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create an honest portrayal of teenagers,</v>

100
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>one defined by clumsy romance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining hi-jinks.</v>

101
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>I think Roger Ebert sums up what these</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties creators accomplished in his</v>

102
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>review of Indiana Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This movie celebrates the stories we</v>

103
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>spent our adolescent searching for in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pulpit adventure magazines in the</v>

104
00:04:58.691 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>novels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in comics,</v>

105
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 1>even in the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's the biggest reason why</v>

106
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>eighties movies are so popular today and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why stranger things has dozens of</v>

107
00:05:05.981 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 1>eighties movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>References.</v>

108
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>San Junipero won two emmy's and it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest grossing horror movie of all</v>

109
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movies of the 80s capture the spirit</v>

110
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>of entertainment and these modern Oh</v>
<v Speaker 1>matias want to do the same when you</v>

111
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:17.990
<v Speaker 1>watch another 80s movie made in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present day,</v>

112
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>notice how there's almost always some</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot where we see what blockbuster is</v>

113
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>currently out in theaters at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighties movies reinvigorated that</v>

114
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood blockbuster and that's why we</v>
<v Speaker 1>look back to that time period when we're</v>
