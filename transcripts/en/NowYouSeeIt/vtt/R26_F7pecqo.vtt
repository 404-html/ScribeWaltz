1
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And now our feature presentation</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence of Arabia,</v>

2
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>presented in its original ultra cinema</v>
<v Speaker 1>scope letterbox format.</v>

3
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the rather attractive girl on a</v>

4
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>camel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Peter O'toole.</v>

5
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I want to make a quick video on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>usage of aspect ratios as a thematic</v>

6
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>device in film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the first 40 years of film were</v>

7
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>limited to one ratio for length and</v>
<v Speaker 1>width of a screen.</v>

8
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Modern filmmakers have several aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>ratios to choose from and each one can</v>

9
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>have a different emotional effect for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the viewer.</v>

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at why filmmakers choose the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ratios they choose and explore the</v>

11
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>emotional effect of changing aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>ratio.</v>

12
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:49.671
<v Speaker 1>During a film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest aspect ratio is the four by</v>

13
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>three academy ratio and it lost its</v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity after the introduction of 16</v>

14
00:00:56.731 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>by nine ratio in the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Directors still use this ratio sometimes</v>

15
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>though to make the film feel like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an older time period.</v>

16
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>A great example is the Grand Budapest</v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel,</v>

17
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>but she switches to academy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the story goes back to the 19</v>

18
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the begins of course with</v>

19
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>the aspect ratio change is a great way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to emotionally transport us to the time</v>

20
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When this ratio was popular,</v>

21
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>we associate the aspect ratio with old</v>
<v Speaker 1>timey movies and it helps pull us into</v>

22
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>the old timey style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quirkiness,</v>

23
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>manners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and culture that the Grand Budapest</v>

24
00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 1>hotel has 500 days of summer uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>polaroid square ratio as a way to show a</v>

25
00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:32.140
<v Speaker 1>glamorized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reminiscent past.</v>

26
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>This time capsule look coincides nicely</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Tom's old fashioned unrealistic</v>

27
00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:37.990
<v Speaker 1>view of love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Towards the end of the movie,</v>

28
00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:39.970
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this polaroid look is eventually pushed</v>

29
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>off screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Tom realizes the expectation of this</v>

30
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>old fashioned outlook does not coincide</v>
<v Speaker 1>with reality.</v>

31
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Jay Jay Jay,</v>

32
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>two point three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five ratio is ultra wide screen and it</v>

33
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>gives the look of an epic big budget</v>
<v Speaker 1>drama or a Scifi film.</v>

34
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I like how Auntie Donna uses it for over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top drama.</v>

35
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>My theses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good,</v>

36
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>but compared to you such doodles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>robot games,</v>

37
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean he is the APP.</v>

38
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.420
<v Speaker 1>The ratio is reserved for extremely epic</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

39
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>A movie like Napoleon dynamite would</v>
<v Speaker 1>look kind of off in this extreme ratio,</v>

40
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 1>but a movie like star wars wouldn't look</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly the same without it.</v>

41
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Portraying space is commonly associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with big aspect ratio changes.</v>

42
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Interstellar switches to imax footage</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the shots are of space,</v>

43
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.070
<v Speaker 1>and it goes back to 16 by nine for shots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the spaceship.</v>

44
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 1>What better way to make space look</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger than my literally adding to the</v>

45
00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>screen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same has done in apollo 13 in galaxy</v>

46
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:40.420
<v Speaker 1>quest to show the huge scope of space</v>

47
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>aspect ratio changes to add scope aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusive to space movies though right</v>

48
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>before the Bain verse Batman Fight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dark Knight rises,</v>

49
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera transitions to figure imax</v>

50
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This change has a great subconscious</v>

51
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>emotional effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reminds us subtly that we're about to</v>

52
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>watch an intense epic seen hunger games</v>
<v Speaker 1>also does a good job of adding</v>

53
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>anticipation by slowly expanding into</v>
<v Speaker 1>IMEX footage before the fighting begins.</v>

54
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>The right aspect ratio can contribute to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the realism of a film.</v>

55
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>A scripted film that's supposed to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a documentary has to be 16 by nine</v>

56
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>or else it won't emotionally feel like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>

57
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>The opening scene in the incredibles</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposefully looks like 16 millimeter,</v>

58
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>six by nine ratio film and the effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>adds realism,</v>

59
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>so the movie feels less like a cartoon</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more like a realistic action film.</v>

60
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Catch me if you can cleverly use this</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

61
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Ratio change to show frank is contained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He starts on TV in the small academy</v>

62
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>ratio and then he's next shown through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>small slit in a wall.</v>

63
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>He is literally being squished in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame.</v>

64
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>It gives the emotional feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank is trapped.</v>

65
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>The most ambitious aspect ratio changes</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when the ratio is ignored,</v>

66
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>completely life of Pi has the fish that</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally jumping out of the frame</v>

67
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>and asked the great and powerful does</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same with a burst of flame.</v>

68
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a really immersive technique and</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes for a great visual aspect.</v>

69
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Ratios have a chance to greatly</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute to the visual storytelling of</v>

70
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether they indicate time period</v>

71
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 1>intensity or added realism aspect ratios</v>
<v Speaker 1>are another clever tool at the disposal</v>

72
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>of the modern director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to fully understand the</v>

73
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>style of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film's aspect ratio is a great frame</v>

74
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>of reference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>
