00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>It opened its wings like this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hovered above me skinny chicken.</v>

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Now you are vampires,</v>

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>and it was Peter.</v>

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 3>The vampire is perhaps the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>universally recognizable character in</v>

5
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 3>all of cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most famous interpretation comes</v>

6
00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Speaker 3>largely from Bela Lugosi's Dracula in</v>
<v Speaker 3>1931 where we got the classic accent and</v>

7
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 3>widow's peak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the high collar,</v>

8
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:30.620
<v Speaker 3>and Kate came from the vampire in</v>
<v Speaker 3>theater and the sharp canines were</v>

9
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 3>popularized by Christopher Lee's horror</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Dracula known as just Dracula in the</v>

10
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 3>UK in 1958 and it's a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these features that leads us to the</v>

11
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 3>image of the vampire we're most familiar</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 3>It's the vampire that shows up in cereal</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxes,</v>

13
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 3>Geico commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sesame street</v>

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 3>greetings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the count,</v>

15
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 3>but in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the design of the vampire varies</v>

16
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 3>drastically depending on the movie count</v>
<v Speaker 3>or lock in those Fra to looks like an</v>

17
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 3>evil monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Edward Kulin and twilight is</v>

18
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 3>basically a perfect version of a human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each vampire is actually carefully</v>

19
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 3>engineered to serve a certain purpose in</v>
<v Speaker 3>each movie,</v>

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 3>and many scholars have studied the</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning of different vampires over time.</v>

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.570
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my name's Stanley's to panic.</v>

22
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 4>I teach at the University of Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm an associate professor currently,</v>

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 4>but I've taught a number of things I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>taught and I'm currently teaching a film</v>

24
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 4>course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russian film,</v>

25
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 4>Eastern Europe came down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my big courses called Dracula live,</v>

26
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 4>it's about vampires and bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

27
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.450
<v Speaker 3>There's been a fair amount of research</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the vampire in academia,</v>

28
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 3>which makes sense considering Dracula is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second most popular character in</v>

29
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 3>cinematic history behind the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>sherlock holmes.</v>

30
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.600
<v Speaker 3>And that's not including the majority of</v>
<v Speaker 3>vampire films that don't even have a</v>

31
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 3>dracula ASCII character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons why the vampire is so</v>

32
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:41.990
<v Speaker 3>popular amongst filmmakers is its</v>
<v Speaker 3>versatility as a creature.</v>

33
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 3>Since the beginning of the vampire</v>
<v Speaker 3>onscreen directors have always made</v>

34
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 3>creative changes to their vampires to</v>
<v Speaker 3>suit their particular movie.</v>

35
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.580
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the vampire,</v>

36
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.160
<v Speaker 4>it's called con aural lab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not contracting and original.</v>

37
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 4>And it comes from the Dutch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means war,</v>

38
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So obviously there's some connection</v>

39
00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 4>there with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with war and the laws that,</v>

40
00:01:58.411 --> 00:01:58.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>

41
00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 4>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>young men for Germany during World War</v>

42
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 4>One and the rest of our team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So wars obvious there.</v>

43
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

44
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 4>And it's also clear assemble like</v>
<v Speaker 4>foreign intervention or a fear of name</v>

45
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 4>of grants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Jewish immigration maybe or Jewish</v>

46
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 4>influence and we know be unfortunate</v>
<v Speaker 4>finishing the bat and then you had this</v>

47
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 4>thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in that case,</v>

48
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.570
<v Speaker 4>which is a human leg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like it's so foul looking and</v>

49
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 4>it spreads disease that then it really</v>
<v Speaker 4>reiterates the negative connotations</v>

50
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 4>about being Jewish.</v>

51
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.130
<v Speaker 3>Much of the design of Count Orlok is</v>
<v Speaker 3>antisemetic.</v>

52
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 3>He has many features also present in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jewish characatures including the</v>

53
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.650
<v Speaker 3>association between Jewish people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rats.</v>

54
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.340
<v Speaker 3>The filmmakers changed or exaggerated</v>
<v Speaker 3>some designs of the original Dracula to</v>

55
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 3>make the creature more relevant to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fears of post World War One.</v>

56
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Germany</v>

57
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 4>in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they changed the location because it</v>

58
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 4>based and Dracula,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've changed it from Transylvania for</v>

59
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:47.960
<v Speaker 4>London,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Transylvania to Germany.</v>

60
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So obviously they're making connections</v>

61
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 4>to their own college and things that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>represent that.</v>

62
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In that case,</v>

63
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something to be feared because when</v>

64
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 4>it's representing is something that</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain people,</v>

65
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:58.584
<v Speaker 4>when you've been like</v>

66
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 3>in filmmakers always</v>

67
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 5>customize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're vampires to represent something</v>

68
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] was a way to symbolize</v>

69
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 5>German fears at the time that largely</v>
<v Speaker 5>included antisemitism.</v>

70
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 5>But the vampire can do much more than</v>
<v Speaker 5>that since vampires aren't technically</v>

71
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 5>human directors have historically used</v>
<v Speaker 5>them to show behavior that would be too</v>

72
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 5>weird or controversial if it were done</v>
<v Speaker 5>by actual humans.</v>

73
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 5>In the 1930s,</v>
<v Speaker 5>homosexuality was essentially banned on</v>

74
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 5>the big screen in America by a series of</v>
<v Speaker 5>moral guidelines called the hays code.</v>

75
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 5>But the vampire found a way to work</v>
<v Speaker 5>around that.</v>

76
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 5>Starting With Dracula in 1931 vampires</v>
<v Speaker 5>quickly switched from disgusting</v>

77
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 5>monsters of Count Oarlock to sex symbols</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Bela Lugosi,</v>

78
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 5>showing just how easily the vampire can</v>
<v Speaker 5>change and how the vampire can mean</v>

79
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:41.791
<v Speaker 5>something sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the images that we have in</v>

80
00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:45.590
<v Speaker 5>western culture of things that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrific are also basically sexual.</v>

81
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.380
<v Speaker 5>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vampirism is just sex from the neck up.</v>

82
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 5>You're penetrating a passive person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

83
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.030
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is a very sexual sort of</v>

84
00:03:56.031 --> 00:03:56.864
<v Speaker 5>monster.</v>

85
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Throughout the filming of Dracula's</v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter in 1936,</v>

86
00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:03.530
<v Speaker 3>universal pictures was well aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lesbian implications of a female vampire</v>

87
00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.840
<v Speaker 3>gazing at and biting a partially nude</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>

88
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.170
<v Speaker 3>They changed the script to make lily</v>
<v Speaker 3>clothed and had the camera cut away,</v>

89
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.350
<v Speaker 3>but either with these changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the homosexuality is pretty obvious.</v>

90
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.800
<v Speaker 3>The vampire allowed a depiction of</v>
<v Speaker 3>lesbian ism decades before humans could</v>

91
00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:18.120
<v Speaker 3>do it themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it isn't explicit ends.</v>

92
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Oleska is also interested in guys in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>film with Vampires.</v>

93
00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Controversial topics are much easier to</v>
<v Speaker 3>discuss when you compare movies about</v>

94
00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:27.200
<v Speaker 3>the same topic that came out around the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same time.</v>

95
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.710
<v Speaker 3>Vampires offer enough removal from</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual humans that they can go much</v>

96
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 3>further with the topic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia is about a homosexual suing</v>

97
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:37.280
<v Speaker 3>a company for wrongly terminating him</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he has aids as the first</v>

98
00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:40.040
<v Speaker 3>mainstream big budget movie focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a homosexual.</v>

99
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.550
<v Speaker 3>The movie approaches the subject very</v>
<v Speaker 3>carefully and Tribeca is written very</v>

100
00:04:43.551 --> 00:04:45.620
<v Speaker 3>sympathetically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always nice in the camera,</v>

101
00:04:45.621 --> 00:04:49.130
<v Speaker 3>shows it nearly every scene gives us a</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot from his perspective with closeups</v>

102
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.950
<v Speaker 3>and we even get home footage to show how</v>
<v Speaker 3>ordinary he is.</v>

103
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Speaker 3>In contrast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bad guys are films speaking almost</v>

104
00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:57.920
<v Speaker 3>exclusively in racist and homophobic</v>
<v Speaker 3>slurs often shot from far away,</v>

105
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 3>often shot from behind back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't express his sexuality much.</v>

106
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.640
<v Speaker 3>He never kisses his partner and the ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>scenes showing two men sharing a bed</v>

107
00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:06.770
<v Speaker 3>together was cut for the theatrical</v>
<v Speaker 3>release.</v>

108
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.760
<v Speaker 3>In many ways it has to water down so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many aspects of homosexuality to show it</v>

109
00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:14.760
<v Speaker 3>as completely normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You survived what I assumed to be your</v>

110
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 3>first gay party and tech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not trying to say that</v>

111
00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:20.300
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia should have pushed more</v>
<v Speaker 3>boundaries because then it might not</v>

112
00:05:20.301 --> 00:05:22.070
<v Speaker 3>have done well during the time that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>came out.</v>

113
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.370
<v Speaker 3>What I am saying is a vampire movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do much more interview with the</v>

114
00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:28.730
<v Speaker 3>vampire came out one year later and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an incredible difference in how</v>

115
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:31.370
<v Speaker 3>far it goes in portraying homosexuality</v>
<v Speaker 3>on screen.</v>

116
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.640
<v Speaker 4>It seemed goes farther.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

117
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shows you like you know where they</v>

118
00:05:34.311 --> 00:05:36.500
<v Speaker 4>almost kiss and stuff and gets really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

119
00:05:36.501 --> 00:05:38.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sexually tans in a number of scenes.</v>

120
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 4>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>near of Yam,</v>

121
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.210
<v Speaker 4>whenever I'm on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just so you know,</v>

122
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 4>with Louie and that our gallery and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Louie draws him really close.</v>

123
00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:44.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

124
00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:48.920
<v Speaker 4>you know that it's clicks and then let's</v>
<v Speaker 4>start and the way he's connected to</v>

125
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Louie and then they get this daughter or</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

126
00:05:50.931 --> 00:05:53.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's representing two gay guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they've essentially,</v>

127
00:05:53.391 --> 00:05:56.420
<v Speaker 4>and talking about a child in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 4>nearly 90 it's like I can remember that</v>

128
00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 4>being a controversy this guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they liked it.</v>

129
00:05:59.151 --> 00:05:59.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

130
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.230
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes us like August to vampires</v>

131
00:06:02.231 --> 00:06:02.631
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

132
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:03.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

133
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like right there but not officially</v>

134
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 4>saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 3>When it's pampers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hide your meaning in a symbol.</v>

136
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 3>Then the movie can have more nuanced</v>
<v Speaker 3>characters in discussions.</v>

137
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 3>The movie doesn't need to have to give</v>
<v Speaker 3>us any lectures about homosexuality.</v>

138
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Like Philadelphia does interview with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vampire marks,</v>

139
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 3>the first piece of work with a first</v>
<v Speaker 3>person perspective of the vampire and it</v>

140
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 3>focuses more on the relationship between</v>
<v Speaker 3>vampires over time.</v>

141
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Not to mention the bitey scenes are</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely erotic,</v>

142
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 3>more erotic than a movie like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia was capable of doing with</v>

143
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:32.790
<v Speaker 3>real people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But maybe my favorite example of using a</v>

144
00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 3>vampire to be ahead of the times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his death dream originally titled dead</v>

145
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 3>of Night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lesser known movie about a soldier who</v>

146
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:41.830
<v Speaker 3>dies in Vietnam and returns home as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>creature like a vampire.</v>

147
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 3>The director cleverly uses the vampire</v>
<v Speaker 3>to show what it was like for a veteran</v>

148
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 3>to return home after combat as a totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>different person,</v>

149
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 3>a shadow of their former self,</v>

150
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.520
<v Speaker 6>like Zombie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like looking corpse thing that is like</v>

151
00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:56.910
<v Speaker 6>near Dad and many before he looks in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>home will be boise sunglasses.</v>

152
00:06:56.911 --> 00:07:00.750
<v Speaker 6>How many acts weird out in public and</v>
<v Speaker 6>his way of responding is very dead.</v>

153
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.440
<v Speaker 6>Like whenever his ex girlfriend or the</v>
<v Speaker 6>girl I used to days talking to me now</v>

154
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.140
<v Speaker 6>that's at one particular scene.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really telling where she says,</v>

155
00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:08.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hope you're not,</v>

156
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.600
<v Speaker 6>you're not mad or anything,</v>

157
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.003
<v Speaker 7>says</v>

158
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.600
<v Speaker 6>Ronnie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a really dead response as if</v>

159
00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:17.201
<v Speaker 6>you suck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

160
00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:21.460
<v Speaker 6>sort of symbolizing that plight of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Vietnam vet who's like emotionally dead</v>

161
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.780
<v Speaker 3>as he fights his friends and family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His actions directly mere how Vietnam</v>

162
00:07:24.781 --> 00:07:28.110
<v Speaker 3>veterans were rejected by society and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the media when they came back from war.</v>

163
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a powerful message and the director</v>
<v Speaker 3>created a berry humanlike but</v>

164
00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:34.500
<v Speaker 3>emotionally stunted kind of vampire to</v>
<v Speaker 3>show his message.</v>

165
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not much different from a movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Rambo,</v>

166
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.080
<v Speaker 3>but with a vampire death dream came out</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight years before Rambo and just one</v>

167
00:07:40.081 --> 00:07:42.270
<v Speaker 3>year after the Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In many ways,</v>

168
00:07:42.271 --> 00:07:44.190
<v Speaker 3>the vampire movies are ahead of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Times.</v>

169
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.890
<v Speaker 3>The vampire was also ahead of its time</v>
<v Speaker 3>in race relations.</v>

170
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.400
<v Speaker 3>The first black horror movie was Black</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ula and it was a box office hit in the</v>

171
00:07:50.401 --> 00:07:52.590
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dracula strips prince mom Waldy of his</v>

172
00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:54.690
<v Speaker 3>power when he tries to abolish the slave</v>
<v Speaker 3>trade,</v>

173
00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:57.780
<v Speaker 3>cursing him as a vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The movie becomes a quest for black ula</v>

174
00:07:57.781 --> 00:08:01.200
<v Speaker 3>to regain his power and identity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any partially does so by fighting off</v>

175
00:08:01.201 --> 00:08:03.390
<v Speaker 3>white policemen attacking a black</v>
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

176
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Here we see a movie in 1972 already</v>
<v Speaker 3>showing the issues of racial profiling</v>

177
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.810
<v Speaker 3>in the fantasy of black Americans to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight back,</v>

178
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.220
<v Speaker 3>making it way ahead of its time.</v>

179
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.730
<v Speaker 4>The thing that makes that film boundary</v>
<v Speaker 4>breaking right is that you're getting</v>

180
00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:15.870
<v Speaker 4>vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he likes it.</v>

181
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saint Catherine White people watching</v>

182
00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:20.430
<v Speaker 4>that and then they identify with what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on with number Waldo and how that</v>

183
00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:22.050
<v Speaker 4>relates to racial relations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

184
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.730
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you showed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

185
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.773
<v Speaker 4>bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

186
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.280
<v Speaker 4>African Americans and packing the</v>
<v Speaker 4>police,</v>

187
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.750
<v Speaker 4>then you met,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're probably gonna have some white</v>

188
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:28.201
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like,</v>

189
00:08:28.201 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing happens today whenever the</v>

190
00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.190
<v Speaker 4>black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talking about police intervention in</v>

191
00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:33.180
<v Speaker 4>black communities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff like that,</v>

192
00:08:33.181 --> 00:08:36.150
<v Speaker 4>that when you got to have an empire and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're sort of bridges that gap and</v>

193
00:08:36.151 --> 00:08:37.590
<v Speaker 4>brings people together in a different</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

194
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.550
<v Speaker 3>And so the modern vampire carries all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these past iterations of the vampire</v>

195
00:08:41.551 --> 00:08:43.710
<v Speaker 3>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This may seem silly to even talk about,</v>

196
00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:47.490
<v Speaker 3>but even a kid show on Disney channel</v>
<v Speaker 3>uses the symbol of vampires to talk</v>

197
00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:48.600
<v Speaker 3>about human issues.</v>

198
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's obvious right there what that shows</v>

199
00:09:00.851 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 4>is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's basically symbolizing a different</v>

200
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 4>culture or a different race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were character.</v>

201
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 4>That's fun so that kids can understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>it better.</v>

202
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.840
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've always thought they were the</v>

203
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:14.530
<v Speaker 8>greatest metaphor for the outsider in</v>
<v Speaker 8>all of us.</v>

204
00:09:14.531 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 8>I felt like an outsider growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I miss fed.</v>

205
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.100
<v Speaker 8>I think a lot of people did or do it</v>
<v Speaker 8>sometime in their life feel like</v>

206
00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:24.190
<v Speaker 8>outsiders,</v>
<v Speaker 8>outkast and the vampire is a great way</v>

207
00:09:24.191 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 8>to talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's,</v>

208
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 8>he's a larger than life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mythic hero who is looks human and can</v>

209
00:09:29.981 --> 00:09:33.130
<v Speaker 8>talk to you like a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's actually a monster and he's</v>

210
00:09:33.131 --> 00:09:36.310
<v Speaker 8>immortal.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's outside of life and I think that's</v>

211
00:09:36.311 --> 00:09:37.960
<v Speaker 8>a great metaphor for human beings.</v>

212
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 3>The show has episodes where neighbors</v>
<v Speaker 3>come to terms with the odd van</v>

213
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 3>stereotypes this family follows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Using a vampire makes it simple for kids</v>

214
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 3>to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not controversial.</v>

215
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 3>It would be a little trickier to address</v>
<v Speaker 3>black or Asian stereotypes to a little</v>

216
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 3>kid in a TV series,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if fake creature is a lot easier,</v>

217
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a great example of why</v>
<v Speaker 3>more complicated ideas like</v>

218
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 3>homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>race relations in the effects of war or</v>

219
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 3>more easily discussed using a vampire</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of a human.</v>

220
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 3>I'll go for one more example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bit out there.</v>

221
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 3>Why did twilight do so well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely not the writing.</v>

222
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.910
<v Speaker 3>The book copies a very common storyline</v>
<v Speaker 3>in tons of female,</v>

223
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.820
<v Speaker 3>young adult literature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A story of an attractive bad boy with a</v>

224
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:17.070
<v Speaker 3>bad background who is dangerous in some</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

225
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 3>whether it's from drugs or abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he meets a girl who changes him.</v>

226
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Typically it's through some very average</v>
<v Speaker 4>girl that he becomes a better pair of</v>

227
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 4>Stan because of law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

228
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 4>And that's the idea that love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can change the world and there's this</v>

229
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:31.890
<v Speaker 4>guy out there that's going to pick me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

230
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:35.250
<v Speaker 4>And no one else notices me and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy's going to pick me and he's totally</v>

231
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:37.410
<v Speaker 4>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm the one that's going to lead to</v>

232
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:40.170
<v Speaker 4>that totally awesome because he's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be on me.</v>

233
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Twilight follows this storyline</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely closely,</v>

234
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 3>as have dozens of novels before it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but making the bad boy of empire is</v>

235
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:49.320
<v Speaker 3>actually kind of creative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That creature is perfect for that</v>

236
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 3>fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're usually attractive,</v>

237
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 3>at least in some modern movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't age and they can't be killed,</v>

238
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.250
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vampires are dangerous.</v>

239
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 3>They could hurt you in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're extremely strong.</v>

240
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.720
<v Speaker 4>There's that famous scene whenever</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're about the case and he jumps back</v>

241
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:04.410
<v Speaker 4>because he's afraid of going too far</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he could end up harming,</v>

242
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:05.230
<v Speaker 4>harsh and see us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

243
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 4>even vague.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that danger that he represents is</v>

244
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 4>this bad boy image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not really his fault so to speak,</v>

245
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 4>which is what makes him a little more</v>
<v Speaker 4>sellable to because he just needs to be</v>

246
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:17.470
<v Speaker 4>like find the right human being.</v>

247
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.400
<v Speaker 3>So that movie and novel craft of Vampire</v>
<v Speaker 3>that works as a bad boy and young girls</v>

248
00:11:21.401 --> 00:11:24.100
<v Speaker 3>identify with the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fantasy for young girls that's</v>

249
00:11:24.101 --> 00:11:26.950
<v Speaker 3>always been around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the vampire gives it a new spin and</v>

250
00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:30.400
<v Speaker 3>allows the fantasy to be explored a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little deeper because at the end of the</v>

251
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.230
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bad boy fantasy isn't real.</v>

252
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.560
<v Speaker 3>That's not how real life works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So using a fake creature instead of a</v>

253
00:11:35.561 --> 00:11:37.690
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's you go further with the fantasy</v>

254
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.560
<v Speaker 3>just like you can with other complicated</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues as a great sum up of Vampires</v>

255
00:11:41.561 --> 00:11:42.610
<v Speaker 3>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the company,</v>

256
00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:45.940
<v Speaker 3>what we do in the shadows helps us</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the power of the vampire as a</v>

257
00:11:45.941 --> 00:11:48.520
<v Speaker 3>symbol overall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The van in the movie are all from</v>

258
00:11:48.521 --> 00:11:50.350
<v Speaker 3>different time periods and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>influences.</v>

259
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Peter's Terrifying Monster Portrayal</v>
<v Speaker 3>Echoes Count Oarlock in Nosferatu</v>

260
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Flautas lavs teams influenced by</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vladislav in Dracula,</v>

261
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Si,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Si,</v>

262
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 3>and nick has similarities to Edward from</v>
<v Speaker 3>twilight even admitting it himself,</v>

263
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 2>they'll maybe twilight if you say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the main guy,</v>

264
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:14.614
<v Speaker 2>twilight</v>

265
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.070
<v Speaker 3>mockumentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We follow around these vampires in their</v>

266
00:12:17.071 --> 00:12:20.790
<v Speaker 3>everyday lives and in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the format and style actually teaches us</v>

267
00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:22.650
<v Speaker 3>a lot about vampires in media.</v>

268
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.540
<v Speaker 4>We get documentaries when we think about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

269
00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:27.110
<v Speaker 4>It's worthy of a documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'll make it about a serious good</v>

270
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.540
<v Speaker 4>product and therefore you'll learn about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nature of the product by studying</v>

271
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 4>the series.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This film,</v>

272
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.360
<v Speaker 4>it is really doing something quite</v>
<v Speaker 4>special.</v>

273
00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:37.310
<v Speaker 4>It's saying you can learn just as much</v>
<v Speaker 4>by studying something lousy.</v>

274
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.140
<v Speaker 3>When you're a vampire you become very</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexy.</v>

275
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.340
<v Speaker 3>This movie shows us what it would really</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like if vampire's existed.</v>

276
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.380
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be epic like and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>other movies.</v>

277
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.380
<v Speaker 3>It would actually be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have to find a place to live.</v>

278
00:12:49.381 --> 00:12:52.110
<v Speaker 3>They would have to clean their flat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>biting someone wouldn't always be</v>

279
00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:54.870
<v Speaker 3>dramatic and theatrical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it would just be silly.</v>

280
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.080
<v Speaker 3>What we do in the shadows shows how</v>
<v Speaker 3>every other vampire movie artificially</v>

281
00:12:58.081 --> 00:13:01.680
<v Speaker 3>creates a vampire to suit their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning by showing us every vampire in</v>

282
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:03.030
<v Speaker 3>film history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in one movie,</v>

283
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.010
<v Speaker 3>we realize just how different they all</v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

284
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.770
<v Speaker 3>and it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some vampires look disgusting to show</v>

285
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:11.610
<v Speaker 3>fears of disease and antisemitism summer</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically perfect versions of humans,</v>

286
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.760
<v Speaker 3>and there's everything in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the traits of the vampire always</v>

287
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:15.530
<v Speaker 3>means something.</v>

288
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.060
<v Speaker 4>It represents not really human problems</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way that makes it accessible</v>

289
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.210
<v Speaker 4>because it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I vampires are fun and it makes it</v>

290
00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:25.600
<v Speaker 4>indirect so that it's kind of save it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and discuss it.</v>

291
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:26.870
<v Speaker 4>You now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're talking about a band pie</v>

292
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.320
<v Speaker 4>that symbolizes racial identity and of</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about those issues in a direct</v>

293
00:13:30.321 --> 00:13:30.650
<v Speaker 4>way</v>

294
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.020
<v Speaker 3>and that little bit of distance from</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual human floods,</v>

295
00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:35.780
<v Speaker 3>the vampire really pushed boundaries and</v>
<v Speaker 3>be ahead of its time.</v>

296
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.580
<v Speaker 3>So the next time you watch a vampire</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

297
00:13:37.581 --> 00:13:41.030
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can see a powerful message</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on what they do or don't do.</v>

298
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Vampires don't do dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you'll learn about vampires in</v>

299
00:13:44.481 --> 00:13:47.210
<v Speaker 3>a new and different way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what these videos are supposed</v>

300
00:13:47.211 --> 00:13:48.044
<v Speaker 3>to be all about.</v>

301
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet like this the better.</v>

302
00:13:49.171 --> 00:13:51.100
<v Speaker 4>Because students like his stuff more and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it's,</v>

303
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 4>it's it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it encapsulates more information to</v>

304
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:55.330
<v Speaker 4>share now stays and so it's where things</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going,</v>

305
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 4>but it's in academia just doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to shift.</v>

306
00:13:57.311 --> 00:13:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's starting to,</v>

307
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.640
<v Speaker 4>but it really needs to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

308
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

309
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.600
<v Speaker 3>One of the most important novels for the</v>

<v Speaker 3>but caused by an actual disease.</v>

312
00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a big influence for night of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>living dead.</v>

313
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.500
<v Speaker 3>A movie that paves the way for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern Zombie.</v>

314
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.540
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>
