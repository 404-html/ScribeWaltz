1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Fear of terrorism is widespread in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Many Americans have actually changed how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live their daily lives.</v>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>A significant number of Americans say</v>
<v Speaker 1>they avoided sporting events,</v>

4
00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:12.700
<v Speaker 1>concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other public events because of their</v>

5
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>fear of terrorism.</v>

6
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are people most afraid of?</v>

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 2>You may think it's insects or natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>disasters or even public speaking,</v>

8
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 2>but an extensive survey conducted by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chapman University in Twenty 15 said the</v>

9
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 2>biggest fears and Americans are cited as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quote manmade disasters.</v>

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.820
<v Speaker 2>These fears include bio warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism,</v>

11
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:34.580
<v Speaker 2>and nuclear attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty four percent of Americans are</v>

12
00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 2>afraid or very afraid of terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks.</v>

13
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Compare that to 28 percent for public</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking and 25 percent for insects.</v>

14
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Fear of terrorism actually peaked</v>
<v Speaker 2>following nine slash 11,</v>

15
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:46.880
<v Speaker 2>as the majority of Americans will</v>
<v Speaker 2>worried that they or someone they knew</v>

16
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 2>would be a victim of a terrorist attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to suggest that what the public</v>

17
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 2>fears is mirrored in Hollywood cinema,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the Zombie movies directly</v>

18
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 2>following nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to start,</v>

19
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 2>we have to go back in time to the horror</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies of the 19 fifties.</v>

20
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 2>So let me rephrase the first question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were people most afraid of?</v>

21
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 51.</v>

22
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>We all know the atomic bomb is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous that may be used against us.</v>

23
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>We must get ready for it.</v>

24
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 2>With the Korean War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet nuclear testing and mccarthyism</v>

25
00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 2>in full force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 1950 polls showed an astounding 68</v>

26
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:19.990
<v Speaker 2>percent of Americans thought the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 2>Union would use an atomic weapon against</v>

27
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fear was even used later as a scare</v>

28
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 2>tactic in an infamous campaign ad by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lyndon Johnson showing just how powerful</v>

29
00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 2>the fear was on the pump.</v>

30
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 3>What are the stakes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of God's children are to go into</v>

31
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 3>the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We must either love each other</v>

32
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 3>are we must die.</v>

33
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 2>So how did horror movies reflect this</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear?</v>

34
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 2>The 19 fifties brought on a wave of</v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster movies were aliens are monsters</v>

35
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 2>attack like war of the worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Blob,</v>

36
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 2>and the thing from another world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you watch battle scenes from the</v>

37
00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 2>original war of the worlds or attack of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 50 foot woman or Godzilla,</v>

38
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 2>you notice the parallels between these</v>
<v Speaker 2>horror movies and the destructive nature</v>

39
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 2>of the atomic bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

40
00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 2>the director of Godzilla was very blunt</v>
<v Speaker 2>about his intentions with the now iconic</v>

41
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

42
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the theme of the film from the beginning</v>

43
00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 2>was the tear of the bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mankind had created the bottom and now</v>

44
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 2>nature was going to take revenge on</v>
<v Speaker 2>mankind for Americans.</v>

45
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fear was channeled towards the</v>

46
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our biggest global threat at the time,</v>

47
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 2>in the same way that Godzilla stomps on</v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings and is immune to bullets,</v>

48
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.300
<v Speaker 2>so to win an atomic bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wipe out cities and be entirely</v>

49
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:29.680
<v Speaker 2>unstoppable by us.</v>

50
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's no coincidence that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese film Godzilla was such a huge</v>

51
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:36.280
<v Speaker 2>success in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Japanese fear of the bomb was just</v>

52
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 2>as relevant to Americans at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

53
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:41.470
<v Speaker 2>let's jump to the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're no longer threatened by a huge</v>

54
00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 2>visible global superpower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

55
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:45.430
<v Speaker 2>the fear of terrorism is quite the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

56
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing like Godzilla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A giant monster who drops in on a city,</v>

57
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 2>a terrorist hides in the shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disguise themselves as an everyday</v>

58
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 2>citizen and causes society to collapse</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the inside out.</v>

59
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 2>So here's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

60
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 2>The method of destruction for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist sound a like the method of</v>

61
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 2>destruction for Izombie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

62
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 2>it's important to note the explosion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Zombie Genre.</v>

63
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Io Nine posted a nice graph showing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom in Zombie movies in the early two</v>

64
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 2>thousands paralleling with mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 2>video games like resident evil and call</v>

65
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 2>of duty and spilling into other media</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the TV show,</v>

66
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 2>the walking dead.</v>

67
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt that zombies have</v>
<v Speaker 2>infected the public conscience.</v>

68
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Twenty eight days later is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first successful Zombie movies to come</v>

69
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 2>out following nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it highlights contemporary fears of</v>

70
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>terrorism and decay of social order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scene that most strongly ties the</v>

71
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 2>movie to terrorist fears is actually the</v>
<v Speaker 2>very first scene.</v>

72
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 2>The deadly virus is created in a lab by</v>
<v Speaker 2>making chimpanzees watch footage of</v>

73
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Arabic mobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting police,</v>

74
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>burning cars and beating each other up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This virus is literally created from</v>

75
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Arabic violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I particularly like this shot,</v>

76
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>which makes the human look like it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>regressing back into a terrifying</v>

77
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An important element of the Zombie genre</v>

78
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 2>is that the enemy comes inside a</v>
<v Speaker 2>community and spreads from person to</v>

79
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sounds eerily similar to the method</v>

80
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 2>of attack for a terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleeper cell hides within our board was</v>

81
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 2>ready to strike and once we can finally</v>
<v Speaker 2>spot it,</v>

82
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 2>it's too late to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think another key difference between</v>

83
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 2>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monster movies and Zombie movies is the</v>

84
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 2>role of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In monster movies,</v>

85
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 2>the government often fights against the</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy,</v>

86
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 2>but in 28 days later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government hasn't</v>

87
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.950
<v Speaker 4>abandoned them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no government horses to go home</v>

88
00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:18.951
<v Speaker 4>and there's always a government during a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bunker or plane.</v>

89
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 4>There's no government police.</v>

90
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the movie,</v>

91
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 2>the soldiers actually fight against the</v>
<v Speaker 2>protagonist.</v>

92
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.420
<v Speaker 2>In the 21st century with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial invasion of Iraq and</v>

93
00:04:29.421 --> 00:04:32.360
<v Speaker 2>government surveillance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism has brought on a distrust of</v>

94
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 2>our own government where the 19 fifties</v>
<v Speaker 2>government was always joining in the</v>

95
00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:37.880
<v Speaker 2>fight against a common enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It appears that during a Zombie</v>

96
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:40.160
<v Speaker 2>apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't count on any government to</v>

97
00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:42.650
<v Speaker 2>protect us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's so special about cinema is that</v>

98
00:04:42.651 --> 00:04:45.920
<v Speaker 2>it's such a democratic art form when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to art forms like painting,</v>

99
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 2>music or creative writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The message is only channeled through</v>

100
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:50.420
<v Speaker 2>one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with cinema,</v>

101
00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:53.000
<v Speaker 2>the final work is the product of dozens</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

102
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a production process as expensive as</v>

103
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:59.150
<v Speaker 2>making a movie requires that mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies appeal to as many people as</v>

104
00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a result,</v>

105
00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:03.830
<v Speaker 2>movies tend to be a window into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>general mindset of the society it was</v>

106
00:05:03.831 --> 00:05:04.280
<v Speaker 2>made in.</v>

107
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 2>This means that the subject matter of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the successful horror movie has in its</v>

108
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:10.340
<v Speaker 2>subtext,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reflection of the general fears of the</v>

109
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:13.520
<v Speaker 2>environment it was made in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things that regardless of time</v>

110
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.770
<v Speaker 2>period and society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are scared of.</v>

111
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 2>The dark is a universal fear because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't identify the threat.</v>

112
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.970
<v Speaker 2>So a movie like don't breed seems to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>well because like jaws and the ending of</v>

113
00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:25.850
<v Speaker 2>silence of the lambs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's scary when the threat can see you,</v>

114
00:05:25.851 --> 00:05:28.460
<v Speaker 2>but you can't see that it's a timeless</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

115
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.650
<v Speaker 2>But what about fears that do change over</v>
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

116
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I talked about monster movies versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zombie movies,</v>

117
00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:36.560
<v Speaker 2>but I also think mainstream horror</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies about religion or another perfect</v>

118
00:05:36.561 --> 00:05:39.710
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is at an all time low in the</v>

119
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.431
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More importantly,</v>

120
00:05:40.431 --> 00:05:43.820
<v Speaker 2>the fear of damnation is low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that religious groups tend to</v>

121
00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:47.930
<v Speaker 2>spend less time on the pain and torment</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hell in their teachings and more time</v>

122
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.510
<v Speaker 2>on the love and forgiveness that comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from salvation.</v>

123
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.750
<v Speaker 2>This idea is especially true in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catholic Church who revised their</v>

124
00:05:53.751 --> 00:05:58.751
<v Speaker 2>catechism in 1994 to remove the literary</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire and description of hell in favor of</v>

125
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>a metaphorical place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbolizing the loss of one's faith.</v>

126
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 2>So how is this idea shown in modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies around 40 or so years ago?</v>

127
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Most movies about the supernatural</v>
<v Speaker 2>centered around religion.</v>

128
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 2>The devil is often the center villain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In successful movies like Rosemary's</v>

129
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the omen and the exorcist nowadays,</v>

130
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 2>those supernatural beings are still</v>
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>

131
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 2>but religion is largely ignored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ghost is a former mental patient or</v>

132
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 2>some unexplained being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The exorcist is about a child being</v>

133
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 2>possessed by the devil or Finn has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar premise,</v>

134
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 2>a child who is acting strangely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but religion is hardly even mentioned.</v>

135
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that people don't find the</v>
<v Speaker 2>devil as scary as they used to,</v>

136
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 2>partly due to less religion and partly</v>
<v Speaker 2>due to a conscious choice to focus less</v>

137
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 2>on damnation in religious doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt that there are</v>

138
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 2>detectable trends in what horror movies</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose to find scary.</v>

139
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 2>If you want to know what people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid of,</v>

140
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 2>you could run an expensive and time</v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming statistical study,</v>

141
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 2>or you could just look at what horror</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies they find scary,</v>

142
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 2>so the next time someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be scared,</v>

143
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 2>it's just a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't believe them.</v>

144
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.963
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>

145
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.400
<v Speaker 5>Slightly full break from the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a little slot in the need of all</v>

146
00:07:04.231 --> 00:07:04.660
<v Speaker 5>back home.</v>
