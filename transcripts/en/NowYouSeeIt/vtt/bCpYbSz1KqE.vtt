1
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to now you see it</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought forth in art form,</v>

2
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>centered around seeing motion on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

3
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but film is far more than only visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>music plays a huge role in that</v>

4
00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:37.750
<v Speaker 1>heightened realism of what the fuck that</v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

5
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Different film scores can completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>alter the mood of a scene and filmmakers</v>

6
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>carefully pick their soundtracks or film</v>
<v Speaker 1>scores to convey certain emotions or</v>

7
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to look at the psychology of</v>

8
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how our brains respond to different</v>

9
00:00:55.351 --> 00:01:00.351
<v Speaker 1>auditory stimulation in movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about music in a film,</v>

10
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I should distinguish between a</v>
<v Speaker 1>soundtrack and a score.</v>

11
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 1>A film score is written specifically for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening on a screen while the</v>

12
00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>soundtrack contained songs independent</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the movie itself that weren't made</v>

13
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:13.600
<v Speaker 1>only for the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most films have both and one example is</v>

14
00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:15.970
<v Speaker 1>forest gump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has a soundtrack of songs not</v>

15
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:20.971
<v Speaker 1>solely associated with the movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a film score with music written</v>

16
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.430
<v Speaker 1>specifically and only for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really understand the importance of</v>

17
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>the music in a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should compare final cuts of movies</v>

18
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 1>with the intended film score and cuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>with removed or edited music.</v>

19
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>The famous psycho shower scene is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less frightening without a score.</v>

20
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 1>My favorite example to show the</v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of music in a film is the</v>

21
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 1>altering of this scene in the pirates of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Caribbean,</v>

22
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.020
<v Speaker 1>depending on the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seem to become triumphant,</v>

23
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>creepy or comical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using music to psychologically altruist</v>

24
00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>scene has been around the silent era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silent movies used to be accompanied</v>

25
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>with a live piano player who would play</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the movie.</v>

26
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music didn't interact with the movie</v>

27
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>at all and was only there to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>silence in the theater,</v>

28
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>but later piano players would either</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvise a lot with the movie or</v>

29
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>receive sheet music to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Along with the psychology of the</v>

30
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>accompaniment was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>

31
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>When the screen shows a villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the piano player plays a diminished</v>

32
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>minor chord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds Erie and unnerving.</v>

33
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Heroes get uplifting anthems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chase scenes have a fast tempo</v>

34
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.550
<v Speaker 1>and sad scenes are slow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>

35
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>Psychological musical techniques set the</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard for film scores in modern</v>

36
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>cinema,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while the orchestras have gotten</v>

37
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>bigger and the score is more effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general ideas of silent film,</v>

38
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>piano,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a company might have remained the same.</v>

39
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>The shower scene in psycho is a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>example of the psychology of music in</v>

40
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:48.480
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the scene,</v>

41
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Mary Crane gets stabbed to death in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shower,</v>

42
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>and the scene features one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective film scores in history.</v>

43
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.660
<v Speaker 1>This screeching sound of the violin</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimic sounds we biologically associate</v>

44
00:04:57.661 --> 00:05:00.450
<v Speaker 1>with stress and danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sound mimics cry for help.</v>

45
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>A study by the University of California</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2010 found that nonlinear alarm</v>

46
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:07.770
<v Speaker 1>sounds give us an emotional response</v>
<v Speaker 1>that instinctively unsettles us</v>

47
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:09.330
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Herman,</v>

48
00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Speaker 1>that composer of psycho purposefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed the film score to mimic</v>

49
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:16.800
<v Speaker 1>these unsettling noises and the effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the scene significantly scarier</v>

50
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:17.700
<v Speaker 1>and more unsettling.</v>

51
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.553
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

52
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.960
<v Speaker 1>In Jaws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hear the music before we see any</v>

53
00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:30.961
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This technique unsettles us in a</v>

54
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:37.680
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The anticipation of the danger is what</v>

55
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:40.650
<v Speaker 1>makes each scene so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we know something bad is</v>

56
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:43.020
<v Speaker 1>about to happen and the characters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie don't know,</v>

57
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.960
<v Speaker 1>add suspense to the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are warned of the danger through the</v>

58
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:49.650
<v Speaker 1>film score and have no choice but to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the horror unfold as the music</v>

59
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:51.900
<v Speaker 1>slowly speeds up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so does the camera and we feel</v>

60
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 1>psychological terror from the disorder</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the music and the anticipation of the</v>

61
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:56.454
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>

62
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.430
<v Speaker 1>The majority of film scores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though purposefully stay in the</v>

63
00:06:03.431 --> 00:06:06.100
<v Speaker 1>background and only provide subtle cues</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the audience.</v>

64
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Film score pioneer Aaron Copland gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>five ways a score serves the screen and</v>

65
00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:13.750
<v Speaker 1>most of them stay in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is to create a more convincing</v>

66
00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:15.160
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Place.</v>

67
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.670
<v Speaker 1>This one is pretty self explanatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many genres and settings have their own</v>

68
00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:21.850
<v Speaker 1>style of music to go with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The style of the film score puts us into</v>

69
00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:25.330
<v Speaker 1>a particular setting or genre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A classic example would be the Western,</v>

70
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.900
<v Speaker 1>which has a very distinct sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when bill and Ted go back in time to</v>

71
00:06:28.901 --> 00:06:31.090
<v Speaker 1>the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music changes along with them.</v>

72
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.070
<v Speaker 1>How's it going on Western?</v>

73
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Just like friends</v>

74
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 1>cheerla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Second music can underline psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>refinements,</v>

76
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.140
<v Speaker 1>unspoken thoughts or unseen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous get shown or reinforced</v>

77
00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:48.270
<v Speaker 1>through the music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may not see the danger,</v>

78
00:06:48.271 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>but the music reminds us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's their traced.</v>

79
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>The call is coming from inside though</v>

80
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.180
<v Speaker 2>to cut and edit any muggins you just.</v>

81
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yesterday I went food shopping for like</v>

82
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used a computer before I went to the</v>

83
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 3>store and when I came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my history,</v>

84
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 3>it was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cash was cleared and the cookies had</v>

85
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:15.824
<v Speaker 3>been reset.</v>

86
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Third is to build a sense of continuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the music between shots or scenes</v>

87
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:27.010
<v Speaker 1>is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We relate those scenes to each other.</v>

88
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>This includes montages or flashbacks.</v>

89
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.483
<v Speaker 2>Excellent</v>

90
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.640
<v Speaker 1>citizen king uses musical cues as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicator of a flashback.</v>

91
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.780
<v Speaker 1>He was with Mr Kane and me the first day</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Kane took over the choir</v>

92
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.230
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch me if you can.</v>

93
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:06.231
<v Speaker 1>The music is acute that the chase is on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fourth is to give a sense of finality,</v>

94
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.010
<v Speaker 1>copland's notes that this takes place</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually at the end of the film or after</v>

95
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.450
<v Speaker 1>some major trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The triumph that sound of the music</v>

96
00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:29.850
<v Speaker 1>psychologically links us to the triumph</v>
<v Speaker 1>on screen,</v>

97
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 1>and finally Coplin says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes music is just there to fill</v>

98
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 1>the silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

99
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 1>he states that this is the hardest films</v>
<v Speaker 1>court to do because the audience</v>

100
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holiday that recognizes that May 21st</v>

101
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.110
<v Speaker 4>other mother's Day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

102
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

103
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.740
<v Speaker 1>In a clockwork orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick has uplifting orchestra music</v>

104
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:31.570
<v Speaker 1>play while extreme acts of violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>occur on screen,</v>

105
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 1>the contradiction between comfort and</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical music and destruction that</v>

106
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:39.981
<v Speaker 1>adds tension and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>scores enhance the emotion of a scene,</v>

107
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.680
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes directors choose to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>use any music in this can work just as</v>

108
00:09:48.681 --> 00:09:50.450
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In no country for old men,</v>

109
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.320
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of the movie has no</v>
<v Speaker 1>music but mostly dialogue in ambient</v>

110
00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:57.470
<v Speaker 1>noise and it totally works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hearing nothing but a man's struggle for</v>

111
00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:02.471
<v Speaker 1>his life is pretty menacing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The storming of the beach scene and</v>

112
00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:09.580
<v Speaker 1>saving private Ryan overwhelms the</v>
<v Speaker 1>senses with the sounds of gunshots.</v>

113
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Explosions and cries for help</v>

114
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.410
<v Speaker 2>instead of a film score.</v>

115
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Our brains often subconsciously react</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently to a visual given the music</v>

116
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.260
<v Speaker 1>playing behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really interesting because</v>

117
00:10:33.261 --> 00:10:36.640
<v Speaker 1>of how subtle film scores can be and yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>how vital they are to a movie.</v>

118
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.700
