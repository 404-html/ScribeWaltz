00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>The Huffington Post published an article</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Twenty 15 titled No white people will</v>

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>never understand the black experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the writer reasons that a white person,</v>

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>no matter how blind to color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can only understand so much if something</v>

4
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>they cannot viscerally experience to</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

5
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Though white people must still educate</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves on schematic racism to help</v>

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>actively fight against something they</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot truly understand in the movie</v>

7
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>menace to society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Hughes brothers are on this exact</v>

8
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educating white people.</v>

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>We've made that movie for white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We made the film to inform them of</v>

10
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>something they didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I want to explore how movies teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice using various engaging</v>

12
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>cinematic techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>menace to society attempts to do what</v>

13
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>the Huffington Post says is impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie tries to give an outsider a</v>

14
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>window into what it's like to grow up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poor black neighborhood,</v>

15
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>and in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they teach outsiders to empathize with</v>

16
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>people in that situation.</v>

17
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>The movie accomplishes this from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>start in the first two moments,</v>

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>the writing scene and the convenience</v>
<v Speaker 1>store robbery.</v>

19
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>The writing footage purposefully gives a</v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted perspective of poor black</v>

20
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>people from the opening shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera looks at the carnage of the</v>

21
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>watts riots safely from a helicopter</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone would see live news footage</v>

22
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera is physically above the</v>

23
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>violence and looking down on the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding.</v>

24
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Once we get to ride footage on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground to the filming is from the</v>

25
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>perspective of the riot police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never the black people,</v>

26
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>the white news commentator in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background puts obvious emphasis on the</v>

27
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:22.611
<v Speaker 1>cops instead of the rioters</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the pixelation effect makes all the</v>

28
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>black people look the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>removing their face from the story.</v>

29
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>This allows the viewer to easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>generalize them as a group,</v>

30
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>not as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Hughes brothers are cleverly</v>

31
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>capturing the black experience in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical way and in a way many</v>

32
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>white people experienced black</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities from a distance and mostly</v>

33
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>with stereotypes.</v>

34
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>They further reinforced white</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes of black people by showing</v>

35
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>the main characters later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robbing a convenience store at another</v>

36
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical black behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They established this white bias so they</v>

37
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>can spend the rest of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstructing it.</v>

38
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>After the riot footage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go from a white commentator to a</v>

39
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>black narrator and we no longer see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people from a distance.</v>

40
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>We enter their homes and live within</v>
<v Speaker 1>their personal stories.</v>

41
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>That was the first time I'd ever seen my</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone killing anybody,</v>

42
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't the left I got used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The to compliment this intimacy,</v>

43
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>the violence in the film becomes much</v>
<v Speaker 1>grittier than the far removed violence</v>

44
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>be normally see in news footage from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>

45
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>The cinematography becomes clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colorful,</v>

46
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>and up close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This change was done intentionally by</v>

47
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>the Hughes brothers to show that</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence is not like what we see on TV.</v>

48
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>If it pops off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it pop off quick and make the</v>

49
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>aftermath ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like Rambo where guys just go down</v>

50
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Growing up,</v>

51
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>most violence just looked goofy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>unorthodox.</v>

52
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>People had twigs in their eyeballs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

53
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't pretty by first using various</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>

54
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>establishing the black community as</v>
<v Speaker 1>faceless violent riders.</v>

55
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>The rapid cinematic change of the black</v>
<v Speaker 1>community into up close,</v>

56
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>relatable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vulnerable characters,</v>

57
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>deconstructs the racial stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start with the poor black population as</v>

58
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 1>an outsider sees them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then bring the outsider in and challenge</v>

59
00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>their initial perspective with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal story of loss and excessive</v>

60
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.000
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Capture the racism and then deconstruct</v>

61
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting white people on the inside of</v>

62
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>poor black neighborhoods is a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy to helping them understand the</v>

63
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>cycle of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when pitching the movie to</v>

64
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>new line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

65
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is different between this and when</v>

66
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>we see the black guy on the news every</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning running from the helicopter,</v>

67
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.031
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>you're in the helicopter and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know why that kid is running.</v>

69
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>films have used bias,</v>

70
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.920
<v Speaker 1>cinematic techniques to highlight sexism</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as racism.</v>

71
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>This has done more subtly but just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerfully in the silence of the lambs.</v>

72
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>The main character arc in the movie is</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarice starling,</v>

73
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>overcoming the mental trauma of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>

74
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the backdrop of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggling to distinguish herself and in</v>

75
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>almost all male professional men</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexualized clarice throughout the movie.</v>

76
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's subtly checking her out or</v>
<v Speaker 1>outright asking her on a date,</v>

77
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>we see her isolation most powerfully and</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective point of view shots</v>

78
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>throughout the movie where we see</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of clarice all the</v>

79
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>towering male figures looking down on</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

80
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>These cinematic choices put us in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective of the victim.</v>

81
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Even the final scene has immense staring</v>
<v Speaker 1>her down with her,</v>

82
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>unable to see him echoing the men in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

83
00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>always watching her and looking down on</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

84
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>The underlying idea here is that even</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective experiences like growing up</v>

85
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>in a poor black neighborhood or being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman in a male dominated profession</v>

86
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>will always be impossible to experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an outsider,</v>

87
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>but directors use subjective film making</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques to try to recreate it,</v>

88
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes they do a pretty good job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they don't always get it</v>

89
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like historically mainstream</v>

90
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>American cinema has had trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>capturing authentic aspects of the Asian</v>

91
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up until very recently,</v>

92
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Asian characters were almost always</v>
<v Speaker 1>either the Sensei who teaches using his</v>

93
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Americanized eastern wisdom for a racist</v>
<v Speaker 1>punchline.</v>

94
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the most important idea to grasp</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these discussions of creating film</v>

95
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>bias is that they extend outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fictional storytelling.</v>

96
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>In a famous example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible that the police</v>

97
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>officers who physically assaulted Rodney</v>
<v Speaker 1>King were acquitted?</v>

98
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 1>There are many ways to approach this</v>
<v Speaker 1>question and the racial and political</v>

99
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>reasons for their acquittal are</v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniable,</v>

100
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 1>but another reason is necessary to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that trial,</v>

101
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 1>and it's how the lawyers defending the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles police department distorted</v>

102
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>the video footage of the beatings to</v>
<v Speaker 1>suit their story.</v>

103
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>The defense attorneys broke the video</v>
<v Speaker 1>down into stills freezing the frame so</v>

104
00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>that the gesture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the raised hand is torn from its</v>

105
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:04.100
<v Speaker 1>temporal place in the visual narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The video is not only violence</v>

106
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>decontextualized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but violently recontextualized.</v>

107
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.320
<v Speaker 1>It has played without a simultaneous</v>
<v Speaker 1>soundtrack which had it existed,</v>

108
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 1>would have been littered with racial and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual slurs against Rodney King,</v>

109
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>but lawyers whitewashed the footage for</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own narrative.</v>

110
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>This is a perfect example of racially</v>
<v Speaker 1>biased filmmaking used for evil.</v>

111
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.380
<v Speaker 1>The lawyers create a narrative that</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people are used to experiencing</v>

112
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>and this deceit tries to justify the</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously unjust beating of rodney king</v>

113
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>using buys filmmaking to create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted narrative is still happening.</v>

114
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever want to test this,</v>

115
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>see how two different media outlets film</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same event.</v>

116

<v Speaker 1>If your network supports Betsy devoss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her senate,</v>

117
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 1>hearing his films like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not,</v>

118
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>it's films like this.</v>

119
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.930
<v Speaker 1>The HUFFINGTON post article may be</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

120
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 1>quite people can never truly understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black experience,</v>

121
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>and this also applies to men who never</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly understand what it's like to be a</v>

122
00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>woman in a male dominated field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the closest we can get maybe through</v>

123
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>a close reading of commentary on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>black experience like in menace to</v>

124
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>society or by the perspectives in camera</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices,</v>

125
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>like in the silence of the lambs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each movie uses the power of</v>

126
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>cinematography to show experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of our own race or gender,</v>

127
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's the beauty of movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get sucked into lives and experiences</v>

128
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>we could never possibly experienced</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>

129
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>and some directors use that ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach us something about the world</v>

130
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>around us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When these choices are used for good,</v>

131
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>we learn about the human experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they're used for bad,</v>

132
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>they cloud the truth and present the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world in a narrow minded and dangerous</v>

133
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So keep a lookout.</v>

134
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>
