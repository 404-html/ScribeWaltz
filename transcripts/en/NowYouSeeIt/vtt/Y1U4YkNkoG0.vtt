00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>When many designers talk about stripes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to mention how much they stand</v>

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stripe is possibly the most</v>

3
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>noticeable pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immediate and repetitive change from</v>

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>one color to another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calls attention to itself,</v>

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>which explains why caution signs are</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost exclusively striped along with</v>

6
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>other things you need to see like</v>
<v Speaker 1>lighthouses signaling flags and the old</v>

7
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>fashioned barbershop pole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's no coincidence that the most</v>

8
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>famous cartoon you're always trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for has a striped shirt.</v>

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't blend in the designer of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>IBM logo,</v>

10
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>set it right stripes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attract attention.</v>

11
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>The visual power of the pattern possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from the inability to distinguish</v>

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>a stripes foreground from its</v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

13
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>There's something visually confusing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the layers of a stripe.</v>

14
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Notice how every optical illusion or</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypnosis video uses stripes.</v>

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>There's even an evolutionary theory that</v>
<v Speaker 1>zebras wear stripes to confuse</v>

16
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their number in distance.</v>

17
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>It works so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans copied the technique for world</v>

18
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>war two battleships and remember that</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of these traits apply as strongly</v>

19
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>to other patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Checkered feels more orderly.</v>

20
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Plat is less jarring and spots have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear foreground and background.</v>

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Stripes are the most extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripes are different,</v>

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>and these unique properties of stripes</v>
<v Speaker 1>have made them powerful symbols that</v>

23
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>have eventually evolve into signs of</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression,</v>

24
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>deviance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>

25
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>and daring style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter where stripes are,</v>

26
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>they are never subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My goal for this video is to talk about</v>

27
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>the theories of design and symbolism of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stripe in art history and design and</v>

28
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>apply those ideas to the stripes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

29
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>The significance of stripes and cinema</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually surprisingly under</v>

30
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>researched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the meaning of stripes in art and</v>

31
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>design should apply to movies as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not more so.</v>

32
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.661
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pastor,</v>

33
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and author of a book on the history of</v>

34
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>stripes did have one movie in mind when</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussing the power of stripes</v>

35
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>historically spellbound by Alfred</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitchcock,</v>

36
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man with a phobia of lines against a</v>

37
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>white background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man with an actual fear of stripes.</v>

38
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I doubt a movie could pull that off with</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other pattern and it just goes to</v>

39
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>show how the contrast of stripes has</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive appeal to the eye of the</v>

40
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If stripes can literally be somebody</v>

41
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>phobia in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must mean something,</v>

42
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>but I'm getting ahead of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historically,</v>

43
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>the natural properties of stripes gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>them symbolic meaning in western Europe</v>

44
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>and their power at that time can't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimated.</v>

45
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>When a Stripe Orange Catholic religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>group came to Europe from the Crusader</v>

46
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>states in the twelfth century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were ridiculed for how they were</v>

47
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>addressed to the point that Pope</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexander the fourth band,</v>

48
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.100
<v Speaker 1>all clergy men from wearing stripes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle ages when the type of</v>

49
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>clothing always indicated your social</v>
<v Speaker 1>status stripes pointed out the deviance</v>

50
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who wasn't an honest citizen in</v>

51
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>art strike people are more often than</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

52
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>the gestures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitutes,</v>

53
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>executioners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or traders in a twelfth century painting</v>

54
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>God gifts Adam and Eve a striped garment</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they are expelled from paradise.</v>

55
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stripes indicate they have committed</v>

56
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>acts of shame and sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

57
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>the striped bedding in this 14th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

58
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>French painting shows the immorality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing.</v>

59
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>In an era where what you wore with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear indication of your social status,</v>

60
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>the flashiness of the strike meant you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were a social deviant and its meaning</v>

61
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>was taken very seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was often even associated with</v>

62
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>monsters and the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This traditional perception of stripes</v>

63
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>made its way into the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many deviant women in film have worn</v>

64
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>stripes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the most convincing example is how</v>

65
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>the wicked witch of the East is</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguished only by her boldly striped</v>

66
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>black and white stockings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That same year,</v>

67
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Dallas and stage coach has a similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripe moment and she's a prostitute in</v>

68
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.454
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>

69
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.750
<v Speaker 1>possibly originating in the penal</v>
<v Speaker 1>colonies of America.</v>

70
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Prisoners also war stripes as a uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

71
00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:23.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a classic sign of the deviant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies are no different,</v>

72
00:03:23.301 --> 00:03:27.050
<v Speaker 1>and while the stripe as a badge of shame</v>
<v Speaker 1>continued later centuries introduced</v>

73
00:03:27.051 --> 00:03:30.770
<v Speaker 1>different interpretations of the pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting in the 16th century strikes</v>

74
00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:33.470
<v Speaker 1>shifted from being strictly diabolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>into Tamer.</v>

75
00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Eventually positive meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became a uniform for servants and</v>

76
00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:40.070
<v Speaker 1>found its way on textiles integrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>its way into the home.</v>

77
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

78
00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:44.300
<v Speaker 1>is the American revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Introducing the stripe to flag as a</v>

79
00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Speaker 1>symbol of rebellion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took a pattern used for the</v>

80
00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:49.700
<v Speaker 1>prisoners of the American south and made</v>
<v Speaker 1>it their battle cry,</v>

81
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.340
<v Speaker 1>showing how they felt like prisoners</v>
<v Speaker 1>under British rule.</v>

82
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.200
<v Speaker 1>The French followed suit and from then</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

83
00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:57.830
<v Speaker 1>those in favor of the movement of</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom could wear stripes to show their</v>

84
00:03:57.831 --> 00:03:59.750
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really the stripes meaning hadn't</v>

85
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.130
<v Speaker 1>explicitly changed.</v>

86
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.700
<v Speaker 1>It's still a sign of an outsider or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>deviant as the revolutionaries.</v>

87
00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Clearly we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's no longer exclusively negative</v>

88
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.160
<v Speaker 1>movies showed these multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations of the strike.</v>

89
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.100
<v Speaker 1>In some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pattern is a sign of the delinquent</v>

90
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.320
<v Speaker 1>in others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are worn on purpose to signal</v>

91
00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:18.440
<v Speaker 1>somebody unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dual meaning of stripes even shows</v>

92
00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:21.770
<v Speaker 1>itself in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Study of stripes in 2015 mentioned how</v>

93
00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:26.060
<v Speaker 1>many animals use them as a warning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>signal an unpleasant consequence of an</v>

94
00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:29.930
<v Speaker 1>attack while others use stripes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attract attention from a potential mate,</v>

95
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.220
<v Speaker 1>so stripes can be equally good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American cinema in the 19 fifties showed</v>

96
00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:37.460
<v Speaker 1>the rebellious meaning of the stripe</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to the big screen with many high</v>

97
00:04:37.461 --> 00:04:41.300
<v Speaker 1>profile actors wearing the Breton Stripe</v>
<v Speaker 1>in movies directed a teens and young</v>

98
00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:44.480
<v Speaker 1>adults all warned by characters who</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't follow the status quo.</v>

99
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.210
<v Speaker 1>This movement also spread to artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers,</v>

100
00:04:47.211 --> 00:04:50.120
<v Speaker 1>and the Ramones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what stripes also being worn as a</v>

101
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:53.060
<v Speaker 1>point of pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see people using stripes to stand out</v>

102
00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:53.840
<v Speaker 1>on purpose.</v>

103
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.620
<v Speaker 1>A classic example is the gangster</v>
<v Speaker 1>gangster is actually wore pinstripes in</v>

104
00:04:57.621 --> 00:04:59.780
<v Speaker 1>real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that style made its way into the</v>

105
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:02.270
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gangsters outfits commonly have stripes</v>

106
00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 1>to look flashy as they flaunt their</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth and status to the point that some</v>

107
00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:09.320
<v Speaker 1>of them look tasteless for the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>crooked over the top male characters.</v>

108
00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Notice how crazy the stripes become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kind of stripe also matters.</v>

109
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Long fixed stripes seem to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flashy characters,</v>

110
00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:16.160
<v Speaker 1>but thin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleek,</v>

111
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:18.650
<v Speaker 1>stripes look more fashionable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could make the argument that</v>

112
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.010
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers use bold stripes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>businessmen to make them seem more</v>

113
00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:24.440
<v Speaker 1>crooked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stripes can also look very chic.</v>

114
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Old Structure Calls for solid colored or</v>
<v Speaker 1>discretely pattern suits and ties.</v>

115
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.330
<v Speaker 1>The more pronounced the stripe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazier filmmaking has certainly</v>

116
00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.000
<v Speaker 1>taken advantage of the disorienting</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the stripe.</v>

117
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.510
<v Speaker 1>It's no coincidence that a striped cat</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an illusionist and the introduction</v>

118
00:05:38.511 --> 00:05:42.650
<v Speaker 1>to cycle works because the imbalance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stripes looks off like the slicing</v>

119
00:05:42.651 --> 00:05:43.370
<v Speaker 1>of a knife.</v>

120
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.950
<v Speaker 1>There's also a complicated relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>between stripes,</v>

121
00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:47.810
<v Speaker 1>children and hygiene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelle,</v>

122
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.480
<v Speaker 1>pastor rose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>study of stripes mentions how underwear</v>

123
00:05:50.481 --> 00:05:53.960
<v Speaker 1>into under garments were completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>white because the people of the Middle</v>

124
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Ages saw dice and coloring as a form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>contamination while was pure and</v>

125
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

126
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>no color ever directly touch the body in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century.</v>

127
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strength became a way to add style</v>

128
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>to pajamas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towels and underwear while keeping some</v>

129
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>whiteness in the clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the current day,</v>

130
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Prince George always wearing stripes</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it has become a symbol of</v>

131
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>hygiene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a little bit of the</v>

132
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>original meaning of stripes and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>children are playfully deviant,</v>

133
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>not quite fitting in with society</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

134
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>And so some filmmakers do stripes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>evoke a childishness to characters which</v>

135
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>is in its own way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a form of deviance.</v>

136
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Ever since the gestures and jugglers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medieval ages,</v>

137
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>mankind has had an understanding that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripes can also look childish,</v>

138
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>silly and funny.</v>

139
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that all the stripes done</v>

140
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>in movies were done with knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stripes history.</v>

141
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had even considered the meaning</v>

142
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>or history of stripes until the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade or so.</v>

143
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to say is the design of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stripe naturally causes it to stand</v>

144
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>out and so it makes sense that in movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>where wardrobe is meticulously chosen,</v>

145
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers subconsciously or consciously</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to that extreme change from one</v>

146
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>color to the next to tell us something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the character.</v>

147
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're downright evil or they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rebellious teen.</v>

148
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stripes helps show they are a</v>

149
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>deviant from the status quo in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and movies understand this dual meaning.</v>

150
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Think about the title of the boy in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>striped pajamas.</v>

151
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 1>In one sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>striped pajamas are a sign of fashion,</v>

152
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>comfort and the playful child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the audience knows the real reason.</v>

153
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.060
<v Speaker 1>His clothes were striped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie's title plays on our cultures,</v>

154
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 1>multiple interpretations of the Stripe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Juno is perhaps the most complicated and</v>

155
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:23.180
<v Speaker 1>effective the use of stripes I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movies.</v>

156
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.250
<v Speaker 1>It's the pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Juno,</v>

157
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>whereas most often and it became her</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol in the trailers and poster art.</v>

158
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>It fits her character perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's playful,</v>

159
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 1>childish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stands out with her,</v>

160
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>sharp over the top dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's also a deviant as a pregnant</v>

161
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:38.080
<v Speaker 1>teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She self identifies as rebellious and it</v>

162
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>has unconventional taste in music and</v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

163
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Speaker 1>She commands attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both good and bad and the stripes are</v>

164
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>the perfect companion to her character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no matter what they're used for,</v>

165
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>stripes always stands out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may Joseph's coat standout in the</v>

166
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Bible and they compliment Juno's</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncontained,</v>

167
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:56.210
<v Speaker 1>which we're just starting to see more</v>
<v Speaker 1>research into the symbolism of the</v>

168
00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>stripe and I invite you to look into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

169
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I recently noticed the evil Gremlin is</v>
<v Speaker 1>need stripe and it totally fits with the</v>

170
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:05.800
<v Speaker 1>original Association of stripes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters and how he's a deviant,</v>

171
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 1>as the Gremlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most evil.</v>

172
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are tons of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of stripes and movies out</v>

173
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't come across.</v>

174

176
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 1>If you think of any stripes in movies or</v>
<v Speaker 1>come across any in the future,</v>

177
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 1>there's another link where you can</v>

178
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.890

<v Speaker 1>possible meaning might be in the</v>

179
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll continue adding screenshots to make</v>

180
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 1>the first compiled collection of stripes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in film available on the Internet.</v>

181
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Graphic designers have understood the</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of stripes for a long time even</v>

182
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>before there was any research on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ibm logo is a famous example,</v>

183
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>but you can also look at Adidas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>

184
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:44.120
<v Speaker 1>and a t and t to see how companies use</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripes to convey speed and going</v>

185
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 1>against the status quo.</v>

186
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Professional logo designers are some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the few people who do understand the</v>

187
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the stripe.</v>
