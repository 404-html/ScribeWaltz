1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.370
<v Speaker 1>The dollies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zoom is one of the most disorienting and</v>

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>flashy camera techniques of all time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it shows up in some of the most</v>

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>beloved scenes in cinematic history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's famous for,</v>

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>it's bizarre look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the shot also teaches us a lot about</v>

5
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows the different kinds of lenses</v>

6
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>and how to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It enhances the emotion of the scene and</v>

7
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>it can be used in subtle places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not have even noticed.</v>

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dollies zoom or sometimes called the</v>

9
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>vertical effect started in hitchcock's</v>
<v Speaker 1>film vertigo in 1958 you need a smooth</v>

10
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>track and steady zoom to pull it off</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely,</v>

11
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>which is why it wasn't developed sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shot is essentially an optical</v>

12
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>illusion because by zooming in or out on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera lens while tracking the</v>

13
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>camera forward or backward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the result is the foreground stays in</v>

14
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>the same position.</v>

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>While the background appears to squeeze</v>
<v Speaker 1>or stretch,</v>

16
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>depending on which direction you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually teaches an important</v>

17
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>principle of filming camera Lens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever wanted to see the difference</v>

18
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>between wide angle and telephoto lenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A simplified example would be to observe</v>

19
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>at.compare how it begins to how it ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dollies soon shot can start like a</v>

20
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>telephoto lens for the camera is far</v>
<v Speaker 1>away and the focal length is bigger.</v>

21
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>There's less background insight because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lens concentrates on a smaller</v>

22
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>portion of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you change focal lens by</v>

23
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>zooming out while also pushing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera forward,</v>

24
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.630
<v Speaker 1>you can observe more of the background</v>
<v Speaker 1>while keeping the foreground in the same</v>

25
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result is filming the same thing,</v>

26
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>but the camera expands to see more of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the background.</v>

27
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>The change in focal length takes in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wider area,</v>

28
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>so you go from a telephoto shot to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide angle shot.</v>

29
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 1>You generally use telephoto and closeups</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep attention on the foreground when</v>

30
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>you move the camera around while using a</v>
<v Speaker 1>telephoto Lens,</v>

31
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>the background whips quickly behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreground because the camera takes in</v>

32
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>less of the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes for some pretty cool shots.</v>

33
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>People also tend to look better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>telephoto because their faces aren't</v>

34
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>stressed by the wider Lens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wide Angle takes in more of the</v>

35
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's better for outdoor shots.</v>

36
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>When you want to capture the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so each lens is a tradeoff,</v>

37
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>the dollies and captures the transition</v>
<v Speaker 1>from one kind of lens shot to the other</v>

38
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>and it leads to different emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>responses for the viewer.</v>

39
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Vertigo uses the dollies zoom to give a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of height.</v>

40
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>This increase in height perfectly</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodies how the telephoto has a more</v>

41
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>narrow view of the background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'd go from capturing a lot of the</v>

42
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>background to capturing very little.</v>

43
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>The results is a dizzying optical</v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion.</v>

44
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>The shot is unsettling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a little bit nauseating for some</v>

45
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>because it's physically impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience without some kind of lens</v>

46
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>alteration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In goodfellas,</v>

47
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>the diner scene becomes all the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing as the landscape shifts around</v>

48
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>them and impossible ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as Henry's world is crushing and</v>

49
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>his paranoia grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impossible movement of the diner</v>

50
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.860
<v Speaker 1>shows just how disoriented he feels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The zoom makes the world literally close</v>

51
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>in around him as getting caught seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost inevitable.</v>

52
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wide Angle Lens makes people look a</v>

53
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>bit off with the famous Dolly's zoom in</v>
<v Speaker 1>jaws,</v>

54
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>the shot shifts to a wide angle look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes his face look just a bit</v>

55
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>more stretched and unnatural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it unconsciously adds to the rest of</v>

56
00:02:34.891 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>the freakiness of the shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those three examples,</v>

57
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>vertigo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jaws and Goodfellas,</v>

58
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>or the Goto examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever anybody mentions the dollies</v>

59
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>zoom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the promise that when teaching the shot,</v>

60
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>the examples usually stop there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a shame because it makes a shot</v>

61
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>seem like a one off effect for legendary</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

62
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually a lot more versatile</v>
<v Speaker 1>and common than that.</v>

63
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>It's out of this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Visual look makes it commonly used for</v>

64
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>the supernatural or the feeling of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug trip.</v>

65
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I particularly enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's used in the Lord of the rings</v>

66
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>because the widening of the holes in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees gives the visual feeling that the</v>

67
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>forest is opening up a portal for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy to come.</v>

68
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>It's almost always used out of movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climactic ethic moment,</v>

69
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>so if you're a hero fails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it adds to the punchline.</v>

70
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>The shot has even found its way into</v>
<v Speaker 1>animation.</v>

71
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Bradford uses it extensively in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>

72
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>The food critic flashback gets enhanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a dollar zoom effect to simulate</v>

73
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>the transportation from one world to</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

74
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Animation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly computer generated,</v>

75
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>has a distinct opportunity to use the</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo in interesting ways because of</v>

76
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>animations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete control of object placement.</v>

77
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>As remy relates to chef Gusteau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dollies whom is no longer used to</v>

78
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>disorient the viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to show them,</v>

79
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>get physically closer together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicating a relationship is born.</v>

80
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.010
<v Speaker 1>The incredibles has a seemingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible Dolly's.</v>

81
00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Soon as Mrs incredible gets closer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temptation.</v>

82
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Both instances are non disruptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also draw our attention to certain</v>

83
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.480
<v Speaker 1>parts of the shot with its trademark</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeezing effect.</v>

84
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>The Delis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whom is certainly a fantastical shot at</v>

85
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>the disposal of the filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But remember,</v>

86
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:56.510
<v Speaker 1>it's more than just a cheap trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alfred Hitchcock use different depths or</v>

87
00:03:56.511 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>says he used it to show paranoia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Brad Bird used it for visual cues.</v>

88
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>So be on the lookout for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>

89
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you staring at fucker?</v>

90
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.410
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
