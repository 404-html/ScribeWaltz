00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.710
<v Speaker 1>When you hear the word improvisation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of?</v>

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.770
<v Speaker 1>You May 1st think of Improv comedy.</v>

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I did is acting.</v>

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 1>You may have also thought of improvised</v>
<v Speaker 1>jazz breaks,</v>

5
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>freestyle rap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even improvised explosive.</v>

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 2>The reason</v>

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>each of these things still counts as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improv is because Improv isn't defined</v>

8
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>by the product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather the process for making the</v>

9
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>product improvising is creating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>performing spontaneously and without any</v>

10
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in film,</v>

11
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.990
<v Speaker 1>any dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera shot,</v>

12
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>or even a reaction that's unrehearsed or</v>
<v Speaker 1>unprepared can be improv.</v>

13
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Hopkins got an unrehearsed</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction out of Jodie foster when he</v>

14
00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>went off script to make fun of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>accent Gfr,</v>

15
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>the Dag a coal mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just tingling and Alan Rickman</v>

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>surprised expression in die hard comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the stuntmen dropping him on the</v>

17
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>count of two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not three.</v>

18
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.760
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt that improv leads to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious performances.</v>

19
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't know you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I saw you make a spinach dip and a</v>

20
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Lopa sourdough bread once and actors</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition can make for the best laughs,</v>

21
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>tears or surprises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how subtle,</v>

22
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>like the improvised clapping of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>joker.</v>

23
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>In this essay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about the strengths and</v>

25
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>limitations of Improv and why filmmakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>use different cinematic techniques to</v>

26
00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>make their films appear improvised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best improvisation is when actors</v>

27
00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>play the game of the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any improvised scene.</v>

28
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Each actor has certain rules for how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>act and react based on their character's</v>

29
00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what roles do is they free us up to</v>

30
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>improvise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 1>By giving ourselves these constrictions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guide our impulses,</v>

32
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 1>it funnels our creative process into</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of product.</v>

33
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.590
<v Speaker 1>The process of improvisation and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules help us create something.</v>

34
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>The rules the actor must follow along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the conflict between characters</v>

35
00:01:51.221 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 1>makes an improvised scene work well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good at Improv stems from conflict and</v>

36
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:57.580
<v Speaker 1>personality with each character playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game.</v>

37
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear the most annoying sound in</v>

38
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:05.611
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dustin Hoffman's reaction was</v>

39
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>improvised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When an actual taxi driver drove onset</v>

40
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>during the filming of midnight cowboy</v>

41
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.043
<v Speaker 3>boy</v>

42
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>reaction completely embodies his</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

43
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>The conflict is realistic and it adds to</v>
<v Speaker 1>his character showing he's not as smooth</v>

44
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 1>and cool as tries to appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same applies to dramatic Improv.</v>

45
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Robert De Niro perfectly embodies travis</v>
<v Speaker 1>is loneliness,</v>

46
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 1>isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoia,</v>

47
00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>and aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With this improvised scene,</v>

48
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 2>you talking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to me,</v>

49
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>play the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the rules.</v>

50
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Improvisation doesn't work when</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters don't play the game in</v>

51
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>pixels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam Sandler has a meeting with the</v>

52
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>president and other executives and out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere he just starts going around</v>

53
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>the room insulting people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conflict makes no sense and the</v>

54
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>insulting doesn't go along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandler's personality.</v>

55
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced Adam Sandler partially</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvise the scene and it's painful to</v>

56
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>watch because it doesn't come close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the game.</v>

57
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.390
<v Speaker 2>GRANDPA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll see you around maybe a nursing</v>

58
00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:06.224
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>

59
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.380
<v Speaker 1>One limitation of improvisation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes the lack of a resolution to</v>

60
00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:14.130
<v Speaker 1>the scene referred to as the button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The button is the final moment before</v>

61
00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Speaker 1>the end of the scene that resolves the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict with a final joke or comment</v>

62
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.950
<v Speaker 1>key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and peele very consistently has the</v>

63
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:22.800
<v Speaker 1>button at the end of their sketches that</v>
<v Speaker 1>neatly ends the game.</v>

64
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.810
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a sketch where college</v>

65
00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:27.960
<v Speaker 1>football players state their names and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game is that their names get more</v>

66
00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:32.820
<v Speaker 1>and more ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call royal smoochy walls versus Meyer.</v>

67
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.660
<v Speaker 1>The button is a resolution to the chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the names and ends the sketch</v>

68
00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:38.310
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan Smith,</v>

69
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Byu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some improvise scenes don't have the</v>

70
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:43.590
<v Speaker 1>button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result is seems that either go too</v>

71
00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:46.320
<v Speaker 1>long or have an unsatisfying ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Director.</v>

72
00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Judd apatow has great improvised scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with great jokes,</v>

73
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:51.330
<v Speaker 1>but the drawback is the scenes don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really end.</v>

74
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.660
<v Speaker 1>They sometimes kind of just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nature of spontaneity means an</v>

75
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:57.990
<v Speaker 1>improvised scene can't always be</v>
<v Speaker 1>structured as well as a scripted scene.</v>

76
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>This isn't always the case for</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvisation though sometimes the</v>

77
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:03.480
<v Speaker 1>ending is perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a certainty with a scene</v>

78
00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:06.570
<v Speaker 1>that's entirely improvised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just make 10 louder and</v>

79
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:09.750
<v Speaker 1>make tend to be the top number and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a little loud?</v>

80
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 2>These cards are 11</v>

81
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Martin Scorsese likes to mimic</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvisation in his films.</v>

82
00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Despite them actually being scripted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes the scenes look like a</v>

83
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 1>documentary as if they're unrehearsed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where he blurs the line</v>

84
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:28.910
<v Speaker 1>between documentary and fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The effect is films that seem extremely</v>

85
00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>realistic and spontaneous means streets</v>
<v Speaker 1>appears very improvised.</v>

86
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>The opening title sequence in a home</v>
<v Speaker 1>video aspect ratio has characters act</v>

87
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.990
<v Speaker 1>very naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera shots are all handheld.</v>

88
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.070
<v Speaker 1>The music is to sal chick and even the</v>
<v Speaker 1>text was super imposed using blown up</v>

89
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:45.590
<v Speaker 1>typewriter text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A method commonly reserved for</v>

90
00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:49.190
<v Speaker 1>documentaries and home videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opening sequence shows everyday life</v>

91
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:51.530
<v Speaker 1>for this group of Italian Americans in</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

92
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.770
<v Speaker 1>The use of footage and action that looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvised makes the movie seem more</v>

93
00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:57.740
<v Speaker 1>casual and realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contrast this movie with something like</v>

94
00:04:57.741 --> 00:05:00.560
<v Speaker 1>the Godfather with an epic score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic deaths,</v>

95
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.970
<v Speaker 1>intense acting and cryptic dark lighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see how mimicked improvisation</v>

96
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.920
<v Speaker 1>gives a totally different mood to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

97
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.760
<v Speaker 1>The fictional documentary style goes as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far back as citizen Kane when the news</v>

98
00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:14.870
<v Speaker 1>on the march sequence recreated real</v>
<v Speaker 1>life new segments making Charles Kane</v>

99
00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:18.350
<v Speaker 1>seemed like a real world figure while</v>
<v Speaker 1>also establishing the contrast between</v>

100
00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:21.140
<v Speaker 1>his public and private life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife used to farm and she was</v>

101
00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 1>nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had also,</v>

102
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing cuisines.</v>

103
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.490
<v Speaker 1>She used to fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improv does more than just make us</v>

104
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:30.950
<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improvisation is a process that makes</v>

105
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:33.980
<v Speaker 1>for great scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes an actor's best tool is</v>

106
00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:37.610
<v Speaker 1>getting into character and seeing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>can happen spontaneously and even when</v>

107
00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:39.980
<v Speaker 1>it's imitated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The improvised documentary look,</v>

108
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.200
<v Speaker 1>adds realism to a film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So don't forget,</v>

109
00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:45.530
<v Speaker 1>an actor can give a great performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>based solely on the process they go</v>

110
00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:46.370
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internally.</v>

<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
