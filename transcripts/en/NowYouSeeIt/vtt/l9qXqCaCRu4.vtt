00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.170
<v Speaker 1>At 3:00 in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he was sending me to get</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.013
<v Speaker 1>on at first.</v>

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.110
<v Speaker 2>The setup for this is that is that his</v>
<v Speaker 2>limo driver says he's got to stop</v>

4
00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he stops in the ghetto.</v>

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.730
<v Speaker 2>It's Dave in the ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a limo.</v>

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

7
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.633
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

9
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

10
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is that you do exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I what a honky would do in the</v>

11
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:22.284
<v Speaker 2>ghetto.</v>

12
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was crack the window a little bit.</v>

14
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.250
<v Speaker 1>The job starts out in a limousine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew he was taking to the ghetto</v>

15
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>because I'm looking out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like gunstock,</v>

16
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>snow and snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

17
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a little statement,</v>

18
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:40.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's not preachy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not painting the picture.</v>

19
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Paint a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

20
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Then we get to the ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was in Washington.</v>

21
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.710
<v Speaker 1>I saw some kids running around playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

22
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>who has the kids just running out on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>streets like this and this.</v>

23
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it could be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might need my help.</v>

24
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I got to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't gonna get out the car.</v>

25
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True Story.</v>

26
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Now did the baby talk to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

27
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.500
<v Speaker 1>was was selling weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

28
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was making a point and here I am a</v>

29
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>black man in a limousine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're getting into the class issues</v>

30
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.710
<v Speaker 1>right in the ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's true than just I pride myself on</v>

31
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.820
<v Speaker 1>saying real shit that people don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice I'm saying,</v>

32
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>but they feel it because when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up to me,</v>

33
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>they they say that I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that they can feel it,</v>

34
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you pointed that out,</v>

35
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I was very impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

36
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Was your early comedy autobiographical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's yes,</v>

37
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>but never directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give away my secret</v>

38
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:46.880
<v Speaker 1>recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want to know what happened to me</v>

39
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 4>on the new season of the sopranos or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dave Chappelle,</v>

40
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.930
<v Speaker 4>so received.</v>

41
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 1>If the $5,000,000</v>

42
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 3>shit on TV</v>
<v Speaker 3>though</v>

43
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 4>Chappelle supposedly had it all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a $50,000,000 contract from comedy</v>

44
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:22.580
<v Speaker 4>central,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hit TV show,</v>

45
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 4>best selling dvds on April 28th of last</v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

46
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.660
<v Speaker 4>Dave abruptly walked away not only from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the set of the show but for $50,</v>

47
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.090
<v Speaker 4>million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which he left his fans shock and most</v>

48
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 4>everyone completely puzzled.</v>

49
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.510
<v Speaker 2>One of the most promising comedians of</v>
<v Speaker 2>recent history have left a successful</v>

50
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 2>television series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could he have walked away from a</v>

51
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 2>$50,000,000 contract?</v>

52
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you start telling them this</v>

53
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.430
<v Speaker 1>story and when I'm walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street and be like,</v>

54
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.141
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this right.</v>

55
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:54.140
<v Speaker 1>You tell it how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

56
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just say what it feels.</v>

57
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't say it directly.</v>

58
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.473
<v Speaker 5>There's a book</v>

59
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>to me that encapsulates my entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience before I left the show.</v>

60
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.290
<v Speaker 1>In the book is called Pimp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>written by a black American who was a</v>

61
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.410
<v Speaker 1>pimping the forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He describes in detail how these men</v>

62
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.440
<v Speaker 1>break women so that they will give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money that they make with their own</v>

63
00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:31.520
<v Speaker 1>bodies because a guy that generates</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

64
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.250
<v Speaker 1>people have a vested interest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling.</v>

65
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a story in his so cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me shudder to think about it.</v>

66
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.110
<v Speaker 1>The iceberg slim is trying to control</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman that he finds uncontrollable.</v>

67
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>I will go to work on this show and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt awful.</v>

68
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Every day felt like some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitute or something like that,</v>

69
00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>but I feel so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why keep showing up to this place?</v>

70
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>So he asked older how it can rein her in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the older pimps says,</v>

71
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easy iceberg.</v>

72
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.240
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is beat that bitch</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a coat hanger.</v>

73
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.630
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of instances I was deliberately</v>
<v Speaker 1>being put the stress and then run her</v>

75
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>bath and give him some pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried to get me to take</v>

76
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.750
<v Speaker 1>psychotic medication?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll be so grateful that you fixed the</v>

77
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.900
<v Speaker 1>shoe for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will the motherfucker that beat them</v>

78
00:04:20.901 --> 00:04:24.470
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the hostility of the</v>

79
00:04:24.471 --> 00:04:28.130
<v Speaker 1>environment of Showbiz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's something else going on.</v>

80
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe these rapes aren't even the worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

81
00:04:31.191 --> 00:04:32.024
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be something?</v>

82
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't that be something?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now?</v>

83
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.380
<v Speaker 1>End of this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iceberg Slim tells the story is kind of</v>

84
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 1>the crescendo of the book iceberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slim's bottom bitch is at the end of a</v>

85
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.841
<v Speaker 1>mileage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choose bubbling.</v>

86
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:48.330
<v Speaker 1>You could see she was going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to let it go.</v>

87
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bottom bitch go and he wasn't ready to</v>

88
00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>let it go because it's organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't handle losing her for days</v>

89
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.750
<v Speaker 1>released and it fits all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible records.</v>

90
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Know like how many central was a hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>place to be.</v>

91
00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:03.800
<v Speaker 1>When I showed up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

92
00:05:03.801 --> 00:05:05.930
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy in an hotel across the street,</v>

93
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.690
<v Speaker 1>it's waiting for you in room number</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven when should go over there and I</v>

94
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:13.280
<v Speaker 1>want you to fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before you do and he to put some of</v>

95
00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 1>this stuff in this drink.</v>

96
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 6>I slept a small vial of mineral oil into</v>
<v Speaker 6>her poem.</v>

97
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.450
<v Speaker 6>I told her it was chloral hydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>only two drops.</v>

98
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:23.430
<v Speaker 6>We're not to suck out.</v>

99
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did everything you said,</v>

100
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.890
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then Mandel look right some wrong.</v>

101
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you mean something's wrong?</v>

102
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you put that stuff in his drink?</v>

103
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.910
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did everything.</v>

104
00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:34.130
<v Speaker 1>He said that I put all of it in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>

105
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.851
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

106
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:35.840
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

107
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.760
<v Speaker 1>You put all of it in his drink.</v>

108
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 6>I knelt beside him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>blocking her view with my back.</v>

109
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.110
<v Speaker 6>I wiped my brow and turned my face to</v>
<v Speaker 6>water.</v>

110
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 6>My eyes were wide and alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

111
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.483
<v Speaker 6>baby,</v>

112
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.550
<v Speaker 1>he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

113
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.510
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

114
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.343
<v Speaker 1>Let me think.</v>

115
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.340
<v Speaker 6>I can fix this for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She squeezed tightly against me.</v>

116
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.760
<v Speaker 6>I kept telling her she had nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 6>worry about.</v>

117
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.510
<v Speaker 6>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we went together for life and her secret</v>

118
00:06:10.511 --> 00:06:14.830
<v Speaker 6>would always be safe with me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She found out about the hoax years</v>

119
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.663
<v Speaker 6>later.</v>

120
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 1>That's how the whole shit works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies,</v>

121
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 1>you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bitch was at the end of the</v>

122
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>mileage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was at four 98.</v>

123
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>She ended up triggering for iceberg for</v>
<v Speaker 1>another six months.</v>

124
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>She must have done another 200 tricks</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>

125
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No like the whore that they turned us</v>

126
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped on that plane and left my</v>

127
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 1>father's bedside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are granted his day and I went out</v>

128
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>and I sat with these people in this room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

129
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.600
<v Speaker 6>you got to make them have hard and fast</v>
<v Speaker 6>to stick them for the long scratch.</v>

130
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:48.250
<v Speaker 6>Quip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So slim,</v>

131
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.380
<v Speaker 6>be as sweet as scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No sweeter and always stick a hole for</v>

132
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.990
<v Speaker 6>bundle before you sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

133
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 6>Ho ain't nothing but a trick to a pimp</v>

134
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>whole Dave chappelle thing is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

135
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.280
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like I'm going to be some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of parable by either what you're</v>

136
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do with what you nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm either going to be a legend or just</v>

138
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:17.660
<v Speaker 1>that tragic story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going full throttle.</v>

139
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going on way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>

140
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm eager to find out how this will</v>

141
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:25.090
<v Speaker 1>resolve itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of being courageous is that</v>

142
00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:27.910
<v Speaker 1>even though you're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just do the right thing.</v>

143
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in 2004,</v>

144
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I walked away from $15,000,000 and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>November I made a deal for $60,000,000.</v>

145
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Are you having fun this time around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am making a point to have fun in the</v>

146
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.800
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

147
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.580
<v Speaker 7>This video took tons of editing tricks</v>
<v Speaker 7>to carefully assembled these interviews</v>

148
00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:53.280
<v Speaker 7>in a seamless way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I didn't know a handful of shortcuts,</v>

149
00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.730
<v Speaker 7>it would have taken significantly longer</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I would've wasted tons of time.</v>

150
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.130
<v Speaker 7>The best way to get started on any</v>
<v Speaker 7>editing software,</v>

151
00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:02.100
<v Speaker 7>it's definitely a tutorial that will</v>
<v Speaker 7>teach you how to edit efficiently,</v>

152
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.470
<v Speaker 7>like the high quality tutorials on</v>
