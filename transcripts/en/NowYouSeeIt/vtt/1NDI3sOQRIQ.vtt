00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to now you see it when</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters drought in movies,</v>

2
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>they're gone forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more than just the character leaves.</v>

3
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>They always take something with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they take away fear,</v>

4
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>a friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust in others or a desire to go</v>

5
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>somewhere new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happens when a character starts</v>

6
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>drowning and survives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's not gone forever,</v>

7
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>but instead he's alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he isn't just alive.</v>

8
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>He's alive all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He supposed to be dead when he rises up</v>

9
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>key changes,</v>

10
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>but change isn't the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more violent than change.</v>

11
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.743
<v Speaker 1>He's reborn.</v>

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.833
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

13
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.363
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

14
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at drowning more symbolically</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the truman show.</v>

15
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Truman lives on an island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caged from reality.</v>

16
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.260
<v Speaker 1>He's been conditioned to fear the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside world after the drowning of his</v>

17
00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:06.520
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

18
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>he sails out of his world and confronts</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next nearly drowning in the process.</v>

19
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>It's the same pattern we see in baptism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death and rebirth.</v>

20
00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Through the medium of water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truman goes and still scared of the</v>

21
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>outside world and comes out ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died and was born again.</v>

22
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>In any drowning scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see symbolic rebirth,</v>

23
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>which originates from the Judeo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian sacrament of baptism.</v>

24
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.900
<v Speaker 1>A new believer is taking completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater,</v>

25
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 1>dies out of his old self in his report</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in his identity as a follower of</v>

26
00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:33.754
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

27
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 3>The preacher done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>washed away all my sins and</v>

28
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 3>transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a straight now from here on out and</v>

29
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 3>have an everlasting my.</v>

30
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got bigger fish to fry using water as</v>

31
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:53.150
<v Speaker 1>death and rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagery has been used for centuries in</v>

32
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:55.070
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has since found its way into</v>

33
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:56.720
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every drowning experience has a</v>

34
00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:00.700
<v Speaker 1>different meaning based on the context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever causes you to nearly drown is</v>

35
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>the symbolic enemy and whoever saves you</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your symbolic saved.</v>

36
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.220
<v Speaker 1>This includes drowning yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am saving yourself,</v>

37
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>and if you're unable to say someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

38
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>that represents losing a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

39
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>If that person was close to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baptism,</v>

40
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>imagery is not restricted to violent</v>
<v Speaker 1>drowning.</v>

41
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.670
<v Speaker 1>We can see the same death and rebirth</v>
<v Speaker 1>more subtly in say a shower seat or a</v>

42
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>sewage drain followed by a torrential</v>
<v Speaker 1>downpour while not as a parent.</v>

43
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Any scene where a character gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleansed with water can represent a</v>

44
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>death and rebirth for the character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shower scene in psycho has baptism.</v>

45
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Imagery actress Janet Leigh said in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>book on the film,</v>

46
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Marion had decided to go back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix,</v>

47
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>come clean and take the consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when she stepped into the bathtub,</v>

48
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.210
<v Speaker 1>it was as if she were stepping into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baptismal waters.</v>

49
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>The spray beating down on her was</v>
<v Speaker 1>purifying the corruption from her mind,</v>

50
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.090
<v Speaker 1>purging the evil from her soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a virgin again,</v>

51
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.260
<v Speaker 1>tranquil at peace in the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's causing herself of her since in</v>

52
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>her attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though she gets murdered and fails in</v>

53
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>her baptism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Countless films use water as a way of</v>

54
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>showing a deep internal change for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

55
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>So someone goes under water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're hiding,</v>

56
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>feeling trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting super powers are falling out of</v>

57
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:07.950
<v Speaker 1>an exploding plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that getting dunked underwater</v>

58
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>represents a part of them dying and</v>
<v Speaker 1>another part being reborn,</v>

59
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's just a way to get a kiss</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Wendy peppercorn.</v>
