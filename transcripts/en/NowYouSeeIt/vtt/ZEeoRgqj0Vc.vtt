1
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

2
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 2>welcome to now you see what'd be sequels</v>
<v Speaker 2>are impossible to predict,</v>

3
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 2>some become classics and some become the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most hated movies of all time,</v>

4
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 2>so what makes us sql good and why do</v>
<v Speaker 2>sequels have such a hard time not</v>

5
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 2>sucking?</v>

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Do the same thing as last time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's happy.</v>

7
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Let's compare similar sequels to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what works and what doesn't.</v>

8
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 2>One of the biggest obstacles with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great sequel is that you have to do</v>

9
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 2>something new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the first movie works great,</v>

10
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>but the sequel can't be the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it'll suck the sequels that we all</v>

11
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 2>love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mix it up and surprise us.</v>

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 2>The first terminator features Arnold</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schwarzenegger as the villain,</v>

13
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 2>and he's such a terrifying villain</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's not even human.</v>

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 2>He's a robotic monster whose only</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective is to kill Sarah Connor.</v>

15
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 2>A lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsurprising sql would put us in the</v>

16
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 2>same world with the terminator trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill again,</v>

17
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 2>but James Cameron surprises us and in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular twists,</v>

18
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Arno's is actually sent to protect John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connor from another more powerful</v>

19
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 2>terminator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get down</v>

20
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great sequel and then their</v>

21
00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first speed is about a cop who tries</v>

22
00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 2>to rescue civilians from a bus rigged to</v>
<v Speaker 2>explode.</v>

23
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 2>If any of the civilians tried to get off</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the bus slows down,</v>

24
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 2>it's action packed and suspenseful from</v>
<v Speaker 2>start to finish.</v>

25
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 2>The sequel speed to has the same general</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>

26
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 2>but the buses now a luxury cruise ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surprise is amazingly lane.</v>

27
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 2>A slow moving cruise ship is way less</v>
<v Speaker 2>thrilling than the fast moving busing.</v>

28
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.650
<v Speaker 2>The first speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surprise isn't a surprise.</v>

29
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a letdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sequels also need to build.</v>

30
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 2>They need to add something and what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>add has to be good.</v>

31
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Twenty two jump street has the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>general plot as 21 jump street.</v>

32
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.300
<v Speaker 2>The only real difference between the two</v>
<v Speaker 2>films is that one takes place in high</v>

33
00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 2>school and the other in college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the second film as a whole gag about</v>

34
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:42.660
<v Speaker 2>the movie itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they constantly make references to have</v>

35
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 2>doing the same thing over and over again</v>
<v Speaker 2>will not lead to the same results.</v>

36
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Always worse the second time around.</v>

37
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 2>They're making fun of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sequels never work.</v>

38
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.980
<v Speaker 2>They build on 21 jump street by now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making fun of themselves.</v>

39
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 2>It's clever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>original,</v>

40
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 2>unique and hilarious.</v>

41
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe the Korean church back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

42
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good thing there was even hit your</v>

43
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 3>abandoned church directly across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>

44
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is convenient.</v>

45
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.830
<v Speaker 2>The hangover part two tries to build on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original instead of taking place in</v>

46
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sequel is in the much more exotic</v>

47
00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's really the only addition to</v>

48
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 2>the original.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing new here.</v>

49
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.633
<v Speaker 2>There's no bill.</v>

50
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Leave this happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

51
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 2>an inherent problem with feature length</v>
<v Speaker 2>film is that the amount of possible</v>

52
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 2>character development is limited to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half length of the movie,</v>

53
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 2>so in a medium like television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see so many complex changes in a</v>

54
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 2>character over the course of several</v>
<v Speaker 2>seasons,</v>

55
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.420
<v Speaker 2>whereas a movie can show maybe one or</v>
<v Speaker 2>two major changes,</v>

56
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.420
<v Speaker 2>but the sql though we have a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see characters we love and the original</v>

57
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:36.760
<v Speaker 2>grow even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think any sequel that doesn't take</v>

58
00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:39.850
<v Speaker 2>advantage of this opportunity for more</v>
<v Speaker 2>character growth is a disappointment.</v>

59
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 2>Toy Story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

60
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 2>shows us a whole new character arc for</v>
<v Speaker 2>woody and the sql in the first film,</v>

61
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 2>what he makes the realization that</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting the most attention isn't what's</v>

62
00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

63
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.900
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter how much we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>played with</v>

64
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 3>what matters is that word here for Andy,</v>

65
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 2>he needs us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in the sql what he has another.</v>

66
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 2>That while his time with Andy is</v>
<v Speaker 2>temporary.</v>

67
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 2>He would rather spend his limited time</v>
<v Speaker 2>making andy happy over being displayed</v>

68
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:05.670
<v Speaker 2>in the museum.</v>

69
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.250
<v Speaker 4>You're right prospector.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't stop andy from growing up,</v>

70
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.920
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't miss it for the world.</v>

71
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Through the sql,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get further insight into what he.</v>

72
00:03:13.221 --> 00:03:15.920
<v Speaker 2>At his dedication to Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we learned more about what his goals,</v>

73
00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:19.130
<v Speaker 2>his fears and his obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sequel added just as much depth to</v>

74
00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:22.430
<v Speaker 2>the main character as the first film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in the end is what turns sequels</v>

75
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:24.710
<v Speaker 2>into classics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can see this added depth to</v>

76
00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:26.930
<v Speaker 2>characters and other great cus like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Godfather,</v>

77
00:03:26.931 --> 00:03:29.690
<v Speaker 2>part two with Michael Corleone and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dark Knight with Bruce Wayne.</v>

78
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.060
<v Speaker 2>When we compare these sequels to</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like cars too,</v>

79
00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:34.700
<v Speaker 2>and the hobbit franchise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see another way movie sequels can</v>

80
00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:38.060
<v Speaker 2>suck cars to doesn't show any change to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the characters from the original,</v>

81
00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:41.120
<v Speaker 2>and even with almost eight hours of</v>
<v Speaker 2>screen time for the hobbit series,</v>

82
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.390
<v Speaker 2>we see hardly any character depth in</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the ensemble cast.</v>

83
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I have to commend to the marvel</v>
<v Speaker 2>cinematic universe for knowing how to</v>

84
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 2>make great sequels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell from their consistent</v>

85
00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:53.060
<v Speaker 2>continuity writing style crossovers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>brand marketing that Disney isn't making</v>

86
00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:54.920
<v Speaker 2>sequels just for one time cash grabs.</v>

87
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Disney is attempting to make very</v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm profit by creating a lasting</v>

88
00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:00.830
<v Speaker 2>franchise and brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it seems to be working their sql</v>

89
00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:02.930
<v Speaker 2>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build and add character depth.</v>

90
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Think about the avengers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get loads of surprises when our</v>

91
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.540
<v Speaker 2>favorite superheros fight it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Build on plots from previous films and</v>

92
00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:11.930
<v Speaker 2>we see tons of character depth by seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the conflict of interest between each</v>

93
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:13.850
<v Speaker 2>superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying marvel movies of the</v>

94
00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:16.430
<v Speaker 2>greatest movies of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I am saying is that marvel</v>

95
00:04:16.431 --> 00:04:18.380
<v Speaker 2>knows how to make sequels and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying a lot.</v>

96
00:04:18.381 --> 00:04:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Given the callus disappointments we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen in sequels,</v>

97
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.460
<v Speaker 2>making a good sql to a great original,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a challenge,</v>

98
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.340
<v Speaker 2>but I think a big problem with sequels</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a lot of the time the studio</v>

99
00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:32.030
<v Speaker 2>doesn't really care if a sequel as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>reviewed with the successful original as</v>

100
00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:35.090
<v Speaker 2>long as sql is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost guaranteed to make a profit</v>

101
00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:37.130
<v Speaker 2>for the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that despite all the hate</v>

102
00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:39.740
<v Speaker 2>towards sequels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cars to the hangover part two and</v>

103
00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:42.080
<v Speaker 2>the star wars prequels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they grossed more than their original</v>

104
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.390
<v Speaker 2>films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sequels create an interesting paradox in</v>

105
00:04:44.391 --> 00:04:46.040
<v Speaker 2>the film industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be successful,</v>

106
00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:47.960
<v Speaker 2>a film normally has to show some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique,</v>

107
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.000
<v Speaker 2>like great special effects acting or</v>
<v Speaker 2>plot,</v>

108
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.600
<v Speaker 2>but sql can make a profit only by having</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recognizable name and providing</v>

109
00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:56.270
<v Speaker 2>nothing unique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do Hollywood a favor and stop going</v>

110
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:57.260
<v Speaker 2>to sequels that suck.</v>

111
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.320
<v Speaker 4>God willing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll all meet again in spaceballs to</v>

112
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.620
<v Speaker 4>for more money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for watching.</v>
