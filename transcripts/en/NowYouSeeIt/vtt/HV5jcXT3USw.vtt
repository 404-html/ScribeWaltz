<v Speaker 1>You'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see your Schwartz is his biggest</v>

00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be Lord far.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Quads castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the place.</v>

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you think maybe he's compensating for</v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

5
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.653
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

6
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh God.</v>

7
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remembered there's just this teeny</v>

8
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>tiny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

9
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

10
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Sexual comedy is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal and popular genres of comedy</v>

11
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>in cinema pds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

12
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Tourette's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice.</v>

13
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>She has it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something pretty much every adult</v>

14
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>can relate to and has the potential for</v>
<v Speaker 1>big laughs while often used for comedic</v>

15
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to look at how sexual imagery,</v>

16
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>specifically phallic symbols can be used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve dramatic effects.</v>

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Filmmakers can use phallic symbols to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously contribute to the visual</v>

18
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>storytelling of a film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penis shapes are everywhere and while</v>

19
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>not always acknowledged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt that skyscrapers,</v>

20
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>he went to a funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>match go up guns</v>

21
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>or even a pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at a certain point he brings out this</v>

22
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>pipe and what pipe does he bring out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It brings out the Sherlock Holmes pipe</v>

23
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say it's a sexual thing because</v>

24
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>my life is bigger than yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

25
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>and can be treated as phallic symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologist Sigmund Freud is famous for</v>

26
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>theorizing that we noticed these objects</v>
<v Speaker 1>are phallic on a subconscious level in a</v>

27
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>similar way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filmmakers use phallic symbols in place</v>

28
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>of actual sex to get a subconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional reaction from the viewer.</v>

29
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>The simplest and most noticeable use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a phallic symbol is to imply sex in</v>

30
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sexist more often imply been actually</v>

31
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>shown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with strict censorship during</v>

32
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>the golden age of cinema.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That band showing sex on screen,</v>

33
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>so instead of actual sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see sex represented in a phallic</v>

34
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.380
<v Speaker 2>take me to work going</v>
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>

35
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>The object can be anything from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bedpost in the birth of a nation,</v>

36
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>a train entering a tunnel in north by</v>
<v Speaker 1>northwest,</v>

37
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>a man pumping gas into a woman's car and</v>
<v Speaker 1>written on the window or a gun,</v>

38
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:39.001
<v Speaker 1>and Bonnie and Clyde</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove phallic symbol.</v>

39
00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 1>We see there's some kind of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship or desired sexual</v>

40
00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the two characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another common form of Phallic symbol is</v>

41
00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>to show masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gun is a powerful phallic symbol that</v>

42
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:53.230
<v Speaker 1>indicates the masculinity of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

43
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.710
<v Speaker 1>A big gun means your manly and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes and classic action movie seemed</v>

44
00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 1>to always have ridiculously sized</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

45
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>If a girl has a big gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know she's reversing gender roles and</v>

46
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>taking on masculine qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small guns,</v>

47
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a sign of weakness or vulnerability.</v>

48
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Noisy cricket.</v>

49
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

50
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.270
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>

51
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.620
<v Speaker 1>You get a series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We atomize.</v>

52
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.120
<v Speaker 1>I get a little midget cricket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gun sights issue even gets addressed</v>

53
00:03:20.121 --> 00:03:23.570
<v Speaker 1>in the James Bond Film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. No as a spy bond has to conceal a</v>

54
00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:25.550
<v Speaker 1>small gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the film makes it clear that it's</v>

55
00:03:25.551 --> 00:03:29.060
<v Speaker 1>still mainly with the delivery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a brick through a plate glass</v>

56
00:03:29.061 --> 00:03:31.820
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is written on the wind.</v>

57
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.360
<v Speaker 1>When Kyle Threatens Mitch with a pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the small size of the gun further</v>

58
00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:38.900
<v Speaker 1>reinforces the idea that kyle is</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardly week and feminine.</v>

59
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.970
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't appear threatening with such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small weapon.</v>

60
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.020
<v Speaker 1>This parallels nicely with the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle's impotent and so he's missing a</v>

61
00:03:45.021 --> 00:03:48.650
<v Speaker 1>major aspect of being a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phallic symbols can also be used to</v>

62
00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:52.610
<v Speaker 1>convey domination and control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this symbolism hyperbolically in</v>

63
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:55.760
<v Speaker 1>a clockwork orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a clockwork orange conveys the idea that</v>

64
00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:59.360
<v Speaker 1>if you can expose someone sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have complete and utter domination</v>

65
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.650
<v Speaker 1>over them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when Alex,</v>

66
00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:04.340
<v Speaker 1>where's the Phallic Mask and beats the</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple with a phallic stick or uses a</v>

67
00:04:04.341 --> 00:04:08.960
<v Speaker 1>phallic statue to toy with an old lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's asserting his complete control over</v>

68
00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:10.730
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows that to physically dominate</v>

69
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:12.980
<v Speaker 1>someone is to also sexually dominated</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

70
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Sex and violence go hand in hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phallic symbols.</v>

71
00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the visual storytelling of the film</v>

72
00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:21.080
<v Speaker 1>because they help show Alex go from</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominating to being dominated.</v>

73
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.370
<v Speaker 1>He goes from overpowering everyone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally being squished by authority.</v>

74
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Alien uses phallic symbols to convey</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

75
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.630
<v Speaker 1>The writer of the film intentionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>made alien contain rape imagery to make</v>

76
00:04:35.631 --> 00:04:36.740
<v Speaker 1>the film more terrifying.</v>

77
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 3>One thing that people are all disturbed</v>
<v Speaker 3>about if sex,</v>

78
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 3>everybody is always all in a not about</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>

79
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I'm going to attack the</v>

80
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to attack them sexually and</v>

81
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to go after the women in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the audience.</v>

82
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to attack the men and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to put in every image.</v>

83
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 3>I can think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know will make them in the audience,</v>

84
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 3>cross their legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homosexual,</v>

85
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 3>rl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

86
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 3>birth the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laser tags down your throat,</v>

87
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 3>the whole number,</v>

88
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>the parallels between the alien attacks</v>
<v Speaker 1>in real life rape,</v>

89
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>make the alien attacks more horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting raped as a scary thing,</v>

90
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>and the writers use the horrors of rape</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the alien a scarier villain.</v>

91
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.900
<v Speaker 1>The design of the alien is very phallic</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the set pieces look equally as valid</v>

92
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>and vaginal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This design was done very intentionally</v>

93
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>by set designer hr Geiger kegers work</v>
<v Speaker 1>with sexual,</v>

94
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>and that's the most mild thing you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>say about it.</v>

95
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>It's the opening of the alien ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like two giant Vaginas on a 60</v>

96
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>foot and set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We built that set.</v>

97
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:39.991
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a miniature show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God from direct mouth inside alien to</v>

98
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>the face hugger laying eggs orally to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phallic chest.</v>

99
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Buster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole alien is Phallic.</v>

100
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at this sort of gray</v>
<v Speaker 1>penis.</v>

101
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Can I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of using phallic symbols to</v>

102
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>show manliness or domination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alien uses phallic symbols to show us</v>

103
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>being sexually dominated by the alien.</v>

104
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 1>The Phallic symbols evoke terror by</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the human sexual victims to the</v>

105
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Phallic symbols add to visual</v>

106
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>storytelling in the film by making the</v>
<v Speaker 1>alien attacks visually and emotionally</v>

107
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 1>similar to sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phallic symbols work even when they're</v>

108
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 1>subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A film like the social network is a</v>

109
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>perfect opportunity to use phallic</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols because the whole film revolves</v>

110
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>around the fight for power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

111
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>and high social status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The winklevoss twins take mark</v>

112
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerberg to their final clubhouse as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to show off their high status and</v>

113
00:06:22.351 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>power in order to help convince mark to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work for them.</v>

114
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>They offer him a sandwich to further</v>
<v Speaker 1>show off their luxuries and the way it's</v>

115
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>presented to them is just so oddly</v>
<v Speaker 1>family</v>

116
00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.650
<v Speaker 4>and then he holds it like this,</v>

117
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>and then after mark questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their idea and internally thinks of a</v>

118
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:42.040
<v Speaker 1>better one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he holds the sandwich like this request,</v>

119
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.100
<v Speaker 4>myspace or friendster.</v>

120
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 1>Is it just a coincidence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

121
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a point where the</v>

122
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 1>analysis of Phallic symbols becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>overkill.</v>

123
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Sigmund Freud once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.</v>

124
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Not everything that looks valic has some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual meaning,</v>

125
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>but when used intentionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a phallic symbol can be a powerful</v>

126
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 1>visual that adds meaning to what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening on screen.</v>

127
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 1>So the next time you watch a film with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends and notice a phallic</v>

128
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 1>symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel free to point it out.</v>

129
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Just don't be a huge dick about it.</v>

130
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.440
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to be a history major or</v>
<v Speaker 5>a political scientist to see the bigger</v>

131
00:07:13.441 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 5>dick foreign policy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like this,</v>

132
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.200
<v Speaker 5>what they have bigger dicks</v>

133
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 2>bob</v>

134
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.650
<v Speaker 5>course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bombs and the rockets and the</v>

135
00:07:25.651 --> 00:07:30.651
<v Speaker 5>bullets are all shaped like Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a subconscious need to project the</v>

136
00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 5>penis into other people's affairs.</v>

137
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 4>It's called fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>thanks for watching.</v>
