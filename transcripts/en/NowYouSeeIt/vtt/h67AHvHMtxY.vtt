1
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>In inglorious bastards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quintin Tarantino wrote a funny sequence</v>

2
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>where a German officer mix up the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>of King Kong with the story of the</v>

3
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>American slave trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every question he asks has the same</v>

4
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>answer for both of their shifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys,</v>

5
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:27.024
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

6
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really cut conflict on show</v>

7
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to you guys,</v>

8
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what kink concept,</v>

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>the German officer and to intern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terentino's clearly think King Kong is</v>

10
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>an allegory for the slave trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the creators of King Kong had</v>

11
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly denied this interpretation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie saying there are no hidden</v>

12
00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the story to them.</v>

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>This disconnect between Creator and</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience brings to light.</v>

14
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important questions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>film discussion.</v>

15
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Isn't interpretation still valid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not what the artist intended?</v>

16
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>The answer has broad implications for</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing art.</v>

17
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>If meaning is objective than discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes much more narrow.</v>

18
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Critics must take the artist's word as</v>
<v Speaker 1>law and only look for meetings that the</v>

19
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>artist consciously intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

20
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>if meaning is subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a critic can find any message they want</v>

21
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>in a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means anybody can throw around</v>

22
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>any theory they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English teachers can over analyze</v>

23
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>curtains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what the artist says,</v>

24
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>so where's the line?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at how artists talk</v>

25
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>about and make their movies to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the best mindset towards analyzing</v>

26
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>into over analyzing film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some directors do clearly state their</v>

27
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>intentions for a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a rare interview from the Cohen</v>

28
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mentioned that the big Lebowski is</v>

29
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>based on the ward detective novels from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thirties and forties,</v>

30
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>but with a humorous twist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has the main character in over his</v>

31
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complicated and morally ambiguous</v>

32
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>narrative and an unreliable supporting</v>
<v Speaker 1>cast,</v>

33
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>but instead of smoking cigarettes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

34
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>no more heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he smokes marijuana.</v>

35
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>One of the several humorous twists on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conventional detective stereotypes</v>

36
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>for deeper movie ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many directors create a movie with an</v>

37
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>idea in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only will directors hide the</v>

38
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>meaning of their movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may even film the movie</v>

39
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>deceptively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In American Psycho Director Mary Heron</v>

40
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>had William to folk portray his</v>
<v Speaker 1>character in three different ways.</v>

41
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>The first way the character thinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick Bateman killed Paul Allen.</v>

42
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to know if you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second he thinks he didn't do it.</v>

43
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.370
<v Speaker 1>People just disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the third he's unsure to think that</v>

44
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>one of his friends killed him for no</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason whatsoever would be too</v>

45
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:22.310
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that right?</v>

46
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Patrick here and edited these portrayals</v>
<v Speaker 1>together to have the character</v>

47
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>constantly switched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His opinion of Bateman between takes the</v>

48
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates a movie full of uncertainty and</v>

49
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>it adds to the frenzied toxic male</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance within the movie.</v>

50
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Ang Lee's do the exact same technique in</v>
<v Speaker 1>brokeback mountain.</v>

51
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I played it as though I knew what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on with Jake's character Jack and</v>

52
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 2>that he had been cheating on me with men</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I knew about the gay bashing and I</v>

53
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 2>also played it as though I had no idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I that this is how my husband died</v>

54
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 2>and those takes got merged in the final</v>
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>

55
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 2>So I don't actually know and knows the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth in his head and it's not important</v>

56
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 2>to me because I think the ambiguity is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the strength of that scene and</v>

57
00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.910
<v Speaker 2>what's heartbreaking about it.</v>

58
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>When filmmakers create a movie with</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple meanings,</v>

59
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>they tend to keep their intent a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone else have a theory about what it</v>

60
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:08.360
<v Speaker 1>could be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use that.</v>

61
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say what it is that's</v>

62
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.713
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>

63
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may not know.</v>

64
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.270
<v Speaker 3>I never talk about themes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very big shame when something is</v>

65
00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:23.150
<v Speaker 3>finished and then people want you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>translate it back into words.</v>

66
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.260
<v Speaker 3>It never will work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never will go back into words and be</v>

67
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.890
<v Speaker 3>what the film is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like describing a piece of music.</v>

68
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.890
<v Speaker 3>You don't hear the music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just see the words.</v>

69
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.700
<v Speaker 3>It's better to let people conjure up</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own ideas.</v>

70
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.010
<v Speaker 3>Having seen an experienced the film.</v>

71
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean they want you to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you know,</v>

72
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 4>this is a story of the duality of</v>
<v Speaker 4>duplicity of governments or something</v>

73
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.660
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

74
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.410
<v Speaker 4>I hear people try to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's usually is a bullshit or</v>

75
00:03:52.411 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 4>is it work is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of a,</v>

76
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.070
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's usually irrelevant.</v>

77
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick might be the best director to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at when discussing over analyzing</v>

78
00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.480
<v Speaker 1>because his movies are some of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzed in American cinema.</v>

79
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 1>The documentary room to 37 focuses</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely on fan theories about the</v>

80
00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:08.570
<v Speaker 1>shining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the ideas suggested in the</v>

81
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>documentary are pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they cleaned,</v>

82
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:14.960
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick airbrushed his own face into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>clouds as the family drives to the</v>

83
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:17.240
<v Speaker 1>hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After hearing about his intense shooting</v>

84
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:19.610
<v Speaker 1>schedules and extremely detailed</v>
<v Speaker 1>production design,</v>

85
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.420
<v Speaker 1>fans have seen to build a mythos around</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick believing he put specific</v>

86
00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:24.950
<v Speaker 1>meaning into every little thing.</v>

87
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.260
<v Speaker 4>Despite all of this sort of a parker</v>
<v Speaker 4>full stories about me,</v>

88
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.680
<v Speaker 4>almost all of which you're unsure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have unlimited resources and</v>

89
00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 4>they do watch the budget and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

90
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.160
<v Speaker 4>you do have to account for what you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>

91
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.170
<v Speaker 1>The stories about cubic largely ignore</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he himself described his shooting</v>

92
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:41.180
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says he actually doesn't always put a</v>

93
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Speaker 1>particular meaning in his directing</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

94
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty good at generalized</v>
<v Speaker 4>statements,</v>

95
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:47.760
<v Speaker 4>but when I'm asked what is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I still can't tell somebody what</v>

96
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 4>Gloria is about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Iceland as much more of an intuitive</v>

97
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More like what I would imagine writing</v>

98
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 4>music is like rather than us sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>structuring an argument.</v>

99
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.290
<v Speaker 1>This intuitive approach doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick's films any less meaningful.</v>

100
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It just means while he's making the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

101
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:05.310
<v Speaker 1>his intent isn't always immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious to him.</v>

102
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.030
<v Speaker 1>He instead makes choices that feel right</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of constantly dealing with</v>

103
00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:10.410
<v Speaker 1>hidden meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never</v>

104
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.440
<v Speaker 5>deal with subutex when I'm writing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever,</v>

105
00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:13.130
<v Speaker 5>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

106
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.550
<v Speaker 5>I keep it about the text.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I keep it about the scenario because I</v>

107
00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:18.410
<v Speaker 5>know there's a lot there but I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to.</v>

108
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to know it right now.</v>

109
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.740
<v Speaker 1>So where does that leave room for</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis?</v>

110
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.650
<v Speaker 1>In both cases where directors hide the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting and where they don't work with a</v>

111
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:28.100
<v Speaker 1>specific meaning in mind if you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the objective truth,</v>

112
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:29.690
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean analysis is hope.</v>

113
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.630
<v Speaker 5>Bless the very basic things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's especially from Mr. Orange is</v>

114
00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:35.100
<v Speaker 5>coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm dying and I want to go to the</v>

115
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.650
<v Speaker 5>hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but just in writing those words,</v>

116
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:42.651
<v Speaker 5>just all this stuff just started pouring</v>
<v Speaker 5>out and that was when I realized it was</v>

117
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:44.720
<v Speaker 5>a father son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Story going on</v>

118
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.480
<v Speaker 1>in this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tarantino reveals a crucial truth about</v>

119
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.730
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shows us how he subconsciously put a</v>

120
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:52.760
<v Speaker 1>deeper meaning in his movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if directors work with</v>

121
00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:55.310
<v Speaker 1>one meaning in mind or work purely on</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition.</v>

122
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Everybody brings their prior experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in the creative choices they make,</v>

123
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't stop at the director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every person involved in the process of</v>

124
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>filmmaking places their worldview into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work,</v>

125
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>and a good analysis reveals these hidden</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings.</v>

126
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very obvious.</v>

127
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course King Kong is a metaphor for</v>

128
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>the slave trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying the makers of King Kong</v>

129
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>meant it to be that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what.</v>

130
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the movie that they made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they meant to make it or not.</v>

131
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>This analysis works because it fits with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time period.</v>

132
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>The movie was made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only convincing,</v>

133
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>but the analysis also makes the movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>more impactful.</v>

134
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Some interpretation seemed to miss that</v>
<v Speaker 1>analysis should add something meaningful</v>

135
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>to the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this particular interpretation,</v>

136
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 1>King Kong shows how white people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 19 thirties may have feared the free</v>

137
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>black population in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is that interpretation well</v>

138
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>supported,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also invites the viewer to think</v>

139
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>about the movie in a fresh and</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting way.</v>

140
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Even if it is true that Kubrick</v>
<v Speaker 1>airbrushed his face into the clouds.</v>

141
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>How does that add to the movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And strangely enough,</v>

142
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe some stories are better enjoyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>without analysis.</v>

143
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you submit to a completely logical</v>

144
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 1>and detailed analysis of a supernatural</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

145
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.830
<v Speaker 1>it will eventually appear absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The true measure of a great supernatural</v>

146
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 1>thriller he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't in its hidden meanings,</v>

147
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.670
<v Speaker 1>but in if the audience had a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>freight,</v>

148
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>believes the film they were watching and</v>
<v Speaker 1>retain some sense of it.</v>

149
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>With brokeback mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the true analysis of Jack's death isn't</v>

150
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Ang Lee leaves the</v>

151
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>audience uncertain objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fate makes his ending that much more</v>

152
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 1>heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no sense of closure for us or</v>

153
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 1>for Ennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the next time you watch the</v>

154
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:23.900
<v Speaker 1>ending of 2001 a space odyssey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't obsess over the details.</v>

155
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick actually did reveal what he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going for in that ending</v>

156
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 6>came out because when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>say sound foolish,</v>

157
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 6>whereas if they're dramatize,</v>

158
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll link his interpretation in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>description,</v>

159
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.840
<v Speaker 1>but before you click on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the ending one more time and think</v>

160
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:50.410
<v Speaker 1>about the emotion it evokes because even</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a particular meaning in mind,</v>

161
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Kubrick built that ending based to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>around his own meaning but around how he</v>

162
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:57.670
<v Speaker 1>wanted it to make you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when your teacher over analyzes blue</v>

163
00:07:57.671 --> 00:08:00.640
<v Speaker 1>curtains in a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem isn't that it's not what the</v>

164
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.100
<v Speaker 1>artist meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem may be that the teacher got</v>

165
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:06.280
<v Speaker 1>so caught up in analysis that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>missed what made the book's so great in</v>

166
00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:07.114
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>

167
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.583
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>

168
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.480
<v Speaker 1>the big problem with over analyzing film</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from under researching.</v>

169
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.870
<v Speaker 1>If an analysis is inconsistent with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the movie or doesn't have a lot</v>

170
00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:21.990
<v Speaker 1>of concrete evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hold up well in most areas of</v>

171
00:08:21.991 --> 00:08:22.741
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Criticism.</v>

172
00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Education is key to coming up with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best analysis.</v>

173
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.260
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to actual film production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same principles apply.</v>
