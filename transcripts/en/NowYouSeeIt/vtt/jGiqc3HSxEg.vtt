00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.590
<v Speaker 1>You are tearing me apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lisa,</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>when you think of so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

3
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:08.160
<v Speaker 1>You probably think of some movie with</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughably horrible acting and writing a</v>

4
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>movie that's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes really fun to watch you watch</v>

5
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>it and make fun of it with your friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>because such a bad movie takes itself so</v>

6
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so bad.</v>

7
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Movies go as far back as the b movies of</v>

8
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the forties and fifties the concept has</v>
<v Speaker 1>always been the same.</v>

9
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>They're guilty pleasure movies where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed the movie because of its</v>

10
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>excessive use of movie tropes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pour over the top acting and terrible</v>

11
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>camera work and it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not hard to see the similar laugh</v>

12
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>ability of robot monster in 1953 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shark NATO.</v>

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>The problem is analysis of so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

14
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Usually stops there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you can go much deeper than</v>

15
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk about what's at the core</v>

16
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>of this phenomenon and make the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the techniques of so bad,</v>

17
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are present in tons of critically</v>

18
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>acclaimed movies and almost all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done on purpose.</v>

19
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain</v>

20
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walk with me</v>

21
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.221
<v Speaker 1>so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

22
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Movies are an extreme version of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that audiences enjoy theatrical and</v>

23
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 1>over the top movies that's still take</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves seriously.</v>

24
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>This concept is called camp and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>another tool at the disposal of a</v>

25
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.580
<v Speaker 1>filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think of campy movies,</v>

26
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>you may think they're always made</v>
<v Speaker 1>unintentionally,</v>

27
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>like Tommy Wise Owl China film a serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie and accidentally creating the</v>

28
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>ultimate camp classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's actually not the case.</v>

29
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Doctors constantly pretend to take their</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb movie seriously to create a whole</v>

30
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>new level of entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if everybody is earnest and serious</v>

31
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 1>and treating it like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.580
<v Speaker 1>a regular earthquake or it's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an alien invasion,</v>

33
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

34
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Then then that sincerity kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>translate it so then you can go even</v>

35
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:34.670
<v Speaker 1>further with your villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the shark.</v>

36
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Naomi do crazy stuff and that makes it</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more funny.</v>

37
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Camp isn't necessarily a genre of</v>

38
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some movies can have elements of camp</v>

39
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>without exclusively considering</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves so bad.</v>

40
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:47.600
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the perfect balance of camp and</v>

41
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>sincerity is the princess bride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie is actually smartly written</v>

42
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>and well executed while also having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ton of campy and corny moments is</v>

43
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fellow,</v>

44
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I hate Tequila.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seem decent fan.</v>

45
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I hate to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The source site blurs the line between</v>

46
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>cartoonish and serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stakes are high and the scene is</v>

47
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>expertly choreographed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also do random flips.</v>

48
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Campton makes the princess bride fun to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch without making it a movie.</v>

49
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:12.920
<v Speaker 1>People make fun of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over the top,</v>

50
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>but never too much so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it always treats itself seriously.</v>

51
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Camp can actually sometimes save a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

52
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Depp's performance turns the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pirates of the Caribbean from a</v>

53
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:24.740
<v Speaker 1>derivative action flick to a charming</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hilarious franchise and it's because</v>

54
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:27.200
<v Speaker 1>of his can't be exaggerated but grounded</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

55
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 2>You want without doubt the worst pirate</v>
<v Speaker 2>type of</v>

56
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 2>what you have heard of it.</v>

57
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Wes Anderson is a champion of camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His set pieces are famously symmetrical</v>

58
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:41.000
<v Speaker 1>to the point of impossibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera constantly spins from one</v>

59
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>character to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves using outdated cartoonish,</v>

60
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 1>special effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any awkwardly cuts conversations at the</v>

61
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:49.400
<v Speaker 1>end of each sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you consider me your enemy?</v>

62
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Cause your girlfriend's stemming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lefty scissors.</v>

63
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>She's my wife now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>

64
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Anderson creates charming and critically</v>
<v Speaker 1>acclaimed films.</v>

65
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Despite breaking countless film</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions,</v>

66
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>can't be film techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give movies that extra flair that makes</v>

67
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>them fun and devastating me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rewatch Hubble can't be filmmakers</v>

68
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>strike the balance between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible and the realistic so that</v>

69
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:17.160
<v Speaker 1>movies have elements of camp while also</v>
<v Speaker 1>having just a hint of seriousness so</v>

70
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't seem like they're trying too</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

71
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.411
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

72
00:03:19.411 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 3>the Reno Rafe is playing a real person</v>
<v Speaker 3>and making him a real person.</v>

73
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though the context is this sort of</v>

74
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 3>invented country in this invented</v>
<v Speaker 3>version of history and so on,</v>

75
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 3>I sorta feel like we just try to make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as realistic as it can be given,</v>

76
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.100
<v Speaker 3>given what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

77
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Saturated and campy filmmaking happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

78
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>So this</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes this,</v>

79
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.720
<v Speaker 4>this</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes this</v>

80
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Quintin Tarantino loves camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a villain,</v>

81
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>make it a school girl and give her a</v>
<v Speaker 1>flail as a weapon.</v>

82
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>His love for the theatrical and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated shows in the fact that in</v>

83
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>all of his movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters pretend to be somebody,</v>

84
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

85
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>get care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result is hilariously over the top,</v>

86
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>but serious moments of poor or flashy</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting.</v>

87
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.510
<v Speaker 3>I leave it there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I leave it itchy and either that or we</v>

88
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.350
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Derek</v>

89
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.600
<v Speaker 1>camp is also extremely common in</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue.</v>

90
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.900
<v Speaker 1>So many movies have characters say</v>
<v Speaker 1>things nobody says in real life.</v>

91
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.690
<v Speaker 1>This is one doodle that can't be undid</v>
<v Speaker 1>ohms skillet,</v>

92
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't make the dialogue bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:34.830
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not hit her.</v>

94
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit.</v>

95
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I did not have her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not.</v>

96
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.643
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi mark.</v>

97
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>But it's also a way to make movies fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron Sorkin is one of the best</v>

98
00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:46.860
<v Speaker 1>screenwriters in cinema,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he loves campy dialogue.</v>

99
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>In many scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he favors exaggerated dialogue over what</v>

100
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:52.460
<v Speaker 1>someone would actually say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

101
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punch me in the face.</v>

102
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron.</v>

103
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Sorkin's famous walk and talk style from</v>
<v Speaker 1>West Wing feels extremely theatrical and</v>

104
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:01.290
<v Speaker 1>contrived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been reused to the point that it's</v>

105
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>been parodied in just about every TV</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitcom.</v>

106
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.880
<v Speaker 1>He even parodies at himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walk with me.</v>

107
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Amerisource Sorkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his snappy dialogue also gets reused to</v>

108
00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:12.210
<v Speaker 1>an amazing degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you and me talking.</v>

109
00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not other people.</v>

110
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not other paper.</v>

111
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people don't talk to me like I'm</v>

112
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.860
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not bad writing.</v>

113
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>It actually takes a very talented writer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create a style that's so easy to</v>

114
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:25.710
<v Speaker 1>parody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but remains fascinating to watch.</v>

115
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.680
<v Speaker 1>He's not technically original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he still keeps it fresh.</v>

116
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.320
<v Speaker 1>We can feel his classic style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't load it.</v>

117
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.480
<v Speaker 1>We embrace it to a crazy amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

118
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.440
<v Speaker 1>it's almost worshiped to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make actors recreates sorkin style</v>

119
00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:38.274
<v Speaker 1>on talk shows.</v>

120
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Camp is letting movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b movies,</v>

121
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.890
<v Speaker 1>and it's a concept we feel everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically whenever a movie does</v>

122
00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:49.470
<v Speaker 1>something over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would never happen in real life,</v>

123
00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:51.660
<v Speaker 1>but the movie still executes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sincerely.</v>

124
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Malaise and the room fits quite nicely</v>
<v Speaker 1>into these concepts of exaggerated and</v>

125
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>entertaining filmmaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes the movie stand out is that</v>

126
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the few campy movies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>took itself completely seriously without</v>

127
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>having any idea just how over the top it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

128
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>It's still camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so unique because of how</v>

129
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>blissfully unaware it is.</v>

130
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.980
<v Speaker 5>Hi doggy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're my favorite customer.</v>

131
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.240
<v Speaker 5>Thanks a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bye.</v>

132
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Brings me to the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>component of camp camp defies binary</v>

133
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:26.110
<v Speaker 1>thinking in movies because it's both bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good.</v>

134
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Speaker 1>It objectively breaks many of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles of filmmaking,</v>

135
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.720
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheesy dialogue and extreme filming</v>

136
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:33.670
<v Speaker 1>techniques are almost always frowned</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon,</v>

137
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 1>but the crazy thing is camp is not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's actually extremely</v>

138
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:39.940
<v Speaker 1>entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the most entertaining kind of</v>

139
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:43.900
<v Speaker 1>films that exist because many directors</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be serious and many directors can be</v>

140
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:45.910
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not many can be so serious.</v>

141
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:48.280
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I embrace camp because movies shouldn't</v>

142
00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:50.230
<v Speaker 1>always play it straight if they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>

143
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.230
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's movies be what they were meant to</v>

144
00:06:53.231 --> 00:06:55.690
<v Speaker 1>be entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the next time you watch a movie,</v>

145
00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:57.760
<v Speaker 1>don't just consider whether it's good or</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

146
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Consider if you like it for it's guilty</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasures.</v>

147
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Consider that it's so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a bad thing.</v>

148
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.620
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good that it's bad.</v>

149
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.560
<v Speaker 5>Do you want me to order a pizza or</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever?</v>

150
00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:10.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I already ordered a pizza.</v>

151
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.900
<v Speaker 5>You're thinking about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thanks for watching.</v>

152
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.120
<v Speaker 5>Slightly trends full.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a bit of a break from the norm,</v>

153
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.750
<v Speaker 5>just a little slot and the break,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the monotony of all that hard.</v>
