1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an image that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cliche,</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's an image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne.</v>

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't we start with someone easier?</v>

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has John Wayne ever been at a loss of</v>

5
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>words?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>go watch your favorite John Wayne</v>
<v Speaker 1>Classic and pay attention to how he</v>

7
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>speaks over his 40 year career</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of his age,</v>

8
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or mood.</v>

9
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>He almost always talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same.</v>

10
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>Iconic masculine confidence and control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always has the right thing to say in</v>

11
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>as few words as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Envelope.</v>

12
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>That'll be the day even when he's angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not really angry.</v>

13
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>He never loses his cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never stammered screams or even</v>

14
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>improvises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lost my temper in 40 years,</v>

15
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>but pilgrim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you caused a lot of trouble this</v>

16
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might've got somebody killed somebody</v>

17
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>out a belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chewing them out.</v>

18
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Even at his worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't lose that cool John Wayne</v>

19
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>presence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's actually something amazing</v>

20
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>about that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying this makes him a bad</v>

21
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:54.301
<v Speaker 1>actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

22
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>many studio Hollywood actors had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited vocal range.</v>

23
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Whether Humphrey Bogart was a private</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigator.</v>

24
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

25
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't eat a nightclub owner where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

26
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>you can follow what I've got to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be any product or even an</v>

27
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Irishman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hoping that maybe in the state</v>

28
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he always had his trademark voice.</v>

29
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.280
<v Speaker 1>It explains why some actors at that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so easy to imitate it.</v>

30
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>You got any girlfriends at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem bringing them over and John</v>

31
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.873
<v Speaker 1>Wayne is no exception.</v>

32
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>The John Wayne still seems to stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His complete control.</v>

33
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>His whole persona has an almost mythic</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality to it,</v>

34
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.100
<v Speaker 1>so you're a men's only good for one node</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a time.</v>

35
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>It's as if he's created a certain idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>for masculine authority through his</v>

36
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an idea of talking like John</v>

37
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but post-classical method acting ushered</v>

38
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>in a wave of chameleon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actors like Marlin Brando,</v>

39
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Robert De Niro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Meryl Streep,</v>

40
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>actors who morphed to their voices and</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared into their roles.</v>

41
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Any attempt at imitating Daniel Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lewis would probably result in simply</v>

42
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>imitating one of his characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the actual actor,</v>

43
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>because he does them all so differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The use of complex voice acting not only</v>

44
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>created more immersive performances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actors and directors now use voice</v>

45
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>in more complicated ways to tell their</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

46
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not always about what a character</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

47
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>but how and when they say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice shows the characters control of a</v>

48
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.100
<v Speaker 1>scene or their lack of control.</v>

49
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I want to use voice acting as a means</v>
<v Speaker 1>for analyzing one of the most</v>

50
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>complicated characters in film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel,</v>

51
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>plainview in there will be blood and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think to understand Daniel plainview,</v>

52
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>you have to first understand talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>like John Wayne.</v>

53
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Get off your heart and head into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solo.</v>

54
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne's big break came in 1939 in</v>
<v Speaker 1>stagecoach and his introduction starts</v>

55
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 1>his streak of vocal control right from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning.</v>

56
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne has a mastery of voice after</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long montage of stage coach ride and</v>

57
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>he's the one that can stop the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative with a single command and</v>

58
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>notice what else is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his introduction shot,</v>

59
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>he immediately establishes himself as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>master of his own movement through his</v>

60
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:53.880
<v Speaker 1>flashy gun turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the epic pushing of the camera toward</v>

61
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>his face and the mythical quality of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background like he manifested out of the</v>

62
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we see fearlessness and mastery and</v>

63
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>the whole film stops to accommodate him.</v>

64
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>The remainder of the scene presents</v>
<v Speaker 1>another interesting phenomenon.</v>

65
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Invoice in 1939 editors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still tinkering with how to cut</v>

66
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>dialogue and the camera would stay on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>character most or all the time they were</v>

67
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 1>talking except for John Wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this scene,</v>

68
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice he's the only character</v>
<v Speaker 1>that talks while the camera focuses on</v>

69
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>other characters and they expect to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>you riding shotgun on this run.</v>

70
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Marshall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he talks,</v>

71
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>it cuts to reactions or he talks away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the camera as he approaches the</v>

72
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>stage coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in his first big movie,</v>

73
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>even as Ringo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid,</v>

74
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>and even right at his character</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction,</v>

75
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>his voice could control the movement all</v>
<v Speaker 1>on its own.</v>

76
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>He has an almost directorial influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the story.</v>

77
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a distinct power to talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>without being seen in the same way that</v>

78
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>a narrator of a story has a godlike</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality to them.</v>

79
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.181
<v Speaker 1>If they talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>not interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means they're still controlling the</v>

81
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>scene even when they aren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In John Wayne's introductory scene,</v>

82
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>we see two methods of showing control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>directing the narrative through voice</v>

83
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>and controlling the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's not the only one to control</v>

84
00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>this wet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

85
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>We actually also here Daniel plainview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we see him speaking,</v>

86
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I've traveled over half our state like</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne.</v>

87
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>He shows narrative control in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>character introduction.</v>

88
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>He establishes he's the only one</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualified to drill,</v>

89
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>and when people try to interrupt his</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative,</v>

90
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>he ignores them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your offer?</v>

91
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.450
<v Speaker 1>We're wasting time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do my own drilling.</v>

92
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>His authority does get challenged when</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd uproars,</v>

93
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>but he simply leaves changing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative to what he wants.</v>

94
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Refusing to not have total control.</v>

95
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

96
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no confusion.</v>

97
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't take the leash</v>

98
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.550
<v Speaker 1>and controls the movement of the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stops when he stops.</v>

99
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.310
<v Speaker 1>It moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he moves after another voice of God</v>

100
00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:47.750
<v Speaker 1>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see him get elise.</v>

101
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.690
<v Speaker 1>How he wants shifting the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be about family,</v>

102
00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:53.150
<v Speaker 1>to win them over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another way to show control in a movie</v>

103
00:04:53.151 --> 00:04:55.280
<v Speaker 1>is through controlling the voices of</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

104
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.860
<v Speaker 1>This can be as simple as regulating when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk</v>

105
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.880
<v Speaker 1>or regulating what they're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

106
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.840
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we</v>

107
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.060
<v Speaker 1>associate what people say with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking,</v>

108
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 1>what they believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they want.</v>

109
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.980
<v Speaker 1>If you control what someone can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you control everything about them.</v>

110
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Shame my name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any scene,</v>

111
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:21.350
<v Speaker 1>a character's voice can show control in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these factors,</v>

112
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.200
<v Speaker 1>how voice directs the narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the voice controls the shot,</v>

113
00:05:24.201 --> 00:05:26.330
<v Speaker 1>and how characters control the voices of</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

114
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>It's usually a combination of the three</v>
<v Speaker 1>double you motherfucker.</v>

115
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.550
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wishes they had the control of</v>

116
00:05:34.551 --> 00:05:37.130
<v Speaker 1>voice like John Wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when people disagree with him,</v>

117
00:05:37.131 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 1>he still drives the narrative and it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete mastery of the world around</v>

118
00:05:40.581 --> 00:05:42.290
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He may sometimes be a flawed hero,</v>

119
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but the floor is never in his voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we always had some level of control.</v>

120
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 1>In Red River,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets betrayed,</v>

121
00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:50.510
<v Speaker 1>but his voice makes it clear that he'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>end up with what he wants.</v>

122
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Every time you turn around and expect to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see me one time,</v>

123
00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>you'll turn around and I'll be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with John Wayne's</v>

124
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never gets questioned.</v>

125
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Even when he loses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he still talks in that confident air,</v>

126
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>never completely losing his mastery of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of the West.</v>

127
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>What makes there will be blood so well</v>
<v Speaker 1>written is how carefully each scene</v>

128
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power dynamics through voice and Daniel</v>

129
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Plain fuse iconic presence does get</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged in inventive ways to the</v>

130
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>point where the film seems to question</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not a John Wayne like vocal</v>

131
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>control is ever possible or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>desired.</v>

132
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Daniel plainview actually gets a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>worthy opponent in the film.</v>

133
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Eli Sunday is a gifted orator and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly questions playing views,</v>

134
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.090
<v Speaker 1>vocal authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you started to</v>

135
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>take a seemingly benign conversation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plainview has with Eli Sunday.</v>

136
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>What appears to be Eli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just making a simple request is actually</v>

137
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 1>a carefully coated fight for vocal</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

138
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Eli starts with some innocent Chit Chat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which plain view doesn't engage in</v>

139
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>spirit seem high.</v>

140
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Then Eli chooses to see himself without</v>
<v Speaker 1>being offered.</v>

141
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Here we see Eli taking initiative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrasting his brother's politeness in</v>

142
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.970
<v Speaker 1>an earlier seed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I sit down please?</v>

143
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.870
<v Speaker 1>The scene becomes about vocal control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Eli asks to speak at the induction</v>

144
00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:08.310
<v Speaker 1>of the well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will bless the.</v>

145
00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Well actually he doesn't ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says he will directing the speech as</v>

146
00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:14.070
<v Speaker 1>he wants it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before you begin,</v>

147
00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:15.660
<v Speaker 1>you should introduce me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

148
00:07:15.661 --> 00:07:18.120
<v Speaker 1>plainview correction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Eli ignores his correction.</v>

149
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.100
<v Speaker 1>You'll see me walk up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He even provides him a script and then</v>

150
00:07:23.101 --> 00:07:28.101
<v Speaker 1>you could say the proud son of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>hills who tended his father's flock,</v>

151
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.900
<v Speaker 1>plainview bates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him letting him pick the time.</v>

152
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's make it 4:00 then and then it cuts</v>

153
00:07:33.301 --> 00:07:36.000
<v Speaker 1>to the actual induction where Eli is</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to speak,</v>

154
00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:38.850
<v Speaker 1>but plainview directs it his way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling up the little girl and</v>

155
00:07:38.851 --> 00:07:40.290
<v Speaker 1>performing his own script.</v>

156
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.080
<v Speaker 1>He does it all on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ignoring Eli's request.</v>

157
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 1>The camera hovers on Eli as plainview</v>
<v Speaker 1>blesses the well and his voice of God</v>

158
00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:48.660
<v Speaker 1>dominates the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Eli,</v>

159
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.840
<v Speaker 1>he even manipulated Eli's words and</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them his own number one name for</v>

160
00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:53.950
<v Speaker 1>the lovely ms dot every Sunday here by</v>
<v Speaker 1>my side,</v>

161
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.590
<v Speaker 1>a proud daughter of these hills and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple sequence plain view gives up the</v>

162
00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:00.930
<v Speaker 1>win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's Eli's guard down and deans back</v>

163
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.140
<v Speaker 1>control of directing the moment how he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted controlling the camera and</v>

164
00:08:04.141 --> 00:08:07.440
<v Speaker 1>controlling Eli's words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Eli shouldn't be underestimated as a</v>

165
00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:09.840
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He speaks very well and is the vocal</v>

166
00:08:09.841 --> 00:08:12.480
<v Speaker 1>leader of the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two directors pitted against each</v>

167
00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:14.220
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One directs the congregation.</v>

168
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.250
<v Speaker 1>The other directs the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next focal showdown between the two</v>

169
00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:20.370
<v Speaker 1>comes in Eli's territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When plain view has to get baptized.</v>

170
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Notice Eli already starts in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we hear his voice,</v>

171
00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:28.080
<v Speaker 1>before we see him speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly wish everyone could be saved.</v>

172
00:08:28.081 --> 00:08:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Don't chew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He directs when the congregation speaks.</v>

173
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plainview resists,</v>

174
00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:37.950
<v Speaker 1>but Eli subjugates him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to respond to as directed by Eli.</v>

175
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.760
<v Speaker 1>What do you want me to show you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life forces him to say exactly what he</v>

176
00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:45.930
<v Speaker 1>wants and what he's insecure about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bend in my child</v>

177
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.380
<v Speaker 1>and in a complete reversal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eli speaks as the voice of God</v>

178
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:55.120
<v Speaker 1>throughout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we focus on plain,</v>

179
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a total opposite to the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>confrontation you like,</v>

180
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>gives him the lines and he has to recite</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

181
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.690
<v Speaker 1>forcing plainview to for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose his vocal control.</v>

182
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.820
<v Speaker 1>The next time they see each other is at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the movie.</v>

183
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Even though Eli asks for help in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>

184
00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:16.040
<v Speaker 1>he still starts off in control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera follows him and he asserts</v>

185
00:09:16.041 --> 00:09:19.130
<v Speaker 1>himself by making them drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When plain view agrees to work with him,</v>

186
00:09:19.131 --> 00:09:24.040
<v Speaker 1>he says he'll do it on one condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like you to tell me that you are to</v>

187
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.270
<v Speaker 1>have been false prophet</v>
<v Speaker 1>because God is a superstition and now</v>

188
00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:32.230
<v Speaker 1>playing view is the director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

189
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.053
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

190
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.213
<v Speaker 2>put your glass down.</v>

191
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>In theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plainview has bested him,</v>

192
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really feel like a John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wayne kind of local control.</v>

193
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.730
<v Speaker 1>I did watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>

194
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a bastardized version because at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end,</v>

195
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>plain winds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not in control.</v>

196
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.040
<v Speaker 1>He spirals completely out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Towards the end,</v>

197
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:02.540
<v Speaker 1>he phones from the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stutter,</v>

198
00:10:02.541 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>screams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grunts.</v>

199
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 1>He loses mastery of everything in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

200
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Even his walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we think of John Wayne's grace,</v>

201
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 1>it's also in his walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plainview stumbles around incomplete,</v>

202
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.323
<v Speaker 1>erratic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic,</v>

203
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.023
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

204
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.710
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have control at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another relationship that showcases his</v>

205
00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:21.200
<v Speaker 1>lack of vocal control is with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>adopted son,</v>

206
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.690
<v Speaker 1>hw at first do they work together as</v>
<v Speaker 1>partners,</v>

207
00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:26.690
<v Speaker 1>but when he becomes deaf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lose their ability to communicate</v>

208
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.530
<v Speaker 1>and in short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plainview doesn't know what to do with</v>

209
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:32.600
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's no longer an asset to the company</v>

210
00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:34.520
<v Speaker 1>in plainview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sends him away years later,</v>

211
00:10:34.521 --> 00:10:38.150
<v Speaker 1>hw returns with his translator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and plainview tries to control him</v>

212
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:41.750
<v Speaker 1>vocally by forcing him to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming threatened when he considers</v>

213
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:45.080
<v Speaker 1>how a competitor you speak instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your little dog wolf,</v>

214
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.500
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>

215
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:45.971
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>

216
00:10:45.971 --> 00:10:46.790
<v Speaker 1>full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full.</v>

217
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.560
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets vocal control,</v>

218
00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:51.950
<v Speaker 1>but at what cost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cruel and doesn't feel like mastery</v>

219
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.680
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel plainview may have the vocal</v>

220
00:10:54.681 --> 00:10:56.330
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a con man.</v>

221
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.240
<v Speaker 1>In one of his monologues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he elegantly talks about the schools,</v>

222
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:01.730
<v Speaker 1>he'll build the wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll grow and the importance of family</v>

223
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:04.100
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the visual show only men and no</v>

224
00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:07.520
<v Speaker 1>school's irrigation or farmland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just people preparing the drilling.</v>

225
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.180
<v Speaker 1>His Voice of God authority tricks us</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though plain view constantly talks</v>

226
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:14.300
<v Speaker 1>about bringing wealth to the town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are actually very few signs of him</v>

227
00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:17.450
<v Speaker 1>improving the town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a sort of false sense of control</v>

228
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:19.790
<v Speaker 1>when he talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He vocally controls Eli,</v>

229
00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:22.580
<v Speaker 1>but not himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't vocally control his son because</v>

230
00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:25.430
<v Speaker 1>he lost his hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he tries anyway and he can't control</v>

231
00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the work he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to lie about the benefits of his</v>

232
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:30.830
<v Speaker 1>drilling and much of the dangers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>worker out of his control.</v>

233
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:34.400
<v Speaker 1>We expect playing views monologue to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>true because narrators are supposed to</v>

234
00:11:34.401 --> 00:11:36.950
<v Speaker 1>guide the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One John Wayne movie that follows these</v>

235
00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:40.370
<v Speaker 1>principles of narration is Red River,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has a monologue that's almost</v>

236
00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:43.400
<v Speaker 1>identical to plain views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you replace oil drilling with cattle,</v>

237
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.740
<v Speaker 4>good hungry people to make them strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make them grow.</v>

238
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 4>The key</v>

239
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 1>difference though is that John Wayne's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypermasculine advertisement of his</v>

240
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>cattle business is actually taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

241
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 1>whereas there will be blood codes plain</v>
<v Speaker 1>view as a fraud.</v>

242
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne's movie seemed to have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic ideals for heroes,</v>

243
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.570
<v Speaker 1>whereas there will be blood shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more sinister sides of being in</v>

244
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:06.760
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know I said John Wayne always has</v>

245
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 1>vocal control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even he loses it in some of his</v>

246
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:14.041
<v Speaker 1>later movies that says</v>
<v Speaker 1>this chaotic shooting of Buffalo sheds</v>

247
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 1>light on the darker side to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly mastery.</v>

248
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of his earlier films create an idea</v>

249
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 1>of a hypermasculine male with complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of what they say and how they</v>

250
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain fantasy to sounding</v>

251
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:30.040
<v Speaker 1>like John Wayne Chandler and the easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>way you'll learn the hard way,</v>

252
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 1>but movies like there will be blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring into question the validity of such</v>

253
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 1>a one dimensional kind of control.</v>

254
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Having such vocal authority actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't end well.</v>

255
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 1>If someone really had as mainly a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominion over their world,</v>

256
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.980
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't end up like a cool suave</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne riding into the sunset.</v>

257
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 1>They'd probably become the erratic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable and lonely Daniel plainview</v>

258
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.580
<v Speaker 1>because at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old western heroes aren't real.</v>

259
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 1>That level of mastery is not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>unrealistic but also dangerous.</v>

260
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.350
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why couldn't Daniel,</v>

261
00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 1>plainview have let Eli Sunday give that</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech?</v>

262
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 1>What difference does it make if he gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>his little blessing?</v>

263
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Daniel plainview explains it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a competition,</v>

264
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.850
<v Speaker 1>no one else to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that hypermasculine</v>

265
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:13.930
<v Speaker 1>unfaltering thinking is no way to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no fantasy to strive towards.</v>

266
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Never Apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. to sign of weakness.</v>

267
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Speaker 1>When studying voice John Wayne makes for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great place to start.</v>

268
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 1>His way of speaking is hyperbolic and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents the ability to vocally master</v>

269
00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:24.340
<v Speaker 1>a scene.</v>

270
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.930
<v Speaker 1>His purest vocal power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

271
00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 1>feels unrealistic in dangerous when</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying more vocally complicated</v>

272
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One can use John Wayne's power as a</v>

273
00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:35.590
<v Speaker 1>starting point and see how a character</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeds in the John Wayne level of</v>

274
00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 1>vocal control and how they fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they control the camera?</v>

275
00:13:38.471 --> 00:13:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Do they control the narrative and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>they control others,</v>

276
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 1>and also at what cost?</v>
