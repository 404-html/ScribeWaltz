00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to now you see it,</v>

2
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>it affect his moment in a scary movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires extremely precise editing and</v>

3
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>camera direction to actually be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a cool case study to outline</v>

4
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>this idea in a movie currently out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>theaters called lights out the movies</v>

5
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:31.850
<v Speaker 1>based off of a short film with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

6
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>general concept and director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting is that the movie and</v>

7
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>the short film have a moment that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the same,</v>

8
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>but I think one is much scarier than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

9
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.380
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at those scary moments and</v>

10
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 1>see which one has done better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the movie</v>

11
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.440
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The short film,</v>

12
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 1>so which one's scarier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My guess is you picked the short film,</v>

13
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at how the short film</v>

14
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:41.170
<v Speaker 1>perfectly uses many horror techniques</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the movie,</v>

15
00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:42.740
<v Speaker 1>despite being so similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>

16
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I think the most important difference is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the length of the clip.</v>

17
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.280
<v Speaker 1>The movie clip is actually from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trailer because the movie still in</v>

18
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trailer cut makes the movie clip</v>

19
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>about four seconds shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In those four seconds to short film has</v>

20
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>an extra flicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lights with each added second is a</v>

21
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>lot more suspense added to the scary</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

22
00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>so when the pattern suddenly changes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ghost moves,</v>

23
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 1>it's that much more startling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to scare the audience</v>

24
00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:05.620
<v Speaker 1>with a clown attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do it?</v>

25
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you let the clowns sit motionless for</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 long seconds while we have no choice</v>

26
00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:15.121
<v Speaker 1>but to uncomfortably stare at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden it's gone?</v>

27
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Or do you show the clown for a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds at a time and throw in a couple</v>

28
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:26.630
<v Speaker 1>of random jump scares with no buildup or</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuity?</v>

29
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.430
<v Speaker 1>It's making the choice between one</v>
<v Speaker 1>really big scare or a bunch of little</v>

30
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 1>okay scares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which moment builds up the payoff</v>

31
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.230
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another difference in the two moments is</v>

32
00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 1>that the short film has a very powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot right here.</v>

33
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>It's from the creature's point of view</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it looks towards the woman like a</v>

34
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Predator stocking its prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This shot makes the woman look small and</v>

35
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>powerless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a shop we're all familiar with</v>

36
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>in horror movies and that suspense by</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing a character being watched by the</v>

37
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the movie clip is it</v>

38
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>just switches from her reaction to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shot of the monster and it's not as</v>

39
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>menacing as the point of view shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

40
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>where are they in the movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A warehouse.</v>

41
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>It's never fully addressed in the movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it makes them limit less scary</v>

42
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>because we're unfamiliar with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>

43
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>A big component of many horror films is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these monsters or serial killers or</v>

44
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>supernatural beings invade places where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought we were safe.</v>

45
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes it scary.</v>

46
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.340
<v Speaker 3>The call is coming from inside though</v>

47
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.510
<v Speaker 1>lesion is a real life fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we're in our pajamas heading to</v>

48
00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:46.980
<v Speaker 1>bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when we're at our most</v>

49
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:49.230
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The short film really capitalizes on</v>

50
00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:51.900
<v Speaker 1>this idea and it's genuinely scary in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>

51
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:55.770
<v Speaker 1>We see an unfamiliar monster in a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>where already unfamiliar with so it's</v>

52
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:58.140
<v Speaker 1>not as scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the three main differences I</v>

53
00:03:58.141 --> 00:03:59.580
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could go even deeper.</v>

54
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.870
<v Speaker 1>For one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the short film,</v>

55
00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:04.260
<v Speaker 1>The lady is always bright in the shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it seems more menacing when we can</v>

56
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Speaker 1>see her clearly while also seeing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ghost in the movie.</v>

57
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:09.510
<v Speaker 1>When the ghost is visible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lady can't really be seen,</v>

58
00:04:09.511 --> 00:04:12.210
<v Speaker 1>so she seems more removed from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster and the threat.</v>

59
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I also think the ambient hum in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>background makes this short film</v>

60
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:15.870
<v Speaker 1>scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

61
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:18.630
<v Speaker 1>the fact that in the short film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lady has to walk through the hallway</v>

62
00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:20.160
<v Speaker 1>where the ghost already is.</v>

63
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.370
<v Speaker 1>That seems scarier than having the lady</v>
<v Speaker 1>already had the light switch,</v>

64
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.680
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there any other aspects that make</v>

65
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 1>the short film scarier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I overthinking something?</v>

66
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Leave your comments below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting a laugh requires a funny</v>

67
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:33.840
<v Speaker 1>performance or a well timed cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting people to cry,</v>

68
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:36.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe take strong characters and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous film score.</v>

69
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Getting an amazing shot requires</v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling cinematography,</v>

70
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.570
<v Speaker 1>but to get a scare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need everything at once.</v>

71
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.100
<v Speaker 1>The music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the timing,</v>

72
00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>the script,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actors,</v>

73
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>everything has to work together or else</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not scary.</v>

74
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.570
<v Speaker 1>So before you go to sleep tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself what scares me the most.</v>

75
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for what?</v>

76
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slightly</v>

77
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.030
<v Speaker 2>just a bit of a break from the break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the monotony of all that.</v>
