1
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to now you see this video of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>train was first screen to a group of</v>

2
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:16.970
<v Speaker 1>people in France in January of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>96.</v>

3
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Legend has it that the viewers of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film were so overwhelmed by what looked</v>

4
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>like a train coming right at them that</v>
<v Speaker 1>many hid under their seats or ran to the</v>

5
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>back of the room in fear of getting hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth of the story is debated,</v>

6
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:29.810
<v Speaker 1>but what's certain is that seeing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>video for the first time have a train</v>

7
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>coming towards you would probably leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pretty shocked and amazed.</v>

8
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>So the question is even more than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>century later,</v>

9
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>can we be just as moved by film or are</v>
<v Speaker 1>we desensitized because we know that</v>

10
00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>things on screen aren't actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

11
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to explore the war film because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're films have such great potential to</v>

12
00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>shock and amaze us through their sheer</v>
<v Speaker 1>scope and powerful subject matter.</v>

13
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>How can film to portray war and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques do filmmakers used to picked</v>

14
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>war and the soldiers that fight them can</v>
<v Speaker 1>film portray war realistically.</v>

15
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at two types of war</v>
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>

16
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>probe war and Anti War French filmmaker</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

17
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>swatch Hifu is often attributed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying there's no such thing as an</v>

18
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>antiwar film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Steven Spielberg said in an</v>

19
00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:14.830
<v Speaker 1>interview with Newsweek magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course every movie good or bad is an</v>

20
00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>antiwar movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who's right.</v>

21
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to argue that while neither of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these statements is correct,</v>

22
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 1>they do give insight into the nature of</v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

23
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 1>but before arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a film is pro or anti war,</v>

24
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:28.420
<v Speaker 1>we have to define pro and anti war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A definition like antiwar portrays war</v>

25
00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 1>in a bad light and pro war portrays</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a good light is somewhat of an</v>

26
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>oversimplification.</v>

27
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.300
<v Speaker 1>A lot of war films show a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative aspects of war.</v>

28
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>They were expendable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

29
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.700
<v Speaker 1>shows Japanese airplanes blowing up a US</v>
<v Speaker 1>pt boat and killing a soldier.</v>

30
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shot of John Wayne</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsing at the side of the boat way</v>

31
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>down by his combat boots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera following him to the ground.</v>

32
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.440
<v Speaker 1>This scene reflects wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel,</v>

33
00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dead.</v>

34
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.910
<v Speaker 1>But if we look at the movie as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a pro war propaganda</v>

35
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shot up,</v>

36
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>General Macarthur commander of the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he towers over the camera,</v>

37
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 1>speaks little and is treated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers as a celebrity please.</v>

38
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 1>He's looked at as a hero and savior up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the United States and this and along</v>

39
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>with lots of pro war sentiment in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film shows that they were expendable as</v>

40
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>much more pro war than Antigua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a better definition for a pro</v>

41
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>war film would be a film that shows the</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of war outweighing the cost and</v>

42
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.590
<v Speaker 1>an antiwar film shows the cost of war</v>
<v Speaker 1>outweighing the benefits.</v>

43
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 1>A modern example of a probe war film is</v>
<v Speaker 1>American sniper.</v>

44
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Clint Eastwood makes the claim that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film is antiwar and it definitely has a</v>

45
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:33.070
<v Speaker 1>lot of aspects of an antiwar film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film shows that word isn't always</v>

46
00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:35.560
<v Speaker 1>black and white and can cause serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional trauma.</v>

47
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.980
<v Speaker 1>But what makes it pro war is that Chris</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle believes he did the right thing.</v>

48
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll just protect them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Gosh,</v>

49
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to kill our soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

50
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:45.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm willing to meet my creator and as</v>

51
00:02:45.581 --> 00:02:46.660
<v Speaker 2>for every shot that I took,</v>

52
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>the film is pro war because it conveys</v>
<v Speaker 1>that despite all the trauma of war war,</v>

53
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm blessed with the gift of aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Overpowering need to protect the flock,</v>

54
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.900
<v Speaker 1>rare breed live to confront the wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the sheepdog.</v>

55
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>The benefits of war outweigh the costs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and worry is unnecessary evil against</v>

56
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>those who caused terror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's with films like American sniper</v>

57
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>where I think Spielberg is wrong in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement about war.</v>

58
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Films or films normally don't make out</v>
<v Speaker 1>war as something to look forward to,</v>

59
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>but they can certainly make wore out as</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

60
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Pro War films use heroes and an idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greater good to convey the message</v>

61
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>that war is necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's antiwar film,</v>

62
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 1>showcase the brutality and cruelty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>war to portray combat negatively.</v>

63
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>To get a look at how filmmakers you send</v>
<v Speaker 1>them a tography to have an antiwar film</v>

64
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>show the horrors and realities of</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat.</v>

65
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>One has to look no further than the DJ</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene in saving private Ryan.</v>

66
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.030
<v Speaker 1>The transition from the old man in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening scene to the beaches of Normandy</v>

67
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:53.480
<v Speaker 1>is done with a jarring smash cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't fade.</v>

68
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.430
<v Speaker 1>We don't zoom in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fast and abrupt transition.</v>

69
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It gives the effect of being forced into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene without adequate preparation.</v>

70
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>The shot of the endless rows of anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>landing barriers on the beach looks</v>

71
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.120
<v Speaker 1>eerily similar to the rows of tombstones</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the graveyard.</v>

72
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:09.210
<v Speaker 1>We just saw in the earlier scene a</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreshadowing of what's to come.</v>

73
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.750
<v Speaker 1>We get several closeups of soldiers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they certainly aren't the typical war</v>

74
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:15.230
<v Speaker 1>heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first image of our hero is his hand</v>

75
00:04:15.231 --> 00:04:16.740
<v Speaker 1>shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sign of fear.</v>

76
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Compare that to the grand introduction</v>
<v Speaker 1>of John Wayne on a squadron of pt boats</v>

77
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:23.610
<v Speaker 1>that are basically showing off to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera or even American sniper where</v>

78
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kyle first gets shown with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

79
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:26.730
<v Speaker 1>powerful sniper rifle.</v>

80
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Speaker 1>The Omaha beach scene shows a war fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the terrified not by the heroic or</v>

81
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:32.430
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The killing on the beach is best</v>

82
00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>described as pure chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera shake point of view shots and</v>

83
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:40.020
<v Speaker 1>minimal movement blur all work together</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull the viewer onto the battlefield</v>

84
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:42.450
<v Speaker 1>alongside the other soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With all these effects,</v>

85
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.050
<v Speaker 1>this scene definitely conveys that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs of war outweighed the benefits.</v>

86
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.860
<v Speaker 1>A great way for a film to Portray Warren</v>
<v Speaker 1>in negative way is to make war scenes as</v>

87
00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:52.830
<v Speaker 1>realistic as possible by putting us in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real world.</v>

88
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>We feel the terror and get a sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>war may not be worth all the turmoil it</v>

89
00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>causes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waltz with Bashir is another great</v>

90
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Speaker 1>example of pulling us into the action</v>
<v Speaker 1>and showing how work could have such</v>

91
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:05.070
<v Speaker 1>devastating effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movies and animation war,</v>

92
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>film and the resulting effect is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were removed from the reality and the</v>

93
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>film because it's animated and doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>look realistic.</v>

94
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Then in the last minute or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film quickly cuts to actual footage</v>

95
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>of the aftermath of the massacres in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lebanon.</v>

96
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.860
<v Speaker 1>The result is heart wrenching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It jars us from the spectacle of the</v>

97
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:24.210
<v Speaker 1>animation into the harshness of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see widows crying dead bodies and</v>

98
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 1>it's all thrown at us with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation for the transition from</v>

99
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:30.360
<v Speaker 1>cartoons to reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The effect is extremely powerful and we</v>

100
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>realized that what we were originally</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing only an animated characters is in</v>

101
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:38.160
<v Speaker 1>fact exactly the reality of war and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is horrific suffering.</v>

102
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.830
<v Speaker 1>If that's not an antiwar film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I don't know what it is.</v>

103
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I do see where the food is coming from</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he says there's no such thing as an</v>

104
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:46.710
<v Speaker 1>antiwar film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying that film by nature</v>

105
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:49.200
<v Speaker 1>contained spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since we're not actually on the</v>

106
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:51.480
<v Speaker 1>battlefield and our safe in our movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater seats,</v>

107
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.810
<v Speaker 1>we don't completely feel exactly like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soldiers do because we're removed</v>

108
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 1>from the reality.</v>

109
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>This removal makes it difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>construct a film that truly leaves</v>

110
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed it at war because we're safe</v>

111
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can enjoy watching the destruction of</v>

112
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>film in the theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Famous director,</v>

113
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Samuel Fuller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon watching the very antiwar,</v>

114
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>full metal jacket stated that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just another goddamn recruiting film.</v>

115
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Even when films try to criticize war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they can still give the effect</v>

116
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>of making more glamorous cinema as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>art form is limited because no matter</v>

117
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>how John we are to the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always that barrier from</v>

118
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A train on screen doesn't frighten us</v>

119
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 1>like it would in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe we are a little desensitized by</v>

120
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 1>the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We aren't shocked like the viewers of</v>

121
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>the train were back in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>96.</v>

122
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Some may say that's a limitation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>

123
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>but to others it's a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a challenge all filmmakers have to</v>

124
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>tackle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to surprise and astonish us</v>

125
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>even when we're used to watching film</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe not every blockbuster these</v>

126
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>days can blow you away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every once in a while if you're</v>

127
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to see a film that hits you like</v>

128
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.230
<v Speaker 1>a free</v>

129
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.840
<v Speaker 4>train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thanks for watching.</v>
