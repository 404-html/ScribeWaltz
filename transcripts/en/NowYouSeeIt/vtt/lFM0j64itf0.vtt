1
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No words are bad,</v>

2
00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:06.100
<v Speaker 1>but some people start using them a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hurt other people and then they</v>

3
00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>become bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd become a hard,</v>

4
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>there's words that I love that I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>use because other people use them wrong</v>

5
00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>to hurt other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the word cons is a beautiful word</v>

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beauty forward and I don't,</v>

7
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean aesthetically it has like</v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate and around on the ends.</v>

8
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I just liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just liked the way it sounds and I</v>

9
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>don't use it as an insight.</v>

10
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm alone in my laundry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like tones.</v>

11
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Words hold a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you give a guy in particular swear</v>

13
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:46.090
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while people may just consider them a</v>

14
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>way to make something funny or to show</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's,</v>

15
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Matt actually goes a lot deeper than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

16
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to explore swear words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how they're used and how they reveal</v>

17
00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>a lot more than you may think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

18
00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know where swearing came from.</v>

19
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>One has to look no further than the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

20
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>The word swearing and cursing are</v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical in origin.</v>

21
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>The first words that were taboo where</v>
<v Speaker 1>words that said the Lord's name in vain</v>

22
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>way back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swearing on the Bible was a big deal</v>

23
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>because people really thought perjury</v>
<v Speaker 1>undetected by the legal system would be</v>

24
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>punished by an ease dropping and easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>offended God.</v>

25
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you swear to tell the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole truth and nothing but</v>

26
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 1>similarly a curse on someone was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only serious but also deadly.</v>

27
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays our society has lessens the</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of those vulgarities and focused</v>

28
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.690
<v Speaker 1>more on the taboos of sex and bodily</v>
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>

29
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 2>She looked me in the eyes and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom is making a pub salad and I need</v>

30
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 2>some sets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>own dressing,</v>

31
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 2>but I think</v>

32
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a common misconception to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've become completely desensitized</v>

33
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>from swears in the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

34
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of movies swear like crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but swear words still hold that element</v>

35
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>of taboo to prove my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

36
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been fuck like that since</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade school.</v>

37
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Would this line have had the same effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was,</v>

38
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I haven't made love this intensely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People may associate swearing with</v>

39
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swearing in rage.</v>

40
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>But what's interesting in cinema is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can often be the opposite.</v>

41
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>The person who swears is the one that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in control of the scene.</v>

42
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Jerry [inaudible] guard in Fargo is</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly sworn at by people he hires</v>

43
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>and fucking wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>or your fucking wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cherry strangers through a bald face,</v>

45
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:27.291
<v Speaker 1>liar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking liar and his own son.</v>

46
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>And when he gets pushed too far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finally curses back.</v>

47
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>But it's hilariously lane Darren</v>
<v Speaker 1>two-toned</v>

48
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>port until yet he's an extremely weak</v>
<v Speaker 1>character who constantly gets pushed</v>

49
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>around and the swear words reveal how</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in his life can talk down to</v>

50
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>him and control him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one who swearing is the one</v>

51
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:55.341
<v Speaker 1>dominating the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a verbal way of marking</v>

52
00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>your territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll notice in the opening of</v>

53
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>reservoir dogs that white is the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>one who gets this weird directly at the</v>

54
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>boss showing not only that they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>more casual relationship,</v>

55
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.410
<v Speaker 1>but that Mr. White is willing to stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to it.</v>

56
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.230
<v Speaker 1>My full time shit fucking here and y'all</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it back to you.</v>

57
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Swear words carry a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most famous line in cinema,</v>

58
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My hair,</v>

59
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not be the same without the swear.</v>

60
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>A much bigger deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in 1939 the curse word really</v>

61
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>embodies how fed up red is with scarlet</v>
<v Speaker 1>O'hara and he's not bubbling and anger.</v>

62
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>It's pure apathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A place where swearing is controversial</v>

63
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>is actually stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that angel debate of vulgarity</v>

64
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:31.700
<v Speaker 1>and whether or not comedians could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as funny without the constant f</v>

65
00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the glasses just completely</v>

66
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>disguised as this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it was something about</v>

67
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of them are stuck in a fucking cave</v>

68
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>every week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

69
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And that was the bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I said,</v>

70
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see if it works without the word.</v>

71
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I took the word out,</v>

72
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what bothered me.</v>

73
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>And why do comedians swear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not about the swear word there.</v>

74
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>it's about you getting worked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

76
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>it's about this guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he means this.</v>

77
00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 1>He's so annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

78
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>The fucking cave your ass funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's contempt that take for example,</v>

79
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>this swear word that's always bothered</v>
<v Speaker 1>me in the titanic,</v>

80
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.510
<v Speaker 1>he's got the iceberg warning and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hand.</v>

81
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hand,</v>

82
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>it serves no purpose and it's a poor use</v>
<v Speaker 1>of vulgarity.</v>

83
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Definitely makes anything funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

84
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you,</v>

85
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:20.490
<v Speaker 1>once you inject a fuck into your speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it funnier.</v>

86
00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>It gives it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives it an emphasis and it gives it</v>

87
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 1>a shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just about every swear word in the</v>

88
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>departed seems to make me laugh.</v>

89
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Green is on a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but spoke with anyone.</v>

90
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Just stop now go fuck yourself.</v>

91
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Kidding myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If sometimes a swear words purpose is</v>

92
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>just as simple as that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the movie they don't just swear</v>

93
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>leftin write characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No when it's appropriate or not.</v>

94
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Like using a softer word when flirting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone.</v>

95
00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

96
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 3>just smack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll have fun there.</v>

97
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:42.784
<v Speaker 3>I'll break your grades.</v>

98
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.040
<v Speaker 1>You've got her interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can go in for the sweater.</v>

99
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 3>When's the last time you checked before</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to a second topic</v>

100
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.750
<v Speaker 1>is 40 Melissa McCarthy essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameos as the character that swears</v>

101
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:57.210
<v Speaker 1>nonstop and it's just dumped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

102
00:04:57.211 --> 00:04:59.760
<v Speaker 1>I love a good improvised moment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>swear words can be really funny,</v>

103
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.830
<v Speaker 1>but this scene makes no sense in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

104
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a horrible fucking woman.</v>

105
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.000
<v Speaker 1>This is why everybody hates you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jill.</v>

106
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>This kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

107
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 1>they're in a principal's office and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just met and she's going to talk like</v>

108
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not realistic and frankly it's</v>

109
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:15.090
<v Speaker 1>boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of this talk is productive,</v>

110
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.830
<v Speaker 1>but how about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try something a little more</v>

111
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:19.460
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this swear word accomplish?</v>

112
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me,</v>

113
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.490
<v Speaker 4>what did you mix say to hear multiple</v>
<v Speaker 4>migs and the next step is to do,</v>

114
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 4>what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

115
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.810
<v Speaker 4>I can smell your content.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>

116
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Misuse of swearing has many layers to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

117
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.190
<v Speaker 1>At first it seems like a way to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarissa uncomfortable.</v>

118
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Hannibal obviously heard what makes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just wants her to have to say it,</v>

119
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 1>so she's embarrassed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with every insult and humiliating</v>

120
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Speaker 1>comment he spits at her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stays strong.</v>

121
00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Continuing to act polite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insincere,</v>

122
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.090
<v Speaker 1>see a lot doc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's partly Hannibal's</v>

123
00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 1>admiration for her strength and a sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pity that causes him to help.</v>

124
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain duality to swear</v>

125
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On one hand they're funny,</v>

126
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're deadly.</v>

127
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Nothing captures this idea more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies like full metal jacket and</v>

128
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>whiplash where authority figures yellow</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal abuse.</v>

129
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>That's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also deeply manipulative and cruel.</v>

130
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 5>What have we got here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking comedian.</v>

131
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.110
<v Speaker 5>I admire your honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hell,</v>

132
00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:19.170
<v Speaker 5>I like you can come over to my house and</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck my sister.</v>

133
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a lot of ways to use swear</v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

134
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.240
<v Speaker 1>but what ties them all together is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a swear word always reveal something.</v>

135
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.640
<v Speaker 1>It reveals control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a relationship or even some</v>

136
00:06:27.641 --> 00:06:29.890
<v Speaker 1>manipulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that saying sticks and stones</v>

137
00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:31.840
<v Speaker 1>may break my bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but words will never hurt me.</v>

138
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.880
<v Speaker 1>After watching this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you still think that's true?</v>

139
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.030
<v Speaker 6>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe not,</v>

140
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:37.830
<v Speaker 6>maybe fuck yourself</v>

141
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 5>slightly trends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a bit of a break from the norm.</v>

142
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 5>Just a little slot in the break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The monotony of all that hard.</v>
