1
00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>The politicians can pretend it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.890
<v Speaker 1>but Donald Trump calls it radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic terror.</v>

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk politics.</v>

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about who you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should vote for or whose campaign ads</v>

5
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:13.750
<v Speaker 1>are more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I do want to talk about is how</v>

6
00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 1>campaign ads brainwash you using 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old film making techniques.</v>

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.470
<v Speaker 1>The technique is called the montage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was one of the first visual</v>

8
00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>storytelling techniques and film to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

9
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's watch the most famous montage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>

10
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>So here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we ever actually see Marion Crane get</v>

11
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:53.471
<v Speaker 1>stabbed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closest contact the knife makes is</v>

12
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:55.090
<v Speaker 1>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>

13
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>but with montage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a series of images moving rapidly</v>

14
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 1>across the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can convince the viewer they see her</v>

15
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>stabbed repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scene consists of quick shots of the</v>

16
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>knife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marion's body and Marion struggling and</v>

17
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>screaming when seeing those images all</v>
<v Speaker 1>at once,</v>

18
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.700
<v Speaker 1>we associate the images with each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and create a story in our brains of what</v>

19
00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:15.010
<v Speaker 1>we saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially we got brainwashed.</v>

20
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 2>Now the third way is what one might call</v>
<v Speaker 2>pure shit.</v>

21
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Imagine the assembly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All all bill and how come beat chain to</v>

22
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:32.400
<v Speaker 2>create a different idea.</v>

23
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Here's another montage in citizen Kane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1941,</v>

24
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>it tells the story of Susan Cain being</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to perform across the country</v>

25
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>under the pressure of her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles.</v>

26
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.633
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

27
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>here's a more contemporary montage with</v>
<v Speaker 1>two people shooting up heroin.</v>

28
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>We didn't actually see anyone do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug,</v>

29
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>but the assembly of the images told the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story for us.</v>

30
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Now we have a closed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would show what he listens to.</v>

31
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 2>You saw a woman holding a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

32
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.090
<v Speaker 2>now we come back to his reaction to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is smile now?</v>

33
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:24.111
<v Speaker 2>What is he as a character?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a kindly man is sympathetic,</v>

34
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 1>so let's see how campaign ads do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world a president has to grapple</v>

35
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can't even imagine.</v>

36
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the job and she's the one who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>proven.</v>

37
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>She can get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Securing a massive reduction in nuclear</v>

38
00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Hillary Clinton's new world campaign</v>

39
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>ad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cut from the White House and it's</v>

40
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>long white pillows to Hillary Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking in front of more long white</v>

41
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>pillars to her walking off the plane to</v>
<v Speaker 1>her talking with Vladimir Putin.</v>

42
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Now these editors have thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of pictures of Hillary Clinton</v>

43
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>to choose from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For this commercial,</v>

44
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>it is no coincidence that they chose an</v>
<v Speaker 1>image of the White House and then three</v>

45
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>clips of common activities and locations</v>
<v Speaker 1>we associate with presidents,</v>

46
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>the walking by the White House pillars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leaving Air Force One,</v>

47
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>the talking with other world leaders all</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforced with the use of the phrase</v>

48
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>that's the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These editors are using a montage of</v>

49
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>images to make us Imagine Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton as president.</v>

50
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>When we see her working hard in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar spaces,</v>

51
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>we imagined her filling those same shoes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see her as a president in a</v>

52
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar way,</v>

53
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>but montage and campaign ads can also go</v>
<v Speaker 1>from positive to threatening.</v>

54
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take the middle piece of film</v>

55
00:03:29.691 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The woman with the child,</v>

56
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 2>but leave his two pieces of promos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will.</v>

57
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Now we'll put in a piece of film of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl in a bikini.</v>

58
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>He looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>good in a bikini.</v>

59
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 2>You smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he now?</v>

60
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 2>A dirty old man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's no longer a little bit nine</v>

61
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.940
<v Speaker 2>gentleman who loves baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>

62
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what film can do for you.</v>

63
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>More not just abroad,</v>

64
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 4>but here at home with the clear and</v>
<v Speaker 4>present threat of radical Islamic</v>

65
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 4>terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the march,</v>

66
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 4>we must secure our borders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington continues to fail us with</v>

67
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 4>groups like the gang of eight that</v>
<v Speaker 4>support amnesty and allow sanctuary</v>

68
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 4>cities.</v>

69
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>This video shows radical terrorists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal immigrants in a menacing,</v>

70
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>dark green tint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by the capital in front of a</v>

71
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>thunderstorm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by Marco Rubio.</v>

72
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>This montage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the tent and grainy found</v>

73
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look cinematically associates,</v>

74
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Marco Rubio with something Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear the most terrorism.</v>

75
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>The montage manipulates the audience to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see Rubio at has policies as terrorist</v>

76
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.600
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What immediately follows is Ted Cruz in</v>

77
00:04:37.601 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>bright saturated light speaking in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a large crowd,</v>

78
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>surfing as a metaphorical savior to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marco Rubio.</v>

79
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>In the first half of the Commercial</v>

80
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 4>America needs Ted Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The one proven conservative for</v>

81
00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>

82
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump ad uses a similar technique</v>

83
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>by fading out from Hillary Clinton and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama to Muslim looking people</v>

84
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>and an ambulance carrying an injured</v>
<v Speaker 1>person in the background.</v>

85
00:04:57.941 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

86
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.580
<v Speaker 4>the politicians can pretend it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>something else,</v>

87
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 4>but Donald Trump calls it radical</v>
<v Speaker 4>Islamic terror.</v>

88
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>These montages are carefully assembled</v>
<v Speaker 1>to associate Clinton and Obama with</v>

89
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the right images in the right</v>

90
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can create whatever emotional</v>

91
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>response that you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to make it clear that this video</v>

92
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>is supposed to be nonpartisan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican ideology allows for more</v>

93
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>brutal campaign ads because they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show Democrats are soft on terrorism,</v>

94
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>democrats to be just as brutal because</v>
<v Speaker 1>also portray Republicans as vicious</v>

95
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:26.480
<v Speaker 1>warmongers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it,</v>

96
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.210
<v Speaker 5>I would bomb the out of home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of these republicans carpet bomb</v>

97
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 5>them into oblivion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could actually be president.</v>

98
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Here we see a montage generalizing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican candidates,</v>

99
00:05:37.551 --> 00:05:40.160
<v Speaker 1>keeping them in low saturation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low quality footage,</v>

100
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.950
<v Speaker 1>and physically shrinking them in small</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect ratios,</v>

101
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.880
<v Speaker 1>and of course Hillary's clips are bright</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take up the whole street aid who can</v>

102
00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:48.800
<v Speaker 1>stop them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton.</v>

103
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised if Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigners made a montage of wounded</v>

104
00:05:52.341 --> 00:05:55.370
<v Speaker 1>soldiers like Nixon did in one campaign</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in 1968,</v>

105
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>never had so much military and</v>

106
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 6>diplomatic power been used so</v>
<v Speaker 6>ineffectively as in Vietnam.</v>

107
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>The point is that the assembly of images</v>
<v Speaker 1>is extremely powerful.</v>

108
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just limited to movies.</v>

109
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>This form of cinematic brainwashing</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens all the time,</v>

110
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>not only in campaign ads but also other</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercials.</v>

111
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Beer commercials don't sell beer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sell an idea and that idea is</v>

112
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>conveyed through a montage of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>smiling,</v>

113
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>being social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having fun,</v>

114
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>so know that more goes into campaign ads</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you might've thought,</v>

115
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 1>and remember not to just vote for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate who's editor.</v>

116
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Put images together the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is Jack Newton and I approved</v>

117
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:34.570
<v Speaker 1>this message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for awhile.</v>

118
