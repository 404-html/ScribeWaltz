1
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>The Simpsons has some of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorable gags,</v>

2
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the most memorable faces.</v>

3
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just go down to moles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to them?</v>

4
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>I bet he'd be willing to share some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his success.</v>

5
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Was he you with the most memorable catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrases?</v>

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Merge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too upset to eat.</v>

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Where do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to Moe's</v>

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>with almost 30 years on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show remains a staple in American</v>

9
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the secret that makes the show</v>

10
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 1>so legend?</v>

11
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

12
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.083
<v Speaker 1>the secret is bounced.</v>

13
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.383
<v Speaker 3>We did</v>

14
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>the simpsons had a comedic advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>over every other TV sitcom at the time</v>

15
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>because it was animated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it could be drawn at the Simpson</v>

16
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>riders could make the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could do just about anything.</v>

17
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 1>And that made for some hilarious gas.</v>

18
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.863
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

19
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes the simpsons so great is that</v>

20
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>the creators chose not to do just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 4>does the hardcore rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

22
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of cartoons that,</v>

23
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the impossible can happen,</v>

24
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you think about a Wiley coyote</v>

25
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 4>cartoon where he can literally blow up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then come back and he's,</v>

26
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 4>he's black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And or he's flattened like an accordion</v>

27
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 4>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was always made very clear to me that</v>

28
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 4>this is a real world and it gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>stretched.</v>

29
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it gets stretched like crazy.</v>

30
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Why purposefully hold back the cartoon</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

31
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.610
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

32
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the secret behind the Simpson</v>

33
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:48.280
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain point,</v>

34
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a cartoon.</v>

35
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>We're making a show that's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoon.</v>

36
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>It happens to be a cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a cartoon.</v>

37
00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:59.101
<v Speaker 1>Now we us young ones like the car goofy</v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoon jokes and as silly as we could</v>

38
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the slightly a whiz in the older</v>

39
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>guys that know the approach it as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and it was,</v>

40
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's genius.</v>

41
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>It's through the balance between cartoon</v>
<v Speaker 1>gags and realistic portrayals of family</v>

42
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 1>life that the simpsons stands out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This show had the heart and realism of a</v>

43
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>family Sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the humor of a cartoon take homeless</v>

44
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 1>triple bypass surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The episode has hilarious gags that</v>

45
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 1>could only be done in an animation show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Barnes,</v>

46
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I think he's dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>said to him,</v>

47
00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:26.974
<v Speaker 1>to his widow,</v>

48
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.293
<v Speaker 5>eh,</v>

49
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>no wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's alive.</v>

50
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canceled the him dope,</v>

51
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>but the episode is just real enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have genuinely emotional moments.</v>

52
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marge America's health care system is</v>

53
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:45.560
<v Speaker 2>second only to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

54
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Britain,</v>

55
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.630
<v Speaker 2>well all of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can thank your lucky stars.</v>

56
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 2>We don't live in Paraguay.</v>

57
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a perfect</v>

58
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>balance between what's real and what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

59
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>what I tried to is my life's work</v>

60
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 6>is to bridge the gap between the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

61
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 6>the funny artifice that I saw on tv and</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I knew was real.</v>

62
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's partly the success of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the simpsons.</v>

63
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>The result is a show that's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also has this connect with the</v>

64
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes homer such a memorable</v>

65
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>character is more than just when he's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot.</v>

66
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>The best moments in the simpsons are</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he proves he isn't a caricature and</v>

67
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>he's actually a caring husband and</v>
<v Speaker 1>loving father.</v>

68
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 6>Oh my little making.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They may never called you again.</v>

69
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Genki pants shows like family guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>south park are really good at providing</v>

70
00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:33.090
<v Speaker 1>social commentary and funny Gehrig's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these shows don't have the heart and</v>

71
00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:36.210
<v Speaker 1>realism of the simpsons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The simpsons has the perfect balance.</v>

72
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.840
<v Speaker 1>So whenever the simpsons has episodes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a specific topic like politics,</v>

73
00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:40.800
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or religion,</v>

74
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.430
<v Speaker 1>the episodes typically have sincere</v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons along with the edgy jokes and</v>

75
00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:47.310
<v Speaker 1>social commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Simpsons discusses these topics with</v>

76
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:49.770
<v Speaker 1>the perfect combination of humor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sincerity.</v>

77
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Other animated cartoons focus more on</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the most jokes as possible</v>

78
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:57.170
<v Speaker 1>rather than presenting a lesson and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other family sitcoms oftentimes shovel</v>

79
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.090
<v Speaker 1>corny message down your throat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Simpsons is right in the middle.</v>

80
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Take the episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bart sells his soul.</v>

81
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.610
<v Speaker 1>The episode is not without its classic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simpson's humor.</v>

82
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.930
<v Speaker 7>What every religion says there's a soap</v>
<v Speaker 7>bar.</v>

83
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.950
<v Speaker 7>Why would they lie?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What would they have to gain?</v>

84
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strobing but in between the jokes is a</v>

85
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>very interesting commentary on religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bart sells his soul to mail house for $5</v>

86
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>and he finds himself empty without it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unable to laugh at his pranks that you</v>

87
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>usually bring him joy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The episode actually has extremely</v>

88
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>powerful symbolism when Bart without his</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul,</v>

89
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>his left stranded in an ocean unable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>steer himself in the right direction.</v>

90
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>The episode has a great wide shot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bark protesting against spirituality in</v>

91
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 1>the barren church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With a heavenly light casting down on</v>

92
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 1>him from above and an Erie Echo in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

93
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.630
<v Speaker 7>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't have a soul.</v>

94
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.840
<v Speaker 7>I don't have a soul.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's no such thing as a soul.</v>

95
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Through his spiritual journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he realizes the value of his soul.</v>

96
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.730
<v Speaker 1>The episode conveys the message that one</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirituality is not given by some church</v>

97
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.060
<v Speaker 1>or by anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's created internally and the simpsons</v>

98
00:04:57.061 --> 00:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>gives all this philosophical thought in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cartoon.</v>

99
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that the simpsons is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>funniest most of the matic or most</v>

100
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:05.430
<v Speaker 1>realistic show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I am saying is that it is one</v>

101
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:09.210
<v Speaker 1>of the few shows to bounce each of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>three elements almost perfectly.</v>

102
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the glaring unanswered question is what</v>

103
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:15.450
<v Speaker 1>happens just about every Simpson's video</v>
<v Speaker 1>on youtube has a top comment about the</v>

104
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>shows decline in quality and while</v>
<v Speaker 1>people attribute many factors to the</v>

105
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:20.910
<v Speaker 1>decline of the simpsons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bad show runners,</v>

106
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:23.940
<v Speaker 1>bland storylines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lacey writing or overused celebrity</v>

107
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:26.580
<v Speaker 1>cameo appearances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the declines could possibly be</v>

108
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 1>summed up by saying the simpsons lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>its balance.</v>

109
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 1>A slate magazine review of the show sums</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up nicely.</v>

110
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Episodes that once would have ended with</v>
<v Speaker 1>homer and marge bicycling into the</v>

111
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:39.360
<v Speaker 1>sunset now and with homer blowing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tranquilizer dart into marches neck.</v>

112
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in the new hd opening title</v>

113
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:50.310
<v Speaker 1>sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see this subtle change in a show</v>

114
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that's more cartoon then reality.</v>

115
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.473
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

116
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.480
<v Speaker 1>The majority of television shows never</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain the balancing act,</v>

117
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:07.390
<v Speaker 1>the simpsons accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although that's not necessarily a bad</v>

118
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:09.370
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some shows are mostly to make you laugh</v>
