00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you see it.</v>

2
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Disney films have made great strides in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their portrayal of women from the</v>

3
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>entirely domestic and dependence snow</v>
<v Speaker 1>white in 1937 Oh</v>

4
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>to the adventurous and unconstrained</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maretta in 2012 a princess just not</v>

5
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 1>please her weapons on the team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to go a single day on the</v>

6
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Internet without finding yet another</v>
<v Speaker 1>blog post about free spirited women in</v>

7
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Disney movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the Disney princesses.</v>

8
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>They all praised Disney movies for</v>
<v Speaker 1>making great steps towards women's</v>

9
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>rights in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who cares?</v>

10
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 1>These are just movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't we stop relying on fictional</v>

11
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>storytelling to comment on reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to argue the film is in fact,</v>

12
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>one of the best methods of commenting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a society and a Disney princess can have</v>

13
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>more influence on the society than any</v>
<v Speaker 1>politician or leader women.</v>

14
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Every popular film to some extent</v>
<v Speaker 1>conforms with the society.</v>

15
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>It was maiden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

16
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>If a movie was released this year that</v>
<v Speaker 1>generalized all African Americans as</v>

17
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>unintelligent and sexually aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards women and also made out the Klu</v>

18
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Klux Klan is heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be a commercial success?</v>

19
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Probably not that wouldn't conform to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the values of our present society,</v>

20
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>but in the early 19 hundreds this kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of film could be a critical hit because</v>

21
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>that's society conform to those beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was in 1915 the birth of a nation</v>

22
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>was released and became the highest</v>
<v Speaker 1>grossing film of the year despite</v>

23
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>generalizing African Americans as</v>
<v Speaker 1>unintelligent.</v>

24
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>And the KKK is heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is people don't like</v>

25
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>seeing movies that greatly contradict</v>
<v Speaker 1>their views.</v>

26
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.410
<v Speaker 1>So the most commercially successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies generally avoid so much</v>

27
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 1>controversy that nobody pays to see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

28
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercially successful movies or a</v>

29
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>commentary on what the popular beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>were at the time of its making.</v>

30
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are plenty of thought provoking</v>

31
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>society critiquing movies out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we certainly don't see them topping</v>

32
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:47.600
<v Speaker 1>the box office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where do the Disney princesses fit</v>

33
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>into this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney produces some of the most popular</v>

34
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:53.510
<v Speaker 1>films of all time with 13 of the 25</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest grossing films in history from</v>

35
00:01:53.511 --> 00:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>The Walt Disney Corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Disney princess films,</v>

36
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 1>or some of their most successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at how Disney films</v>

37
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>can form with the societies they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>made in snow white takes place in</v>

38
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Germany in the 15 hundreds but it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much a portrayal of life for women in</v>

39
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>America when it was made in 1937 women</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this time,</v>

40
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 1>we're taught that their place was in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>home and snow white is a perfect</v>

41
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>representation of that view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For her,</v>

42
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>a home is the only safe place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The outside world is scary.</v>

43
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Her safety is in a house where she fees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooks and cleans for others and her life</v>

44
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>is eventually saved by a man.</v>

45
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Snow white is more telling a description</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the societal perceptions of women at</v>

46
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>that time been any textbook through</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>

47
00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>We get a taste of reality area reflects</v>
<v Speaker 1>society's portrayal of women during the</v>

48
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>creation of the little mermaid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1989 America has accepted the</v>

49
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>deviation from the nuclear family and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman's role outside of the home area</v>

50
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>leaves her home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ocean inserts for her destiny,</v>

51
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 1>but what does she in search for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A man,</v>

52
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.850
<v Speaker 1>1989 America still believes a woman's</v>
<v Speaker 1>main goal is to find a husband and start</v>

53
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>a family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Society has not yet reached the</v>

54
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 1>milestone of seeing women independent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man.</v>

55
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 1>And that is reflected in the popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinema of that era.</v>

56
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Maretta and brave show society's current</v>
<v Speaker 1>view of winning.</v>

57
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>She is fierce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>

58
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.880
<v Speaker 1>and doesn't need a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

59
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 1>she outperforms other men in her world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our society.</v>

60
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>We now recognize women can do anything a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manton do and don't need men in their</v>

61
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>lives to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women can now choose their own faith.</v>

62
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>When you see a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may take place in the past or the</v>

63
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>distant future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the film has always subtly</v>

64
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>commenting about the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was maiden.</v>

65
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Wally is about a future where humans had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to escape an inhabitable planets.</v>

66
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>But it's really a commentary about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we mistreat the environment today,</v>

67
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>who long it takes place in ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

68
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>But it's about how masculine qualities</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not exclusive to men in our current</v>

69
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a question.</v>

70
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Films are influenced by society's views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can society's views be influenced by</v>

71
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>film?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reach such a wide audience and can</v>

72
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>provide such powerful messages that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>change society's views in radical ways.</v>

73
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Like when jaws led to a huge drop in</v>
<v Speaker 1>beach tourism when men started forming</v>

74
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>their own fight clubs after fight club</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when a movie inspires some</v>

75
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>southerners to bring back the KKK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia is such an important film</v>

76
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.340
<v Speaker 1>because it was the first production to</v>
<v Speaker 1>portray on man with the HIV virus and it</v>

77
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>was a major inspiration for the founding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an international AIDS Awareness</v>

78
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Association in 1997 Philadelphia touch</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hearts of Americans and brought an</v>

79
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 1>awareness to the struggles of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

80
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>In a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a simple awareness campaign never could</v>

81
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.174
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

82
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.610
<v Speaker 1>What makes Disney princesses so</v>
<v Speaker 1>important is that they're marketed</v>

83
00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.410
<v Speaker 1>towards families and especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

84
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.990
<v Speaker 1>children specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls idolize these princesses.</v>

85
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.670
<v Speaker 1>They dress up like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they mimic them.</v>

86
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.190
<v Speaker 1>They act just like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't we want to raise girls who become</v>

87
00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:16.550
<v Speaker 1>women with strong views of themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Disney princesses presented meaning</v>

88
00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:19.490
<v Speaker 1>domesticating values for women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then women will become that through</v>

89
00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:22.100
<v Speaker 1>mimicking that behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disney princesses shaped the character</v>

90
00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>of the children that watch because girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be the princesses they see on</v>

91
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:27.200
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what characters should we show them?</v>

92
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>
