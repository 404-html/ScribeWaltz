1
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Did you know there was a remake of</v>
<v Speaker 1>psycho in 1998 starring Vince Vaughn as</v>

2
00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Norman Bates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all in our private traps.</v>

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Clampton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a commercial and critical</v>

4
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:13.790
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more or less a shot for shot</v>

5
00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>remake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes for a cool case study into</v>

6
00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>how the original psycho worked so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can compare the two movies,</v>

7
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 1>look at the subtle differences and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>why those differences matter and why it</v>

8
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>made the original site goes so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

9
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk specifically about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ending.</v>

10
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.140
<v Speaker 1>How did the original end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it hitchcock leave us with?</v>

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Most people remember the look to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera from Norman Bates,</v>

12
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>but it really ends with the car getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled out of the mud.</v>

13
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>The shot leaves a very bad taste in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouths because we know what's in the</v>

14
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to mention it's filmed very off</v>

15
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>center and it's coming right towards us.</v>

16
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>The remake starts the ending in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar way,</v>

17
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>but it ends by panning out to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape as the credits roll.</v>

18
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>This completely ruins the ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're supposed to end feeling disgusted</v>

19
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>and uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the pan reintroduced this us back</v>

20
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 1>into the world with its familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscapes and cars.</v>

21
00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Driving by the original psycho ending is</v>
<v Speaker 1>great because it's sickening.</v>

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>If the camera moves away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sickening image and ends with the</v>

23
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>familiar were moved from the story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the murder and are reintroduced back</v>

24
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>into society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no way to end the movie.</v>

25
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.500
<v Speaker 1>The psycho remake ending is closer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the riding,</v>

26
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>into the sunset kind of movie ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a kind of shot where we're</v>

27
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:19.280
<v Speaker 1>leaving the original story and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduced into the world.</v>

28
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Normally it's also shot with our main</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters who went through some sort of</v>

29
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 1>ordeal physically moving away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera to continue their journey.</v>

30
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>The western popularize this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ending,</v>

31
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's still very common in modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies just with a few tweaks nowadays.</v>

32
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It can be a car instead of a horse or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>street corner instead of a picture ask</v>

33
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 1>sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very comforting ending.</v>

34
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.210
<v Speaker 1>We see something familiar and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinematic cue that the story is over and</v>

35
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:44.720
<v Speaker 1>we're back to the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 angry men ends with the men who all</v>

36
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:46.730
<v Speaker 1>came together to pronounce the kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent,</v>

37
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>going back into the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world where the American judicial</v>

38
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>system works and people are only</v>
<v Speaker 1>convicted if they actually committed the</v>

39
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a comforting ending and it</v>

40
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>compliments the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good theme that even the most stubborn</v>

41
00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>people can listen to reason and change</v>
<v Speaker 1>their minds.</v>

42
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll be at not so easily and not so</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely,</v>

43
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not saying that all riding into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sunset endings are feel good.</v>

44
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>How about having a serial killer walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>back into society now?</v>

45
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>That's an eerie ending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do wish we could chat.</v>

46
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm having an old fat</v>

47
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>in a very similar way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doors closing at the end makes for a</v>

48
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>nice symbol to end the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a physical separation now</v>

49
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>literally closing the door on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure.</v>

50
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common.</v>

51
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>You can even use it to separate two main</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters within the story,</v>

52
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>which is what Francis Coppola did and</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the most famous movie ending of</v>

53
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:36.531
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

54
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 1>the searchers which has an opening shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>that starts at the doorway with John</v>

55
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Wayne coming in from the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the ending shot shows him</v>

56
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:46.690
<v Speaker 1>leaving through the same doorway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ending symbolizes our hero</v>

57
00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:48.700
<v Speaker 1>returning to the wilderness from which</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came.</v>

58
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Another comment ending is when the</v>

59
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 3>ending shot relates to the opening shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great super cut of opening and</v>

60
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 3>closing shots of movies shown side by</v>
<v Speaker 3>side on Vimeo and a lot of them relate</v>

61
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 3>to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The goal of this kind of ending is to</v>

62
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 3>show a shot similar to the opening shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that you've seen the movie,</v>

63
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 3>it should evoke a different feeling for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

64
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 3>The opening shot is the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>impression.</v>

65
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 3>The movie tells its story and the movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>ends with something similar to what it</v>

66
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 3>started with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last shot will always feel different</v>

67
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 3>because after the movie tells its story</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shot has an entirely different</v>

68
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 3>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the Godfather sql,</v>

69
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 3>the shot is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Michael Corleone is not and he looks</v>

70
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 3>at two in gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Girl,</v>

71
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 3>he uses violent imagery to refer to his</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife.</v>

72
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Picture of cracking or lovely skull</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoiling our brains,</v>

73
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 3>trying to get answers,</v>

74
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.950
<v Speaker 1>and by the last shot we know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun way to look at movies because</v>

75
00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:48.920
<v Speaker 1>the ending could potentially some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>main ideas of the movie.</v>

76
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.920
<v Speaker 1>The difference between the opening and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the closing is that the opening shot</v>

77
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.740
<v Speaker 1>hints at the main ideas and the ending</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforces them.</v>

78
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.770
<v Speaker 1>It's as if the director is highlighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important part of the movie.</v>

79
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.840
<v Speaker 1>So go watch your favorite movie ending</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

80
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe look for a symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the feathers</v>

81
00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:05.390
<v Speaker 1>symbolizes in forrest gump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no right or wrong answer,</v>

82
00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:07.850
<v Speaker 1>but we know what the director wants you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to notice.</v>

83
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.470
<v Speaker 1>What mood does the ending leave you</v>
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>

84
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the most important feeling of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie because what you walk out of the</v>

85
00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:15.500
<v Speaker 1>theater feeling is what matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So give it a try.</v>

86
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.680
<v Speaker 1>And with that I leave you with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>simpsons parody of the godfather ending</v>

87
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.990
<v Speaker 1>because I love the simpsons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for watching.</v>
