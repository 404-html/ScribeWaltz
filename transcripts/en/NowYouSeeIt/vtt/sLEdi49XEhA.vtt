1
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am sick and tired of being treated</v>

2
00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:10.510
<v Speaker 1>like I don't exist you to do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do whenever you want to do</v>

3
00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't complain all the time.</v>

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 2>So important about a dinner scene and</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would a director waste their time on</v>

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 2>something so simple?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're going to focus on</v>

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So welcome tonight.</v>

7
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't interrupt me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're done a drink.</v>

8
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I think dinner scenes are some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most powerful and revealing scenes in</v>

9
00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:41.350
<v Speaker 2>the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always show much more than people</v>

10
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They she'll communion.</v>

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 2>When I say communion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean an act of sharing and peace</v>

12
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 2>between the people at the dinner table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Directors use the dinner scene to show</v>

13
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 2>us relationships between each character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they get along or how they don't.</v>

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 2>I got to reply for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew.</v>

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 2>You think Carlton football's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come play with us.</v>

16
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Four words you will never hear from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>NFL,</v>

17
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 2>but I think even more is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know the process of eating a</v>

18
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 2>typical dinner you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about your day,</v>

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 2>make a few jokes and call it a night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when a meal goes wrong in a film,</v>

20
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 2>we especially noticed because we're used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to dinners going a certain way and</v>

21
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 2>that's what gives it dinner scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much potential either for Kuma</v>

22
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.380
<v Speaker 2>or for drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's funny,</v>

23
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's funny.</v>

24
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at what dinner scenes can</v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplish in three sections.</v>

25
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Humans eat the conflict and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected.</v>

26
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Whether you're a contract killer or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>demigod,</v>

27
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat and that makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>human.</v>

28
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 2>It was drawing [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

29
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:47.784
<v Speaker 2>It's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

30
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 2>Showing characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating makes them human like us.</v>

31
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 2>It puts us into their world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes us relate with them.</v>

32
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 2>We can't relate to stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diamonds are getting shot,</v>

33
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 2>but we can relate to getting in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument at the table.</v>

34
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 2>Dinner scenes make us empathize with</v>
<v Speaker 2>characters.</v>

35
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino uses the dinner scene very</v>
<v Speaker 2>well and reservoir dogs and pulp fiction</v>

36
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 2>to pull us into the world of his films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When these characters who we just saw</v>

37
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 2>have a friendly meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start getting shot and robbed the</v>

38
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.520
<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that much more shocking because we</v>

39
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 2>saw them as who they were people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who eat just like we do.</v>

40
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.500
<v Speaker 2>When people come together for dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be a peaceful</v>

41
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 2>communion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't always go that way.</v>

42
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Dinner scenes are perfect ways to show</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict.</v>

43
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 2>When people storm out,</v>

44
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go there.</v>

45
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>So my best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

46
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait dishes,</v>

47
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>get left alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not you know,</v>

48
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.280
<v Speaker 1>you'll be doing the dishes alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That says a lot about the characters</v>

49
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>without having to tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so a successful meal means just the</v>

50
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 1>opposite time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time to shove off moby and margie,</v>

51
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 1>let me just simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

52
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:49.773
<v Speaker 1>just</v>

53
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 2>dinner doesn't always go smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't for us in real life and it</v>

54
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 2>certainly doesn't for the characters in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a movie,</v>

55
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 2>since we can relate to how awkward and</v>
<v Speaker 2>meal can be,</v>

56
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 2>it can be much funnier when a dinner</v>
<v Speaker 2>scene doesn't go as expected.</v>

57
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea you could milk a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

58
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:10.021
<v Speaker 2>you can milk anything with nipples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have nipples.</v>

59
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you milk me or it can be that much</v>

60
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:18.161
<v Speaker 2>more dramatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go from the familiar dinner scene to</v>

61
00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:23.900
<v Speaker 2>an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Busting out of somebody's chest really</v>

62
00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:28.901
<v Speaker 2>adds to the horror</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner.</v>

63
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:32.960
<v Speaker 2>That's just a dinner would be boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A director wouldn't waste to scene with</v>

64
00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:35.750
<v Speaker 2>something as simple as people eating if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't to show something more</v>

65
00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:37.490
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I love about film.</v>

66
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.990
<v Speaker 2>A film doesn't have to tell us</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

67
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person doesn't get along with this</v>

68
00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:43.760
<v Speaker 2>person or this person is human just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

69
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.810
<v Speaker 2>It can just show us,</v>

70
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>hey Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to see you.</v>

71
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Showing rather than telling is what</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes a film go from good to great and</v>

72
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:09.600
<v Speaker 2>at dinner scene can be quite the show</v>
<v Speaker 2>and another thing from now on,</v>

73
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:12.300
<v Speaker 2>we're going to alternate our dinner</v>
<v Speaker 2>music because frankly,</v>

74
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.990
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think I'm alone here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really tired of this lawrence welk.</v>

75
00:04:15.991 --> 00:04:20.991
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for watching.</v>
