1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,550
History has not been kind to horses.
Many people talk about the 600,000

2
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:16,210
people killed in the American civil war,
but some overlook that the horse and

3
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:19,570
mule death toll is over 1 million.
In Victorian England.

4
00:00:19,571 --> 00:00:22,960
It was not uncommon for trolleys and
factories to work horses until they

5
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:25,600
dropped dead,
sometimes in the middle of busy streets,

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,810
up and into the 20th century.
Horses brutally stood with a side by

7
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:32,740
side in war time and in civilian life
and even today where the average person

8
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,260
almost never interacts with horses in
their everyday lives.

9
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,250
We still see the horse constantly in art
and media for every culture with horses,

10
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:40,900
there's a different meaning applied to
them.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,750
In Ancient Greece,
the animal was a sign of aspiration and

12
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:46,300
connection to the gods,
which we can see most clearly.

13
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:48,820
In Pegasus,
the Nordic people believed in horses for

14
00:00:48,821 --> 00:00:51,280
day and night,
called her and factsy and skin foxy,

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,980
who traversed the land and sea and moved
with the wind.

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,070
Gandalf's horse shadow.
Fax was directly influenced by this

17
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,720
norse mythology,
but in this video,

18
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:01,060
I want to talk about a specific course
mythology,

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,570
the American version one deeply
ingrained in the modern American

20
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:07,990
conscious American cinema has
historically used the horse as a symbol

21
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:09,400
of status,
masculinity,

22
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:12,580
and mastery over nature,
and to explore this particular meaning

23
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:14,860
of the horse.
Historians don't have to look at ancient

24
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:17,260
paintings and stories like with older
civilizations.

25
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,610
We can actually very clearly see the
symbolism of horses in the movies and TV

26
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:24,670
have the last 100 years up in into the
current day.

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,430
So what do I mean by the Horse?
As a symbol of mastery,

28
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,940
the horse provides the perfect
opportunity to show mans control over

29
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:31,960
nature.
For one thing,

30
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:35,560
horses are very wild and unpredictable.
They're too large to keep in the home

31
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,140
like a dog and strong enough to easily
kill a human,

32
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,240
so they are a worthy opponent to
control.

33
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,450
Bronc riding reminds us of their
strength because they're genuinely

34
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:46,510
dangerous in certain contexts.
Despite these characteristics,

35
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:48,940
we still manage to tame them on a
massive scale.

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,820
We are able to control them,
send them into battle and use them as

37
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:55,840
tools more so than any other animal of
that size and unlike cattle or other

38
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:57,850
livestock,
they can easily be mounted.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,570
There's nothing that shows mastery over
nature more than being on top of a large

40
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,970
wild beast directing it where you want
it to go.

41
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,450
Riding at a higher vantage point than
pedestrians to showcase my point.

42
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:10,990
How did the creators of the planet of
the apes series show that the monkeys

43
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:14,260
are dominating the planet,
are no longer simply wild animals and

44
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:17,170
are taking charge?
This simple image tells us everything we

45
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:20,710
need to know about how much the monkeys
are evolving and that's because of all

46
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:22,900
the meaning associated with riding a
horse.

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,550
Some of the earliest forms of cinema.
We can see how the horse human

48
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:31,380
relationship reinforce this horse riding
as a symbol of mastery in 18,

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,250
78,
Edward more bridge rigged.

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,970
Twenty four cameras on a racetrack with
trip wires that went off as a horse

51
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:39,310
galloped by.
He wanted to see if all four of the

52
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,900
horse's feet come off the ground at once
during Gallup.

53
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:45,010
Something that happens too quickly for
the human eye to see on its own.

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,510
This experiment tries to master the
movement of the Horse in a way more.

55
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:52,000
Bridge was taming the wild unknown
aspects of horseback riding and turning

56
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,850
them into something controllable by the
camera and by humans.

57
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,330
The camera man is a master of the world
around him capturing the horse as he

58
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:00,550
wants to make an part of nature.
No,

59
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,240
this experiment became one of the first
primitive forms of a motion picture and

60
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:08,170
it paved the way for cinema to contain
the wild nature of the horse.

61
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,660
From then on,
the horse in movies reflected a thing to

62
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:14,170
master a wild beasts to represent who
could control it and who couldn't.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,230
These early ideals of horseback riding
found their way into Hollywood,

64
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,750
particularly in the western genre.
In these movies,

65
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:23,650
the horse showcases the mastery and
control of the typical western hero.

66
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,220
The horse is an extension of these
masterful writers who could effortlessly

67
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:29,620
handled their horses in dangerous
situations.

68
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,860
A classic example of control through
horseback riding comes from John Wayne

69
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:34,360
in stagecoach.
Throughout the movie,

70
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,420
the people writing the stage coach are
being controlled by others.

71
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,870
They either change plans to avoid an
Apache attack or because of the military

72
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:44,320
made them do so symbolically.
It makes sense that these two outside

73
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:46,630
forces would control the fate of the
stagecoach.

74
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,320
Both the Apache and the military are the
men actually riding on horseback.

75
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,770
Unlike the stage coach where the horses
are in front pulling the people behind

76
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:54,010
them.

77
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,400
John Wayne famously abandons the
stagecoach to ride one of the horses

78
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:59,680
himself,
giving the visual cue that he is now

79
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:02,080
taking control by becoming a man on a
horse.

80
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,200
In this final battle scene in the
military and stage,

81
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,580
coach members shoot the Apache off of
their horses,

82
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,640
indicating that now the Apache are no
longer in control.

83
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,940
There's actually a running gag and
American westerns where men are dragged

84
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:15,370
by horses.
Here we see a complete reversal of the

85
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,520
traditional roles because the horse is
in control instead of the man.

86
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,640
This trope is always reserved for the
characters not in control.

87
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,970
The ones without the swab and mastery of
the traditional American hero.

88
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,330
Either they can't control their horse or
they ride the horse in a bastardized

89
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,010
way,
maybe they're too short to ride the

90
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:32,710
horse themselves,
or they have to fake writing altogether.

91
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,950
You'll never see John Wayne riding a
horse in any way other than one that

92
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:39,400
shows cool manly control,
which brings up another key aspect of

93
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:40,990
horseback riding in American cinema.

94
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,060
In the real worlds,
horseback riding is one of the most

95
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:46,300
gender neutral competitions to exist
today in the Olympics.

96
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,020
Equestrian events or some of the few
where men and women compete against each

97
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,250
other,
but in American cinema,

98
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,650
that is not the case with some notable
exceptions.

99
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:57,580
Women on horses are few and far between,
especially at the peak of the western

100
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,470
genre.
This phenomenon is historically

101
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:01,960
accurate.
Since the men had the agency money and

102
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:05,200
land to own their own horses.
We can still feel this masculine

103
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,390
perception of horseback riding in modern
media.

104
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,920
It explains why this joke work.

105
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,380
Anything is possible when your man
smells like old spice and not a lady.

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,393
I'm on a horse.

107
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,600
The ideal man is one that rides a horse.
Any movie that puts women on a horse

108
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:22,520
usually challenges this norm of men on
horseback in Brokeback Mountain Lorraine

109
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,100
First Sees Jack while she's riding a
horse and he's on foot already

110
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,830
establishing a reversal of gender roles
on the horse.

111
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:31,430
She physically towers over him.
This role reversal continues when she

112
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,000
approaches him at the bar to hit on him
and act traditionally done by the man

113
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,220
throughout the movie.
Their positions in the marriage get

114
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:39,470
challenged.
She's the one operating the company with

115
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:42,860
the traditional office desk.
While he fights for control in the home,

116
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,760
the initial power dynamic of her on
horseback establishes masculinity in the

117
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:48,350
movie.
She rides the show horse,

118
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:49,430
showing her power,
wealth,

119
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:51,500
and control ball jackets thrown off a
bowl,

120
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,650
showing his lack of control,
and to hint at his non traditional male

121
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:56,960
role.
Westworld shows just how much the hosts

122
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,390
breaking the rules by having Dolores
Adaas Aisle,

123
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:03,260
female character become a horse riding
gunslinger with horses so closely

124
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:05,810
associated with masculinity,
control and power.

125
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,990
It's no surprise that characters will
also kill other people's horses to

126
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,930
assert dominance.
This power grab gets done most famously

127
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:15,230
in the godfather and the public enemy.
If a horse shows control,

128
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:18,920
killing the horse removes the control.
There are also racial undertones to

129
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,890
horseback riding.
It was illegal for black people to buy a

130
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:24,170
horse in many parts of the antebellum
south.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,890
Such a loss seems unnecessary because
blind people did not have the money or

132
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:29,810
agency to own a horse in the first
place.

133
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,290
This redundancy implies that the law
existed as a symbolic gesture,

134
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,800
a reminder by white southerners that
black people should not have the status

135
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:39,080
and power associated with riding a
horse.

136
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,410
Django unchained touches on the racial
issues of horseback riding.

137
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,490
The simple act of being black into on a
horse challenges traditional portrayals

138
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:49,040
of men on horseback.
It's such a great movie because it lets

139
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:53,030
minority characters have the same cool
mastery and control that was originally

140
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:54,410
reserved for white men.

141
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,740
The movie perfectly showcases horseback
riding as a power dynamic.

142
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,590
Right in the first scene,
there's a power reversal where a horse

143
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,500
immobilizes a man,
the opposite of a man controlling the

144
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,150
horse.
Many times in the movie,

145
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:08,870
weaker characters are either thrown off
their horse or shot off their horse,

146
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,850
but never django.
When we watch the movie,

147
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,090
we never consciously observe who was
riding the horse well or not,

148
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:17,780
but these images play into subconscious
American ideas of mastery.

149
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:20,990
Through mastery of the horse,
we can feel how much more controlled

150
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:24,800
Django has compared to the other white
characters apart from Dr. King Shults,

151
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,460
who can command his horses that will add
fits.

152
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,960
We can feel how much more controlled
Django has compared to the other white

153
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:35,810
characters the KKK members can't see for
themselves,

154
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:39,290
so they let the horse take control.
I can't see you can't see.

155
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,800
So what all that matters is can the
fucking fate.

156
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,760
This KKK charge feels like a comedic
revision of a similar scene in the birth

157
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:51,470
of a nation filmed in 1915.
Dw Griffith portrays these KKK members

158
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,890
much differently than the easy to trick
idiots in Django Klansmen,

159
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,760
charged into town on a horseback to
rescue llc from the hands of black men

160
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,140
on screen by epic and skillful riding on
a horse transforms these klansmen from

161
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:08,030
an unruly mob into hero saving the day.
This movie uses horses to show the KKK

162
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:11,930
members as heroic end to end control,
and they disturbingly used their mastery

163
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:14,150
to attack and suppress black people in
the movie.

164
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,840
The cruelest irony in both the birth of
a nation and Django unchained is that

165
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:20,300
horses themselves are slaves.
They were tamed,

166
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:23,480
enforced to work historically for white
men in the cinematic sphere.

167
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:27,680
Controlling the horse shows if their
handler is a good master with Django as

168
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:30,650
a former slave.
His role as a horseback rider and master

169
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:33,590
is confusing since it's a slave
controlling a slave.

170
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,740
This unnatural relationship confuses
characters throughout the movie.

171
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,190
Django repeatedly does things a master
would do like whipping people and

172
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,410
manipulating people.
Do I sound like a fucking slave?

173
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,100
The horse symbolizes his new role as a
master of his domain,

174
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,980
but I want to go further.
I want to suggest that in some cases,

175
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:52,280
this symbolism of horse riding exists
past just the movies.

176
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,530
It bleeds into real life.
You know that it is special election day

177
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:55,980
and we do

178
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,650
expect to see a Senate candidate,
Roy Moore,

179
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,590
arriving by horseback to the polls.

180
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,150
Is it a coincidence that really more a
conservative Republican rode a horse to

181
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:07,100
the polls during his campaign in
Alabama?

182
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,500
I don't think so.
He rode that horse when he didn't have

183
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:11,030
to.
It was a symbolic gesture.

184
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,900
He was trying to evoke American
perceptions of the West ones of mastery

185
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:15,830
and control.
Now,

186
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:19,370
I'm not saying that riding a horse to
the polls is necessarily a bad thing,

187
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,990
lucy,
that men on horseback,

188
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,400
particularly when embodying old ideas of
the American cowboy evoke concepts of

189
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:28,820
domination and masculinity that are
inherently problematic in certain

190
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:29,654
contexts.

191
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,180
A state of emergency has been declared
in the US state of Virginia.

192
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,830
Jefferson were protesting the plan
removal of a confederate monument from a

193
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:39,970
city park.
Confederate.

194
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:43,780
Statues were taken down in New Orleans
after two years of court battles and a

195
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:45,630
heated public debate.
Protest.

196
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,820
Violence is extremely painful.
I was in tears yesterday to see that it

197
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,670
hurt.
It hurts.

198
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,320
I want American cars.

199
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,940
America has debated the removal of
confederate monuments around the country

200
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:04,820
for the last several years.
Opponents of the statues claimed that

201
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:06,560
these statues were not built as
memorials,

202
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:10,040
but rather to intimidate black people
and to reaffirm white supremacy.

203
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,400
One aspect of these statutes rarely
mentioned is the fact that these men are

204
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:16,340
very commonly on horseback.
It's one thing to have these people

205
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:18,590
standing,
but the fact that they are on horseback,

206
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:21,920
it gives them a certain mythological
authority like a John Wayne Western

207
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,320
hero,
a man on horseback symbolizes a man in

208
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:26,180
control,
a master of his domain,

209
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,900
a person of wealth and status physically
above the pedestrians around him,

210
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,050
but the mythologizing of these men
disguises a sinister history.

211
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,740
Though some Americans may look to these
statutes and be reminded of admire

212
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:39,590
herbal western heroes,
other Americans may look at them and see

213
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:43,100
a reminder of the men on horses who
fought to keep their ancestors in

214
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:43,670
chains.

215
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,280
After all,
the horse is itself a slave taken from

216
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:49,700
the wild and teams to work as a tool,
and the rider is his master,

217
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,570
whether you feel it consciously or not.
A confederate white man riding a horse

218
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,980
on a monument evokes slavery imagery and
a historical look at writing in American

219
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:01,490
cinema shows how the design of these
statutes makes them aggressive tools for

220
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:03,440
intimidation.
So what should we do about them?

221
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,080
Polls show America is torn on whether to
take them down,

222
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,140
but there's more to consider than simply
whether they should stay the same or

223
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:10,250
whether they should go away.

224
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,700
So there's a third option.
The third option is we engage our

225
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:17,270
contemporary artists of this time.
We have the mics sculptures that exist

226
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:21,170
in the communities that they live in.
We present those sculptures in the same

227
00:11:21,171 --> 00:11:24,920
community squares where these Robert e
Lee sculptures exists.

228
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,400
We pull those least sculptures down from
the pedestal,

229
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:32,060
bring them at the same level as these
new contemporary works and we forced

230
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,160
these works to engage one another.
Richmond,

231
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,800
Virginia has five confederate leaders on
Monument Avenue,

232
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,890
including Jefferson Davis,
Robert e Dot Lee and stonewall Jackson.

233
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,400
But one other monument company falls
under the radar when talking about these

234
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,720
iconic centerpieces,

235
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,220
tennis legend,
Arthur Ashe also has his own statue on

236
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:53,860
Monument Avenue,
despite a much more design than his

237
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,650
confederate counterparts.
Their proposal of his statue sparked a

238
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:59,470
racial debate at the time of its
erection in the 19 nineties.

239
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,360
This statue is a step in the right
direction,

240
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:04,990
challenging monument avenue as a place
reserved for white confederate leaders.

241
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,420
Even so,
I think Richmond has an opportunity in

242
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:10,600
the current political climate to add
other more challenging monuments.

243
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,540
Monument Avenue Falls.
The tradition of white men in art

244
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,380
aristocrats in the 18th century commonly
commissioned portraits of themselves on

245
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:19,570
horseback to signify their importance,
wealth,

246
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:20,220
and power.

247
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,960
It's designed for domination.
It's,

248
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,550
it's a language designed to make the
sitter feel as though he could ride this

249
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:31,050
steve and control it with a pinky
controlled with the sheer will of his

250
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,840
mind.
It's a propaganda act

251
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,550
in response to these traditional
portraits artists can handle.

252
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:39,910
Wiley has a piece titled Napoleon
leading the Army over the Alps,

253
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,180
Wiley's piece recontextualizes,
the famous Napoleon painting by

254
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,030
replacing him with a black man in
contemporary clothing.

255
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,720
Critiquing the historical tradition of
ignoring the black cultural experience.

256
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,590
It crystallized something that I had
been thinking about for a very long

257
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:56,050
time,
which is that black men have been giving

258
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,490
very little in this world and that I as
an artist,

259
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,930
have the power and the potential and the
will to do something about it

260
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,180
because it's not just that.
These confederate heroes invoke slavery

261
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:10,280
imagery.
There's another opportunity with the

262
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:13,580
debate over these statues,
the opportunity to make heroes out of

263
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:13,770
people

264
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,360
well,
that have historically been put to the

265
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,860
side and we go into the front entrance
of the museum and there's that amazing

266
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:23,130
sculpture of Teddy Roosevelt out there.
You guys know which one I'm talking

267
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:24,750
about.
Teddy Roosevelt,

268
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:29,670
this in there with one hand on the horse
fall strong sleeves rolled up.

269
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:31,810
I don't know if he's bare chested,
but it kinda feels like it.

270
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,000
And on the left hand side of him is a
native American walking and on the right

271
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,430
hand side of him it was an African
American Walker.

272
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,910
And as we're moving up the stairs,
getting closer to the sculpture,

273
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,820
my oldest son who's nine says,
dad,

274
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,380
how come he gets to ride and they have
to walk.

275
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,170
I think an artist can handle wiley or
titus Kaphar could create a great

276
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:04,890
addition to monument avenue with a
statue that rethinks who gets to ride on

277
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:07,260
horseback.
So I'm not saying you should feel bad

278
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:10,770
for liking classic cowboy movies.
Some of those movies are amongst the

279
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:12,990
greats,
but I am saying that the horse rider

280
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,440
relationship deserves a closer look
because it reveals subtleties in our

281
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:19,200
media and how we can make more powerful
and challenging art.

282
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,030
Okay.
I'm done preaching this stuff.

283
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,880
I'll get off my high horse,
but there is one thing I won't get off

284
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:25,710
my high horse about.
As some of you might know,

285
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,260
I'm actually a software developer.
When I'm not making videos,

286
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm writing code and logging in and out
of tons of applications and websites.

287
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,230
I keep all my passwords secure and out
of mind.

288
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:37,080
Using dashlane.
Dashlane is a secure and easy to use

289
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:40,770
password protection service with over 10
million users in the current tech

290
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:41,280
landscape.

291
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,850
It is definitely the best way to manage
the dozens of passwords you use on a

292
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,100
regular basis.
When you need to log into a site,

293
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:50,700
dashlane automatically adds your secure
password and it works on all phones and

294
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:52,340
computers,
