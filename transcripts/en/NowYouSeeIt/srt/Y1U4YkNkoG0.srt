00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,350
When many designers talk about stripes,
they tend to mention how much they stand

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:06,060
out.
The stripe is possibly the most

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:08,940
noticeable pattern,
the immediate and repetitive change from

4
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:11,280
one color to another,
calls attention to itself,

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,970
which explains why caution signs are
almost exclusively striped along with

6
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,450
other things you need to see like
lighthouses signaling flags and the old

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,540
fashioned barbershop pole,
and so it's no coincidence that the most

8
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,420
famous cartoon you're always trying to
look for has a striped shirt.

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,120
He doesn't blend in the designer of the
IBM logo,

10
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:29,310
set it right stripes,
attract attention.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,000
The visual power of the pattern possibly
comes from the inability to distinguish

12
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,920
a stripes foreground from its
background.

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,980
There's something visually confusing
about the layers of a stripe.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,730
Notice how every optical illusion or
hypnosis video uses stripes.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,060
There's even an evolutionary theory that
zebras wear stripes to confuse

16
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,890
predators,
have their number in distance.

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,500
It works so well.
Humans copied the technique for world

18
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:53,010
war two battleships and remember that
none of these traits apply as strongly

19
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,080
to other patterns.
Checkered feels more orderly.

20
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:58,710
Plat is less jarring and spots have a
clear foreground and background.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,500
Stripes are the most extreme,
stripes are different,

22
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,470
and these unique properties of stripes
have made them powerful symbols that

23
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:06,570
have eventually evolve into signs of
oppression,

24
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:07,590
deviance,
freedom,

25
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,870
and daring style.
No matter where stripes are,

26
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:12,540
they are never subtle.
My goal for this video is to talk about

27
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:16,860
the theories of design and symbolism of
the stripe in art history and design and

28
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,960
apply those ideas to the stripes and
movies.

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,170
The significance of stripes and cinema
is actually surprisingly under

30
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:24,240
researched,
but the meaning of stripes in art and

31
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,850
design should apply to movies as well,
if not more so.

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,661
Michael,
pastor,

33
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,430
row,
and author of a book on the history of

34
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,940
stripes did have one movie in mind when
discussing the power of stripes

35
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:35,280
historically spellbound by Alfred
Hitchcock,

36
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:37,920
stars,
a man with a phobia of lines against a

37
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:41,100
white background,
a man with an actual fear of stripes.

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,280
I doubt a movie could pull that off with
any other pattern and it just goes to

39
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:48,120
show how the contrast of stripes has
massive appeal to the eye of the

40
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,460
filmmaker.
If stripes can literally be somebody

41
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:52,830
phobia in a movie,
they must mean something,

42
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,990
but I'm getting ahead of myself.
Historically,

43
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:58,920
the natural properties of stripes gave
them symbolic meaning in western Europe

44
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,650
and their power at that time can't be
underestimated.

45
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,100
When a Stripe Orange Catholic religious
group came to Europe from the Crusader

46
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:07,860
states in the twelfth century,
they were ridiculed for how they were

47
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,830
addressed to the point that Pope
Alexander the fourth band,

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,100
all clergy men from wearing stripes in
the middle ages when the type of

49
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,790
clothing always indicated your social
status stripes pointed out the deviance

50
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:20,610
of society.
Anybody who wasn't an honest citizen in

51
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,680
art strike people are more often than
not,

52
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:24,240
the gestures,
prostitutes,

53
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,240
executioners,
or traders in a twelfth century painting

54
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,410
God gifts Adam and Eve a striped garment
before they are expelled from paradise.

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,630
In this case,
the stripes indicate they have committed

56
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:35,700
acts of shame and sin.
Similarly,

57
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:37,620
the striped bedding in this 14th
century,

58
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:40,380
French painting shows the immorality of
what they're doing.

59
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,160
In an era where what you wore with a
clear indication of your social status,

60
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,670
the flashiness of the strike meant you
were a social deviant and its meaning

61
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:50,730
was taken very seriously.
It was often even associated with

62
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:53,820
monsters and the devil.
This traditional perception of stripes

63
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:57,100
made its way into the movies.
Many deviant women in film have worn

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,380
stripes.
Maybe the most convincing example is how

65
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:02,770
the wicked witch of the East is
distinguished only by her boldly striped

66
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,810
black and white stockings.
That same year,

67
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,620
Dallas and stage coach has a similar
stripe moment and she's a prostitute in

68
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:09,454
the movie,

69
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,750
possibly originating in the penal
colonies of America.

70
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,390
Prisoners also war stripes as a uniform.
Again,

71
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:23,300
it's a classic sign of the deviant and
movies are no different,

72
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:27,050
and while the stripe as a badge of shame
continued later centuries introduced

73
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:30,770
different interpretations of the pattern
starting in the 16th century strikes

74
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:33,470
shifted from being strictly diabolic
into Tamer.

75
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:36,950
Eventually positive meanings.
It became a uniform for servants and

76
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:40,070
found its way on textiles integrating
its way into the home.

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,240
Most importantly,
however,

78
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:44,300
is the American revolution.
Introducing the stripe to flag as a

79
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:46,880
symbol of rebellion.
They took a pattern used for the

80
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:49,700
prisoners of the American south and made
it their battle cry,

81
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,340
showing how they felt like prisoners
under British rule.

82
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,200
The French followed suit and from then
on,

83
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,830
those in favor of the movement of
freedom could wear stripes to show their

84
00:03:57,831 --> 00:03:59,750
support.
Really the stripes meaning hadn't

85
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,130
explicitly changed.

86
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,700
It's still a sign of an outsider or a
deviant as the revolutionaries.

87
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:07,400
Clearly we're,
but it's no longer exclusively negative

88
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,160
movies showed these multiple
interpretations of the strike.

89
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,100
In some cases,
the pattern is a sign of the delinquent

90
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,320
in others.
They are worn on purpose to signal

91
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,440
somebody unique.
The dual meaning of stripes even shows

92
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:21,770
itself in nature.
A Study of stripes in 2015 mentioned how

93
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:26,060
many animals use them as a warning to
signal an unpleasant consequence of an

94
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:29,930
attack while others use stripes to
attract attention from a potential mate,

95
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,220
so stripes can be equally good or bad.
American cinema in the 19 fifties showed

96
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:37,460
the rebellious meaning of the stripe
coming to the big screen with many high

97
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:41,300
profile actors wearing the Breton Stripe
in movies directed a teens and young

98
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:44,480
adults all warned by characters who
don't follow the status quo.

99
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,210
This movement also spread to artists,
philosophers,

100
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:50,120
and the Ramones,
so what stripes also being worn as a

101
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:53,060
point of pride,
we see people using stripes to stand out

102
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:53,840
on purpose.

103
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,620
A classic example is the gangster
gangster is actually wore pinstripes in

104
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:59,780
real life,
and that style made its way into the

105
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:02,270
movies.
Gangsters outfits commonly have stripes

106
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:05,630
to look flashy as they flaunt their
wealth and status to the point that some

107
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:09,320
of them look tasteless for the most
crooked over the top male characters.

108
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:12,800
Notice how crazy the stripes become.
The kind of stripe also matters.

109
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,320
Long fixed stripes seem to go to the
flashy characters,

110
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:16,160
but thin,
sleek,

111
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:18,650
stripes look more fashionable.
You could make the argument that

112
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,010
filmmakers use bold stripes on
businessmen to make them seem more

113
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:24,440
crooked,
but stripes can also look very chic.

114
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,420
Old Structure Calls for solid colored or
discretely pattern suits and ties.

115
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,330
The more pronounced the stripe,
the crazier filmmaking has certainly

116
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:35,000
taken advantage of the disorienting
nature of the stripe.

117
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,510
It's no coincidence that a striped cat
is an illusionist and the introduction

118
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:42,650
to cycle works because the imbalance of
the stripes looks off like the slicing

119
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:43,370
of a knife.

120
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,950
There's also a complicated relationship
between stripes,

121
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:47,810
children and hygiene.
Michelle,

122
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,480
pastor rose,
study of stripes mentions how underwear

123
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:53,960
into under garments were completely
white because the people of the Middle

124
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,950
Ages saw dice and coloring as a form of
contamination while was pure and

125
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,000
healthy.
As a result,

126
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,210
no color ever directly touch the body in
the 20th century.

127
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,250
However,
the strength became a way to add style

128
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:06,860
to pajamas,
towels and underwear while keeping some

129
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,960
whiteness in the clothing.
So when the current day,

130
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:12,110
Prince George always wearing stripes
because it has become a symbol of

131
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:13,970
hygiene,
but there's also a little bit of the

132
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,270
original meaning of stripes and that
children are playfully deviant,

133
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,640
not quite fitting in with society
completely.

134
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,270
And so some filmmakers do stripes to
evoke a childishness to characters which

135
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,190
is in its own way,
a form of deviance.

136
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,830
Ever since the gestures and jugglers in
the medieval ages,

137
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:31,100
mankind has had an understanding that
stripes can also look childish,

138
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:32,060
silly and funny.

139
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,980
Now,
I'm not saying that all the stripes done

140
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:36,410
in movies were done with knowledge of
the stripes history.

141
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,440
It's actually the opposite.
Nobody had even considered the meaning

142
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,840
or history of stripes until the last
decade or so.

143
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,500
What I'm trying to say is the design of
the stripe naturally causes it to stand

144
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:49,250
out and so it makes sense that in movies
where wardrobe is meticulously chosen,

145
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,180
filmmakers subconsciously or consciously
used to that extreme change from one

146
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:55,910
color to the next to tell us something
about the character.

147
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,820
Maybe they're downright evil or they're
a rebellious teen.

148
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,800
Either way,
the stripes helps show they are a

149
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:04,880
deviant from the status quo in some way,
and movies understand this dual meaning.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,400
Think about the title of the boy in the
striped pajamas.

151
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,950
In one sense,
striped pajamas are a sign of fashion,

152
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,130
comfort and the playful child,
but the audience knows the real reason.

153
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,060
His clothes were striped.
The movie's title plays on our cultures,

154
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,750
multiple interpretations of the Stripe.
Juno is perhaps the most complicated and

155
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:23,180
effective the use of stripes I've seen
in the movies.

156
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,250
It's the pattern,
Juno,

157
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,950
whereas most often and it became her
symbol in the trailers and poster art.

158
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,530
It fits her character perfectly.
She's playful,

159
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,060
childish,
and stands out with her,

160
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:35,420
sharp over the top dialogue,
but she's also a deviant as a pregnant

161
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,080
teenager.
She self identifies as rebellious and it

162
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,550
has unconventional taste in music and
style.

163
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,820
She commands attention,
both good and bad and the stripes are

164
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:47,300
the perfect companion to her character,
but no matter what they're used for,

165
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,630
stripes always stands out.
They may Joseph's coat standout in the

166
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:53,090
Bible and they compliment Juno's
uncontained,

167
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,210
which we're just starting to see more
research into the symbolism of the

168
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:58,460
stripe and I invite you to look into it
yourself.

169
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,390
I recently noticed the evil Gremlin is
need stripe and it totally fits with the

170
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,800
original Association of stripes with
monsters and how he's a deviant,

171
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,520
as the Gremlin.
That's the most evil.

172
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,250
I'm sure there are tons of other
examples of stripes and movies out

173
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:11,420
there.
I haven't come across.

174
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,630
Check out.
Now you see it.blog/stripes to see all

175
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:17,060
the examples of stripes I have compiled
so far.

176
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,820
If you think of any stripes in movies or
come across any in the future,

177
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:21,980
there's another link where you can
submit the name of the film,

178
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,890
who wears the stripes and what the
possible meaning might be in the

179
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:27,110
description.
I'll continue adding screenshots to make

180
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:30,740
the first compiled collection of stripes
in film available on the Internet.

181
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,550
Graphic designers have understood the
power of stripes for a long time even

182
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:38,030
before there was any research on them.
The Ibm logo is a famous example,

183
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:39,890
but you can also look at Adidas,
apple,

184
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:44,120
and a t and t to see how companies use
stripes to convey speed and going

185
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,380
against the status quo.

186
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,980
Professional logo designers are some of
the few people who do understand the

187
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:51,890
meaning of the stripe.
One of the premier logo designers in the

188
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:55,230
business currently is Aaron Draplin,
a designer for Nike Ford,

189
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,230
and even the Obama administration.
