1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,220
What's your favorite movie memory?
What I mean is what's your fondest

2
00:00:03,221 --> 00:00:06,010
memory while watching a movie?
The question came to me this morning

3
00:00:06,011 --> 00:00:09,140
when I was watching the episode of Louis
Ck is horace and Pete,

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,720
it's a TV show that he produced on his
website and it's great.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,870
There's this interesting segment where
an old man enters their bar.

6
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,220
I'm going to let the whole scene play
out.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,990
I really encourage you to get the first
episode.

8
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:18,824
If you enjoy this.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,020
My mother would send me here for a Pail
of beer for my dad.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,690
We used to sell beer pills out the bank.

11
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,480
Yeah.
And I,

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,450
I,
I came here to get my first beer and I

13
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:34,600
met my wife here.
She was sitting

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,130
in that stool.
Yeah.

15
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,680
And we were.
We were married for

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,510
years and
I was happy and then I heard that she

17
00:00:55,811 --> 00:01:00,811
was sleeping with my best friend and so
I showed up here one night and she was

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,540
sitting in that stool again with my best
friend kissing her and I just shot them

19
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:17,190
both dead.
Yeah,

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,250
that was back in 1961.
I just got to go to jail today.

21
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,740
That guy really there
you want a beer?

22
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,960
So here's my question.
Was that segment tragic or funny?

23
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,420
I think the first instinct is to find it
morbid.

24
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,110
Certainly a man murdering his wife and
spending his life in prison is tragic,

25
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,390
but the way it's presented is also
comedic.

26
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,840
It's a rollercoaster of events.
I was choking on my morning Bagel from

27
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:07,750
laughter at how his story got absurdly
worse and worse.

28
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,690
I'm a big believer that the funniest
moments are the ones that are also the

29
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:12,910
saddest.
I watched daddy's home the other day and

30
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,650
it's fine.
It had some good labs,

31
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:17,560
but with comedies like daddy's home,
there's always something missing and

32
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:20,680
that brings me to my point.
The funniest movies are also the saddest

33
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:23,410
movies.
It's the tragicomedy hear me out on this

34
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:24,940
one.
I'd venture to say that the vast

35
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:28,510
majority of comedy these days contains
characters who served no other purpose

36
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:29,560
but to make us laugh.

37
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,500
Stuff like bridesmaids and spaceballs
and they're great.

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,170
Those are classics and I think Mel
Brooks is a genius,

39
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,870
but there's something inherently shallow
about the comedy.

40
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,540
All we got was laughter,
but with this moment from horace and

41
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,730
Pete,
there's such a huge spectrum of emotion.

42
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,610
It goes from a laugh,
the fact that he met his wife there and

43
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:47,890
caught her cheating there to a very sad
moment,

44
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,250
a homicide to a final resolution.
Pete offering him a drink.

45
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,220
That rollercoaster is just well better.
It means more that way.

46
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,820
It really lingers with me afterwards
when I experience multiple emotions in

47
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:00,010
one moment,
not just laughter and it's different

48
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,350
from dark comedy.
Dark comedy is when you make comedy out

49
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,970
of something that's supposed to be
taboo,

50
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,540
but tragic comedy is when you let the
sad moments be genuinely sad,

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,480
and the funny moments as a result are
more genuinely funny.

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,510
This scene brought me back to my
favorite memory of watching a movie.

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,460
I was watching little Miss Sunshine with
my mom,

54
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,560
Dad and sister,
and this scene came up.

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,100
Slight spoilers ahead in this scene,
dwayne finds out he can't fulfill his

56
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:21,860
dream of becoming a

57
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,130
pilot.
You cannot fly jets

58
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,630
rewatching it.
It's certainly a tragic scene,

59
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,970
right?
But here we see another essential moment

60
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:34,400
of tragic comedy.
The funniest moments are also the

61
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:36,320
saddest moments.
As soon as he found out he was

62
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:38,000
colorblind,
I started getting emotional,

63
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,590
but then frank has his perfect.
Thanks.

64
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,640
Okay.
Got An emergency

65
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,890
and at this point my mom busts out
laughing and all of a sudden I do too.

66
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,920
Uncontrollable laughter and my sister
and dad think we're crazy.

67
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,690
So is the scene funny?
Well,

68
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,890
no,
it's tragic,

69
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,690
but at the same time,
yes it is fight.

70
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,580
The lows are low,
but the highs are high.

71
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,720
Steve Carell is a master of comedy
because he earns his last by also having

72
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:04,554
his sad side

73
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,630
and that's when I decided to check out
early.

74
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,370
Yes,
yes,

75
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,830
and I failed at that as well.

76
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,910
He has that perfect balance throughout
the movie.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,210
I've noticed his best movies put him as
a pathetic character while the movies

78
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,930
where he's always goofy,
don't have that spark any ads.

79
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,480
His talent to my favorite movie memory,
every character choice makes this seem

80
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,910
perfect.
The Way Dwayne maniacally punches the

81
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:30,370
side of the car,
the car horn honking randomly.

82
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,570
The fact that Richard Texas watching
argues that they don't have time to pull

83
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:35,380
over Dwayne's reaction is priceless.

84
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,610
It's going to be good

85
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,500
at this point.
I'm in tears,

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,170
sad tears,
but I'm also laughing hysterically.

87
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,360
The climax of the scene is pretty much
perfect.

88
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,640
My Dad and sister were looking at my mom
and me dumbfounded.

89
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,590
How could we be so cruel and
insensitive?

90
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,000
Can't they see?
This is tragic.

91
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,260
No,
it's not tragic.

92
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,260
It's better than tragic.
It's tragic comedy because last time I

93
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:05,940
checked,
life is tragic and funny,

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,600
but 99 percent of movies are either one
or the other and the ones that you both

95
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,390
are the diamonds in the rough.
Once you noticed this type of movement,

96
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:14,430
you can't help but appreciate it that
much more.

97
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,180
So that became my favorite movie memory,
laughing and crying at the same time

98
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:20,670
with my mom.
What a treat those movies that genuinely

99
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,100
capture the human experience.
Sometimes it's tragic.

100
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,990
Sometimes it's comedy,
right?

101
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,670
Thanks.
