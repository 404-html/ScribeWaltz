1
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome to now you see it,

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,670
it affect his moment in a scary movie,
requires extremely precise editing and

3
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:26,510
camera direction to actually be scared.
I found a cool case study to outline

4
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:29,900
this idea in a movie currently out in
theaters called lights out the movies

5
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,850
based off of a short film with the same
name,

6
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:35,450
general concept and director.
What's interesting is that the movie and

7
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,910
the short film have a moment that's
basically the same,

8
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:40,100
but I think one is much scarier than the
other,

9
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,380
but what do you think?
Let's look at those scary moments and

10
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:44,540
see which one has done better.
Let's start with the movie

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,440
now.
The short film,

12
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,550
so which one's scarier?
My guess is you picked the short film,

13
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,530
but why?
Let's take a look at how the short film

14
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,170
perfectly uses many horror techniques
while the movie,

15
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:42,740
despite being so similar,
doesn't.

16
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,400
I think the most important difference is
the length of the clip.

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,280
The movie clip is actually from the
trailer because the movie still in

18
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,290
theaters,
the trailer cut makes the movie clip

19
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:53,440
about four seconds shorter.
In those four seconds to short film has

20
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:56,590
an extra flicker.
The lights with each added second is a

21
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:58,810
lot more suspense added to the scary
moment,

22
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:01,270
so when the pattern suddenly changes and
the ghost moves,

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,970
it's that much more startling.
Let's say you want to scare the audience

24
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:05,620
with a clown attack.
How do you do it?

25
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,120
Do you let the clowns sit motionless for
30 long seconds while we have no choice

26
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:15,121
but to uncomfortably stare at it
and then all of a sudden it's gone?

27
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,270
Or do you show the clown for a few
seconds at a time and throw in a couple

28
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,630
of random jump scares with no buildup or
continuity?

29
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,430
It's making the choice between one
really big scare or a bunch of little

30
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:54,010
okay scares,
which moment builds up the payoff

31
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,230
better.
Another difference in the two moments is

32
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:58,960
that the short film has a very powerful
shot right here.

33
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,050
It's from the creature's point of view
as it looks towards the woman like a

34
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,110
Predator stocking its prey.
This shot makes the woman look small and

35
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:07,150
powerless.
This is a shop we're all familiar with

36
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,810
in horror movies and that suspense by
showing a character being watched by the

37
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,640
monster.
The problem with the movie clip is it

38
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:15,580
just switches from her reaction to a
shot of the monster and it's not as

39
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:17,560
menacing as the point of view shot.
Finally,

40
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,600
where are they in the movie?
A warehouse.

41
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,390
It's never fully addressed in the movie
and it makes them limit less scary

42
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,340
because we're unfamiliar with the
location.

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,390
A big component of many horror films is
that these monsters or serial killers or

44
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,690
supernatural beings invade places where
we thought we were safe.

45
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,980
That's what makes it scary.

46
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,340
The call is coming from inside though

47
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,510
lesion is a real life fear,
and when we're in our pajamas heading to

48
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:46,980
bed,
that's when we're at our most

49
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,230
vulnerable.
The short film really capitalizes on

50
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:51,900
this idea and it's genuinely scary in
the movie.

51
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:55,770
We see an unfamiliar monster in a place
where already unfamiliar with so it's

52
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:58,140
not as scary.
Those are the three main differences I

53
00:03:58,141 --> 00:03:59,580
think,
but you could go even deeper.

54
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,870
For one thing,
in the short film,

55
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:04,260
The lady is always bright in the shot,
so it seems more menacing when we can

56
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:07,050
see her clearly while also seeing the
ghost in the movie.

57
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:09,510
When the ghost is visible,
the lady can't really be seen,

58
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:12,210
so she seems more removed from the
monster and the threat.

59
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,030
I also think the ambient hum in the
background makes this short film

60
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:15,870
scarier.
Also,

61
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:18,630
the fact that in the short film,
The lady has to walk through the hallway

62
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:20,160
where the ghost already is.

63
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,370
That seems scarier than having the lady
already had the light switch,

64
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,680
but what do you think?
Are there any other aspects that make

65
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:28,140
the short film scarier?
Am I overthinking something?

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,720
Leave your comments below.
Getting a laugh requires a funny

67
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:33,840
performance or a well timed cut.
Getting people to cry,

68
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,600
maybe take strong characters and a
gorgeous film score.

69
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,480
Getting an amazing shot requires
compelling cinematography,

70
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,570
but to get a scare,
you need everything at once.

71
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,100
The music,
the timing,

72
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:45,270
the script,
the actors,

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,090
everything has to work together or else
it's not scary.

74
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,570
So before you go to sleep tonight,
ask yourself what scares me the most.

75
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,610
Thanks for what?

76
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,610
Sure.
Slightly

77
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:20,030
just a bit of a break from the break,
the monotony of all that.
