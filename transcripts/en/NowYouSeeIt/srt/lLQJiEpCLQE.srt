1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,910
Alright,
think hard.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,930
What is
circle

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,080
close spot,

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,240
definitely wrong.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,170
Let's see,
I showed you two shapes,

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,840
sheep,
one in shape too,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,530
and then I asked you would you be shapes
matches the word Boba and which matches

8
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:27,000
the word Kiki for 98 percent of people
shape one is Kiki and shaped to his Boba

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,770
and it doesn't matter if you're from
America,

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,690
India,
or your two and a half years old.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,140
This result is extremely consistent
across all cultures and languages,

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,720
and so what does it mean?
I want to suggest that with this study

13
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:40,230
we can see how the brain gives abstract
meaning too many different shapes in a

14
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:42,840
consistent way,
and filmmakers use this phenomenon to

15
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:45,210
tell their story.
The best place to see this idea has to

16
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,630
be animation were animators can make
objects and characters from any shape

17
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,190
they want.
Let's start with the basics.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,660
Circle,
square and triangle.

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,090
This may seem reductive,
but these shapes say a lot more than you

20
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:56,220
may think.
Evil characters are drawn like Kiki.

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,900
They have sharper features pointing
noses,

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,870
ears in long curly fingers,
and the lovable characters are designed

23
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:04,050
like Boba soft and round.
Is it a coincidence that the fluffiest

24
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,600
and least threatening character in
animation is named balloon?

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,340
To me,
this whole concept makes intuitive

26
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:10,410
sense.
Our brains are designed to c sharp and

27
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,550
pointy things is more threatening.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,900
It just stood around on the top.
It needs to be pointed around.

29
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,180
It's not scary scary.

30
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,600
Notice how I can draw the nicest and
most recognizable character in animation

31
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:23,810
with three circles and notice how the
devil is commonly represented as a

32
00:01:23,811 --> 00:01:26,480
collection of triangles,
but do it a little more subtly and

33
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,690
you're able to emit an emotional
response to the viewer without them even

34
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:31,550
noticing.
It happens during one of my favorite

35
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:35,150
movie moments of all time when we see
the wicked villain transformed from Kiki

36
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:36,890
into around vulnerable Boba.

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,750
You may think this only applies to
animation,

38
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:51,130
but is it a coincidence that darth
vader's mask has this shape and Lord

39
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,540
dark helmet?
The cartoonish and comedic parody of

40
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,150
Darth vader has this shape.
One of the sharpest villains is

41
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:58,070
maleficent,
and they even tried to keep her pointy

42
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:00,350
jaw line and eyebrows in the live action
remake.

43
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,870
Following these same principles,
what does it mean when you call somebody

44
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:04,490
a square?
It means they're boring.

45
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,400
Maybe they're old fashioned,
but a square can also symbolize

46
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,560
something that is sturdy and from sound
familiar.

47
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,280
Squares are rigid and slow to change if
the world is and how they want it to be.

48
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,310
Maybe they get a little angry.
If you really want to think abstractly,

49
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,100
the world of film exists inside a
rectangular shape.

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,410
A lot of important geometry comes from
framing.

51
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,860
The most significant framing to look for
is probably the frame within the frame.

52
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,650
This is used to show a character trapped
in their current situation.

53
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,250
Another less common,
but equally important frame with it.

54
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:43,060
The frame is the circle which gives the
geometric impression of surveillance and

55
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:48,061
spying
to go a step deeper than the frame

56
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:54,610
within the frame.
You can use lines to create a visual

57
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:57,610
jail cell in the frame,
whether it's through blinds in an office

58
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,610
or even a computer screen.
A collection of vertical and horizontal

59
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:04,210
lines can indicate a character is not
only trapped but held prisoner in their

60
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,230
current lifestyle.

61
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,670
These shots used geometry as a means of
visual storytelling as far back as I can

62
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:14,800
remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster and how

63
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,200
does even noticing it?
Framing is filled with lines.

64
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,540
Geometry is everywhere,
and the same principles apply.

65
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,200
Triangles can emphasize power dynamics.
Linear framing can show physical

66
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,180
separation.
We're straight lines can guide our

67
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,830
eyesight,
so the next time you rewatch your

68
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,170
favorite movie,
try analyzing the geometry of the

69
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,880
framing and characters.
If you do that,

70
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,870
then you're in good shape.

71
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,503
What's this one

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,280
couple of wavy lines.
Sorry.

73
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,940
This isn't your lucky day.
Thanks for watching.

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,830
Slightly.
Just a bit of a break from just a little

75
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:52,970
slot in the break.
The monotony of all that hardcore.

76
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,770
I want to think good blood for giving me
this idea in the first place with his

77
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:58,530
amazing crash bandicoot video.
I highly recommend it.
