1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,670
I'm fascinated with chess and movies and
not just because I played chess in

2
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:09,280
middle school and competitively in high
school and college.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,280
Chess is so interesting because of how
much meaning it can have in film,

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,110
whether it's through analogy,
metaphor,

5
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:17,080
or even a plot device.
Filmmakers love using the game to add to

6
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:19,210
their stories in a way no other game
can.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,510
So let's play teach y'all.
If y'all want to lie,

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,780
man.
Nah,

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,350
come on right in the middle of the most
basic use of tests for an analogy,

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,300
it's usually to associate something with
patients or precision,

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,920
you know,
picked my punches to take him down.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,800
Pendants state sets up the main
character as a tress player and he

13
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:39,240
references the game throughout film.
Firstly,

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,080
strategical position to pieces and when
the timing's right,

15
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:45,230
you strategy,
the next step is to use chest to show

16
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:46,190
somebody as smart.

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,520
And this is where filmmakers get clever
in 2001 a space Odyssey House

18
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:52,880
intelligence is established in his
ability to be humans in chess.

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,300
The importance of this scene is somewhat
lost on modern movie goers because

20
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:59,540
computers have been beating the best
chess players for the last 20 years,

21
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:03,680
but in 1968 it showed that how was not
only intelligent but very powerful.

22
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,740
If you look at the scene more closely,
it also foreshadows and important plot

23
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:08,870
point.
When this super computer tells the human

24
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:11,430
the better choice.
I'm sorry frank,

25
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:14,700
I think you missed it.
Waned to bishop.

26
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,260
Bishop takes.
Queen takes bishop night,

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,780
chest.
We see the computer disagreeing with the

28
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,320
human and making a better move for him,
showing very subtly that the computer

29
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:28,590
can conflict with and outsmart.
Hit this for shout as the plot quite

30
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:32,430
nicely and sorry Dave,
I'm afraid I can't do that.

31
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,040
How actually makes a mistake while
talking about the game,

32
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,760
his suggestion queen to Bishop three is
impossible in this position,

33
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,060
so how does have the force checkmate,
but he's declaring it incorrectly.

34
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,180
Now you could say this was either a
mistake on Kubrick's part or more.

35
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,910
Interestingly,
Kubrick is very subtly foreshadowing

36
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:50,820
house eventual breakdown.
The Duel Between Hal and frank.

37
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:54,330
Poole brings me to my third point.
Chess books nicely to represent a battle

38
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,270
between two people.
This can be as discreet or symbolic as

39
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:58,470
you like.
In Sherlock Holmes,

40
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:01,830
the montage of the chess game with an
actual conflict makes the idea of pretty

41
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,420
obvious.
It's a battle of wits,

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,670
but the events of the game almost always
stands for something more.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,210
Chess is a very versatile game.
Pixar made short with the entire plot

44
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,250
revolving around a chest battle.
For example,

45
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,920
it's popular to use chest to show a
person sacrifice.

46
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,380
Maybe the most literal instance of this
is Harry Potter.

47
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,600
Sherlock goes for a queen sacrifice in
his game directly.

48
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,730
Mirroring Sherlock's plan to stop
moriarty

49
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,660
are winning.
Strategy sometimes sacrifice

50
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,040
to go one step further.
You can even let the chest pieces

51
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,830
themselves serve as metaphors for what's
happening in the movie.

52
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,860
Mag.
Needle fights with the powerful rook and

53
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,570
night pieces,
but professor x winds by sacrificing his

54
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,790
powerful pieces and using his bonds to
checkmate.

55
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,890
These moves reflect each player's
worldview.

56
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,110
Magneto.
Strong pieces represent him fighting

57
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:47,680
with mutans against the humans.
While professor x fights with the ponds

58
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,380
showing his desire to work with and
trust the humans.

59
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,750
This metaphor serves the movie nicely
because in chess,

60
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,390
upon can actually mutate into a night or
rook,

61
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,020
and this metaphor is further supported
when humans are referred to as ponds.

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,303
The exponent

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,360
interest,
the poem scuffs.

64
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,690
I think chess metaphors are most
powerful when they add to the story in

65
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:11,810
the people versus Oj Simpson.
Shapiro and Johnny Carson both have

66
00:03:11,811 --> 00:03:15,170
chest sets in their offices during the
episode where they decide to make their

67
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:17,870
defense arguments center around race in
one shot.

68
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,490
The chess set is right in the
foreground.

69
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,060
Here we see an obvious choice to have
this chest set as the focal point in the

70
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:24,830
shot,
and I think it may mean something.

71
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,990
Of course I hesitate to read too far
into this,

72
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:30,230
but it's worth noting that chess is a
battle between black and white pieces

73
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,230
and in the context of this scene about
black versus white people.

74
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,710
That makes for a powerful visual and
adds to the idea that this trial was a

75
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:39,950
battle centering on race.
Maybe the perfect summation of all these

76
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:42,440
techniques comes from this chest scene
in the TV show.

77
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:45,590
The wire d essentially uses chest to
explain the drug trade,

78
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,700
the Brookside,
the stash.

79
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:48,980
The queen is the muscle and the king is
top dog.

80
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,550
He even goes so far as to naming the
pieces after actual people in their

81
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,230
gang.
What he ain't got no hustle,

82
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,690
but the rest of these motherfuckers on
the chain,

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,210
they got his back when they run so deep,

84
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,790
he really ain't gotta do shit.
But like your uncle?

85
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,470
Yeah,
like mom.

86
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,060
The Pantera

87
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,600
described as the soldiers and in reality
these kids are the soldiers in their

88
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:10,180
gang and so they naturally identify with
the ponds.

89
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,970
What's interesting is what Wallace.
His question is after he learns about

90
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:13,804
the pond,

91
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,300
they liked the front lines.
They'd be out in the field.

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,630
So how do you get to be the king and he
liked that.

93
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,220
See the Qing state of King.
Alright.

94
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,060
Anything stay who he is

95
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,610
as the ponds.
They always have to serve the king no

96
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,770
matter what.
Even if they get to the other side of

97
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:30,604
the board,

98
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,380
catch the other dudes king and trap it,
then you would all right,

99
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,090
but it will make it to the end.
I'm top dog now,

100
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:40,924
Yo,
it ain't like that

101
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,650
trust.
We learn about the drug trade and how

102
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:45,350
its hierarchy is that strict as the
rules of a board game.

103
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,450
No matter what.
These characters are trapped in their

104
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:50,510
roles with no way to escape.
They get sacrificed for the king and no

105
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:53,300
matter how they play,
they never get to be in charge ponds.

106
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:54,010
Man

107
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,840
in the game,
they get cab quick,

108
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,080
maybe out of the game early,
less they some smart ass poems

109
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,480
and movies that use to most games is one
dimensional.

110
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,940
Bingo is there to establish.
You're in a retirement home.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,360
If you're playing dungeons and dragons,
the characters are stereotyped as nerdy,

112
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,820
but with chest there's almost always
more to analyze,

113
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,050
so get out there and make a move.

114
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,200
That's his majesty.
King is playing chess.

115
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,720
Chess.
Hey,

116
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,070
thanks for
slightly just a bit of a break from the

117
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:32,260
norm.
Just to break the monotony of all that

118
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,450
hard.
