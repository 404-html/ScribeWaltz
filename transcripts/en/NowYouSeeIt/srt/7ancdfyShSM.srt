00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,290
The Huffington Post published an article
in Twenty 15 titled No white people will

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:07,920
never understand the black experience,
the writer reasons that a white person,

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:11,580
no matter how blind to color,
can only understand so much if something

4
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,830
they cannot viscerally experience to
her.

5
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:17,610
Though white people must still educate
themselves on schematic racism to help

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,330
actively fight against something they
cannot truly understand in the movie

7
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,000
menace to society.
The Hughes brothers are on this exact

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,710
mission,
educating white people.

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,100
We've made that movie for white people.
We made the film to inform them of

10
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:30,960
something they didn't know.
In this video,

11
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:34,380
I want to explore how movies teach
prejudice using various engaging

12
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:37,500
cinematic techniques,
menace to society attempts to do what

13
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:41,340
the Huffington Post says is impossible.
The movie tries to give an outsider a

14
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,610
window into what it's like to grow up in
a poor black neighborhood,

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,280
and in doing so,
they teach outsiders to empathize with

16
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,660
people in that situation.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,810
The movie accomplishes this from the
start in the first two moments,

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,150
the writing scene and the convenience
store robbery.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,810
The writing footage purposefully gives a
distorted perspective of poor black

20
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:00,570
people from the opening shot.
The camera looks at the carnage of the

21
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:04,500
watts riots safely from a helicopter
like someone would see live news footage

22
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:06,720
on TV.
The camera is physically above the

23
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,790
violence and looking down on the people
riding.

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,520
Once we get to ride footage on the
ground to the filming is from the

25
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:14,430
perspective of the riot police.
Never the black people,

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,610
the white news commentator in the
background puts obvious emphasis on the

27
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:22,611
cops instead of the rioters
even the pixelation effect makes all the

28
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:28,770
black people look the same,
removing their face from the story.

29
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,380
This allows the viewer to easily
generalize them as a group,

30
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:33,900
not as individuals.
The Hughes brothers are cleverly

31
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:37,260
capturing the black experience in a
stereotypical way and in a way many

32
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:40,560
white people experienced black
communities from a distance and mostly

33
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,520
with stereotypes.

34
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,730
They further reinforced white
stereotypes of black people by showing

35
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:47,820
the main characters later,
robbing a convenience store at another

36
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:51,180
stereotypical black behavior.
They established this white bias so they

37
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,310
can spend the rest of the movie,
deconstructing it.

38
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,070
After the riot footage,
we go from a white commentator to a

39
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:59,310
black narrator and we no longer see the
black people from a distance.

40
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:02,100
We enter their homes and live within
their personal stories.

41
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,220
That was the first time I'd ever seen my
phone killing anybody,

42
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,330
but it wasn't the left I got used to it.
The to compliment this intimacy,

43
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:14,670
the violence in the film becomes much
grittier than the far removed violence

44
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,220
be normally see in news footage from a
helicopter.

45
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,440
The cinematography becomes clear,
colorful,

46
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,810
and up close.
This change was done intentionally by

47
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:25,170
the Hughes brothers to show that
violence is not like what we see on TV.

48
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,020
If it pops off,
make it pop off quick and make the

49
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:31,530
aftermath ugly.
Not like Rambo where guys just go down

50
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:32,880
and that's it.
Growing up,

51
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,580
most violence just looked goofy and
unorthodox.

52
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:37,590
People had twigs in their eyeballs and
shit.

53
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,140
It wasn't pretty by first using various
techniques,

54
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,500
establishing the black community as
faceless violent riders.

55
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,770
The rapid cinematic change of the black
community into up close,

56
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,690
relatable,
and vulnerable characters,

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,620
deconstructs the racial stereotypes.
Start with the poor black population as

58
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:55,900
an outsider sees them,
then bring the outsider in and challenge

59
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:59,320
their initial perspective with a
personal story of loss and excessive

60
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:02,000
violence.
Capture the racism and then deconstruct

61
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:03,580
it.
Getting white people on the inside of

62
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:06,790
poor black neighborhoods is a great
strategy to helping them understand the

63
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,520
cycle of poverty.
I remember when pitching the movie to

64
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,480
new line,
they go,

65
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,250
well,
what is different between this and when

66
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,280
we see the black guy on the news every
morning running from the helicopter,

67
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,031
I go,
well,

68
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,640
you're in the helicopter and you don't
know why that kid is running.

69
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,140
Actually,
films have used bias,

70
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,920
cinematic techniques to highlight sexism
as well as racism.

71
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,350
This has done more subtly but just as
powerfully in the silence of the lambs.

72
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,780
The main character arc in the movie is
clarice starling,

73
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,030
overcoming the mental trauma of her
childhood,

74
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,300
but there's also the backdrop of her
struggling to distinguish herself and in

75
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,050
almost all male professional men
sexualized clarice throughout the movie.

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,260
Whether it's subtly checking her out or
outright asking her on a date,

77
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,800
we see her isolation most powerfully and
subjective point of view shots

78
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,470
throughout the movie where we see
through the eyes of clarice all the

79
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,270
towering male figures looking down on
her.

80
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,240
These cinematic choices put us in the
perspective of the victim.

81
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,700
Even the final scene has immense staring
her down with her,

82
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,310
unable to see him echoing the men in her
career,

83
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:59,200
always watching her and looking down on
her.

84
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,770
The underlying idea here is that even
subjective experiences like growing up

85
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:06,220
in a poor black neighborhood or being a
woman in a male dominated profession

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,130
will always be impossible to experience
as an outsider,

87
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,820
but directors use subjective film making
techniques to try to recreate it,

88
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,850
and sometimes they do a pretty good job.
Of course they don't always get it

89
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:17,800
right.
It seems like historically mainstream

90
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:21,340
American cinema has had trouble
capturing authentic aspects of the Asian

91
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:23,170
experience.
Up until very recently,

92
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:26,800
Asian characters were almost always
either the Sensei who teaches using his

93
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,010
Americanized eastern wisdom for a racist
punchline.

94
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,370
Maybe the most important idea to grasp
in these discussions of creating film

95
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:36,100
bias is that they extend outside of
fictional storytelling.

96
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,500
In a famous example,
how is it possible that the police

97
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:41,080
officers who physically assaulted Rodney
King were acquitted?

98
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,170
There are many ways to approach this
question and the racial and political

99
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:46,240
reasons for their acquittal are
undeniable,

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,850
but another reason is necessary to
understanding that trial,

101
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,150
and it's how the lawyers defending the
Los Angeles police department distorted

102
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:54,580
the video footage of the beatings to
suit their story.

103
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,090
The defense attorneys broke the video
down into stills freezing the frame so

104
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,730
that the gesture,
the raised hand is torn from its

105
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:04,100
temporal place in the visual narrative.
The video is not only violence

106
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,790
decontextualized,
but violently recontextualized.

107
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,320
It has played without a simultaneous
soundtrack which had it existed,

108
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,870
would have been littered with racial and
sexual slurs against Rodney King,

109
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,570
but lawyers whitewashed the footage for
their own narrative.

110
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,230
This is a perfect example of racially
biased filmmaking used for evil.

111
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,380
The lawyers create a narrative that
white people are used to experiencing

112
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,580
and this deceit tries to justify the
obviously unjust beating of rodney king

113
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,030
using buys filmmaking to create a
distorted narrative is still happening.

114
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,740
By the way,
if you ever want to test this,

115
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:35,200
see how two different media outlets film
the same event.

116
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,570
If your network supports Betsy devoss,
her senate,

117
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,220
hearing his films like this,
if not,

118
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,270
it's films like this.

119
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,930
The HUFFINGTON post article may be
right,

120
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,650
quite people can never truly understand
the black experience,

121
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,860
and this also applies to men who never
truly understand what it's like to be a

122
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,310
woman in a male dominated field,
but the closest we can get maybe through

123
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:54,370
a close reading of commentary on the
black experience like in menace to

124
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,800
society or by the perspectives in camera
choices,

125
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:59,870
like in the silence of the lambs.
Each movie uses the power of

126
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:03,800
cinematography to show experiences
outside of our own race or gender,

127
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:07,550
and that's the beauty of movies.
We get sucked into lives and experiences

128
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,920
we could never possibly experienced
ourselves,

129
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,920
and some directors use that ability to
teach us something about the world

130
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,900
around us.
When these choices are used for good,

131
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,870
we learn about the human experience,
but when they're used for bad,

132
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,320
they cloud the truth and present the
world in a narrow minded and dangerous

133
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,550
way.
So keep a lookout.

134
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,630
Thanks for watching.
