1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,170
At 3:00 in the morning,
I didn't know he was sending me to get

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,013
on at first.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,110
The setup for this is that is that his
limo driver says he's got to stop

4
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:10,210
somewhere,
so he stops in the ghetto.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,730
It's Dave in the ghetto.
In a limo.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,390
Yes,
yes,

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:13,800
yes.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,633
Huh.

9
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,940
That's it.

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,450
But the thing is that you do exactly
what I what a honky would do in the

11
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,284
ghetto.

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,000
Right?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,710
Right.
And I was crack the window a little bit.

14
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,250
The job starts out in a limousine.
I knew he was taking to the ghetto

15
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,990
because I'm looking out the window.
I'm like gunstock,

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,180
snow and snow.
So.

17
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,490
Okay.
There's a little statement,

18
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:40,790
but it's not preachy.
It's not painting the picture.

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,290
Paint a picture.
Right.

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,200
Then we get to the ghetto.
That was in Washington.

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,710
I saw some kids running around playing
and I was like,

22
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,590
who has the kids just running out on the
streets like this and this.

23
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,560
Maybe it could be in trouble.
He might need my help.

24
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,750
I got to do something,
but I wasn't gonna get out the car.

25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,730
Okay.
True Story.

26
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:05,430
Now did the baby talk to me?
No,

27
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,500
was was selling weed.
No,

28
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,930
what?
I was making a point and here I am a

29
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:15,680
black man in a limousine,
now we're getting into the class issues

30
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,710
right in the ghetto.
So it's true than just I pride myself on

31
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,820
saying real shit that people don't even
notice I'm saying,

32
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,850
but they feel it because when people
come up to me,

33
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:33,140
they they say that I love.
I love that they can feel it,

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,050
but I don't think they really know.
So when you pointed that out,

35
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,250
I was very impressed.
Man.

36
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,600
Was your early comedy autobiographical?
It's yes,

37
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,540
but never directly.
I don't want to give away my secret

38
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,880
recipe.
Want to know what happened to me

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,920
on the new season of the sopranos or the
Dave Chappelle,

40
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,930
so received.

41
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,840
If the $5,000,000

42
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,040
shit on TV
though

43
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,720
Chappelle supposedly had it all,
a $50,000,000 contract from comedy

44
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:22,580
central,
a hit TV show,

45
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,630
best selling dvds on April 28th of last
year.

46
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,660
Dave abruptly walked away not only from
the set of the show but for $50,

47
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:35,090
million dollars,
which he left his fans shock and most

48
00:02:35,091 --> 00:02:36,950
everyone completely puzzled.

49
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,510
One of the most promising comedians of
recent history have left a successful

50
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,120
television series.
How could he have walked away from a

51
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,740
$50,000,000 contract?

52
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,390
Hey,
where do you start telling them this

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,430
story and when I'm walking down the
street and be like,

54
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,141
Hey,
this right.

55
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:54,140
You tell it how it is.
Not really.

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,100
I don't really know what it is.
I just say what it feels.

57
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,650
I'll tell you what happened,
but I can't say it directly.

58
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,473
There's a book

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,320
to me that encapsulates my entire
experience before I left the show.

60
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,290
In the book is called Pimp,
written by a black American who was a

61
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,410
pimping the forties.
He describes in detail how these men

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,440
break women so that they will give them
the money that they make with their own

63
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:31,520
bodies because a guy that generates
money,

64
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,250
people have a vested interest in
controlling.

65
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,030
There's a story in his so cold.
It makes me shudder to think about it.

66
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,110
The iceberg slim is trying to control
the woman that he finds uncontrollable.

67
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,880
I will go to work on this show and I
felt awful.

68
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,160
Every day felt like some kind of
prostitute or something like that,

69
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,460
but I feel so bad.
Why keep showing up to this place?

70
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,320
So he asked older how it can rein her in
and the older pimps says,

71
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,410
oh,
that's easy iceberg.

72
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,240
All you have to do is beat that bitch
with a coat hanger.

73
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,220
I felt like,
you know,

74
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,630
in a lot of instances I was deliberately
being put the stress and then run her

75
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,820
bath and give him some pills.
Have you tried to get me to take

76
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,750
psychotic medication?
She'll be so grateful that you fixed the

77
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,900
shoe for good.
You will the motherfucker that beat them

78
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:24,470
in the first place.
I forgot the hostility of the

79
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:28,130
environment of Showbiz.
Maybe there's something else going on.

80
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,190
Maybe these rapes aren't even the worst
of it.

81
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:32,024
Wouldn't that be something?

82
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,560
Wouldn't that be something?
Now?

83
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,380
End of this book,
Iceberg Slim tells the story is kind of

84
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:45,060
the crescendo of the book iceberg.
Slim's bottom bitch is at the end of a

85
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,841
mileage.
Choose bubbling.

86
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:48,330
You could see she was going crazy.
They had to let it go.

87
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,260
It's hard to let it go,
a bottom bitch go and he wasn't ready to

88
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:56,260
let it go because it's organization
couldn't handle losing her for days

89
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,750
released and it fits all these
incredible records.

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,090
Know like how many central was a hot
place to be.

91
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:03,800
When I showed up there,
he said,

92
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:05,930
okay,
this guy in an hotel across the street,

93
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,690
it's waiting for you in room number
seven when should go over there and I

94
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:13,280
want you to fuck them,
but before you do and he to put some of

95
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:14,300
this stuff in this drink.

96
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,680
I slept a small vial of mineral oil into
her poem.

97
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,450
I told her it was chloral hydrate,
only two drops.

98
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,430
We're not to suck out.

99
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,240
She said,
I did everything you said,

100
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,890
but.
But then Mandel look right some wrong.

101
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,420
Daddy,
do you mean something's wrong?

102
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,950
Bitch?
Did you put that stuff in his drink?

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,910
She said,
I did everything.

104
00:05:31,911 --> 00:05:34,130
He said that I put all of it in his
drink.

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,851
He said,
wait a minute,

106
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:35,840
bitch,
wait a minute.

107
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,760
You put all of it in his drink.

108
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,660
I knelt beside him,
blocking her view with my back.

109
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,110
I wiped my brow and turned my face to
water.

110
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,540
My eyes were wide and alarm.
I said,

111
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,483
baby,

112
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,550
he's dead.
I think.

113
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,510
All right,
bitch.

114
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,343
Let me think.

115
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,340
I can fix this for you.
She squeezed tightly against me.

116
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,760
I kept telling her she had nothing to
worry about.

117
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,510
After all,
we went together for life and her secret

118
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:14,830
would always be safe with me.
She found out about the hoax years

119
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,663
later.

120
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,680
That's how the whole shit works.
Ladies,

121
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,740
you understand?
This bitch was at the end of the

122
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:23,750
mileage.
She was at four 98.

123
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,660
She ended up triggering for iceberg for
another six months.

124
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,940
She must have done another 200 tricks
for them.

125
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,420
Do you understand?
No like the whore that they turned us

126
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:35,360
into,
jumped on that plane and left my

127
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,660
father's bedside,
which are granted his day and I went out

128
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:41,720
and I sat with these people in this room
and

129
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,600
you got to make them have hard and fast
to stick them for the long scratch.

130
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:48,250
Quip.
So slim,

131
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,380
be as sweet as scratch.
No sweeter and always stick a hole for

132
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:55,990
bundle before you sexy.
Oh,

133
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,430
Ho ain't nothing but a trick to a pimp

134
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,860
whole Dave chappelle thing is going to
end,

135
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,280
but I feel like I'm going to be some
kind of parable by either what you're

136
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:11,680
supposed to do with what you nasty.
Well,

137
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,930
I'm going to be something.
I'm either going to be a legend or just

138
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,660
that tragic story,
but I'm going full throttle.

139
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,770
I'm going on way.
I want to.

140
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,430
I'm.
I'm eager to find out how this will

141
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:25,090
resolve itself.
The idea of being courageous is that

142
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:27,910
even though you're scared,
you just do the right thing.

143
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,610
Anyway,
so in 2004,

144
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,700
I walked away from $15,000,000 and in
November I made a deal for $60,000,000.

145
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,730
Are you having fun this time around?
I am making a point to have fun in the

146
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,800
store.
Yes.

147
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,580
This video took tons of editing tricks
to carefully assembled these interviews

148
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,280
in a seamless way.
If I didn't know a handful of shortcuts,

149
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,730
it would have taken significantly longer
and I would've wasted tons of time.

150
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,130
The best way to get started on any
editing software,

151
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:02,100
it's definitely a tutorial that will
