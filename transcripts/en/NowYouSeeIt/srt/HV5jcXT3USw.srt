1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,990
You'll have,
and I see your Schwartz is his biggest

2
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:16,090
mind.
That must be Lord far.

3
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:18,670
Quads castle.
That's the place.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,420
Do you think maybe he's compensating for
something?

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,653
Oh my God.

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,590
Oh,
oh God.

7
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,050
I just.
I remembered there's just this teeny

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,470
tiny thing.
No,

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:45,970
no,
no.

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,100
Sexual comedy is one of the most
universal and popular genres of comedy

11
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:53,070
in cinema pds.
Sorry,

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,190
Tourette's.
Notice.

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,820
She has it too.
It's something pretty much every adult

14
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:03,810
can relate to and has the potential for
big laughs while often used for comedic

15
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:05,730
effect.
I want to look at how sexual imagery,

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,240
specifically phallic symbols can be used
to achieve dramatic effects.

17
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,660
Filmmakers can use phallic symbols to
tremendously contribute to the visual

18
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:15,630
storytelling of a film.
Penis shapes are everywhere and while

19
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:18,540
not always acknowledged,
there's no doubt that skyscrapers,

20
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,610
he went to a funny
match go up guns

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,770
or even a pipe,
so at a certain point he brings out this

22
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:38,160
pipe and what pipe does he bring out?
It brings out the Sherlock Holmes pipe

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,950
one.
You can say it's a sexual thing because

24
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,600
my life is bigger than yours.
All right,

25
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:46,290
and can be treated as phallic symbols.
Psychologist Sigmund Freud is famous for

26
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:50,100
theorizing that we noticed these objects
are phallic on a subconscious level in a

27
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:53,100
similar way of thinking.
Filmmakers use phallic symbols in place

28
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:57,090
of actual sex to get a subconscious
emotional reaction from the viewer.

29
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,110
The simplest and most noticeable use of
a phallic symbol is to imply sex in

30
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:03,240
film.
Sexist more often imply been actually

31
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,400
shown,
especially with strict censorship during

32
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,070
the golden age of cinema.
That band showing sex on screen,

33
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,460
so instead of actual sex,
we see sex represented in a phallic

34
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,380
take me to work going
black.

35
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,860
The object can be anything from a
bedpost in the birth of a nation,

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,920
a train entering a tunnel in north by
northwest,

37
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,000
a man pumping gas into a woman's car and
written on the window or a gun,

38
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:39,001
and Bonnie and Clyde
drove phallic symbol.

39
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:44,740
We see there's some kind of sexual
relationship or desired sexual

40
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:48,430
relationship between the two characters.
Another common form of Phallic symbol is

41
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:51,220
to show masculinity.
A gun is a powerful phallic symbol that

42
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:53,230
indicates the masculinity of a
character.

43
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,710
A big gun means your manly and the
heroes and classic action movie seemed

44
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:58,960
to always have ridiculously sized
weapons.

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,780
If a girl has a big gun,
we know she's reversing gender roles and

46
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,150
taking on masculine qualities.
Small guns,

47
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,640
on the other hand,
are a sign of weakness or vulnerability.

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,370
That's what I'm talking about.
Noisy cricket.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,310
Okay.
No,

50
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,270
no.
Come on man.

51
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,620
You get a series.
We atomize.

52
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,120
I get a little midget cricket.
The gun sights issue even gets addressed

53
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:23,570
in the James Bond Film.
Dr. No as a spy bond has to conceal a

54
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,550
small gun,
but the film makes it clear that it's

55
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:29,060
still mainly with the delivery,
like a brick through a plate glass

56
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:31,820
window.
Another example is written on the wind.

57
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,360
When Kyle Threatens Mitch with a pistol,
the small size of the gun further

58
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:38,900
reinforces the idea that kyle is
cowardly week and feminine.

59
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,970
He doesn't appear threatening with such
a small weapon.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,020
This parallels nicely with the fact that
Kyle's impotent and so he's missing a

61
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:48,650
major aspect of being a man.
Phallic symbols can also be used to

62
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:52,610
convey domination and control.
We see this symbolism hyperbolically in

63
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:55,760
a clockwork orange,
a clockwork orange conveys the idea that

64
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:59,360
if you can expose someone sexually,
you have complete and utter domination

65
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,650
over them.
So when Alex,

66
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:04,340
where's the Phallic Mask and beats the
couple with a phallic stick or uses a

67
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:08,960
phallic statue to toy with an old lady,
he's asserting his complete control over

68
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,730
them.
It shows that to physically dominate

69
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:12,980
someone is to also sexually dominated
someone.

70
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,620
Sex and violence go hand in hand.
Phallic symbols.

71
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,510
Eight,
the visual storytelling of the film

72
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:21,080
because they help show Alex go from
dominating to being dominated.

73
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,370
He goes from overpowering everyone to
literally being squished by authority.

74
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,670
Alien uses phallic symbols to convey
fear.

75
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,630
The writer of the film intentionally
made alien contain rape imagery to make

76
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:36,740
the film more terrifying.

77
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,330
One thing that people are all disturbed
about if sex,

78
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,810
everybody is always all in a not about
sex.

79
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:45,460
I said,
that's how I'm going to attack the

80
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:48,490
audience.
I'm going to attack them sexually and

81
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm not going to go after the women in
the audience.

82
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,490
I'm going to attack the men and I'm
going to put in every image.

83
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,710
I can think of that.
I know will make them in the audience,

84
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:58,480
cross their legs,
homosexual,

85
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,320
rl,
right,

86
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,950
birth the thing,
laser tags down your throat,

87
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,840
the whole number,

88
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,200
the parallels between the alien attacks
in real life rape,

89
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,590
make the alien attacks more horrific,
getting raped as a scary thing,

90
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,070
and the writers use the horrors of rape
to make the alien a scarier villain.

91
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,900
The design of the alien is very phallic
in the set pieces look equally as valid

92
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,820
and vaginal.
This design was done very intentionally

93
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,900
by set designer hr Geiger kegers work
with sexual,

94
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,540
and that's the most mild thing you can
say about it.

95
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,190
It's the opening of the alien ship.
Looks like two giant Vaginas on a 60

96
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:34,990
foot and set.
We built that set.

97
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:39,991
It wasn't a miniature show,
my God from direct mouth inside alien to

98
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:43,300
the face hugger laying eggs orally to
the phallic chest.

99
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,010
Buster,
the whole alien is Phallic.

100
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,280
You're looking at this sort of gray
penis.

101
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,220
Can I say that,
but instead of using phallic symbols to

102
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:54,910
show manliness or domination,
alien uses phallic symbols to show us

103
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:56,890
being sexually dominated by the alien.

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,680
The Phallic symbols evoke terror by
making the human sexual victims to the

105
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,690
alien.
The Phallic symbols add to visual

106
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:06,320
storytelling in the film by making the
alien attacks visually and emotionally

107
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:09,380
similar to sexual assault.
Phallic symbols work even when they're

108
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:11,300
subtle.
A film like the social network is a

109
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:14,780
perfect opportunity to use phallic
symbols because the whole film revolves

110
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:16,310
around the fight for power,
sex,

111
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,950
and high social status.
The winklevoss twins take mark

112
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:22,350
Zuckerberg to their final clubhouse as a
way to show off their high status and

113
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:24,800
power in order to help convince mark to
work for them.

114
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,860
They offer him a sandwich to further
show off their luxuries and the way it's

115
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,140
presented to them is just so oddly
family

116
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,650
and then he holds it like this,

117
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,230
and then after mark questions,
their idea and internally thinks of a

118
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,040
better one,
he holds the sandwich like this request,

119
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,100
myspace or friendster.

120
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,520
Is it just a coincidence?
Maybe,

121
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,770
but maybe not.
There's definitely a point where the

122
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:51,230
analysis of Phallic symbols becomes
overkill.

123
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,590
Sigmund Freud once said,
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

124
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,200
Not everything that looks valic has some
sexual meaning,

125
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,080
but when used intentionally,
a phallic symbol can be a powerful

126
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,810
visual that adds meaning to what's
happening on screen.

127
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,570
So the next time you watch a film with
your friends and notice a phallic

128
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:07,100
symbol,
feel free to point it out.

129
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,720
Just don't be a huge dick about it.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,440
You don't have to be a history major or
a political scientist to see the bigger

131
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:18,280
dick foreign policy theory.
It sounds like this,

132
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,200
what they have bigger dicks

133
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,650
bob

134
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,650
course,
the bombs and the rockets and the

135
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:30,651
bullets are all shaped like Dick.
It's a subconscious need to project the

136
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:34,730
penis into other people's affairs.

137
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,720
It's called fucking
thanks for watching.
