1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,410
And now our feature presentation
Lawrence of Arabia,

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,740
presented in its original ultra cinema
scope letterbox format.

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,770
I can't see anything.
What's the rather attractive girl on a

4
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:24,390
camel?
That's Peter O'toole.

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,290
I want to make a quick video on the
usage of aspect ratios as a thematic

6
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,660
device in film.
While the first 40 years of film were

7
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:33,390
limited to one ratio for length and
width of a screen.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,870
Modern filmmakers have several aspect
ratios to choose from and each one can

9
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,970
have a different emotional effect for
the viewer.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,240
Let's look at why filmmakers choose the
ratios they choose and explore the

11
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,670
emotional effect of changing aspect
ratio.

12
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:49,671
During a film.
The oldest aspect ratio is the four by

13
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:56,730
three academy ratio and it lost its
popularity after the introduction of 16

14
00:00:56,731 --> 00:01:00,660
by nine ratio in the 19 fifties.
Directors still use this ratio sometimes

15
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:03,600
though to make the film feel like it's
from an older time period.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,580
A great example is the Grand Budapest
hotel,

17
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:08,520
but she switches to academy.
When the story goes back to the 19

18
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:11,250
forties,
the begins of course with

19
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,660
the aspect ratio change is a great way
to emotionally transport us to the time

20
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,550
period.
When this ratio was popular,

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,330
we associate the aspect ratio with old
timey movies and it helps pull us into

22
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:24,100
the old timey style,
quirkiness,

23
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:26,140
manners,
and culture that the Grand Budapest

24
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:30,340
hotel has 500 days of summer uses
polaroid square ratio as a way to show a

25
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,140
glamorized,
reminiscent past.

26
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,280
This time capsule look coincides nicely
with Tom's old fashioned unrealistic

27
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:37,990
view of love.
Towards the end of the movie,

28
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:39,970
though,
this polaroid look is eventually pushed

29
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:42,910
off screen.
As Tom realizes the expectation of this

30
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:45,660
old fashioned outlook does not coincide
with reality.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,870
Jay Jay Jay,

32
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,850
two point three,
five ratio is ultra wide screen and it

33
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:57,150
gives the look of an epic big budget
drama or a Scifi film.

34
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,940
I like how Auntie Donna uses it for over
the top drama.

35
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,560
My theses.
So good,

36
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:04,830
but compared to you such doodles of
robot games,

37
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,770
I mean he is the APP.

38
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,420
The ratio is reserved for extremely epic
movies.

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,080
A movie like Napoleon dynamite would
look kind of off in this extreme ratio,

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,110
but a movie like star wars wouldn't look
nearly the same without it.

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,070
Portraying space is commonly associated
with big aspect ratio changes.

42
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,190
Interstellar switches to imax footage
when the shots are of space,

43
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,070
and it goes back to 16 by nine for shots
of the spaceship.

44
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,920
What better way to make space look
bigger than my literally adding to the

45
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:38,350
screen?
The same has done in apollo 13 in galaxy

46
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:40,420
quest to show the huge scope of space

47
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,940
aspect ratio changes to add scope aren't
exclusive to space movies though right

48
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:53,340
before the Bain verse Batman Fight and
the Dark Knight rises,

49
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,860
for example,
the camera transitions to figure imax

50
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:57,960
footage.
This change has a great subconscious

51
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,430
emotional effect.
It reminds us subtly that we're about to

52
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,580
watch an intense epic seen hunger games
also does a good job of adding

53
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:07,630
anticipation by slowly expanding into
IMEX footage before the fighting begins.

54
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,780
The right aspect ratio can contribute to
the realism of a film.

55
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,620
A scripted film that's supposed to look
like a documentary has to be 16 by nine

56
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,020
or else it won't emotionally feel like a
documentary.

57
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,340
The opening scene in the incredibles
purposefully looks like 16 millimeter,

58
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,110
six by nine ratio film and the effect
adds realism,

59
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,620
so the movie feels less like a cartoon
and more like a realistic action film.

60
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,660
Catch me if you can cleverly use this
aspect.

61
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,650
Ratio change to show frank is contained.
He starts on TV in the small academy

62
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,590
ratio and then he's next shown through a
small slit in a wall.

63
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,570
He is literally being squished in the
frame.

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,700
It gives the emotional feeling that
frank is trapped.

65
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,760
The most ambitious aspect ratio changes
or when the ratio is ignored,

66
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:46,210
completely life of Pi has the fish that
literally jumping out of the frame

67
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,950
and asked the great and powerful does
the same with a burst of flame.

68
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,100
It's a really immersive technique and
makes for a great visual aspect.

69
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,980
Ratios have a chance to greatly
contribute to the visual storytelling of

70
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:02,050
the film.
Whether they indicate time period

71
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,490
intensity or added realism aspect ratios
are another clever tool at the disposal

72
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:08,860
of the modern director.
If you want to fully understand the

73
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,770
style of the film,
the film's aspect ratio is a great frame

74
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:13,450
of reference.
Thanks for watching.
