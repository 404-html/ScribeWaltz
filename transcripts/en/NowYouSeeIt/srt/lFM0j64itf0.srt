1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,890
Not Bad words.
No words are bad,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,100
but some people start using them a lot
to hurt other people and then they

3
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:07,740
become bad.
It'd become a hard,

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,990
there's words that I love that I can't
use because other people use them wrong

5
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,840
to hurt other people.
Like the word cons is a beautiful word

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,560
to me.
Beauty forward and I don't,

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:21,750
I mean aesthetically it has like
chocolate and around on the ends.

8
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:25,890
I just liked,
I just liked the way it sounds and I

9
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,040
don't use it as an insight.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,900
I'm alone in my laundry.
I'm like tones.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,193
Okay.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,620
Words hold a lot of weight.
When you give a guy in particular swear

13
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:46,090
words,
while people may just consider them a

14
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,070
way to make something funny or to show
someone's,

15
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:49,670
Matt actually goes a lot deeper than
that.

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,810
I want to explore swear words,
see how they're used and how they reveal

17
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:55,170
a lot more than you may think.
That's awesome.

18
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,210
I want
to know where swearing came from.

19
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:03,070
One has to look no further than the word
itself.

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,130
The word swearing and cursing are
biblical in origin.

21
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,310
The first words that were taboo where
words that said the Lord's name in vain

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,360
way back in the day,
swearing on the Bible was a big deal

23
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,050
because people really thought perjury
undetected by the legal system would be

24
00:01:23,051 --> 00:01:25,810
punished by an ease dropping and easily
offended God.

25
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,870
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but

26
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,390
similarly a curse on someone was not
only serious but also deadly.

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,200
Nowadays our society has lessens the
power of those vulgarities and focused

28
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:40,690
more on the taboos of sex and bodily
functions.

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,760
She looked me in the eyes and said,
mom is making a pub salad and I need

30
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,140
some sets,
own dressing,

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:46,470
but I think

32
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,650
it's a common misconception to think
we've become completely desensitized

33
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,690
from swears in the 21st century.
Sure.

34
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:55,080
Plenty of movies swear like crazy,
but swear words still hold that element

35
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,400
of taboo to prove my point.
God,

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,330
I haven't been fuck like that since
grade school.

37
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,280
Would this line have had the same effect
if it was,

38
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:05,670
I haven't made love this intensely.
People may associate swearing with

39
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,100
somebody who's out of control,
swearing in rage.

40
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,830
But what's interesting in cinema is that
it can often be the opposite.

41
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,310
The person who swears is the one that's
actually in control of the scene.

42
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,090
Jerry [inaudible] guard in Fargo is
constantly sworn at by people he hires

43
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:19,350
and fucking wife,
you know,

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,290
or your fucking wife,
Cherry strangers through a bald face,

45
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:27,291
liar,
fucking liar and his own son.

46
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,770
And when he gets pushed too far,
he finally curses back.

47
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:37,370
But it's hilariously lane Darren
two-toned

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,520
port until yet he's an extremely weak
character who constantly gets pushed

49
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:48,030
around and the swear words reveal how
everyone in his life can talk down to

50
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:50,340
him and control him.
The one who swearing is the one

51
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:55,341
dominating the scene.
It's almost like a verbal way of marking

52
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:58,110
your territory.
You'll notice in the opening of

53
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,600
reservoir dogs that white is the only
one who gets this weird directly at the

54
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,570
boss showing not only that they have a
more casual relationship,

55
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,410
but that Mr. White is willing to stand
up to it.

56
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,230
My full time shit fucking here and y'all
give it back to you.

57
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,250
Swear words carry a lot of weight.
The most famous line in cinema,

58
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,210
right.
My hair,

59
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't give a damn,
would not be the same without the swear.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,790
A much bigger deal.
Back in 1939 the curse word really

61
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,390
embodies how fed up red is with scarlet
O'hara and he's not bubbling and anger.

62
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,150
It's pure apathy.
A place where swearing is controversial

63
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:28,480
is actually stand up comedy.
There's that angel debate of vulgarity

64
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,700
and whether or not comedians could be
just as funny without the constant f

65
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:34,120
bonds.
I have the glasses just completely

66
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:37,210
disguised as this guy.
And then it was something about

67
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,420
meantime,
two of them are stuck in a fucking cave

68
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,590
every week,
you know?

69
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,360
And that was the bit,
and then I said,

70
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,340
well,
let me see if it works without the word.

71
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,810
Right.
And I took the word out,

72
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,570
it didn't work.
And that's what bothered me.

73
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,720
And why do comedians swear?
But it's not about the swear word there.

74
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,600
It's about,
you know,

75
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,960
it's about you getting worked up.
Yeah,

76
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,570
it's about this guy is,
he means this.

77
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,620
He's so annoyed.
Right.

78
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,760
The fucking cave your ass funny.
That's contempt that take for example,

79
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,160
this swear word that's always bothered
me in the titanic,

80
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,510
he's got the iceberg warning and it's
fucking hand.

81
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,700
Excuse me,
his hand,

82
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,490
it serves no purpose and it's a poor use
of vulgarity.

83
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,310
Definitely makes anything funny.
It does.

84
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:16,960
There's no doubt about it.
Once you,

85
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:20,490
once you inject a fuck into your speech,
that makes it funnier.

86
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:23,050
It gives it,
it gives it an emphasis and it gives it

87
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:24,860
a shock.
Just about every swear word in the

88
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:26,170
departed seems to make me laugh.

89
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,050
Green is on a cup of coffee,
but spoke with anyone.

90
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,120
Just stop now go fuck yourself.

91
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,030
Kidding myself.
If sometimes a swear words purpose is

92
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,180
just as simple as that,
but in the movie they don't just swear

93
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,500
leftin write characters.
No when it's appropriate or not.

94
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,630
Like using a softer word when flirting
with someone.

95
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:40,770
Yeah,

96
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,950
just smack.
You'll have fun there.

97
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:42,784
I'll break your grades.

98
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,040
You've got her interest.
Then you can go in for the sweater.

99
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,660
When's the last time you checked before
I went to a second topic

100
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,750
is 40 Melissa McCarthy essentially
cameos as the character that swears

101
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,210
nonstop and it's just dumped.
Don't get me wrong,

102
00:04:57,211 --> 00:04:59,760
I love a good improvised moment and
swear words can be really funny,

103
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,830
but this scene makes no sense in its
context.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,780
Yo,
you're a horrible fucking woman.

105
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,000
This is why everybody hates you,
Jill.

106
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,680
This kind of shit.
I mean,

107
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,260
they're in a principal's office and they
just met and she's going to talk like

108
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,030
this.
It's not realistic and frankly it's

109
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:15,090
boring.
None of this talk is productive,

110
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,830
but how about this?
Let's try something a little more

111
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:19,460
complex.
What does this swear word accomplish?

112
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,760
Okay.
Tell me,

113
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,490
what did you mix say to hear multiple
migs and the next step is to do,

114
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,600
what did he say?
He said,

115
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,810
I can smell your content.
I see.

116
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,790
Misuse of swearing has many layers to
it.

117
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,190
At first it seems like a way to make
clarissa uncomfortable.

118
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,550
Hannibal obviously heard what makes that
and he just wants her to have to say it,

119
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,400
so she's embarrassed,
but with every insult and humiliating

120
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,440
comment he spits at her,
she stays strong.

121
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:50,280
Continuing to act polite,
insincere,

122
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,090
see a lot doc.
I think it's partly Hannibal's

123
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:56,930
admiration for her strength and a sense
of pity that causes him to help.

124
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,540
At the end of the scene,
there's a certain duality to swear

125
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,010
words.
On one hand they're funny,

126
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,390
but on the other hand,
they're deadly.

127
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,330
Nothing captures this idea more than
movies like full metal jacket and

128
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,760
whiplash where authority figures yellow
verbal abuse.

129
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:10,220
That's funny,
but also deeply manipulative and cruel.

130
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,280
What have we got here?
I'm fucking comedian.

131
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,110
I admire your honesty.
Hell,

132
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:19,170
I like you can come over to my house and
fuck my sister.

133
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,970
I know that's a lot of ways to use swear
words,

134
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,240
but what ties them all together is that
a swear word always reveal something.

135
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,640
It reveals control,
a relationship or even some

136
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:29,890
manipulation.
There's that saying sticks and stones

137
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,840
may break my bones,
but words will never hurt me.

138
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,880
After watching this video.
Do you still think that's true?

139
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,030
Maybe,
maybe not,

140
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,830
maybe fuck yourself

141
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,070
slightly trends,
just a bit of a break from the norm.

142
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,610
Just a little slot in the break.
The monotony of all that hard.
