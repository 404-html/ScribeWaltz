1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:05,210
Did you know there was a remake of
psycho in 1998 starring Vince Vaughn as

2
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:08,780
Norman Bates?
I think we're all in our private traps.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,240
Clampton.
It was a commercial and critical

4
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:13,790
failure.
It's more or less a shot for shot

5
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,100
remake,
which makes for a cool case study into

6
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:19,640
how the original psycho worked so well.
We can compare the two movies,

7
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:23,390
look at the subtle differences and see
why those differences matter and why it

8
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:25,310
made the original site goes so much
better.

9
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,230
Let's talk specifically about the
ending.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,140
How did the original end,
what it hitchcock leave us with?

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,810
Most people remember the look to the
camera from Norman Bates,

12
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:35,480
but it really ends with the car getting
pulled out of the mud.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,930
The shot leaves a very bad taste in our
mouths because we know what's in the

14
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,150
trunk,
not to mention it's filmed very off

15
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:43,040
center and it's coming right towards us.

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,170
The remake starts the ending in a
similar way,

17
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:48,470
but it ends by panning out to a
landscape as the credits roll.

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,860
This completely ruins the ending.
We're supposed to end feeling disgusted

19
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:54,410
and uncomfortable,
but the pan reintroduced this us back

20
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:57,200
into the world with its familiar
landscapes and cars.

21
00:00:57,201 --> 00:01:00,740
Driving by the original psycho ending is
great because it's sickening.

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,770
If the camera moves away from the
sickening image and ends with the

23
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:07,460
familiar were moved from the story and
the murder and are reintroduced back

24
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:09,770
into society.
That's no way to end the movie.

25
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,500
The psycho remake ending is closer to
the riding,

26
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:15,890
into the sunset kind of movie ending.
This is a kind of shot where we're

27
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:19,280
leaving the original story and get
reintroduced into the world.

28
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,640
Normally it's also shot with our main
characters who went through some sort of

29
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:25,850
ordeal physically moving away from the
camera to continue their journey.

30
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,040
The western popularize this kind of
ending,

31
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:31,790
but it's still very common in modern
movies just with a few tweaks nowadays.

32
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,500
It can be a car instead of a horse or a
street corner instead of a picture ask

33
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,700
sunset.
It's a very comforting ending.

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,210
We see something familiar and it's a
cinematic cue that the story is over and

35
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:44,720
we're back to the real world.
12 angry men ends with the men who all

36
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:46,730
came together to pronounce the kid
innocent,

37
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,910
going back into the real world,
a world where the American judicial

38
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:53,270
system works and people are only
convicted if they actually committed the

39
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:55,220
crime.
It's a comforting ending and it

40
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:57,800
compliments the field.
Good theme that even the most stubborn

41
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,080
people can listen to reason and change
their minds.

42
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,600
I'll be at not so easily and not so
nicely,

43
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,990
but I'm not saying that all riding into
the sunset endings are feel good.

44
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,930
How about having a serial killer walk
back into society now?

45
00:02:08,931 --> 00:02:11,670
That's an eerie ending.
I do wish we could chat.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,330
I'm having an old fat

47
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,170
in a very similar way.
Doors closing at the end makes for a

48
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,200
nice symbol to end the movie.
There's a physical separation now

49
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,390
literally closing the door on an
adventure.

50
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,440
Also,
very common.

51
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,260
You can even use it to separate two main
characters within the story,

52
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:31,530
which is what Francis Coppola did and
perhaps the most famous movie ending of

53
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:36,531
all time.
Also,

54
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:40,870
the searchers which has an opening shot
that starts at the doorway with John

55
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,390
Wayne coming in from the desert,
and then the ending shot shows him

56
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:46,690
leaving through the same doorway.
This ending symbolizes our hero

57
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,700
returning to the wilderness from which
he came.

58
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,010
Another comment ending is when the

59
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,640
ending shot relates to the opening shot.
There's a great super cut of opening and

60
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,360
closing shots of movies shown side by
side on Vimeo and a lot of them relate

61
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,520
to each other.
The goal of this kind of ending is to

62
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,760
show a shot similar to the opening shot,
but now that you've seen the movie,

63
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,620
it should evoke a different feeling for
you.

64
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,450
The opening shot is the first
impression.

65
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,480
The movie tells its story and the movie
ends with something similar to what it

66
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:21,880
started with.
The last shot will always feel different

67
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,000
because after the movie tells its story
to shot has an entirely different

68
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,530
meaning.
With the Godfather sql,

69
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,620
the shot is the same,
but Michael Corleone is not and he looks

70
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,730
at two in gone.
Girl,

71
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:33,070
he uses violent imagery to refer to his
wife.

72
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,100
Picture of cracking or lovely skull
spoiling our brains,

73
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,230
trying to get answers,

74
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,950
and by the last shot we know why.
It's a fun way to look at movies because

75
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:48,920
the ending could potentially some of the
main ideas of the movie.

76
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,920
The difference between the opening and
the closing is that the opening shot

77
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,740
hints at the main ideas and the ending
reinforces them.

78
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,770
It's as if the director is highlighting
the most important part of the movie.

79
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,840
So go watch your favorite movie ending
again.

80
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,490
Maybe look for a symbol.
What do you think the feathers

81
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:05,390
symbolizes in forrest gump?
There's no right or wrong answer,

82
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:07,850
but we know what the director wants you
to notice.

83
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,470
What mood does the ending leave you
with?

84
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,950
That's the most important feeling of the
movie because what you walk out of the

85
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,500
theater feeling is what matters.
So give it a try.

86
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,680
And with that I leave you with a
simpsons parody of the godfather ending

87
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,990
because I love the simpsons.
Thanks for watching.
