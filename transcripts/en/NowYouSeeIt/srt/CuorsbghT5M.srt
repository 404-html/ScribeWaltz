1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,300
Well,
there they are,

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,300
Shira Mr Creeps in his partner,
Mr Kroll.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,650
I've been asked to make a video on plot
twists and it's just about the beginning

4
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:09,900
of this channel,
but I was always hesitant to do it

5
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:12,630
because I didn't want to spoil a bunch
of major plot twists.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,440
I stood by this principle until I came
across an interesting study conducted by

7
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,990
UC San Diego.
Researchers had one group of

8
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:22,680
participants read several famous books
after the researchers spoiled their

9
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,630
endings while another group read the
books.

10
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:28,200
Normally after reading each group noted
how much they liked each book.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,570
Based on the results,
it turns out that if the ending is

12
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:34,050
spoiled to you before you read a book,
you actually end up liking the book

13
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,420
more.
Not only do I think this study perfectly

14
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:39,690
explains what makes a plot twist great.
I also like it because it helps me

15
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:42,180
justify spoiling some movies.
I'll have to spoil.

16
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:45,780
Now you see me and primal fear with the
prestige having only very minor

17
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:47,370
spoilers.
If you haven't seen one,

18
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:51,000
consider what the study says and use
this video as an opportunity to recreate

19
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,650
the experiment.
So let's get spoiling.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,190
We are going to follow those dirty,
find that data.

21
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,650
The common definition of a plot twist is
a totally unexpected outcome to a story,

22
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,680
and now you see me.
Dylan roads is an FBI agent trying to

23
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:06,050
track down the four horsemen,
but in a shocking twist,

24
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:08,090
it turns out he was the fifth horseman
all along.

25
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,300
While I do think the rest of the movie
is pretty fun,

26
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,090
there's one key reason that this plot
twists doesn't really work.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,310
Now you and our shipping
shoddily a bomb goes off.

28
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,090
I'm the FBI,
got past him not once,

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,190
not twice,
but consistently,

30
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,580
almost as if they were on the in.
A lot of the audience had seen five or

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,950
10 seconds or shock.
Even though the original shows are

32
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:48,100
pretty simple and predictable,
scooby doo actually adheres to an

33
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:51,910
important principle of good plot twists.
The final payoff always follows the

34
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,280
established logic.
At the beginning of each episode,

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,830
they were trying to scare all the years
off the island.

36
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,580
Then no one would spend the night and
they would keep control of a fortune.

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,670
We get just enough information in the
beginning so that when the twist does

38
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:06,870
happen,
it's satisfying.

39
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,810
Since there was always that looming
feeling that you know who did it,

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,260
creeps and crawls,
they sure picked the right lawyers for

41
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,094
this job.

42
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,820
Can you see me?
Twist has this element missing.

43
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,220
It follows very little established
logic.

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,980
The complete rewriting of the character
from a clumsy FBI agent to accounting

45
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,600
genius means there was really no way to
see this plot twists coming and that's

46
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:29,570
why it's not very satisfying and relies
too heavily on shock.

47
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,810
The Prestige is the perfect balance
between the shock value of the.

48
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:36,350
Now you see me twists and the
predictable but logical twists of Scooby

49
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,700
Doo.
Twenty minutes into the movie,

50
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:40,430
we've technically been told enough to
predict the plot twist,

51
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,730
but Christopher Nolan leaves just enough
information out to make the ending.

52
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,490
An amazing shock that still follows
established logic.

53
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,050
You do the sheen over again,
but we tell the audience a bomb

54
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,840
underneath this table is going to five
limit.

55
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,160
You're looking for the secret,
but you won't volunteer because you're

56
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,300
coke's not really.

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,260
Plot twist is the one that can create
the biggest surprise without ruining the

58
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,270
established logic because at the end of
the day,

59
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:07,410
the twisted,
now you see me,

60
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,800
isn't actually that satisfying.
It's a complete rewrite of his character

61
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:13,440
for a cheap surprise.
It's not particularly interesting to

62
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:16,710
change 100 percent of a character's
personality that has been built up

63
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:19,440
throughout the whole movie,
so how do you do this in a surprising

64
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:21,540
but also entertaining way and primal
fear.

65
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,990
The plot twist is similar,
but with one key difference in the movie

66
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:28,590
and alter boy is accused of murdering
and archbishop and the lawyer gets him

67
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:32,190
off not guilty by reason of insanity,
because the boy test positive for

68
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,340
multiple personality disorder.
The film ends with the final scene

69
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,040
before the altar boy is moved to a
psychiatric hospital.

70
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,930
Here he reveals,
he faked it the whole time.

71
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:44,931
To get a short sentence,
there never was an aaron counselor.

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,290
It may seem like pure shock,
but this ending is actually carefully

73
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,020
woven into the logic of the story
throughout the movie.

74
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:54,930
We're not sure which personality he is
or what he's about to change his

75
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:57,150
identity,
so we've always had this feeling that he

76
00:03:57,151 --> 00:04:00,180
wasn't who he says he was,
but the shock is still fantastic because

77
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:03,450
we go from being on his side to him,
tricking everybody in the story,

78
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,970
including us and switching to an
antagonist.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,100
At the very end.
We got the information,

80
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:11,580
but it's still a surprise and it's what
separates the good plot twists from the

81
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:12,330
bad ones

82
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,950
in order to
provide the audience with a certain

83
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:18,140
amount that had for me.

84
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,121
Come on,
Marty.

85
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:20,280
I thought you had it figured out.

86
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,630
Yeah,
and leave the rest of it to their own

87
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,640
imagining,
but to tell you the truth,

88
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:26,630
I'm glad you figured it.

89
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,260
I have been dying to tell you,
give them just enough to see it coming,

90
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:37,261
but not enough to expect it.
I think the best way to test a good plot

91
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:42,120
twist is if the movie is re watchable
because once you know the twist ending,

92
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:44,470
if the ending is a good one,
then it's just as fun.

93
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,460
If not more fun to go back and see where
they hint at that twist ending.

94
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,840
Totally.
I think that's why the studies shows how

95
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:55,750
spoiling a book before reading it makes
it more enjoyable.

96
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,110
This expense of the ending makes the
path getting there that much more

97
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,680
exciting and maybe that's why lots of
stories spoiled the ending at the very

98
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:03,514
beginning

99
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,020
and me,
I'm the damn

100
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,750
for the charter because as much as it's
about the plot twists,

101
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,860
it's about how you get there,
so feel free to watch something even if

102
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:14,570
you know how it ends,
because who knows?

103
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:15,710
Maybe you'll like it even more.

104
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,400
They bring the dog and come in the
waiting in.

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,320
Thanks for watching.
