1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,590
You are tearing me apart,
Lisa,

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:04,140
when you think of so bad,
it's good.

3
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:08,160
You probably think of some movie with
laughably horrible acting and writing a

4
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:11,250
movie that's so bad.
It becomes really fun to watch you watch

5
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:14,820
it and make fun of it with your friends
because such a bad movie takes itself so

6
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,050
seriously,
so bad.

7
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:18,480
It's good.
Movies go as far back as the b movies of

8
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:21,480
the forties and fifties the concept has
always been the same.

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,360
They're guilty pleasure movies where you
enjoyed the movie because of its

10
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,230
excessive use of movie tropes.
Pour over the top acting and terrible

11
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,650
camera work and it makes sense.
It's not hard to see the similar laugh

12
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:35,280
ability of robot monster in 1953 and
shark NATO.

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,410
The problem is analysis of so bad.
It's good.

14
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:40,290
Usually stops there,
but I think you can go much deeper than

15
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,120
that.
I want to talk about what's at the core

16
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:45,150
of this phenomenon and make the case
that the techniques of so bad,

17
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:47,520
it's good,
are present in tons of critically

18
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,490
acclaimed movies and almost all the time
it's done on purpose.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,450
So let me explain

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,270
Michael.
Walk with me

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,221
so bad.
It's good.

22
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:59,390
Movies are an extreme version of the
idea that audiences enjoy theatrical and

23
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:02,240
over the top movies that's still take
themselves seriously.

24
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,600
This concept is called camp and it's
another tool at the disposal of a

25
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,580
filmmaker.
When you think of campy movies,

26
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:09,710
you may think they're always made
unintentionally,

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,430
like Tommy Wise Owl China film a serious
movie and accidentally creating the

28
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,250
ultimate camp classic.
But that's actually not the case.

29
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,180
Doctors constantly pretend to take their
dumb movie seriously to create a whole

30
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:23,330
new level of entertainment.
But if everybody is earnest and serious

31
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,860
and treating it like it's a,
you know,

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,580
a regular earthquake or it's you know,
an alien invasion,

33
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,510
whatever it is,
yeah.

34
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,210
Then then that sincerity kind of
translate it so then you can go even

35
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:34,670
further with your villain,
which is the shark.

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,860
Naomi do crazy stuff and that makes it
even more funny.

37
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,220
Yeah.
Camp isn't necessarily a genre of

38
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:42,530
movies.
Some movies can have elements of camp

39
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:45,140
without exclusively considering
themselves so bad.

40
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:47,600
It's good.
Maybe the perfect balance of camp and

41
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:50,900
sincerity is the princess bride.
The movie is actually smartly written

42
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:55,140
and well executed while also having a
ton of campy and corny moments is

43
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,130
similar.
This fellow,

44
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,090
I hate Tequila.
You seem decent fan.

45
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,330
I hate to die.
The source site blurs the line between

46
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,300
cartoonish and serious.
The stakes are high and the scene is

47
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,060
expertly choreographed,
but they also do random flips.

48
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,060
Campton makes the princess bride fun to
watch without making it a movie.

49
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,920
People make fun of.
It's over the top,

50
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,920
but never too much so,
and it always treats itself seriously.

51
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,960
Camp can actually sometimes save a
movie.

52
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,840
Johnny Depp's performance turns the
pirates of the Caribbean from a

53
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,740
derivative action flick to a charming
and hilarious franchise and it's because

54
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:27,200
of his can't be exaggerated but grounded
performance.

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,700
You want without doubt the worst pirate
type of

56
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,550
what you have heard of it.

57
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,550
Wes Anderson is a champion of camp.
His set pieces are famously symmetrical

58
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:41,000
to the point of impossibility.
The camera constantly spins from one

59
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,970
character to another.
He loves using outdated cartoonish,

60
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:46,730
special effects.
Any awkwardly cuts conversations at the

61
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:49,400
end of each sentence.
Why do you consider me your enemy?

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,730
Cause your girlfriend's stemming back.
Lefty scissors.

63
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,730
She's my wife now.
Congratulations.

64
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,990
Anderson creates charming and critically
acclaimed films.

65
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,210
Despite breaking countless film
conventions,

66
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,090
can't be film techniques,
give movies that extra flair that makes

67
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,150
them fun and devastating me.
Rewatch Hubble can't be filmmakers

68
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:13,300
strike the balance between the
impossible and the realistic so that

69
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,160
movies have elements of camp while also
having just a hint of seriousness so

70
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,880
they don't seem like they're trying too
hard.

71
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,411
Well,
for me,

72
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:23,560
the Reno Rafe is playing a real person
and making him a real person.

73
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,310
And um,
even though the context is this sort of

74
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,570
invented country in this invented
version of history and so on,

75
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,500
I sorta feel like we just try to make it
as realistic as it can be given,

76
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,100
given what it is.
Okay.

77
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,880
Saturated and campy filmmaking happens
all the time.

78
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,620
So this
becomes this,

79
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,720
this
becomes this

80
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,360
Quintin Tarantino loves camp.
If you have a villain,

81
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,850
make it a school girl and give her a
flail as a weapon.

82
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,270
His love for the theatrical and
exaggerated shows in the fact that in

83
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:09,880
all of his movies,
characters pretend to be somebody,

84
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:10,870
they're not.
Come on,

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,440
get care.
The result is hilariously over the top,

86
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,990
but serious moments of poor or flashy
acting.

87
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,510
I leave it there.
I leave it itchy and either that or we

88
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,350
ever,
Derek

89
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,600
camp is also extremely common in
dialogue.

90
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,900
So many movies have characters say
things nobody says in real life.

91
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,690
This is one doodle that can't be undid
ohms skillet,

92
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,970
but that doesn't make the dialogue bad.
Well,

93
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:34,830
sometimes it does.
I did not hit her.

94
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,600
It's not true.
It's bullshit.

95
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:38,850
I did not have her.
I did not.

96
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,643
Oh,
hi mark.

97
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,160
But it's also a way to make movies fun.
Aaron Sorkin is one of the best

98
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,860
screenwriters in cinema,
and he loves campy dialogue.

99
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,800
In many scenes,
he favors exaggerated dialogue over what

100
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:52,460
someone would actually say.
Yes,

101
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,060
sir.
Punch me in the face.

102
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,020
Go ahead,
Aaron.

103
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:59,160
Sorkin's famous walk and talk style from
West Wing feels extremely theatrical and

104
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:01,290
contrived.
It's been reused to the point that it's

105
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,720
been parodied in just about every TV
Sitcom.

106
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,880
He even parodies at himself.
Walk with me.

107
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,900
Amerisource Sorkin,
his snappy dialogue also gets reused to

108
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:12,210
an amazing degree,
which is you and me talking.

109
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,710
Dana,
I'm not other people.

110
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,780
I'm not other people.
I'm not other paper.

111
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,080
I'm not.
Other people don't talk to me like I'm

112
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,860
other people,
but it's not bad writing.

113
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,550
It actually takes a very talented writer
to create a style that's so easy to

114
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:25,710
parody,
but remains fascinating to watch.

115
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,680
He's not technically original,
but he still keeps it fresh.

116
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,320
We can feel his classic style,
but we don't load it.

117
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,480
We embrace it to a crazy amount.
Actually,

118
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,440
it's almost worshiped to the point where
they make actors recreates sorkin style

119
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:38,274
on talk shows.

120
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,650
Camp is letting movies,
b movies,

121
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,890
and it's a concept we feel everywhere.
Basically whenever a movie does

122
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:49,470
something over the top,
that would never happen in real life,

123
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:51,660
but the movie still executes it.
Sincerely.

124
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,140
Malaise and the room fits quite nicely
into these concepts of exaggerated and

125
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,750
entertaining filmmaking.
What makes the movie stand out is that

126
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,410
it's one of the few campy movies that
took itself completely seriously without

127
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,260
having any idea just how over the top it
was.

128
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,510
It's still camp,
but it's so unique because of how

129
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:15,920
blissfully unaware it is.

130
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,980
Hi doggy.
You're my favorite customer.

131
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,240
Thanks a lot.
Bye.

132
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,350
Brings me to the most important
component of camp camp defies binary

133
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:26,110
thinking in movies because it's both bad
and good.

134
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,780
It objectively breaks many of the
principles of filmmaking,

135
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,720
unrealistic acting,
cheesy dialogue and extreme filming

136
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:33,670
techniques are almost always frowned
upon,

137
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,540
but the crazy thing is camp is not bad.
Sometimes it's actually extremely

138
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,940
entertaining,
perhaps the most entertaining kind of

139
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,900
films that exist because many directors
can be serious and many directors can be

140
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,910
funny,
but not many can be so serious.

141
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:48,280
It's funny,
I embrace camp because movies shouldn't

142
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,230
always play it straight if they don't
want to.

143
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,230
On the contrary camp,
let's movies be what they were meant to

144
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:55,690
be entertaining,
so the next time you watch a movie,

145
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:57,760
don't just consider whether it's good or
bad.

146
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,010
Consider if you like it for it's guilty
pleasures.

147
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,800
Consider that it's so bad,
but that's not a bad thing.

148
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,620
It's actually a great thing.
It's so good that it's bad.

149
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,560
Do you want me to order a pizza or
whatever?

150
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,840
I don't care.
