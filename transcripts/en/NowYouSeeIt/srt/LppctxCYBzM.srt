1
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,120
Have you ever heard somebody say,
I can't watch black and white movies,

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,610
I have a problem with this,
not because some of the most important

3
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:20,460
movies are in black and white,
but because black and white can do just

4
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:22,320
as much,
if not more than color.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,450
The best place to prove this point is
film noir,

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,140
a style of filmmaking that continues to
influence modern cinematography

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,970
everywhere,
including breaking bad,

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,880
but I'm getting ahead of myself.
I want to focus on film the war as a

9
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:35,550
style to make the case for black and
white film making.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,620
The first question is,
what is film noir?

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,710
I actually don't think it requires a
concrete definition because it's

12
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:44,590
something you can feel,
especially in modern parodies by saying,

13
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:49,020
I see what this is going.
Chicago know the conversation that

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,250
predictable.
Only one.

15
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,500
I can tell what you're going to do next.

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,660
Maybe my favorite parody of the style is
Calvin and Hobbes.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,200
Comic Strip can perfectly embodied the
cinematography of film noir,

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,260
the contrast of light and black,
the white trail of cigarette smoke,

19
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,930
the long shadows,
and the dramatic morally ambiguous

20
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,790
narrative,
but let's unpack that to start.

21
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,930
Let's consider black and white on Rob
Snl parodied Casa Blanca recently and

22
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,840
shot in black and white,
rigid.

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,480
They are parenting this.
See notice a difference in the look of

24
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:21,900
each shot in the snl sketch.
The contrast is extremely low.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,110
If I take a sample of the darkest shade
in the shot and compare it to the

26
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,480
lightest shade in the shot,
you see there isn't much difference

27
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,430
between the two.
Compare that difference to the

28
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,430
difference in Casa Blanca.
The darkest shade on screen is nearly

29
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,290
black,
while the brightest shade on screen is

30
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,870
nearly white.
This dynamic range of shading makes for

31
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:40,530
a more interesting shot composition and
it really showcases how black and white

32
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:43,230
can make such an interesting look with
higher contrast.

33
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,170
I know I'm comparing Casa Blanca to a
sketch comedy TV show,

34
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:49,440
but it does show how black and white Kim
look boring and I think a lot of people

35
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:52,140
see black and white this way.
Let's see the beauty of black and white

36
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,840
in an experiment.
Let's take a stock photo in color of a

37
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:57,210
stage picture that's got the film noir
style.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,060
Let's try de Saturating it.
Upping the contrast and adding some

39
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,200
shadow.
Now look at it.

40
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,180
The background is it distracting from
the subject.

41
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,130
The shadows from the blinds are more
pronounced,

42
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:08,340
more focus is placed on her facial
features like lips and eyebrows.

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,360
The simplicity of black and white means
that the I can observe more key features

44
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:13,650
in the shock colors,
great,

45
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,110
but sometimes simple is better in the
age of color.

46
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:19,200
Filmmakers going for that noir feel.
Have two options.

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,540
The first is mimic in our budding color.

48
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,720
Blast the screen with bright,
vibrant colors to give the same level of

49
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:27,270
contrast and aesthetic as black and
white movies,

50
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,080
or do the opposite film in color,
but make the coloring so monochromatic

51
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:34,170
that it almost looks black and white.
You can see this in many gritty movies

52
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:36,960
like seven inbound,
black and white filming emphasizes

53
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,790
contrast,
so it can be used for visual

54
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,190
storytelling.
The classic blind shot shows a character

55
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:44,310
that is literally dark and light.
Lighting is filmed in extremes.

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,050
One side of the character is brightly
lit.

57
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:49,410
The other side is completely black.
They've got a good side and a dark side.

58
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,510
You may not actively acknowledged these
details,

59
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:54,090
but they subtly remind the viewer
through lighting that the character

60
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,850
might have a dark side,
or at least it makes the scene much more

61
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,230
threatening.
Black and white film making gave cinema

62
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:01,810
these techniques.
We still see them in color and they work

63
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:03,790
well,
but black and white has a much stronger

64
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,530
look because of the contrast.

65
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,990
This sequence in breaking bad screams
film noir.

66
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,630
If I make this black and white,
you could even confuse it as an old

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,760
flick.
I'm not saying breaking bad should have

68
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,490
been filmed in black and white,
but what I am saying is that breaking

69
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,800
bad's gorgeous cinematography owes
itself to the techniques that shine the

70
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:21,970
strongest in black and white movies.
Actually breaking bad has filmed noir

71
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,650
lighting everywhere.
The blinds,

72
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,180
the good side,
and the dark side,

73
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,110
high contrast and smoking smoke looks
gorgeous in a black and white movie.

74
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,090
The movie,
the Big Combo shows all the beauty of

75
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,100
black and white in this shot.
Silhouettes,

76
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,680
smoke high contrast.
It looks fantastic.

77
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,160
So if you want to convince somebody that
black and white has merrick,

78
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,770
give them a movie that shows off what
high contrast and low key lighting can

79
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,090
do.
Show them a film noir,

80
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,920
strong lights,
strong blacks,

81
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,020
strong picture.
So Scott,

82
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,380
the thing or the blacks are like,
really?

83
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:51,214
Really,
really

84
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,703
thanks for watching.

85
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,390
Slightly full.
Just a bit of a break from the norm.

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,730
Just to break the monotony of all that.
