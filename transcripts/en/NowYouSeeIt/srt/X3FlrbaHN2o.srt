1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,920
Sure,
pictures they make these days roll into

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,773
TV.
Cut,

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,540
cut,
cut,

4
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,210
cut.
The opening shot of a touch of evil was

5
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:09,810
six and a half minutes long.
Three or four in a way,

6
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:11,650
set up the whole picture of the one
track.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,310
Father was a key grip and what about
absolute beginners?

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,970
That was an extraordinary shocked.
The hell is that I've never heard of it.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,530
Now you see it aren't long.
Takes awesome.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,830
I'm talking about the huge ones,
the masterpieces where all the technical

11
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:28,960
camera work,
special effects and carefully

12
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:32,320
choreographed movement pushes the
boundaries of cinema as an art form and

13
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:33,610
leaves us thinking,
Holy Shit.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,320
If you want to read more about how
awesome they are,

15
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:44,200
I recommend that these three articles or
even these tech.

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,710
How about 25?
What I'm saying is we're all well aware

17
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:49,870
of how long it takes work.
They dazzled,

18
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:52,090
they entertain,
they pushed film to its limits,

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,330
but I want to make a quick video essay
that explores one way long takes might

20
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:58,000
people limited in their storytelling
abilities to start.

21
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,820
Let's hear from someone familiar who
doesn't like long takes.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Don't know why I really dialed in the
stump.

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,390
I can only call it a stunt

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,540
it.
Rope rope was hitchcock's attempt at a

25
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,360
movie taking place in real time in one
long take.

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,840
Originally a play.
Hitchcock kept every action and reaction

27
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:22,530
in the frame and let the camera roll.
Cameras at the time could only film 20

28
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:25,110
minutes per reel,
so we had to hide cuts in between scenes

29
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,270
when he needed to.
What are you worrying about,

30
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:30,150
Philip?
After all the result is something

31
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:31,890
hitchcock didn't think was all that
great.

32
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,070
He comments on what it was missing in a
French interview with the truffaut,

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,530
which explains the French translator in
the background.

34
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,730
When I look back of it was
quite nonsense.

35
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,310
Memorials,
Joe Bosco.

36
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,550
I was breaking all my own simplicity to
of film.

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,800
The Samuel just fill me in on the
cutting of film to tell the story.

38
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,350
A lot of people think the cotton is St
Montage or assembly is taking a man from

39
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,610
one place,
Jordan Adler and jumping into a closeup

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,880
of him which griffith invented.
It's true,

41
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,800
but
to me it goes much deeper.

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,270
So that's what long takes.
Can Miss Editing.

43
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,970
In many ways,
hitchcock was simply filming a play,

44
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,890
but if it was something originally a
play,

45
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:26,620
you can use editing to tell a story and
hitchcock things.

46
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:29,890
Editing is a strong storytelling device
that was missing with his movie.

47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,530
How could rope have used editing to tell
its story?

48
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,230
12,
angry men originally a teleplay and then

49
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:38,230
a stage play also has a limited set and
heavy dialogue,

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,660
but the editing tells us everything.
I'm like rope,

51
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,030
which has no Arabic.
The beginning shots are wide

52
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,370
uncomfortable.
There's actually a six minute long take

53
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:48,580
in the beginning where conversation is
light and everyone looks at ease in the

54
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:51,070
early scenes,
most of the dialogue features multiple

55
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,700
people that takes are relatively long
and shots of single people aren't too

56
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:58,240
close as the movie progresses.
Intense scenes have super close ups of

57
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:02,260
characters and the are much quicker by
allowing the camera to cut quickly from

58
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:05,080
closeup too.
Closeup editing showcases the intensity

59
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,410
of this

60
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,243
seat

61
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,430
guilty not to mention the Erie overhead
lighting,

62
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,530
the performances and the rain in the
background.

63
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,440
The cuts are very important here too
quickly and efficiently.

64
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:27,130
Move from the action to the reaction as
opposed to a long take where the camera

65
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,550
has to either whip around or we see
action and reaction at the same time,

66
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,650
which gives them both equal weight to
the viewer,

67
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,220
but that's not to say filmmakers can't
direct our eyes without using cuts.

68
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,650
On the contrary,
director's guide our eyes with the right

69
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,431
lighting,
camera,

70
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:42,700
movement and frame composition.
The University of Edinburg developed a

71
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:46,720
visual tools that track eye movement so
they can show people a movie clip and

72
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,330
track what they look at in this scene in
there will be blood.

73
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:52,360
The person talking is important to the
viewer according to where they're

74
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,850
looking,
but I movement also shifts when someone

75
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,400
moves to smoke a cigarette or starts
leaving the frame.

76
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,940
There's lots of ways to direct the eye
like what's in focus where everybody is

77
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,850
looking lights and geometry.
You may not notice it consciously,

78
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:05,560
but directors are telling you where to
look,

79
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:09,370
especially in flashy long takes.
The long battle scene in the revenue is

80
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,230
chaos,
but it's directed chaos.

81
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,070
You look from one person to another or
at that specific era whizzing past the

82
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,440
camera,
but according to hitchcock along take,

83
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,010
just can't beat the intensity,
speed and storytelling power of an

84
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:21,844
effective cut.

85
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,150
Copping
five.

86
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,650
It really should be called a hem.

87
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,350
When clips are assembled together
through editing,

88
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,860
they create a new story for the viewer.
If you cut from one clip to another,

89
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,400
your mind associates the clips with each
other and creates the idea.

90
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,830
Of course,
the classic example is the psycho shower

91
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,230
scene,
but it works in a variety of movies in

92
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:48,150
the Godfather.
Coppola cuts from the spiritual

93
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:51,450
cleansing of Michael's son through
baptism to the violent cleansing of

94
00:04:51,451 --> 00:04:53,850
mafia leaders.
One cleanses with holy water.

95
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:54,450
The other one

96
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,283
blood.

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,810
You could write a book on what this
editing choice means in the context of

98
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,820
the film,
but one thing is very clear.

99
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,720
The editing is what establishes this
symbolic connection and a take just

100
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,600
doesn't have the ability to
automatically associate two different

101
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:15,850
ideas in a way as effective as these
edits.

102
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,150
I mean the
film which moved in rapid succession for

103
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,260
the.
I create an idea

104
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,120
I love long takes,
anybody can appreciate them for how

105
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:34,280
beautiful they are,
but they are limited in their

106
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:36,920
storytelling power.
They give us more choices in what to

107
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:40,040
look at compared to cutting from face to
face or object to object.

108
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,350
This has its advantages with more to
look at.

109
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,510
We can be more overwhelmed,
more taking it back,

110
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,150
more amazed,
but a cut forcing us to look at one

111
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:51,200
thing that can be intense and has the
kind of emphasis a big shot doesn't

112
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,150
have.
Sometimes an edit works,

113
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,420
sometimes a long take works.
It just depends on how you look at it.

114
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,231
Of course,
a difference,

115
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,500
how long it takes.
Supposedly we do it in five minutes,

116
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:03,860
so what?
Let's take an hour ballgame doesn't

117
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:05,570
start till 8:00.
If you wish,

118
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:08,240
this video was longer,
you're in luck because all time movies

119
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:12,050
has a great video that focuses on how
directors pull off these intricate long

120
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:14,720
takes and sometimes long takes are
hidden in plain sight.

121
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,110
Watch Tony [inaudible] video on the
Spielberg one or to learn more about

122
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,340
that.
Both these videos are in the

123
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,780
description.
Thanks for watching.
