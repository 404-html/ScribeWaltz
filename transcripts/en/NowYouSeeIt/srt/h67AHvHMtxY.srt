1
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,090
In inglorious bastards,
Quintin Tarantino wrote a funny sequence

2
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:21,240
where a German officer mix up the story
of King Kong with the story of the

3
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:24,420
American slave trade.
Every question he asks has the same

4
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,190
answer for both of their shifts.
Guys,

5
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:27,024
I love you.
Thank you.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,470
Yeah,
it's really cut conflict on show

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,000
finished.
Listen to you guys,

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,000
and
that's what kink concept,

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,130
the German officer and to intern
Terentino's clearly think King Kong is

10
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:44,070
an allegory for the slave trade.
Get the creators of King Kong had

11
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:47,880
repeatedly denied this interpretation of
the movie saying there are no hidden

12
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,680
meanings.
It's just the story to them.

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,590
This disconnect between Creator and
audience brings to light.

14
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,900
One of the most important questions in
film discussion.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,020
Isn't interpretation still valid?
If it's not what the artist intended?

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,510
The answer has broad implications for
analyzing art.

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,690
If meaning is objective than discussion
becomes much more narrow.

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,930
Critics must take the artist's word as
law and only look for meetings that the

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,270
artist consciously intended.
On the other hand,

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,540
if meaning is subjective,
a critic can find any message they want

21
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,880
in a film,
and that means anybody can throw around

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,460
any theory they want.
English teachers can over analyze

23
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,380
curtains,
no matter what the artist says,

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,260
so where's the line?
Let's have a look at how artists talk

25
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,770
about and make their movies to figure
out the best mindset towards analyzing

26
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:28,950
into over analyzing film.
Some directors do clearly state their

27
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,890
intentions for a movie.
In a rare interview from the Cohen

28
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,420
Brothers,
they mentioned that the big Lebowski is

29
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,210
based on the ward detective novels from
the thirties and forties,

30
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:39,090
but with a humorous twist,
it has the main character in over his

31
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,220
head,
a complicated and morally ambiguous

32
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:43,530
narrative and an unreliable supporting
cast,

33
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,450
but instead of smoking cigarettes like
most,

34
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,160
no more heroes,
he smokes marijuana.

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,150
One of the several humorous twists on
the conventional detective stereotypes

36
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,880
for deeper movie ideas.
Many directors create a movie with an

37
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,370
idea in mind,
but not only will directors hide the

38
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:58,620
meaning of their movies,
they may even film the movie

39
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:01,200
deceptively.
In American Psycho Director Mary Heron

40
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:04,380
had William to folk portray his
character in three different ways.

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,500
The first way the character thinks
Patrick Bateman killed Paul Allen.

42
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,590
I just wanted to know if you know
the second he thinks he didn't do it.

43
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,370
People just disappear.
And the third he's unsure to think that

44
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,680
one of his friends killed him for no
reason whatsoever would be too

45
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,310
ridiculous.
Isn't that right?

46
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,370
Patrick here and edited these portrayals
together to have the character

47
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:29,310
constantly switched.
His opinion of Bateman between takes the

48
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,470
choice,
creates a movie full of uncertainty and

49
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:34,680
it adds to the frenzied toxic male
dominance within the movie.

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,650
Ang Lee's do the exact same technique in
brokeback mountain.

51
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,820
I played it as though I knew what was
going on with Jake's character Jack and

52
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:45,360
that he had been cheating on me with men
and I knew about the gay bashing and I

53
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:49,530
also played it as though I had no idea
am I that this is how my husband died

54
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,200
and those takes got merged in the final
film.

55
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,770
So I don't actually know and knows the
truth in his head and it's not important

56
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:58,810
to me because I think the ambiguity is
what is the strength of that scene and

57
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,910
what's heartbreaking about it.

58
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,380
When filmmakers create a movie with
multiple meanings,

59
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:06,190
they tend to keep their intent a secret.
Anyone else have a theory about what it

60
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:08,360
could be?
Use that.

61
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,780
So it's good.
I'm not going to say what it is that's

62
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,713
could.

63
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,220
Oh,
you may not know.

64
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,270
I never talk about themes.
It's a very big shame when something is

65
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:23,150
finished and then people want you to
translate it back into words.

66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,260
It never will work.
It never will go back into words and be

67
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,890
what the film is.
It's like describing a piece of music.

68
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,890
You don't hear the music,
you just see the words.

69
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,700
It's better to let people conjure up
their own ideas.

70
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,010
Having seen an experienced the film.

71
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,430
I mean they want you to say,
I think you know,

72
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,350
this is a story of the duality of
duplicity of governments or something

73
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,660
like that.
And you know,

74
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,410
I hear people try to do it.
Sometimes it's usually is a bullshit or

75
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:54,640
is it work is good.
It's sort of a,

76
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,070
well,
it's usually irrelevant.

77
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,330
Kubrick might be the best director to
look at when discussing over analyzing

78
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:02,480
because his movies are some of the most
analyzed in American cinema.

79
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,650
The documentary room to 37 focuses
entirely on fan theories about the

80
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:08,570
shining.
Some of the ideas suggested in the

81
00:04:08,571 --> 00:04:11,110
documentary are pretty ridiculous.
Like when they cleaned,

82
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:14,960
Kubrick airbrushed his own face into the
clouds as the family drives to the

83
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:17,240
hotel.
After hearing about his intense shooting

84
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,610
schedules and extremely detailed
production design,

85
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,420
fans have seen to build a mythos around
Kubrick believing he put specific

86
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:24,950
meaning into every little thing.

87
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,260
Despite all of this sort of a parker
full stories about me,

88
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,680
almost all of which you're unsure.
You don't have unlimited resources and

89
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:33,610
they do watch the budget and uh,
you know,

90
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,160
you do have to account for what you're
doing.

91
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,170
The stories about cubic largely ignore
how he himself described his shooting

92
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:41,180
process.
He says he actually doesn't always put a

93
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,190
particular meaning in his directing
choices.

94
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,010
I'm pretty good at generalized
statements,

95
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:47,760
but when I'm asked what is this,
but I still can't tell somebody what

96
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,670
Gloria is about.
Iceland as much more of an intuitive

97
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,070
process.
More like what I would imagine writing

98
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:57,970
music is like rather than us sort of
structuring an argument.

99
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,290
This intuitive approach doesn't make
Kubrick's films any less meaningful.

100
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,850
It just means while he's making the
movie,

101
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:05,310
his intent isn't always immediately
obvious to him.

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,030
He instead makes choices that feel right
instead of constantly dealing with

103
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:10,410
hidden meanings.
I never

104
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,440
deal with subutex when I'm writing,
ever,

105
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:13,130
ever,
ever.

106
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,550
I keep it about the text.
I keep it about the scenario because I

107
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:18,410
know there's a lot there but I don't
want to.

108
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,790
I don't want to know it right now.

109
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,740
So where does that leave room for
analysis?

110
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,650
In both cases where directors hide the
meeting and where they don't work with a

111
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:28,100
specific meaning in mind if you can't
know the objective truth,

112
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,690
but that doesn't mean analysis is hope.

113
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,630
Bless the very basic things.
It's especially from Mr. Orange is

114
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:35,100
coming from,
I'm dying and I want to go to the

115
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,650
hospital,
but just in writing those words,

116
00:05:37,651 --> 00:05:42,651
just all this stuff just started pouring
out and that was when I realized it was

117
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,720
a father son.
Story going on

118
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,480
in this interview,
Tarantino reveals a crucial truth about

119
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,730
filmmaking.
He shows us how he subconsciously put a

120
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:52,760
deeper meaning in his movie.
It doesn't matter if directors work with

121
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:55,310
one meaning in mind or work purely on
intuition.

122
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,120
Everybody brings their prior experiences
them in the creative choices they make,

123
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,570
and that doesn't stop at the director.
Every person involved in the process of

124
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,060
filmmaking places their worldview into
the work,

125
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,370
and a good analysis reveals these hidden
meanings.

126
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,720
To me,
it's very obvious.

127
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:11,090
I mean,
of course King Kong is a metaphor for

128
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,760
the slave trade.
I'm not saying the makers of King Kong

129
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:15,260
meant it to be that way,
but that's what.

130
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,290
That's the movie that they made,
whether they meant to make it or not.

131
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,840
This analysis works because it fits with
the time period.

132
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:22,820
The movie was made.
It's not only convincing,

133
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,460
but the analysis also makes the movie
more impactful.

134
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,420
Some interpretation seemed to miss that
analysis should add something meaningful

135
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,670
to the movie.
In this particular interpretation,

136
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:35,510
King Kong shows how white people have.
The 19 thirties may have feared the free

137
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,930
black population in America.
Not only is that interpretation well

138
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,090
supported,
but it also invites the viewer to think

139
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,130
about the movie in a fresh and
interesting way.

140
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,760
Even if it is true that Kubrick
airbrushed his face into the clouds.

141
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,460
How does that add to the movie?
And strangely enough,

142
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:52,550
maybe some stories are better enjoyed
without analysis.

143
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,280
Kubrick once said,
if you submit to a completely logical

144
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,470
and detailed analysis of a supernatural
movie,

145
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,830
it will eventually appear absurd.
The true measure of a great supernatural

146
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,960
thriller he says,
isn't in its hidden meanings,

147
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,670
but in if the audience had a good
freight,

148
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,550
believes the film they were watching and
retain some sense of it.

149
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,610
With brokeback mountain,
the true analysis of Jack's death isn't

150
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,920
what matters.
The fact that Ang Lee leaves the

151
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:16,040
audience uncertain objects.
Fate makes his ending that much more

152
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,470
heartbreaking.
There's no sense of closure for us or

153
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,600
for Ennis.
So maybe the next time you watch the

154
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,900
ending of 2001 a space odyssey,
don't obsess over the details.

155
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,630
Kubrick actually did reveal what he was
going for in that ending

156
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,560
came out because when you
say sound foolish,

157
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,160
whereas if they're dramatize,

158
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,840
I'll link his interpretation in the
description,

159
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,840
but before you click on that,
watch the ending one more time and think

160
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,410
about the emotion it evokes because even
with a particular meaning in mind,

161
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,190
Kubrick built that ending based to not
around his own meaning but around how he

162
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:57,670
wanted it to make you feel.
So when your teacher over analyzes blue

163
00:07:57,671 --> 00:08:00,640
curtains in a story,
the problem isn't that it's not what the

164
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,100
artist meant.
The problem may be that the teacher got

165
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:06,280
so caught up in analysis that they
missed what made the book's so great in

166
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:07,114
the first place.

167
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,583
God,

168
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,480
the big problem with over analyzing film
comes from under researching.

169
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,870
If an analysis is inconsistent with the
rest of the movie or doesn't have a lot

170
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,990
of concrete evidence,
it doesn't hold up well in most areas of

171
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:22,741
film.
Criticism.

172
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:25,380
Education is key to coming up with the
best analysis.

173
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,260
When it comes to actual film production,
the same principles apply.

174
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,560
