1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,270
In 1922 Soviet filmmakers,
Iga bear 12 wrote about his hatred of dw

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:07,420
Griffith and other popular directors at
the time for making movies that he

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,670
called carbon copies of novels in
theater.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,330
The camera is a boring objective.
Spectator watching the action unfolds

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,210
and there must be a plot relate to the
viewer with title cards.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,240
He calls it leprose mortally dangerous
and contagious.

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,160
His response was a man with a movie
camera,

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,860
a documentary that changed the way
people made movies forever.

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,190
The caber becomes a character in the
movie showing us how we pulls off his

10
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:29,560
different shots.
He made strides in slow motion,

11
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:33,040
double exposure and split screens.
He makes his goal very clear in the

12
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,600
title sequence.
No sets,

13
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,950
no actors,
no scripts,

14
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:39,040
no title cards,
only the absolute language of cinema on

15
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,160
the basis of its complete separation
from the language of theater and the

16
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:45,790
novel and it's in this way of thinking
that he used the then experimental Dutch

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,650
angle,
which shows him several times in the

18
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:49,840
movie along with the other camera
innovations.

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,970
And while he was not the first to use
the Dutch angle,

20
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:55,840
he knew exactly how to do it.
The Dutch angle exploded in the 90s and

21
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:59,470
early two thousands appearing just about
everywhere from action movies to soak

22
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:01,840
commercials.
The problem comes from using the shot as

23
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,880
a crutch to make a boring shot.
Interesting.

24
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:07,540
Just tilt the camera.
Battlefield Earth was over 90% Dutch

25
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,850
angles as Roger Ebert put it.
The director,

26
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:12,130
Roger Christian,
has learned from better films that

27
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:16,000
directors sometimes tilt their cameras,
but he has not learned why the tradition

28
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:20,200
goes right up to four in 2011 director
Kenneth Brando says he was going for a

29
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,600
comic book look,
but I think there's more to looking like

30
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:25,120
a comic book than adding Dutch angles to
half the movie.

31
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,150
I also can't help but find it kind of
cheesy when it's used to make the

32
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:30,220
villains crooked,
and that's probably because of where

33
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:31,420
that idea first came from.

34
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,470
The dynamic joe at the school.
What I'm trying to say is these movies

35
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:38,950
don't capture the spirit of the shot.
The most important movie for Dutch

36
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:43,750
angles is arguably the cabinet of Dr
Caligari in 1920 the movie was years

37
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:47,110
ahead of American cinema at the time.
It's incredible use of shadows and

38
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:48,880
light,
angular set pieces and twist.

39
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:51,850
Ending brought expressionism from
literature and paintings to the big

40
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:54,190
screen.
This daring German style quickly found

41
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:57,350
its way into American cinema.
The extreme lighting defined the film

42
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:00,880
noir and the horror elements found their
way into all kinds of blockbusters.

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,020
I had a quad strong German and crunch by
walking up the poop.

44
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:07,580
A is burned it

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,980
fluence goes right up to Tim Burton set
pieces and character design.

46
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,990
He never directly sites German
influence,

47
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:16,740
but there's no doubt his work screams
expressionism and even he mixes in the

48
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:18,900
Dutch angle and his expressionistic
movies.

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,200
I like when you sit to exaggerate the
mundane like losing your bicycle.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,660
The most crucial aspect of the cabinet
of Dr Caligari is the introduction of

51
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:33,690
subjective filmmaking.
This movie was the first twist ending in

52
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:37,830
film history when Francis is actually in
an insane asylum and his experiences are

53
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:39,840
delusions.
The movie presents its world in a

54
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:41,940
subjective way.
What we see is not reality,

55
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,460
but actually the subjective experience
of the narrator.

56
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,860
So all the movie doesn't have explicit
camera tilts.

57
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,430
The tilting of the set and the tilting
of the narrative introduces the idea

58
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,730
that movies can be hyper realistic and
more than filming traditional set

59
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,620
pieces.
Movies can be subjective,

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,680
so really the Dutch angle arises out of
two movements,

61
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,840
the Soviet experimental documentary and
German expressionism.

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,770
One movement introduced the innovative
camera techniques focusing entirely on

63
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:09,010
the cinematic aspects and the other
focused on how the theatrical and

64
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,410
artistic elements could be subjective
and unique.

65
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,460
Maybe the perfect use of the Dutch angle
comes into third man and incredible

66
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,370
Nawar about the black market in post
World War II Vienna,

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,850
the landscape of Vienna is the German
expressionist vision come to life with

68
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,770
its Jari angles and rooms landscape.

69
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,530
You can't help but notice the
similarities in the crooked ruins of

70
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:30,610
Vienna and the bizarre set pieces of the
cabinet of Dr Caligari in the third man,

71
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,630
the camera itself acts as another tilt
in the already crooked world of post

72
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,990
World War II vianna and sometimes the
camera doesn't even need to tell because

73
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:41,890
the street does it by itself within the
frame lines of all sorts of angles.

74
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,380
Add to the angle created from the camera
tilts.

75
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,920
The Dutch angle contributes to the
distortion already on screen giving

76
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:51,520
cinema a way of adding uncertainty that
no other art form can do,

77
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,850
not in theater and not in the novel,
but the crooked angles do more than

78
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,370
enhance the landscape.
During Holly's questioning of each

79
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,930
witness,
the crooked angles make their

80
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,530
confessions feel a bit off and reminds
you never to be quite sure who to

81
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:04,210
believe.
During Harry's monologue,

82
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,660
the ferris wheel tilts while the camera
holds steady creatively integrating

83
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,160
Dutch angles into the shot.

84
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,790
If fits nicely with Harry's personality
as his dialogue quickly switches from

85
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,160
playful justin to threatening murder.
Okay,

86
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,330
so look for a bullet wound up to that
ground.

87
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,410
The crooked vianna landscape,
ambiguous characters,

88
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:24,100
extreme lighting and plot twist,
echo the design of German expressionism

89
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:26,530
in the experimentation of the Soviet
documentary.

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,690
It's a movie begging to have Dutch
angles.

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,350
Many more recent movies used to shot in
similar ways and die hard villain.

92
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:35,860
Hans Gruber pretend he's just a civilian
during his back and forth with John

93
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,110
mcclane,
every shot is at least a little bit

94
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,360
tilted.
This medium shot on Hans is the most

95
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:43,090
tilted in the scene.
His shadow is long and exaggerated.

96
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,580
The camera is off center and the tension
is perfect.

97
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,140
As soon as John mcclane gives them a
gun,

98
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:50,350
the seem feels just like the third man.
The Dutch angle tilt adds to the

99
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:52,960
uncertainty of the moment.
We know something and we're not sure

100
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:56,950
John McLean has any idea and for all we
know he could get killed any second.

101
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,490
Maybe I prefer this reveal over lameness
because it's so obvious in Lima's

102
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:02,860
they're villains.
The Dutch angle feels forced.

103
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,310
The shots seems to fit better in moments
of tension and uncertainty when things

104
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,740
aren't as they should be.
It's no coincidence that a movie with

105
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,530
many great Dutch angles is called
[inaudible].

106
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,540
I liked the way they make you feel.
It's been a bit of controversy about

107
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,630
them as people feel that they call too
much attention to themselves.

108
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,800
But actually,
you know,

109
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,830
I just watch all the movies that are
filled with Dutch angles and you don't

110
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:23,480
realize it because they use them so
much.

111
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:25,130
It doesn't particularly mean anything.

112
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,300
And even all these years later,
the movies with well thought out Dutch

113
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:33,301
angles still have the expressionism then
out in back of the same apartment

114
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:37,720
buildings with these German
expressionistic alleys and they also

115
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,980
have the experimentation

116
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,070
in a producer's came in and said lucky
and I also got to shoot it four square

117
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,530
in case this doesn't work.
Which I certainly couldn't blame them

118
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:50,680
for doing what I ended up liking it very
much.

119
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,300
They even put it in the trailer.

120
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,490
The kind of Dutch angles I enjoy seem to
be the ones that stay true to where the

121
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:58,030
shot came from.
The English shows what makes filmmaking

122
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,440
unique through its emotional
manipulation of a scene.

123
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,340
So when your moment features the classic
unsettling nature of the cabinet of Dr

124
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,840
Caligari,
then it's perfect.

125
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,580
And when you use it just because it
looks cool,

126
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,360
it seems to lose some weight,
but I'm not trying to say that there's

127
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,820
some obvious way to use the Dutch angle.
It's a very emotional shot.

128
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,130
You may enjoy how it feels and movies
that I don't,

129
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
and we're both right or you could say
I'm looking too far into the shot and

130
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:22,700
the Dutch angle is just a way to tilt
the camera to make us seem interesting.

131
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:26,060
But I think if you look more closely,
you can see how the shot means quite a

132
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,040
lot.
The shot in many ways represents the

133
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,550
original intent of directors to use
filmmaking as a unique art form.

134
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,670
That tilting of the camera is the purest
form of subjective filmmaking.

135
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,910
The unease of the Dutch angle makes
cinema special because you can't do it

136
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,830
in theater or the novel,
and when it's used,

137
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,170
it pushes boundaries for what movies are
capable of.

138
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,710
So what I'm saying is the Dutch angle is
a perfect representation of what makes

139
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:47,360
movies better than all that other crap.

140
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,360
If you want to learn more about
cinematography and how to make your own

141
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:59,210
filming looked like a high budget movie,
I recommend this course by

142
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,000
cinematographer Ryan Booth.
He gets in depth about how the

143
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:04,310
professionals like their scenes and
shoot on location.

144
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,240
It's actually rare to have someone so
experience get into such detail online.
