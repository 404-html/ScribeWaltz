1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,420
The Simpsons has some of the most
memorable gags,

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,890
John,
by the most memorable faces.

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,310
Why don't you just go down to moles and
talk to them?

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,680
I bet he'd be willing to share some of
his success.

5
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:26,130
Was he you with the most memorable catch
phrases?

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,840
Merge.
I'm too upset to eat.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,460
Where do you go?
Go to Moe's

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,290
with almost 30 years on television,
the show remains a staple in American

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,270
culture.
So what's the secret that makes the show

10
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:36,880
so legend?

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,540
No.
Hey,

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,083
the secret is bounced.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,383
We did

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,260
the simpsons had a comedic advantage
over every other TV sitcom at the time

15
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,720
because it was animated.
If it could be drawn at the Simpson

16
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:00,090
riders could make the joke,
they could do just about anything.

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,910
And that made for some hilarious gas.

18
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:10,863
No.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,970
Well,
what makes the simpsons so great is that

20
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,180
the creators chose not to do just about
anything,

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,240
does the hardcore rule,
which is,

22
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:19,950
you know,
there's a lot of cartoons that,

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,470
uh,
where the impossible can happen,

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,810
you know,
and you think about a Wiley coyote

25
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:28,380
cartoon where he can literally blow up
and then come back and he's,

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,720
he's black.
And or he's flattened like an accordion

27
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,140
and they were,
it was always made very clear to me that

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,110
this is a real world and it gets
stretched.

29
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,700
Obviously it gets stretched like crazy.

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,950
Why purposefully hold back the cartoon
jokes.

31
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,610
Right.
Okay,

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,140
thank you.
That's the secret behind the Simpson

33
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,280
success.
Certain point,

34
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:49,930
it was like,
this is not a cartoon.

35
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,810
We're making a show that's not a
cartoon.

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,100
It happens to be a cartoon,
but it's not a cartoon.

37
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:59,101
Now we us young ones like the car goofy
cartoon jokes and as silly as we could

38
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:03,010
be,
but the slightly a whiz in the older

39
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:05,500
guys that know the approach it as a
family and it was,

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,660
as you say,
I think it's genius.

41
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,140
It's through the balance between cartoon
gags and realistic portrayals of family

42
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:14,470
life that the simpsons stands out.
This show had the heart and realism of a

43
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:17,170
family Sitcom,
but the humor of a cartoon take homeless

44
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,840
triple bypass surgery.
The episode has hilarious gags that

45
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:22,180
could only be done in an animation show.
Mr. Barnes,

46
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:26,140
I think he's dad
said to him,

47
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:26,974
to his widow,

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,293
eh,

49
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,150
no wait,
he's alive.

50
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,970
Oh good.
Canceled the him dope,

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,630
but the episode is just real enough to
have genuinely emotional moments.

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
Don't worry.
Marge America's health care system is

53
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:45,560
second only to Japan,
Canada,

54
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,480
Sweden,
Great Britain,

55
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,630
well all of Europe.
But you can thank your lucky stars.

56
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,100
We don't live in Paraguay.

57
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,130
It's a perfect

58
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,960
balance between what's real and what's
funny,

59
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,040
what I tried to is my life's work

60
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,710
is to bridge the gap between the,
the,

61
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:06,460
the funny artifice that I saw on tv and
what I knew was real.

62
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,800
And I think that's partly the success of
the simpsons.

63
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,590
The result is a show that's funny,
but also has this connect with the

64
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,390
characters.
What makes homer such a memorable

65
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,370
character is more than just when he's an
idiot.

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,610
The best moments in the simpsons are
when he proves he isn't a caricature and

67
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,770
he's actually a caring husband and
loving father.

68
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,730
Oh my little making.
They may never called you again.

69
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,970
Genki pants shows like family guy and
south park are really good at providing

70
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:33,090
social commentary and funny Gehrig's.
But these shows don't have the heart and

71
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:36,210
realism of the simpsons.
The simpsons has the perfect balance.

72
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,840
So whenever the simpsons has episodes on
a specific topic like politics,

73
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:40,800
marriage,
or religion,

74
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,430
the episodes typically have sincere
lessons along with the edgy jokes and

75
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:47,310
social commentary.
The Simpsons discusses these topics with

76
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,770
the perfect combination of humor and
sincerity.

77
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,400
Other animated cartoons focus more on
telling the most jokes as possible

78
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:57,170
rather than presenting a lesson and
other family sitcoms oftentimes shovel

79
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,090
corny message down your throat.
The Simpsons is right in the middle.

80
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,070
Take the episode.
Bart sells his soul.

81
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,610
The episode is not without its classic
Simpson's humor.

82
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,930
What every religion says there's a soap
bar.

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,950
Why would they lie?
What would they have to gain?

84
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,740
I don't care.
Strobing but in between the jokes is a

85
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:19,330
very interesting commentary on religion.
Bart sells his soul to mail house for $5

86
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,780
and he finds himself empty without it.
Unable to laugh at his pranks that you

87
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,480
usually bring him joy.
The episode actually has extremely

88
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,820
powerful symbolism when Bart without his
soul,

89
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:31,600
his left stranded in an ocean unable to
steer himself in the right direction.

90
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,560
The episode has a great wide shot of
bark protesting against spirituality in

91
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:38,260
the barren church.
With a heavenly light casting down on

92
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:40,960
him from above and an Erie Echo in his
voice.

93
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,630
Listen,
you don't have a soul.

94
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,840
I don't have a soul.
There's no such thing as a soul.

95
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,590
Through his spiritual journey,
he realizes the value of his soul.

96
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:53,730
The episode conveys the message that one
spirituality is not given by some church

97
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,060
or by anyone else.
It's created internally and the simpsons

98
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,370
gives all this philosophical thought in
a cartoon.

99
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,700
I'm not saying that the simpsons is the
funniest most of the matic or most

100
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:05,430
realistic show,
but what I am saying is that it is one

101
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:09,210
of the few shows to bounce each of these
three elements almost perfectly.

102
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,640
Of course,
the glaring unanswered question is what

103
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:15,450
happens just about every Simpson's video
on youtube has a top comment about the

104
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:18,720
shows decline in quality and while
people attribute many factors to the

105
00:05:18,721 --> 00:05:20,910
decline of the simpsons,
like bad show runners,

106
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:23,940
bland storylines,
lacey writing or overused celebrity

107
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:26,580
cameo appearances,
I think the declines could possibly be

108
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:29,190
summed up by saying the simpsons lost
its balance.

109
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,950
A slate magazine review of the show sums
it up nicely.

110
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,310
Episodes that once would have ended with
homer and marge bicycling into the

111
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:39,360
sunset now and with homer blowing a
tranquilizer dart into marches neck.

112
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you.
Even in the new hd opening title

113
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:50,310
sequence,
we can see this subtle change in a show

114
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:52,020
that's more cartoon then reality.

115
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,473
Wow.

116
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,480
The majority of television shows never
maintain the balancing act,

117
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:07,390
the simpsons accomplished.
Although that's not necessarily a bad

118
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,370
thing.
Some shows are mostly to make you laugh

119
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:12,310
or mostly to make you feel,
and that doesn't make them bad shows,

120
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,490
but what makes the Simpson so legendary
is that they were able to have the

121
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:16,600
laughter and the heart.

122
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:22,990
Yeah.
