1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:04,920
Urban dictionary defines a jump scare as
a technique used by unimaginative

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,640
filmmakers as a cheap method of
frightening the audience.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,770
And judging by a lot of comments on my
last video,

4
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:11,570
people tend to agree with this
definition.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,150
I agreed that the jump scare has lost
its former glory,

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,540
not only our movie saturated with them.
I think many filmmakers are using them

7
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,760
completely wrong.
But where I disagree with a lot of

8
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:22,670
people is that I think there's still
hope for the jump scare and people don't

9
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:25,220
give them nearly enough credit for how
amazing they can beat.

10
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:27,560
So let's see what they can do.
And if you can't handle all the jump

11
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,870
scares why you are nothing but a great
big coward,

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,340
you Roy
and its simplest form,

13
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:37,460
a jump scare is a jarring cut,
usually accompanied by a frightening

14
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:38,960
sound.
To illustrate this technique,

15
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,240
let's look at an example that's not from
a horror movie

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,520
shoots
ticket one time.

17
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,483
Okay?

18
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,150
Now what makes this more than a cheap
jump scare?

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,130
What's important is that it not only
scares,

20
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,160
but it outlines a major plot point that
resonates throughout the Lord of the

21
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:07,750
rings trilogy.
With a jump scare.

22
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:11,560
We see how the ring can turn the kind
bilbo into an evil and terrifying

23
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:13,510
creature.
A jump scare was without a doubt the

24
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:15,910
best way to show the terrors of the ring
firsthand.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,150
So now for the rest of their adventure
that jumps gear sticks with us and

26
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:22,210
reminds us how high the stakes are and
how powerful the ring is.

27
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,010
Great.
Think jumps gears are misunderstood,

28
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:27,370
is that they're supposed to do much more
than just give us a simple startle.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,910
A jump scare should add tension to the
rest of the movie by making us distrust

30
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:33,490
any moment where we feel safe after
being startled,

31
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:37,270
once were put on high alert and with
every long pause or dark shadow we

32
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:40,030
experience afterwards,
there's a heightened suspense and

33
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:42,610
alertness because now we question
everything we see.

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,030
This is where many filmmakers use the
jump scare rung when used correctly.

35
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,790
The technique makes the call moments of
the movie scary too.

36
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,570
Places down it can wander in and out of
any panic night

37
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,630
scare should function like real life.
Once he gets scared.

38
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,280
Once you're scared for the rest of the
night,

39
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,270
they're great movies like the witch that
use very subtle and infrequent jump

40
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:06,980
scares.
They aren't scary themselves,

41
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:10,760
but the quick cuts in change in sound
still add to the overall suspense of the

42
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:15,761
movie.
The technique is done wrong when it's

43
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:29,550
used too often and isn't punctuated with
suspiciously calm and suspenseful scenes

44
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,180
like when silent hill revelation makes a
jump scare out of literally everything

45
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,540
including a pop tart.
Actually,

46
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,850
I take it back.
You can use a toaster for an effective

47
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,860
job,
but it's the great buildup that does it

48
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,733
trick.

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,520
Another misunderstanding is that people
don't know what makes a jump scare good.

50
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,040
Take this of the technique from watch
Mojo's video on the top 10 jump scares

51
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,410
of all time.
It's a one two punch of a scary face and

52
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:07,750
a loud noise and that's exactly what
makes it jump scare.

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,060
So effective.
This is a completely wrong way to

54
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,760
analyze jump scares.
The most important part is not the scare

55
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,280
itself.
It's the 30 seconds of buildup before

56
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:18,580
the scare buildup is what separates the
good jump scare from the cheap one.

57
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,500
Here's a simple example from the sixth
sense,

58
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,010
the 10 opens at the top left of the
frame and moves to the bottom right

59
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:27,040
along with the camera.
This framing guides our eyes towards the

60
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,790
bottom right where a jump scare.
Oh wait,

61
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,624
sorry.

62
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,733
Yes.

63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,640
This is a jump scare that doesn't
require a fast cut or even any jarring

64
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:39,730
movement to be scary.
It was the buildup from the slow camera

65
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:42,820
movement that did the trick.
Compare that to the laziest jump scare

66
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,860
of all time,
the bad guys showing up through the

67
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,694
bathroom mirror.

68
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,360
Okay.

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,940
There's no time for the buildup and it's
a huge cliche.

70
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,180
The predictable jump scare scenarios are
giving the whole technique of bad

71
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:56,370
reputation.
The best ones should go against our

72
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:58,260
expectations,
not appeal to them.

73
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,220
This jump scare and insidious feels so
fresh because we unconsciously expected

74
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:05,670
the scared to come from the flashback,
not from where she's telling the story.

75
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,440
Similarly,
with this scene in jaws,

76
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,170
we expected the scariest part to be when
he found the tooth,

77
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:18,270
but there's actually something much
worse waiting.

78
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,910
Okay,

79
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,740
good jump scare.
It's a lot like a magic trick.

80
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,100
It's all about the showmanship.
Let's use the prestige and a jump scare

81
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,560
from the original poltergeist to outline
this idea

82
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:36,670
if magic trick consists of three parts.
First part is called the pledge

83
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,700
competition shows you some old Larry
Bird or Ma Pepsi all shipped to Japan.

84
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,830
Did you say you usually date real?
Yeah.

85
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,273
Nope.

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,080
Coach probably isn't too.
The second age is called the term

87
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,380
magician takes the old shopping.
I might just do salad.

88
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,660
You're looking for the secret,
but you weren't falling because she

89
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:35,540
cooks.
No.

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Want to know.
Look to be full.

91
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,570
Yeah,
but you wouldn't clap yet because making

92
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:54,571
something disappear isn't enough.
You have to bring it back.

93
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,153
That's why

94
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,870
every magic trick I said Third Act.
Oh,

95
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,440
this part,
the part we call press.

96
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,083
Sure.

97
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,310
Let's face it.
Jump scares usually suck,

98
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,680
but don't write them off just yet
because when used,

99
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,510
right,
they're pretty great and don't worry,

100
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,400
I won't end this video with a jump scare
or will I?

101
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,190
Thanks for watching.
