1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,640
I'll be home at six sharp.
If you need anything,

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,080
call.
I mean you can

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,250
love you.
Sweet Mimi.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,260
Mimi call if you need it.
Yeah,

5
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,880
they bought it.
Pardon me?

6
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:33,881
Why I have a strange envelopes.
I you a couple of baboons.

7
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:40,810
What are you looking at
breaking the fourth wall.

8
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:45,630
It's one of the most unique,
the devices at the disposal of a

9
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:47,940
filmmaker.
Most cinematic techniques pull us into a

10
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:49,980
story and make us forget we're watching
a film,

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,720
but breaking the fourth wall does the
opposite.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,050
It reminds us we're actually an audience
member watching what's happening on

13
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:55,690
screen.

14
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,820
I can't believe we're paying.
It's he jumped in.

15
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:00,260
We get on TV for free.
If you,

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,830
me,
everybody in this theater is a giant

17
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:05,050
sucker.
It's your,

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,600
the technique can contribute to the
visual storytelling of the film in many

19
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,640
different ways depending on how it's
presented.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,130
To really understand the power of
breaking the fourth wall,

21
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,890
we have to look at its inception and
theatrical performance.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,050
It's crazy.
Now a formal definition for breaking the

23
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,080
fourth wall would be a dramatic
technique and a work of fiction where

24
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:31,140
characters display an awareness that
they are in such a work.

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,470
You might say every one of us is a
fiddler on the roof.

26
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,560
The technique goes as far back as
ancient Greece and continue to through

27
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,790
Shakespeare time and well into
postmodern.

28
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,310
A theater,
especially in musicals,

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,180
the term first arose after the use of
box sets became popular in the 18

30
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,850
hundreds when sets were constructed with
three walls.

31
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,600
The fourth wall being the imaginary wall
between the audience and the performers

32
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:57,090
on stage.
So whenever a character acknowledged the

33
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,960
audience's presence,
the fourth wall was

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,873
rope.

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,520
The technique has been used since the
silent era and Charlie Chaplin played

36
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:12,250
around extensively with fourth wall
breaks in his films.

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,640
With the introduction of sound and the
popularity of the musical genre,

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,510
fourth wall breaks became more common to
contribute to the spectacle of film.

39
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,600
And over the next 70 years,
fourth wall breaks have made their way

40
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:26,280
into a variety of film genres with a
variety of thematic effects.

41
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,290
Do you all see me all dancing crab?
The most popular use of this technique

42
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,750
is for comedy and the comedy stands out
by creating some of the most memorable

43
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,360
punchlines in cinematic history.

44
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,210
Oh,
do you?

45
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,690
Yeah.
That's funny because I happen to have

46
00:02:40,691 --> 00:02:42,460
mister McLuhan right here,
so,

47
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,870
so yeah,
just let me,

48
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,900
let me,
let me come over here second.

49
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,890
Oh,
I heard what you were saying.

50
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,170
You,
you know nothing at my work.

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,670
You mean my whole fallacy is wrong.
How you ever got to teach a course in

52
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,590
anything is totally amazing.
Boy,

53
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:58,000
if life were only like this,
right,

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,220
there's something really surprising and
hilarious

55
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,860
about reminding us that we're in the
middle of watching a film.

56
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,410
No matter how many times I watch a movie
break the fourth wall,

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,300
the joke can still catch me by surprise.

58
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,030
The joke has to step out of the film to
deliver the punchline,

59
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,280
and there's really no other type of joke
like it.

60
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,000
Every other joke is enclosed within the
imaginary world of the art form.

61
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,310
Taking that step out of a movie is what
makes a good fourth wall joke.

62
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:29,230
So satisfying and creative.
That's where I see things just a little

63
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:33,040
differently contract or no,
I will not bow to any sponsor.

64
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,530
I do want to note that breaking the
fourth wall,

65
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:39,110
it doesn't automatically make you a
comedic genius.

66
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,440
The setup and delivery of a fourth wall
break has to be at least somewhat

67
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:47,441
surprising are the joke can come off as
kind of Lazy Jay and Silent Bob Movie,

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,070
Eh,
I suggest you don't worry about this

69
00:03:55,071 --> 00:04:00,071
sort of thing and just enjoy ourselves.
That goes for you all to yes,

70
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,020
Eh,
what it was.

71
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,120
Now be miles.
I bought

72
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,420
hello,
good evening and welcome to the middle

73
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,030
of the film.
Much better.

74
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,110
You can't talk about breaking the fourth
wall without mentioning Mel Brooks.

75
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,080
He broke the fourth wall in the most
extreme ways possible.

76
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,663
We see the script.

77
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,620
His films go so far as to actually have
the main characters watch themselves

78
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:37,760
within the movie.

79
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,270
What the hell am I looking at?
When does this happen in the movie?

80
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,920
Where all,
what do you want to do now?

81
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,260
Come home.
Let's check out the end of the,

82
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,440
Gee,
I sure hope there's a happy ending.

83
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,060
Well,
his films are funny because of the

84
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:04,790
ridiculousness.
There's definitely some method to his

85
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,080
madness.
I like a blazing saddles uses fourth

86
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:10,370
wall breaks to poke fun at the western
genre as a whole.

87
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,210
It really points out how unrealistic
Hollywood films were in their portrayal

88
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:16,040
of life in the West.
In reality,

89
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,790
western films were nothing but actors in
a studio acting and fake towns and

90
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,460
eventually getting into a car to drive
off the sec.

91
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,150
Blazing Saddles is a not so subtle
reminder that film as an art form has

92
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:30,110
its limitations at portraying reality.
Mel Brooks made a statement by pointing

93
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:32,360
out the lack of realism in the western
films.

94
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,890
Western films of the forties 50s and 60s
almost completely ignore racism,

95
00:05:36,891 --> 00:05:40,940
xenophobia and other ugly parts of the
West and blazing saddles breaks the

96
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:45,230
fourth wall in an insane way to remind
us we're watching a dramatize film.

97
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,470
Not Reality.
Could've thought of another way to get

98
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:50,720
us here.
There we go again.

99
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,010
We're wrong.
Perhaps what makes breaking the fourth

100
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:57,740
wall the most intriguing is that
depending on context,

101
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,160
the act of acknowledging the audience
can actually push us into the film.

102
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,100
Instead of pulling us out.
There's a sort of intimacy to a

103
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,800
character speaking directly to us in
road to Morocco,

104
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:09,740
bing crosby and Bob Hope.
Make lighthearted jokes straight to the

105
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,710
audience and even to remind us that
they're going to end up fine on their

106
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,544
adventure.

107
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,040
Who's we may meet.
We haven't any paramount,

108
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,720
well pro tech does cause we're signed
for five more years.

109
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,610
We know from the casual and inviting
fourth wall break set.

110
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:29,820
This is a movie that doesn't take itself
too seriously and will provide light

111
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:32,550
conservative entertainment.
Fourthwall breaks can be a way to

112
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:36,150
welcome us into this story and this
variation of the technique is definitely

113
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:38,220
indicative of a more casual movie

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,953
morale.

115
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,060
A fourth wall break can make us intimate
with a character as well as with the

116
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:52,930
story.
There's really no stronger way to show a

117
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:55,660
character's motives.
Then by having them look right at us and

118
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:56,494
save them.

119
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,520
I go for 10 I'm probably going to have
to barf up the lung.

120
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,450
I better make this one count.

121
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,500
It's a great way to show us what's going
on in the character's head and is

122
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:08,250
comparable to an aside in feeder.
Frank Underwood addressing us directly

123
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:11,220
is the foundation for so much of the
energy in house of cards.

124
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,110
Good and Donald don't let this get you
down.

125
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:16,140
Why together we're going to do more than
you've been able to do in 25 years.

126
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,840
I left the scenes where he says one
thing to another character and then

127
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:23,070
looks at us and reminds us what he's
really after two things and now

128
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,510
irrelevant.
I don't blythe and Donald Blinds,

129
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,570
new drafts.
Eventually I have to rewrite the bill

130
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:30,450
myself forward.
That is the battle cry.

131
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,150
Leave ideology to the armchair general
was does mean no

132
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,090
final great effect of breaking the
fourth wall is to unsettle.

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,270
There's nothing scarier than feeling
safe and removed from the villain in a

134
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:47,910
movie and then having that villain look
directly at you.

135
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,480
I hope they are watching.

136
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,810
They have c see,
and they'll know and they'll say,

137
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,701
hi,
Shane.

138
00:07:58,701 --> 00:07:59,980
Look,
Nathan Hammons,

139
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,200
decks,
comedy,

140
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,550
satire,
intimacy,

141
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,730
and fear can all be accomplished just
from a look to the camera.

142
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,640
So don't forget the great potential of
fourth wall break can have.

143
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,533
And thanks for what

144
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,140
w.
W what were you doing in here?

145
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:15,340
This is my room.
Get Out,

146
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,830
get out and making the video.
Get Out.

147
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,210
Hello.
What does the guy have to do to get some

148
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:20,170
privacy around here?
