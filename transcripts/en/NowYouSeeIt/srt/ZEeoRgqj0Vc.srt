1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,630
Just the
beginning,

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,890
welcome to now you see what'd be sequels
are impossible to predict,

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,100
some become classics and some become the
most hated movies of all time,

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,550
so what makes us sql good and why do
sequels have such a hard time not

5
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:23,980
sucking?

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,120
Do the same thing as last time.
Everyone's happy.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,930
Let's compare similar sequels to see
what works and what doesn't.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
One of the biggest obstacles with a
great sequel is that you have to do

9
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,610
something new.
Maybe the first movie works great,

10
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:39,060
but the sequel can't be the same thing
or it'll suck the sequels that we all

11
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:40,560
love,
mix it up and surprise us.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,200
The first terminator features Arnold
Schwarzenegger as the villain,

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,660
and he's such a terrifying villain
because he's not even human.

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,750
He's a robotic monster whose only
objective is to kill Sarah Connor.

15
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,030
A lazy,
unsurprising sql would put us in the

16
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,190
same world with the terminator trying to
kill again,

17
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:56,010
but James Cameron surprises us and in a
spectacular twists,

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,310
Arno's is actually sent to protect John
Connor from another more powerful

19
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:00,630
terminator.
Get down

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,990
now.
That's a great sequel and then their

21
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:07,180
speed.
The first speed is about a cop who tries

22
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,760
to rescue civilians from a bus rigged to
explode.

23
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:12,670
If any of the civilians tried to get off
or the bus slows down,

24
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,130
it's action packed and suspenseful from
start to finish.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,470
The sequel speed to has the same general
idea,

26
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,890
but the buses now a luxury cruise ship,
the surprise is amazingly lane.

27
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,390
A slow moving cruise ship is way less
thrilling than the fast moving busing.

28
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,650
The first speed,
the surprise isn't a surprise.

29
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,870
It's a letdown.
Sequels also need to build.

30
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,240
They need to add something and what they
add has to be good.

31
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,390
Twenty two jump street has the same
general plot as 21 jump street.

32
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,300
The only real difference between the two
films is that one takes place in high

33
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,240
school and the other in college,
but the second film as a whole gag about

34
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,660
the movie itself,
they constantly make references to have

35
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,960
doing the same thing over and over again
will not lead to the same results.

36
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,200
Always worse the second time around.

37
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,310
They're making fun of the fact that
sequels never work.

38
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,980
They build on 21 jump street by now.
Making fun of themselves.

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,120
It's clever,
original,

40
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,200
unique and hilarious.

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,790
I can't believe the Korean church back.
Yeah,

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,360
I mean,
good thing there was even hit your

43
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:02,040
abandoned church directly across the
street.

44
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,340
Yes,
it is convenient.

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,830
The hangover part two tries to build on
the original instead of taking place in

46
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:11,200
Las Vegas.
The sequel is in the much more exotic

47
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:13,120
Thailand,
but that's really the only addition to

48
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:14,620
the original.
There's nothing new here.

49
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,633
There's no bill.

50
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,330
Leave this happening.
Again,

51
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,160
an inherent problem with feature length
film is that the amount of possible

52
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:24,070
character development is limited to the
hour and a half length of the movie,

53
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,100
so in a medium like television,
we can see so many complex changes in a

54
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:28,900
character over the course of several
seasons,

55
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,420
whereas a movie can show maybe one or
two major changes,

56
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,420
but the sql though we have a chance to
see characters we love and the original

57
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,760
grow even more.
I think any sequel that doesn't take

58
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:39,850
advantage of this opportunity for more
character growth is a disappointment.

59
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:40,780
Toy Story,
for example,

60
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:44,110
shows us a whole new character arc for
woody and the sql in the first film,

61
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:47,020
what he makes the realization that
getting the most attention isn't what's

62
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:47,650
important.

63
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,900
It doesn't matter how much we have
played with

64
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,110
what matters is that word here for Andy,

65
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,020
he needs us,
and then in the sql what he has another.

66
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,480
That while his time with Andy is
temporary.

67
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,930
He would rather spend his limited time
making andy happy over being displayed

68
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:05,670
in the museum.

69
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,250
You're right prospector.
I can't stop andy from growing up,

70
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,920
but I wouldn't miss it for the world.

71
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,220
Through the sql,
we get further insight into what he.

72
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:15,920
At his dedication to Andy,
we learned more about what his goals,

73
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:19,130
his fears and his obstacles.
The sequel added just as much depth to

74
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:22,430
the main character as the first film,
which in the end is what turns sequels

75
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:24,710
into classics.
We can see this added depth to

76
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:26,930
characters and other great cus like the
Godfather,

77
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:29,690
part two with Michael Corleone and the
Dark Knight with Bruce Wayne.

78
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,060
When we compare these sequels to
something like cars too,

79
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:34,700
and the hobbit franchise,
we see another way movie sequels can

80
00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:38,060
suck cars to doesn't show any change to
the characters from the original,

81
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:41,120
and even with almost eight hours of
screen time for the hobbit series,

82
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,390
we see hardly any character depth in
most of the ensemble cast.

83
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,000
I have to commend to the marvel
cinematic universe for knowing how to

84
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:49,190
make great sequels.
You can tell from their consistent

85
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:53,060
continuity writing style crossovers and
brand marketing that Disney isn't making

86
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:54,920
sequels just for one time cash grabs.

87
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,280
Disney is attempting to make very
longterm profit by creating a lasting

88
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,830
franchise and brand,
and it seems to be working their sql

89
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:02,930
surprise,
build and add character depth.

90
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,390
Think about the avengers.
We get loads of surprises when our

91
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,540
favorite superheros fight it out.
Build on plots from previous films and

92
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,930
we see tons of character depth by seeing
the conflict of interest between each

93
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:13,850
superhero.
I'm not saying marvel movies of the

94
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:16,430
greatest movies of all time,
but what I am saying is that marvel

95
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,380
knows how to make sequels and that's
saying a lot.

96
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:20,540
Given the callus disappointments we've
seen in sequels,

97
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,460
making a good sql to a great original,
it's definitely a challenge,

98
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,340
but I think a big problem with sequels
is that a lot of the time the studio

99
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:32,030
doesn't really care if a sequel as well
reviewed with the successful original as

100
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:35,090
long as sql is okay,
it's almost guaranteed to make a profit

101
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:37,130
for the studio.
Remember that despite all the hate

102
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:39,740
towards sequels,
like cars to the hangover part two and

103
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:42,080
the star wars prequels,
they grossed more than their original

104
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,390
films.
Sequels create an interesting paradox in

105
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:46,040
the film industry.
To be successful,

106
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,960
a film normally has to show some of the
unique,

107
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,000
like great special effects acting or
plot,

108
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,600
but sql can make a profit only by having
a recognizable name and providing

109
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,270
nothing unique.
So do Hollywood a favor and stop going

110
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:57,260
to sequels that suck.

111
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,320
God willing.
We'll all meet again in spaceballs to

112
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,620
for more money.
Thanks for watching.
