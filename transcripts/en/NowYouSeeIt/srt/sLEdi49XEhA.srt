1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,980
Man,
I am sick and tired of being treated

2
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:10,510
like I don't exist you to do whatever
you want to do whenever you want to do

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,280
it.
And I don't complain all the time.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,540
So important about a dinner scene and
why would a director waste their time on

5
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,820
something so simple?
That's what we're going to focus on

6
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:19,110
today.
So welcome tonight.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,910
Don't interrupt me.
We're done a drink.

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,610
I think dinner scenes are some of the
most powerful and revealing scenes in

9
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:41,350
the film.
They always show much more than people

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,640
eating.
They she'll communion.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,160
When I say communion,
I mean an act of sharing and peace

12
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:48,160
between the people at the dinner table.
Directors use the dinner scene to show

13
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:51,470
us relationships between each character,
how they get along or how they don't.

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,820
I got to reply for you,
Andrew.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,640
You think Carlton football's a joke.
Come play with us.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,160
Four words you will never hear from the
NFL,

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,980
but I think even more is going on.
We all know the process of eating a

18
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:03,260
typical dinner you eat,
talk about your day,

19
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,500
make a few jokes and call it a night.
So when a meal goes wrong in a film,

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,830
we especially noticed because we're used
to dinners going a certain way and

21
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,590
that's what gives it dinner scene.
So much potential either for Kuma

22
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,380
or for drama.
I think that's funny,

23
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:31,830
Huh?
I think that's funny.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,070
Let's look at what dinner scenes can
accomplish in three sections.

25
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:37,830
Humans eat the conflict and the
unexpected.

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,840
Whether you're a contract killer or a
demigod,

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,970
you have to eat and that makes you
human.

28
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,950
It was drawing [inaudible].
I know.

29
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:47,784
It's great,
right?

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,240
Showing characters,
eating makes them human like us.

31
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,820
It puts us into their world.
It makes us relate with them.

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,250
We can't relate to stealing.
Diamonds are getting shot,

33
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,620
but we can relate to getting in an
argument at the table.

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,690
Dinner scenes make us empathize with
characters.

35
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,990
Tarantino uses the dinner scene very
well and reservoir dogs and pulp fiction

36
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,080
to pull us into the world of his films.
When these characters who we just saw

37
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:09,570
have a friendly meal,
start getting shot and robbed the

38
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:11,520
restaurant,
it's that much more shocking because we

39
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,550
saw them as who they were people,
people who eat just like we do.

40
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,500
When people come together for dinner.
It's supposed to be a peaceful

41
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,240
communion,
but it doesn't always go that way.

42
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,310
Dinner scenes are perfect ways to show
conflict.

43
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,290
When people storm out,

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,020
Tom,
don't go there.

45
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,380
So my best friend,
okay,

46
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,980
Jesus,
wait dishes,

47
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,340
get left alone.
Not you know,

48
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,280
you'll be doing the dishes alone.
That says a lot about the characters

49
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,280
without having to tell us,
and so a successful meal means just the

50
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:43,690
opposite time.
Time to shove off moby and margie,

51
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,100
let me just simply,
no,

52
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,773
just

53
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,740
dinner doesn't always go smoothly.
It doesn't for us in real life and it

54
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,420
certainly doesn't for the characters in
a movie,

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,580
since we can relate to how awkward and
meal can be,

56
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,450
it can be much funnier when a dinner
scene doesn't go as expected.

57
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,020
I have no idea you could milk a cat.
Oh yeah,

58
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:10,021
you can milk anything with nipples.
I have nipples.

59
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,160
Greg,
could you milk me or it can be that much

60
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:18,161
more dramatic
to go from the familiar dinner scene to

61
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,900
an alien.
Busting out of somebody's chest really

62
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:28,901
adds to the horror
dinner.

63
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:32,960
That's just a dinner would be boring.
A director wouldn't waste to scene with

64
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:35,750
something as simple as people eating if
it wasn't to show something more

65
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,490
important.
That's what I love about film.

66
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,990
A film doesn't have to tell us
something.

67
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,510
It doesn't have to tell us,
this person doesn't get along with this

68
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:43,760
person or this person is human just like
you.

69
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,810
It can just show us,

70
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,000
hey Richard,
good to see you.

71
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,920
Showing rather than telling is what
makes a film go from good to great and

72
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:09,600
at dinner scene can be quite the show
and another thing from now on,

73
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:12,300
we're going to alternate our dinner
music because frankly,

74
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,990
and I don't think I'm alone here,
I'm really tired of this lawrence welk.

75
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:20,991
Shit.
Thanks for watching.
