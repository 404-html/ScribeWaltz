1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,330
In 1993 Steven Spielberg directed
Schindler's list.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,180
The film he considers the most important
of his career.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,970
The movie shows his mastery of visual
imagery.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,570
Perhaps the most famous symbol in this
movie is the little girl in the red coat

5
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:18,780
wandering aimlessly during the
liquidation of the Krakow ghetto.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,080
Spielberg said she symbolizes how
obvious the Holocaust was.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,530
Yet nobody did anything to stop it.
It was always obvious as a little girl

8
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,570
wearing a red coat walking down the
street.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,870
When he talks about the scene,
he mentions the impact of having a color

10
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:32,970
show up in the middle of a black and
white movie,

11
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:35,970
but he doesn't mention the color itself,
which begs the question,

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,320
why does red work so well in this scene?
If all that matters is having color show

13
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:42,570
up in black and white,
the symbolism wouldn't be the same if

14
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:45,600
her coat was blue,
but blue drastically changes the feeling

15
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,520
of the scene as would any other color.

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,830
Each color is packed with its own
symbolism.

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,290
Filmmakers may not know all the nuances
of a colors,

18
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,900
history and meaning,
but they understand each colors

19
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,110
emotional payoff.
So what symbolism is unique to the color

20
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,270
red.
Why do some filmmakers make such

21
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:02,160
pointed?
Careful use of red.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,370
The color definitely has a very unusual
biological effect on humans.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,620
It evokes all sorts of passionate
emotions.

24
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,150
When we feel angry,
embarrassed,

25
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:14,790
or flirtatious,
we literally get red in the face.

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,950
If two boxers of equal skill fight each
other,

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,020
the one in red is actually more likely
to win.

28
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,320
Several studies suggest that it's the
color people look most attractive

29
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:24,480
wearing.
There's even an urban legend that red

30
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:28,560
cars are more likely to get pulled over.
Red stands out amongst other colors,

31
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,200
and filmmakers have always understood
this phenomenon.

32
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,350
The screenwriters of the wizard of Oz
wanted to show off the beauty of

33
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,660
technicolor,
so they had to change the plain silver

34
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:40,320
slippers from the novel the sought after
and powerful slippers did not become

35
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,800
emeralds green or bright yellow.
One color suited them best.

36
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,560
If something is important,
read gets the job done on its own.

37
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,700
We use the color red to indicate
anything in the real world that has been

38
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:57,410
tainted by the other world.
And red is you specifically to connote

39
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,740
really explosively emotional moments and
situations.

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,060
It's no surprise that red is mankind's
original color.

41
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,970
Not only was it the first color used in
art in cave paintings,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,230
but nearly every western language has a
name for it before any other color

43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,470
before Newton's rainbow.
Early philosophers put red in the middle

44
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:19,230
of the color spectrum directly in
between black and white,

45
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,160
so it's no surprise that many filmmakers
have an instinct to place black,

46
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,330
white,
and red together.

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,690
It seems like reducing the color
spectrum exponentially enhances the

48
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:30,390
symbolic weight of these three colors.
Snow White,

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,160
the evil queen,
dressed in black,

50
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,950
the red apple,
but I think to really get at the meaning

51
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:38,520
of such a unique and important color and
why a scene like in Schindler's list

52
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:40,530
would use it.
We have to look at its historical

53
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,050
significance.
The perception of color is not just a

54
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,930
biological phenomenon but a cultural one
and it's symbolic.

55
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,510
Power comes from two objects,
fire and blood,

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,010
two elements always associated with red
and universally encountered by every

57
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:55,200
society throughout history.
Even today,

58
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:58,860
whenever a dictionary defines red,
they typically use fire and blood in

59
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:01,660
their explanation.
The relationship between red and blood

60
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,820
makes sense.
Since all living vertebraes,

61
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,940
half dried blood,
but the association of red with fire is

62
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,210
less clear after all,
fire isn't exactly read but more of an

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,030
orange or yellow.
Why do we culturally link read it with

64
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,700
the color of fire?
Historians argue it's because many

65
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:19,600
ancient societies soft fire as a living
being it's domestication was the

66
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:22,320
symbolic birth of civilization and like
the Sun.

67
00:03:22,321 --> 00:03:24,970
It is a source of life by providing
light and heat.

68
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,900
Blood and fire were always at the center
of early religious traditions.

69
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,680
Animal blood sacrifices were thought to
lead to good harvest and many beliefs.

70
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,400
Fire was passed down from the gods like
when prometheans stolen in Greek

71
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,030
mythology.

72
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,320
A key component of these two elements is
there symbolism of both life and death.

73
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,120
On one hand,
fire keeps you warm,

74
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,580
protects you from predators and lights
up your home,

75
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,880
but once it's out of control,
fire leads to death and destruction.

76
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,130
Similarly,
blood is a source of human life,

77
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,640
but the sight of blood indicates injury
and too much means death.

78
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,630
Christian stories clearly reflect our
ancient contradictory relationships with

79
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:00,250
fire and blood.
On one hand,

80
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,430
God uses fire to communicate with Moses
three burning Bush,

81
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,820
but fire also symbolizes the eternal
tormenting of hell,

82
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,020
explaining why hell is always read.
What does represent Jesus as gruesome

83
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:13,600
crucifixion,
but cardinals reappropriated that

84
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:17,590
meaning it to something positive by
wearing red as a symbol of Jesus's blood

85
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,620
sacrifice.
Red Symbolism varies wildly depending on

86
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:23,470
the time and place,
but it always ties back to these core

87
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,750
elements.
Red is a symbol of love and passion,

88
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:29,950
but it also became a symbol of
prostitution and illicit sex in the

89
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,990
middle ages,
showing the pitfalls of too much passion

90
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:34,330
of getting too close to the flame,
so to speak.

91
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,540
Red was the symbol of the French
revolution and from that on the color

92
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,790
became a sign of extreme political
upheaval.

93
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,920
Oftentimes,
violet always passionate,

94
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:43,510
aggressive,
and filled with life.

95
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,820
The point is,
if a critic looks at read through the

96
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:49,990
Lens of its origins in fire in blood,
then the symbolic power of red becomes

97
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:53,170
much more obvious.
Many movies used red to tap into these

98
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:55,660
powerful historical roots.
Red is heat.

99
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,890
It is a symbol of life and light in an
otherwise desolate and cold world.

100
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,350
It adorns energetic,
youthful characters.

101
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,770
What's Anderson gloves?
It because injects visual life into his

102
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,620
scenes.
Retta often sexualizes female characters

103
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,170
echoing it's association with love and
lust,

104
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,930
but sometimes red goes to,

105
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,760
are you listening to me?
Neil,

106
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,530
what were you looking at?
The woman in the red dress I was with

107
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,373
again,

108
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,400
as much as red indicates life,
it just as easily signals death and

109
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:28,890
horror.
What was one's passion becomes obsession

110
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:32,640
to the point of self destruction.
No color better captures youth and

111
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:36,600
sexuality and the boys have a clockwork
orange represent this sexuality to a

112
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:39,960
dangerous extreme.
Sometimes a red car is just an easy way

113
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:42,630
to indicate speed,
but it sometimes goes deeper than that.

114
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,860
Cameron's dad loves his red car to the
extreme more so than even his own son.

115
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,250
The Carton Boyz in the hood is a
illuming sign of death that appears out

116
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:52,410
of nowhere.
The idea that there is no escape for

117
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,870
these characters gets reinforced in the
opening shot.

118
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,000
An example of red as the color of
warning and danger movies also channeled

119
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,550
the religious significance of the color
in mean streets.

120
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:05,030
Charlie holds his hand over flames in a
form of personal penance,

121
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,070
a nod to his fear of the flames of hell.

122
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,060
It's no coincidence that Tony's Bart is
bathed in red and indication at the

123
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:13,340
place contains sex,
blood and violence.

124
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,110
Uh,
world's Charlie wants to escape.

125
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,770
Perhaps the most powerful use of red is
when filmmakers can juxtapose.

126
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:22,580
It's positive and negative symbolism
showing the two kinds of red side by

127
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,620
side.
The ending of don't look now has a

128
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:28,370
bizarre montage revealing the true
identity of the girl in the red coat.

129
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,910
Part of the horror of the finale is the
contrast of different classic red

130
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,190
images.
That youthful coat followed by his

131
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:37,220
blood,
then sex and even a flames in a church.

132
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
All these images mixed together.
Disorients the viewer through the

133
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:45,161
unusual pairings of Red Schindler's list
perfectly embodies all the symbolic uses

134
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,220
of red.
It's origins in fire and blood.

135
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,670
The religious significance developed
from pagan rituals all the way to

136
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,010
Christianity and the harnessing of the
colors,

137
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:55,844
dual meanings.

138
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,890
The movie begins with the lighting of a
flame.

139
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,250
As a Jewish family celebrates,
the sabbath color fades away when the

140
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,800
fire goes out and the story descends
into Krakow,

141
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,200
Poland during World War II,
right from the beginning,

142
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,680
the film establishes fire as a symbol of
Jewish tradition and to the

143
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:13,520
extinguishing of the flame for shadows,
the end of Jewish life in Poland,

144
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,030
the recurring flames throughout the
movie symbolize both danger and life.

145
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,910
In one scene,
Spielberg super imposes a burning flame

146
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:23,600
on to Oskar Schindler's chests to
symbolize his gradual transformation

147
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:25,970
from a greedy businessman to a
benevolent savior.

148
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,140
The flames of his factory are a source
of life as he saves Jewish people from

149
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,480
extermination.
In contrast to the flames from the

150
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:36,320
pressure of labor camp burn bright and
harsh in the foreground as the Nazis

151
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:40,370
walk into the factory in the background.
A reminder of the death and destruction

152
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:43,550
they bring with them at their most
extreme flames are associated with

153
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,960
horrific mass graves.

154
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,810
But when Schindler invites his Jewish
workers to practice the sabbath,

155
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,900
the flames become color.
Once again in Schindler's factory,

156
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:54,560
the Jewish tradition can continue.
He provides light in a world surrounded

157
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,530
by darkness.
Flames are at the same time a symbol of

158
00:07:57,531 --> 00:08:00,530
the Jewish people surviving and a symbol
of their destruction.

159
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,930
In this movie,
blood and death also go hand in hand

160
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,220
with numerous executions and murders,
but once he uses blood in a more subtle

161
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:10,130
but equally disturbing way,
when the Nazis want to separate the

162
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:12,980
healthy from the sick,
a group of women in the camp apply their

163
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:16,280
own blood as makeup.
They're using blood to try to appear

164
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:18,770
more alive.
It's such a cruel irony that they have

165
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,650
to bleed to look more lively so they can
intern.

166
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:25,010
Avoid a bloody death.
Self harm is a form of self preservation

167
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,570
in comparison to the rest of the movie.

168
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,170
This moment may seem benign,
but it perfectly captures the absurdity

169
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:33,050
of the Holocaust.
How life and death were so disturbingly

170
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:36,230
intertwined.
Blood is death and life all at once.

171
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,140
The red code is an incredible summation
of all these ideas.

172
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,750
On one hand,
the little girl is youth life and

173
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:44,270
innocence.
The red calls attention to her fiery

174
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:47,120
warmth and young blood,
but once she hides under the bed,

175
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,530
her redcoat loses its color and we see
it later in a whole new deadly context.

176
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,100
The code is now presumably red with
blood to be disposed of in Schindler's

177
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:58,290
list,
and the girl in the code are the story

178
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,990
of the color red.
They are a story of death and life

179
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,930
coexisting together.
The red of Oskar Schindler is the bread

180
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:07,380
of life surrounded by his red is the red
of the Holocaust.

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,540
Well,
this is life.

182
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,700
It's margins nice to company.

183
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,250
Not every instance of the color is as
extreme as Schindler's list,

184
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,850
but an overt uses of read the same
symbolic principles apply.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,360
It has a powerful and primal response
for the viewer coming from the human

186
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,840
understanding of blood and fire.
Filmmakers don't necessarily have

187
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:34,780
knowledge of the actual symbolic history
of different colors,

188
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:36,970
but the best ones definitely know how to
use it.

189
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,570
Long before directing artists understood
the strengths of different colors.

190
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,870
If a calvinist painter wanting to give
prominence to someone in their painting,

191
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,530
all they had to do was add a red sash.
Any artist can benefit from knowing the

192
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:50,330
various strengths and weaknesses of each
color.

193
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,930
