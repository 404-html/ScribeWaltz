1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
It opened its wings like this and
hovered above me skinny chicken.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,110
Now you are vampires,

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,020
and it was Peter.

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,250
The vampire is perhaps the most
universally recognizable character in

5
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:21,530
all of cinema.
The most famous interpretation comes

6
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:26,210
largely from Bela Lugosi's Dracula in
1931 where we got the classic accent and

7
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:27,560
widow's peak,
the high collar,

8
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:30,620
and Kate came from the vampire in
theater and the sharp canines were

9
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:34,400
popularized by Christopher Lee's horror
of Dracula known as just Dracula in the

10
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,540
UK in 1958 and it's a combination of
these features that leads us to the

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,730
image of the vampire we're most familiar
with.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,040
It's the vampire that shows up in cereal
boxes,

13
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,050
Geico commercials,
and sesame street

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,270
greetings.
I am the count,

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,580
but in reality,
the design of the vampire varies

16
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:57,240
drastically depending on the movie count
or lock in those Fra to looks like an

17
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:59,610
evil monster.
But Edward Kulin and twilight is

18
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:03,420
basically a perfect version of a human.
Each vampire is actually carefully

19
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,910
engineered to serve a certain purpose in
each movie,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,180
and many scholars have studied the
meaning of different vampires over time.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,570
Hey,
my name's Stanley's to panic.

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,050
I teach at the University of Virginia.
I'm an associate professor currently,

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,620
but I've taught a number of things I've
taught and I'm currently teaching a film

24
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:18,630
course.
Russian film,

25
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,360
Eastern Europe came down,
but my big courses called Dracula live,

26
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,560
it's about vampires and bunch of other
things.

27
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,450
There's been a fair amount of research
on the vampire in academia,

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,080
which makes sense considering Dracula is
the second most popular character in

29
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:32,420
cinematic history behind the only
sherlock holmes.

30
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,600
And that's not including the majority of
vampire films that don't even have a

31
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:38,780
dracula ASCII character.
One of the reasons why the vampire is so

32
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,990
popular amongst filmmakers is its
versatility as a creature.

33
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,170
Since the beginning of the vampire
onscreen directors have always made

34
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,080
creative changes to their vampires to
suit their particular movie.

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,580
For example,
the vampire,

36
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,160
it's called con aural lab,
not contracting and original.

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,920
And it comes from the Dutch,
which means war,

38
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,810
you know?
So obviously there's some connection

39
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:58,410
there with,
with war and the laws that,

40
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:58,781
you know,
Mike,

41
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:01,100
in particular,
young men for Germany during World War

42
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:03,830
One and the rest of our team.
So wars obvious there.

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,060
Um,
yeah.

44
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:08,420
And it's also clear assemble like
foreign intervention or a fear of name

45
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:11,450
of grants,
a Jewish immigration maybe or Jewish

46
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:15,140
influence and we know be unfortunate
finishing the bat and then you had this

47
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:17,120
thing that,
especially in that case,

48
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:20,570
which is a human leg,
but it's like it's so foul looking and

49
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:24,560
it spreads disease that then it really
reiterates the negative connotations

50
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,520
about being Jewish.

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,130
Much of the design of Count Orlok is
antisemetic.

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,370
He has many features also present in
Jewish characatures including the

53
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:33,650
association between Jewish people and
rats.

54
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,340
The filmmakers changed or exaggerated
some designs of the original Dracula to

55
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:40,310
make the creature more relevant to the
fears of post World War One.

56
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:40,760
Germany

57
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,190
in particular,
they changed the location because it

58
00:02:43,191 --> 00:02:46,160
based and Dracula,
they've changed it from Transylvania for

59
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:47,960
London,
Transylvania to Germany.

60
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,730
Right.
So obviously they're making connections

61
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:51,790
to their own college and things that it
represent that.

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,970
Yeah.
In that case,

63
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:55,370
you know,
it's something to be feared because when

64
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,750
it's representing is something that
certain people,

65
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:58,584
when you've been like

66
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,190
in filmmakers always

67
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,470
customize,
they're vampires to represent something

68
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,660
different.
[inaudible] was a way to symbolize

69
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,780
German fears at the time that largely
included antisemitism.

70
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,200
But the vampire can do much more than
that since vampires aren't technically

71
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,770
human directors have historically used
them to show behavior that would be too

72
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,500
weird or controversial if it were done
by actual humans.

73
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,650
In the 1930s,
homosexuality was essentially banned on

74
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:24,400
the big screen in America by a series of
moral guidelines called the hays code.

75
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,410
But the vampire found a way to work
around that.

76
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:30,340
Starting With Dracula in 1931 vampires
quickly switched from disgusting

77
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,460
monsters of Count Oarlock to sex symbols
like Bela Lugosi,

78
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,790
showing just how easily the vampire can
change and how the vampire can mean

79
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:41,791
something sexual.
Some of the images that we have in

80
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:45,590
western culture of things that are
horrific are also basically sexual.

81
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,380
Basically,
vampirism is just sex from the neck up.

82
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,580
You're penetrating a passive person.
Um,

83
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,030
it's just,
it really is a very sexual sort of

84
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:56,864
monster.

85
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,540
Throughout the filming of Dracula's
daughter in 1936,

86
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:03,530
universal pictures was well aware of the
lesbian implications of a female vampire

87
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:05,840
gazing at and biting a partially nude
woman.

88
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,170
They changed the script to make lily
clothed and had the camera cut away,

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,350
but either with these changes,
the homosexuality is pretty obvious.

90
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,800
The vampire allowed a depiction of
lesbian ism decades before humans could

91
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,120
do it themselves,
even though it isn't explicit ends.

92
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,140
Oleska is also interested in guys in the
film with Vampires.

93
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:25,010
Controversial topics are much easier to
discuss when you compare movies about

94
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:27,200
the same topic that came out around the
same time.

95
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,710
Vampires offer enough removal from
actual humans that they can go much

96
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:33,910
further with the topic.
Philadelphia is about a homosexual suing

97
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:37,280
a company for wrongly terminating him
because he has aids as the first

98
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:40,040
mainstream big budget movie focusing on
a homosexual.

99
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,550
The movie approaches the subject very
carefully and Tribeca is written very

100
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,620
sympathetically,
always nice in the camera,

101
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:49,130
shows it nearly every scene gives us a
shot from his perspective with closeups

102
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,950
and we even get home footage to show how
ordinary he is.

103
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,200
In contrast,
the bad guys are films speaking almost

104
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:57,920
exclusively in racist and homophobic
slurs often shot from far away,

105
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,400
often shot from behind back.
It doesn't express his sexuality much.

106
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,640
He never kisses his partner and the ones
scenes showing two men sharing a bed

107
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,770
together was cut for the theatrical
release.

108
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,760
In many ways it has to water down so
many aspects of homosexuality to show it

109
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:14,760
as completely normal.
You survived what I assumed to be your

110
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:17,570
first gay party and tech.
Now I'm not trying to say that

111
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:20,300
Philadelphia should have pushed more
boundaries because then it might not

112
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:22,070
have done well during the time that it
came out.

113
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,370
What I am saying is a vampire movie
could do much more interview with the

114
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:28,730
vampire came out one year later and
there's an incredible difference in how

115
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:31,370
far it goes in portraying homosexuality
on screen.

116
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,640
It seemed goes farther.
Yeah.

117
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,310
Yeah.
It shows you like you know where they

118
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:36,500
almost kiss and stuff and gets really,
really,

119
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,690
you know,
sexually tans in a number of scenes.

120
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,820
So for example,
near of Yam,

121
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,210
whenever I'm on,
just so you know,

122
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,300
with Louie and that our gallery and
Louie draws him really close.

123
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:44,871
I mean,
they're like,

124
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:48,920
you know that it's clicks and then let's
start and the way he's connected to

125
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:50,930
Louie and then they get this daughter or
you know,

126
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:53,390
I mean it's representing two gay guys.
So they've essentially,

127
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:56,420
and talking about a child in the back of
nearly 90 it's like I can remember that

128
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:59,150
being a controversy this guys,
but they liked it.

129
00:05:59,151 --> 00:05:59,920
Right.
And again,

130
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,230
it's,
it makes us like August to vampires

131
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:02,631
though,
right?

132
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,700
You know,
it's,

133
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,410
it's,
it's like right there but not officially

134
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,010
saying it.
Yeah.

135
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,380
When it's pampers,
you can hide your meaning in a symbol.

136
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,200
Then the movie can have more nuanced
characters in discussions.

137
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,530
The movie doesn't need to have to give
us any lectures about homosexuality.

138
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,840
Like Philadelphia does interview with
the vampire marks,

139
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,350
the first piece of work with a first
person perspective of the vampire and it

140
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:24,320
focuses more on the relationship between
vampires over time.

141
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,200
Not to mention the bitey scenes are
extremely erotic,

142
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,200
more erotic than a movie like
Philadelphia was capable of doing with

143
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,790
real people.
But maybe my favorite example of using a

144
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:36,230
vampire to be ahead of the times,
his death dream originally titled dead

145
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,450
of Night,
a lesser known movie about a soldier who

146
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:41,830
dies in Vietnam and returns home as a
creature like a vampire.

147
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,440
The director cleverly uses the vampire
to show what it was like for a veteran

148
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:48,230
to return home after combat as a totally
different person,

149
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,940
a shadow of their former self,

150
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,520
like Zombie,
like looking corpse thing that is like

151
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:56,910
near Dad and many before he looks in the
home will be boise sunglasses.

152
00:06:56,911 --> 00:07:00,750
How many acts weird out in public and
his way of responding is very dead.

153
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,440
Like whenever his ex girlfriend or the
girl I used to days talking to me now

154
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,140
that's at one particular scene.
It's really telling where she says,

155
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:08,230
you know,
I hope you're not,

156
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,600
you're not mad or anything,

157
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,003
says

158
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,600
Ronnie,
which is a really dead response as if

159
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,201
you suck,
you know,

160
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:21,460
sort of symbolizing that plight of the
Vietnam vet who's like emotionally dead

161
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,780
as he fights his friends and family.
His actions directly mere how Vietnam

162
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:28,110
veterans were rejected by society and
the media when they came back from war.

163
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,680
It's a powerful message and the director
created a berry humanlike but

164
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:34,500
emotionally stunted kind of vampire to
show his message.

165
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,420
It's not much different from a movie
like Rambo,

166
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,080
but with a vampire death dream came out
eight years before Rambo and just one

167
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:42,270
year after the Vietnam War.
In many ways,

168
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:44,190
the vampire movies are ahead of the
Times.

169
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,890
The vampire was also ahead of its time
in race relations.

170
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,400
The first black horror movie was Black
Ula and it was a box office hit in the

171
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:52,590
movie.
Dracula strips prince mom Waldy of his

172
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:54,690
power when he tries to abolish the slave
trade,

173
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,780
cursing him as a vampire.
The movie becomes a quest for black ula

174
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:01,200
to regain his power and identity.
Any partially does so by fighting off

175
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:03,390
white policemen attacking a black
community.

176
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,500
Here we see a movie in 1972 already
showing the issues of racial profiling

177
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,810
in the fantasy of black Americans to
fight back,

178
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,220
making it way ahead of its time.

179
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,730
The thing that makes that film boundary
breaking right is that you're getting

180
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:15,870
vampire,
but he likes it.

181
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,760
Right?
Saint Catherine White people watching

182
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:20,430
that and then they identify with what's
going on with number Waldo and how that

183
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:22,050
relates to racial relations.
Right.

184
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,730
Whereas if you showed,
you know,

185
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,773
bunch of,
you know,

186
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,280
African Americans and packing the
police,

187
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,750
then you met,
you're probably gonna have some white

188
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:28,201
people.
It'd be like,

189
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:30,050
I don't like that.
Same thing happens today whenever the

190
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,190
black lives matter.
Talking about police intervention in

191
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:33,180
black communities,
stuff like that,

192
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:36,150
that when you got to have an empire and
they're sort of bridges that gap and

193
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:37,590
brings people together in a different
way.

194
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,550
And so the modern vampire carries all
these past iterations of the vampire

195
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:43,710
with it.
This may seem silly to even talk about,

196
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:47,490
but even a kid show on Disney channel
uses the symbol of vampires to talk

197
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:48,600
about human issues.

198
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,850
I mean,
it's obvious right there what that shows

199
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:02,730
is doing.
It's basically symbolizing a different

200
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:05,700
culture or a different race.
They were character.

201
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:09,390
That's fun so that kids can understand
it better.

202
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,840
No,
I've always thought they were the

203
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,530
greatest metaphor for the outsider in
all of us.

204
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:16,980
I felt like an outsider growing up.
I miss fed.

205
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,100
I think a lot of people did or do it
sometime in their life feel like

206
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:24,190
outsiders,
outkast and the vampire is a great way

207
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:25,380
to talk about that.
He's,

208
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:29,980
he's a larger than life,
mythic hero who is looks human and can

209
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:33,130
talk to you like a human being,
but it's actually a monster and he's

210
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:36,310
immortal.
He's outside of life and I think that's

211
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,960
a great metaphor for human beings.

212
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,370
The show has episodes where neighbors
come to terms with the odd van

213
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,330
stereotypes this family follows.
Using a vampire makes it simple for kids

214
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,460
to understand,
and it's not controversial.

215
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,000
It would be a little trickier to address
black or Asian stereotypes to a little

216
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:54,360
kid in a TV series,
but if fake creature is a lot easier,

217
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,480
it's actually a great example of why
more complicated ideas like

218
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:00,450
homosexuality,
race relations in the effects of war or

219
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:03,420
more easily discussed using a vampire
instead of a human.

220
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,730
I'll go for one more example.
That's a bit out there.

221
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,850
Why did twilight do so well?
It's definitely not the writing.

222
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,910
The book copies a very common storyline
in tons of female,

223
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,820
young adult literature.
A story of an attractive bad boy with a

224
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:17,070
bad background who is dangerous in some
way,

225
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,280
whether it's from drugs or abuse,
and he meets a girl who changes him.

226
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,450
Typically it's through some very average
girl that he becomes a better pair of

227
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:25,920
Stan because of law,
right?

228
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:28,890
And that's the idea that love,
we can change the world and there's this

229
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:31,890
guy out there that's going to pick me,
right?

230
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:35,250
And no one else notices me and this
guy's going to pick me and he's totally

231
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,410
awesome,
but I'm the one that's going to lead to

232
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:40,170
that totally awesome because he's going
to be on me.

233
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,840
Twilight follows this storyline
extremely closely,

234
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:46,380
as have dozens of novels before it,
but making the bad boy of empire is

235
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:49,320
actually kind of creative.
That creature is perfect for that

236
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,880
fantasy.
They're usually attractive,

237
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:54,060
at least in some modern movies.
They don't age and they can't be killed,

238
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,250
but at the same time,
vampires are dangerous.

239
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,140
They could hurt you in.
They're extremely strong.

240
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,720
There's that famous scene whenever
they're about the case and he jumps back

241
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:04,410
because he's afraid of going too far
because he could end up harming,

242
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:05,230
harsh and see us,
you know,

243
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,890
even vague.
So that danger that he represents is

244
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:11,310
this bad boy image.
It's not really his fault so to speak,

245
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,290
which is what makes him a little more
sellable to because he just needs to be

246
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,470
like find the right human being.

247
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,400
So that movie and novel craft of Vampire
that works as a bad boy and young girls

248
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:24,100
identify with the girl.
It's a fantasy for young girls that's

249
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,950
always been around.
But the vampire gives it a new spin and

250
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:30,400
allows the fantasy to be explored a
little deeper because at the end of the

251
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,230
day,
the bad boy fantasy isn't real.

252
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,560
That's not how real life works.
So using a fake creature instead of a

253
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,690
human,
let's you go further with the fantasy

254
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,560
just like you can with other complicated
issues as a great sum up of Vampires

255
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:42,610
over time,
the company,

256
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:45,940
what we do in the shadows helps us
understand the power of the vampire as a

257
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:48,520
symbol overall.
The van in the movie are all from

258
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,350
different time periods and to
influences.

259
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,310
Peter's Terrifying Monster Portrayal
Echoes Count Oarlock in Nosferatu

260
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,710
Flautas lavs teams influenced by
Vladislav in Dracula,

261
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,900
Si,
Si,

262
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,700
and nick has similarities to Edward from
twilight even admitting it himself,

263
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,780
they'll maybe twilight if you say no,
I'm the main guy,

264
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:14,614
twilight

265
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,070
mockumentary.
We follow around these vampires in their

266
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:20,790
everyday lives and in a weird way,
the format and style actually teaches us

267
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,650
a lot about vampires in media.

268
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,540
We get documentaries when we think about
it.

269
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,110
It's worthy of a documentary,
so I'll make it about a serious good

270
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,540
product and therefore you'll learn about
the nature of the product by studying

271
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,630
the series.
This film,

272
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,360
it is really doing something quite
special.

273
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:37,310
It's saying you can learn just as much
by studying something lousy.

274
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,140
When you're a vampire you become very
sexy.

275
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,340
This movie shows us what it would really
be like if vampire's existed.

276
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,380
It wouldn't be epic like and all these
other movies.

277
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,380
It would actually be ridiculous.
They would have to find a place to live.

278
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:52,110
They would have to clean their flat and
biting someone wouldn't always be

279
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:54,870
dramatic and theatrical.
Sometimes it would just be silly.

280
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,080
What we do in the shadows shows how
every other vampire movie artificially

281
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:01,680
creates a vampire to suit their own
meaning by showing us every vampire in

282
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,030
film history,
in one movie,

283
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,010
we realize just how different they all
are,

284
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,770
and it's true.
Some vampires look disgusting to show

285
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:11,610
fears of disease and antisemitism summer
basically perfect versions of humans,

286
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,760
and there's everything in between.
And the traits of the vampire always

287
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:15,530
means something.

288
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,060
It represents not really human problems
in a way that makes it accessible

289
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,210
because it's fine.
I vampires are fun and it makes it

290
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:25,600
indirect so that it's kind of save it
and discuss it.

291
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:26,870
You now,
when you're talking about a band pie

292
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,320
that symbolizes racial identity and of
talking about those issues in a direct

293
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:30,650
way

294
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,020
and that little bit of distance from
actual human floods,

295
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,780
the vampire really pushed boundaries and
be ahead of its time.

296
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,580
So the next time you watch a vampire
movie,

297
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:41,030
maybe you can see a powerful message
based on what they do or don't do.

298
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,480
Vampires don't do dishes,
and maybe you'll learn about vampires in

299
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:47,210
a new and different way,
which is what these videos are supposed

300
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:48,044
to be all about.

301
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,170
Oh,
I bet like this the better.

302
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:51,100
Because students like his stuff more and
you know it's,

303
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:53,230
it's it,
it encapsulates more information to

304
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,330
share now stays and so it's where things
are going,

305
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,310
but it's in academia just doesn't want
to shift.

306
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,550
Yeah,
it's starting to,

307
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,640
but it really needs to,
you know?

308
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,230
Yeah.
Okay.

309
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,600
One of the most important novels for the
vampire is I am legend.

310
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,360
The original book has the first
scientific vampire,

311
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,480
one that's not supernatural,
but caused by an actual disease.

312
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,490
It's a big influence for night of the
living dead.

313
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,500
A movie that paves the way for the
modern Zombie.

314
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,540
So yes,
that means the zombies we see today

315
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,930
partially originate from vampires.
You can listen to this book today using

316
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:23,090
audible,
and I really recommend you check it out.

317
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,110
The original book is so much better than
