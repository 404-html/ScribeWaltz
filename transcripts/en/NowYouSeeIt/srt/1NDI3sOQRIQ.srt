00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,070
Welcome to now you see it when
characters drought in movies,

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,100
they're gone forever,
but more than just the character leaves.

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,310
They always take something with them.
Maybe they take away fear,

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,520
a friendship,
trust in others or a desire to go

5
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:27,620
somewhere new,
but what happens when a character starts

6
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:30,320
drowning and survives?
She's not gone forever,

7
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,900
but instead he's alive,
but he isn't just alive.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,650
He's alive all over again.
He supposed to be dead when he rises up

9
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:37,670
again,
key changes,

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,640
but change isn't the right word.
It's more violent than change.

11
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,743
He's reborn.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,833
Oh

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,363
Wow.

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,890
Let's look at drowning more symbolically
in the truman show.

15
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,200
Truman lives on an island,
caged from reality.

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,260
He's been conditioned to fear the
outside world after the drowning of his

17
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:06,520
father.
Finally,

18
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:10,270
he sails out of his world and confronts
the next nearly drowning in the process.

19
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:13,420
It's the same pattern we see in baptism,
death and rebirth.

20
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:16,240
Through the medium of water,
Truman goes and still scared of the

21
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:19,210
outside world and comes out ready.
He died and was born again.

22
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,770
In any drowning scene,
we see symbolic rebirth,

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,140
which originates from the Judeo
Christian sacrament of baptism.

24
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,900
A new believer is taking completely
underwater,

25
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,920
dies out of his old self in his report
and in his identity as a follower of

26
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:33,754
Christ.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,000
The preacher done,
washed away all my sins and

28
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:44,320
transmission.
It's a straight now from here on out and

29
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:46,260
have an everlasting my.

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,630
What are you talking about?
We got bigger fish to fry using water as

31
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:53,150
death and rebirth.
Imagery has been used for centuries in

32
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:55,070
literature,
but it has since found its way into

33
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,720
film.
Every drowning experience has a

34
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:00,700
different meaning based on the context.
Whoever causes you to nearly drown is

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,100
the symbolic enemy and whoever saves you
is your symbolic saved.

36
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,220
This includes drowning yourself,
am saving yourself,

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,350
and if you're unable to say someone
else,

38
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,340
that represents losing a part of
yourself.

39
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,100
If that person was close to you,
baptism,

40
00:02:13,101 --> 00:02:15,140
imagery is not restricted to violent
drowning.

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,670
We can see the same death and rebirth
more subtly in say a shower seat or a

42
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:23,330
sewage drain followed by a torrential
downpour while not as a parent.

43
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:26,480
Any scene where a character gets
cleansed with water can represent a

44
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,660
death and rebirth for the character.
The shower scene in psycho has baptism.

45
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,170
Imagery actress Janet Leigh said in her
book on the film,

46
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,120
Marion had decided to go back to
Phoenix,

47
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,330
come clean and take the consequence.
So when she stepped into the bathtub,

48
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,210
it was as if she were stepping into the
baptismal waters.

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,480
The spray beating down on her was
purifying the corruption from her mind,

50
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,090
purging the evil from her soul.
She was a virgin again,

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,260
tranquil at peace in the shower.
She's causing herself of her since in

52
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:53,600
her attempt,
though she gets murdered and fails in

53
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:56,300
her baptism.
Countless films use water as a way of

54
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,670
showing a deep internal change for a
character.

55
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,210
So someone goes under water,
whether they're hiding,

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,690
feeling trapped,
getting super powers are falling out of

57
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:07,950
an exploding plane.
Remember that getting dunked underwater

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,840
represents a part of them dying and
another part being reborn,

59
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,440
or maybe it's just a way to get a kiss
from Wendy peppercorn.
