1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,490
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,720
You ain't heard nothing yet.
You ain't heard nothing.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,370
You want it.
This moment in the jazz singer in 1928

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:13,740
led to standing ovations in movie
theaters.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,040
The first moment of dialogue marked at
the beginning of a boom in the motion

6
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:22,041
picture industry improving sales from
1928 to 1929 despite the beginning of

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,533
the Great Depression.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,953
Okay.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,000
Warner brothers surged and profits from
2 million to 14 million a year as

10
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,450
millions flock to these talkies,
which for the first few years consisted

11
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,450
mostly of musicals.
Talking provided a layer of realism

12
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:41,270
missing and movies by allowing more
character development and plot

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,450
innovation in radio and television
writing paved the way for strong

14
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:47,450
dialogue driven movies.
12 angry men is written in such a way

15
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:50,000
that you can follow the entire story
with your eyes closed.

16
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,040
Oh can to chalk and told even when it's
an open and shut case like this one

17
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:55,520
image of the innocent which drug about
no.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,220
Well I guess their own title,

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,250
Nick tensity and pace.
That's impossible for a completely

20
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:03,070
silent movie to achieve.
I want to talk about dialogue and look

21
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:06,160
at how dialogue enhances the story while
also seeing its limitations.

22
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,880
Probably the biggest immediate benefit
of dialogue is it's just so damn

23
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:11,700
efficient.

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,810
Hello,
are you captain with me?

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,520
Whatever you're doing in Arizona,
I'm joining Richard Lord Vick.

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,010
He's there with his truth.
The lock narrowed and accurate with

27
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,990
Mallory,
he's been I to have to drive far right.

28
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:25,110
That's the next top of the stage coach.
You'll be with your husband in a few

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,190
hours

30
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,440
from 10 seconds of dialogue.
We know who lucy is,

31
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:29,720
where she is,
where she's going and why she's going

32
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:30,860
there,
what her husband does,

33
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,620
where her husband is,
where the stage coach stops next and how

34
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,720
long it should take until the couple is
reunited.

35
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,020
Dialogue is quick and easy,
but exposition through dialogue runs the

36
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:42,290
risk of being boring like when we have
to sit through a villain monologuing his

37
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,260
evil plan through a computer.
I think voiceover narration can be a

38
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:48,200
lazy substitute for strong,
efficient dialogue on screen,

39
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,180
although sometimes there is no other way
to do it.

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,460
There are right and wrong ways to do
exposition dialogue.

41
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,870
Let's say a character,
his parents died.

42
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,400
Shit dialogue.
Tell us like this.

43
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,630
Oh,
well mama good.

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,880
I don't know.
They're,

45
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,490
they're gone.
They died when I was three.

46
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:03,140
Remember?
Or like this,

47
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,430
uh,

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,353
leave it.
Both

49
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,460
mom would allow it.
Expositions should be descriptive and

50
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:21,520
also not completely plain.
It's the difference between saying

51
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:24,520
something and revealing something.
I call it the dead parent test for

52
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:27,820
dialog because so many movies seem to
have trouble telling us a parent isn't

53
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:30,040
around anymore.
My mother's name was Susan.

54
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,830
She was killed in a car accident with my
father and they're both dead.

55
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,940
So stop trying to bring up dialogue.
Should reveal a character isn't in the

56
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:38,740
picture.
Instead of just saying it out loud,

57
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,360
it doesn't always have to be through
dialogue

58
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,830
and it can even be comedic.
Oh.

59
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:56,700
And she inexplicably mails me a cactus
every Valentine's Day and I'm like,

60
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,320
thanks to heat,
coyote ugly.

61
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,180
This cactus Graham stinks.
Even worse than your abandonment,

62
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,460
but it just has to reveal something
instead of saying it,

63
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,310
it passes the dead parent test if it's
not completely dry.

64
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,740
Because frankly just saying is lazy
writing.

65
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:08,950
Yeah.

66
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,040
And with the number of lifeboats times
the capacity you mentioned,

67
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,310
forgive me,
but it seems that there are not enough

68
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,270
for everyone on board.

69
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,640
I think the same idea goes for dialogue
that explores the movie's made sure

70
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,590
ideas.
Interstellar is a gorgeous movie,

71
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:24,320
but this dialogue is very heavy handed
and just being set

72
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,090
is the one thing we're capable of
perceiving that transcends dimensions of

73
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:34,091
time and space.
Maybe we should trust that even if we

74
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:36,170
can't understand it yet,

75
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,140
maybe it's better to have themes hidden
and more ordinary dialogue

76
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,240
and fuck the Air Force Academy.
If I want to fly,

77
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,530
I'll find a way to fly

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,920
or revealing the teams through visuals.
Dialogue always serves a narrative or

79
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:52,080
comedic purpose.
No matter how random it feels,

80
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,270
impulse fiction,
the dialogue feels meaningless,

81
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,550
but it sets up major plot points and
conflict.

82
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,520
Vinson and jewel's have a 10 minute
conversation about whether or not it's

83
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:01,410
cheating for a man to give a woman a
foot rub

84
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,570
and look,
I can even a million ladies and then

85
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:05,940
your foot massages and they all meant
something.

86
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,220
Or we act like they don't,
but they do.

87
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,540
I mean,
it's just so fucking cool.

88
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:13,290
That is a centralist thing going on
where where you know you don't talk

89
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,610
about it,
but you know what?

90
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:16,530
She knows it.
Fuck Marcella.

91
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,440
Snoop and Antwan should've fucking
better known better

92
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,200
this conversation while at the surface,
very casual reinforces that Marcellus

93
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,980
walls is not to be trifled with as
Vincent spends his night with Mrs.

94
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,660
Wallace,
that earlier conversation reminds us

95
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:31,600
that the stakes are high and Vincent May
or may not be overstepping his

96
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,434
boundaries.

97
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,770
Well Dan,
you're going to shit.

98
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,260
Good night.
I've had a very lovely

99
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,540
walk out the door and get in the car,
go home,

100
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,500
jerk off and I saw you going to do

101
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,930
Tarantino uses dialogue to show
character flaws.

102
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,711
Jolson,
Vincent,

103
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:48,980
get a Great Cup of coffee and praise it
in an attempt to be polite to Jimmy.

104
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,890
All it does is make him mad cause jewels
and Vincent are not focused on the

105
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,920
crisis they just created.
But you know what's on my mind right

106
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,440
now.
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

107
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,400
It's the dead nigger in my garage.
Their signature swab and charming

108
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,290
dialogue failed them.
But Winston Wolfe,

109
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,840
he knows the appropriate way to respond
because he's the wolf.

110
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,820
Terentino's dialogue has masterfully
layer.

111
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,730
They may be talking about nothing,
but in actuality the dialogue

112
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:20,100
foreshadows the major conflicts in the
rest of the movie.

113
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,640
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

114
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't listen to anybody that says
dialogue is bad and visuals are always

115
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,800
better in film.
It's just false.

116
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,170
Dialogue is beautiful,
revealing at hilarious.

117
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,600
Just know when to use it.
I am the Walrus.

118
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,030
Shut the fuck up.
Donnie,

119
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,380
the island and bladder Murry Elliot
Joliet off the fuck is he talking about?

120
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,030
If you like this topic,
you should check out channel Creswell's

121
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,840
video on the same idea.
He talks about dialogue with even more

122
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:51,580
depth than I did.
Also a big thanks to all my patrion

123
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,300
supporters and follow me at my
ridiculous twitter handle.

124
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:56,610
Swag thug for life.
Thanks for watching.
