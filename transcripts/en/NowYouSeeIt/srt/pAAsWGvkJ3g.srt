00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,880
Many years ago,
the great British explorer,

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:07,380
George Mallory,
who was to die on Mt.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,600
Everest was asked,
why did he want to climb it?

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,440
You said,
because it is their whole spaces date

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,760
and we're going to climb it,
and the moon and the planets are they

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,170
new hopes for knowledge and piece of
data and therefore as

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,900
we have gone on the most as it is in
danger,

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,380
greatest adventure,
which man has ever inbox

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,613
I to know.

10
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,400
Look at this time.
Don't

11
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,940
just remember those kings will always be
there to guide you.

12
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,893
Okay?

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,600
There's a team lean in the spine that
capturing the voice of think sensation

14
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,990
as if a distant memory of forming of a
great height.

15
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,510
We know you're approaching the brand of
this business.

16
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,610
Oh,
books.

17
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,770
Stories written before space travel,
but about space cop.

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,640
Could there have been stories about
space travel before the writers,

19
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,130
Chris said made it up.
What does she do

20
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,910
you
want?

21
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,280
What do you want?
You want the moon?

22
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,540
Just say the word and I'll pull it down.
Hey,

23
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,480
that's pretty good idea.
I'll give you the bull,

24
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,570
right?

25
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,760
Oh Man.
