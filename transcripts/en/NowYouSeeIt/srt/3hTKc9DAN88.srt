1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,970
Suppose there is such a place,
there must be.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,850
It's not a place you could get to buy a
boat or a train

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,500
far.
Far Away.

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Wizard.
I take one more step.

5
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,590
It will be the farthest away from home.
We

6
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,490
do.
I do not get

7
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,280
open the pod bay doors.
I'm afraid I can't.

8
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Why don't you take my.
Of course I will.

9
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,243
What's

10
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,970
very well.
Oh,

11
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,570
I'll try.
Really?

12
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,150
I will.
