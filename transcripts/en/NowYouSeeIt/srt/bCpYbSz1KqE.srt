1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,600
Welcome to now you see it
brought forth in art form,

2
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,540
centered around seeing motion on the
screen,

3
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,340
but film is far more than only visual
music plays a huge role in that

4
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:37,750
heightened realism of what the fuck that
means.

5
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,260
Different film scores can completely
alter the mood of a scene and filmmakers

6
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,120
carefully pick their soundtracks or film
scores to convey certain emotions or

7
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:52,980
ideas.
I want to look at the psychology of

8
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:55,350
music,
how our brains respond to different

9
00:00:55,351 --> 00:01:00,351
auditory stimulation in movies
to talk about music in a film,

10
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:03,160
I should distinguish between a
soundtrack and a score.

11
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,730
A film score is written specifically for
what's happening on a screen while the

12
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:10,450
soundtrack contained songs independent
from the movie itself that weren't made

13
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:13,600
only for the movie.
Most films have both and one example is

14
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:15,970
forest gump,
which has a soundtrack of songs not

15
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:20,971
solely associated with the movie
and a film score with music written

16
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,430
specifically and only for that
to really understand the importance of

17
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:34,090
the music in a film,
you should compare final cuts of movies

18
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:37,810
with the intended film score and cuts
with removed or edited music.

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,320
The famous psycho shower scene is so
much less frightening without a score.

20
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,010
My favorite example to show the
importance of music in a film is the

21
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:02,590
altering of this scene in the pirates of
the Caribbean,

22
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,020
depending on the music,
the seem to become triumphant,

23
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:10,050
creepy or comical.
Using music to psychologically altruist

24
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:01,870
scene has been around the silent era.
Silent movies used to be accompanied

25
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,660
with a live piano player who would play
along with the movie.

26
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,000
At first,
the music didn't interact with the movie

27
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,670
at all and was only there to avoid
silence in the theater,

28
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,940
but later piano players would either
improvise a lot with the movie or

29
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,790
receive sheet music to play.
Along with the psychology of the

30
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,470
accompaniment was pretty
straightforward.

31
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,530
When the screen shows a villain,
the piano player plays a diminished

32
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:23,050
minor chord,
which sounds Erie and unnerving.

33
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:40,230
Heroes get uplifting anthems.
Chase scenes have a fast tempo

34
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,550
and sad scenes are slow and
early.

35
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:07,090
Psychological musical techniques set the
standard for film scores in modern

36
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:08,830
cinema,
and while the orchestras have gotten

37
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,340
bigger and the score is more effective,
the general ideas of silent film,

38
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:14,260
piano,
a company might have remained the same.

39
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,610
The shower scene in psycho is a perfect
example of the psychology of music in

40
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:48,480
film.
In the scene,

41
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,490
Mary Crane gets stabbed to death in the
shower,

42
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,580
and the scene features one of the most
effective film scores in history.

43
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,660
This screeching sound of the violin
mimic sounds we biologically associate

44
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:00,450
with stress and danger.
The sound mimics cry for help.

45
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,560
A study by the University of California
in 2010 found that nonlinear alarm

46
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:07,770
sounds give us an emotional response
that instinctively unsettles us

47
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:09,330
psychologically,
Bernard Herman,

48
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:12,840
that composer of psycho purposefully
constructed the film score to mimic

49
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:16,800
these unsettling noises and the effect
makes the scene significantly scarier

50
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:17,700
and more unsettling.

51
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,553
Right?

52
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,960
In Jaws,
we hear the music before we see any

53
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:30,961
danger.
This technique unsettles us in a

54
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,680
different way.
The anticipation of the danger is what

55
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:40,650
makes each scene so scary.
The fact that we know something bad is

56
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:43,020
about to happen and the characters in
the movie don't know,

57
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,960
add suspense to the scene.
We are warned of the danger through the

58
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:49,650
film score and have no choice but to
watch the horror unfold as the music

59
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:51,900
slowly speeds up,
so does the camera and we feel

60
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:55,620
psychological terror from the disorder
of the music and the anticipation of the

61
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,454
inevitable.

62
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,430
The majority of film scores,
though purposefully stay in the

63
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:06,100
background and only provide subtle cues
to the audience.

64
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,360
Film score pioneer Aaron Copland gave
five ways a score serves the screen and

65
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:13,750
most of them stay in the background.
The first is to create a more convincing

66
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,160
atmosphere of time.
Place.

67
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,670
This one is pretty self explanatory.
Many genres and settings have their own

68
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,850
style of music to go with.
The style of the film score puts us into

69
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:25,330
a particular setting or genre.
A classic example would be the Western,

70
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,900
which has a very distinct sound,
so when bill and Ted go back in time to

71
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:31,090
the west,
the music changes along with them.

72
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,070
How's it going on Western?

73
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,710
Just like friends

74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,020
cheerla.
Yeah.

75
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,510
Second music can underline psychological
refinements,

76
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,140
unspoken thoughts or unseen,
dangerous get shown or reinforced

77
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:48,270
through the music.
We may not see the danger,

78
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:51,440
but the music reminds us.
It's their traced.

79
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,180
The call is coming from inside though

80
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,180
to cut and edit any muggins you just.

81
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,640
That's weird.
Yesterday I went food shopping for like

82
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,890
15 minutes.
I used a computer before I went to the

83
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:12,230
store and when I came back,
my history,

84
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,990
it was gone.
The cash was cleared and the cookies had

85
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:15,824
been reset.

86
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,760
Third is to build a sense of continuity.
It's the music between shots or scenes

87
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,010
is the same.
We relate those scenes to each other.

88
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,030
This includes montages or flashbacks.

89
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,483
Excellent

90
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,640
citizen king uses musical cues as an
indicator of a flashback.

91
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,780
He was with Mr Kane and me the first day
Mr Kane took over the choir

92
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,230
in.
Catch me if you can.

93
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:06,231
The music is acute that the chase is on.
Fourth is to give a sense of finality,

94
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,010
copland's notes that this takes place
usually at the end of the film or after

95
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,450
some major trial.
The triumph that sound of the music

96
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:29,850
psychologically links us to the triumph
on screen,

97
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,220
and finally Coplin says,
sometimes music is just there to fill

98
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,540
the silence.
Interestingly,

99
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,510
he states that this is the hardest films
court to do because the audience

100
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:08,340
shouldn't notice it.
Holiday that recognizes that May 21st

101
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,110
other mother's Day.
Thank you.

102
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,030
Thanks.

103
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,740
In a clockwork orange,
Kubrick has uplifting orchestra music

104
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:31,570
play while extreme acts of violence
occur on screen,

105
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,980
the contradiction between comfort and
classical music and destruction that

106
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:39,981
adds tension and to
scores enhance the emotion of a scene,

107
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,680
but sometimes directors choose to not
use any music in this can work just as

108
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,450
well.
In no country for old men,

109
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,320
the vast majority of the movie has no
music but mostly dialogue in ambient

110
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:57,470
noise and it totally works.
Hearing nothing but a man's struggle for

111
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:02,471
his life is pretty menacing.
The storming of the beach scene and

112
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:09,580
saving private Ryan overwhelms the
senses with the sounds of gunshots.

113
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,260
Explosions and cries for help

114
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,410
instead of a film score.

115
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,130
Our brains often subconsciously react
differently to a visual given the music

116
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,260
playing behind it.
I think it's really interesting because

117
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:36,640
of how subtle film scores can be and yet
how vital they are to a movie.

118
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,700
The psychology of music is one of the
most important cinematic techniques and

119
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,450
fill the emotional infomatic potential
of these techniques is limitless,

120
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,390
and I've only scratched the surface.
So take your favorite film,

121
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,000
watch it again,
and pay close attention to the music and

122
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:55,700
how it enhanced the film.
Maybe without you even noticing.

123
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,160
How does that sound?
Thanks for watching.

124
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,240
I love the books that I recommended,
even if he didn't.

125
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,110
