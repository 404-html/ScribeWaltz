1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,250
Let me start by saying there is no
greatest movie of all time.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,070
The question is just too difficult to
really answer,

3
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:18,800
but I still think it's the most
important question in cinema.

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,340
What makes a movie great?
There are a number of concrete aspects

5
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:25,430
of a movie that turned them from good
movies to movies with the legacy.

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,180
The first is cinematic influence.
How did the movie changed the way movies

7
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:31,550
are made?
If you read anything about citizen Kane,

8
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:34,820
you'll realize that it's probably the
most innovative movie of all time and

9
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:37,070
that's a big reason why a tops every all
time.

10
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:41,240
Movie List Citizen Kane highlights a
very clear distinction between two areas

11
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,790
of filmmaking,
especially in it's cinematography.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,430
Silent films were very economical with
their editing.

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,700
They either showed their actors on a
simple two dimensional plane or used

14
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:53,060
montage cuts to quickly associate one
idea with another,

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,490
and one sound was introduced in the late
19 twenties.

16
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:58,820
The first instinct for many directors
was just filming dialogue,

17
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:00,830
shot,
reverse shot with shallow focus,

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,693
and it was boring.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,970
Here's your price
on it,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
or a steven from the hands of the lady
who was a blackout on today.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,830
That's my quote.
I've lost results,

22
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:13,410
our guy,

23
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,310
but Orson Welles and Gregg toland
changed the game in 1941 by bringing

24
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,160
back traditional theatrical staging onto
the screen.

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,970
The use of deep focus camera allowed
characters to be staged in interesting

26
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:27,660
and revealing way.
You are the sole owner showing power

27
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:29,550
dynamics,
transitions of power,

28
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:32,640
complex visual storytelling,
and giving the viewer active

29
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:35,790
participation in the seed,
allowing the viewer to choose what to

30
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,980
look at.
Instead of having a close up force you

31
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:41,310
to watch one character at a time.
Wells and tollens weren't the first to

32
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:44,130
use this technique,
but they executed it so effectively that

33
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:45,420
they started a movement.
Yeah.

34
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,250
Iconic,
deep focused and sharp lighting.

35
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:50,070
A film noir,
movies all influenced from citizen Kane,

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,933
not to mention,
well,

37
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,280
his use of sound to transition from one
scene to another,

38
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,320
which is basically in every single movie
now,

39
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,530
not to mention the makeup which had
never been done so extensively.

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Not to mention it's extensive use of
flashback and unreliable narration,

41
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,770
which had only been done majorly in
literature.

42
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,200
Once you think about it,
there's no question of its greatness.

43
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,440
Great movies change things.
Star wars ended a streak of dreary and

44
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,570
sophisticated movies in the 19
seventies.

45
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,080
The Blair witch project changed the
horror genre for good and it looks like

46
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,020
deadpool's going to change the game when
it comes to marketing a movie and we'll

47
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:21,930
probably see a lot more r rated comedies
in the future because of it.

48
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,360
If a movie changed what other filmmakers
we're doing,

49
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,100
it's got to be at least a little bit.
Great.

50
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,650
The second measure of greatness is the
cultural impact.

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,660
How did the movie change the actual
world?

52
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:32,700
It was made it not just the world of
cinema,

53
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,010
like when jaws made beach attendance
plummet,

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,370
or when fight club made an actual fight
club spring up around the US.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,440
Personally,
I think if the movie fight club inspired

56
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,810
you to start your own fight club,
then you're totally misreading the

57
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,760
movie,
but that's a topic for another time.

58
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,590
All I'm saying is movies aren't in a
bubble.

59
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,190
Movies can make laws get enacted,
they can spread awareness on a massive

60
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,160
scale to billions of people.
The ones that catch the attention of

61
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:55,830
enough people are great,
even if it's just bringing back folk

62
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:59,070
music
was

63
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,150
the third and final way is personal
impact.

64
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,210
It's the way that movie changes you.
I think this is the most overlooked

65
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,430
aspect of a great movie because it's
hard to measure,

66
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,430
but I've always been a big believer that
movies can tell us more about how to

67
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:16,510
live our lives than the real world does.
I think Juno explores abortion in a more

68
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:21,220
accessible way than any abortion
pamphlet or any talk show host and she

69
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:21,941
was like,
oh,

70
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,710
hi,
babies have fingernails,

71
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,890
fingernails,
and I think that ability to tap into

72
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:29,680
reality through a story makes a movie
one of the greats,

73
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,630
and it's the underlying beauty of
cinema.

74
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,890
A movie doesn't have to change cinema
forever and it doesn't have to change

75
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:42,170
the world forever,
but if it changes you forever,

76
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:44,570
it's got to be pretty great.
I know this video is going more

77
00:03:44,571 --> 00:03:47,240
sentimental than usual,
but greatness is hard to discuss

78
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:49,580
otherwise.
There's certainly measurable cinematic

79
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:52,280
techniques to judge for greatness,
but at the end of the day,

80
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,200
it's the way movies touched us
personally.

81
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,720
That makes them great.
People pick different movies as their

82
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:58,550
favorite because at that point in their
life,

83
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,910
that was the movie they needed to watch
to help them out or just to astound them

84
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:03,980
the most.
It could be as simple as a movie that

85
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:06,620
makes you laugh a lot.
I find that if I really liked the movie,

86
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,490
I think about it constantly after I'd
seen it 500 days of summer really helped

87
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:13,760
me with a bad relationship because it
felt like the movie was talking about me

88
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,640
and explaining everything I was
currently feeling so perfectly.

89
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,060
So how about this and normally terrible
at keeping up with social media,

90
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:26,540
but tweet about your favorite movie to
my twitter at swag thug for life and

91
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,240
I'll respond to it.
Let's talk about great movies and while

92
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:31,700
I did start by saying there is no
greatest movie of all time.

93
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,290
It's definitely the princess bride
pack,

94
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,780
which Tammy,
thanks for watching.
