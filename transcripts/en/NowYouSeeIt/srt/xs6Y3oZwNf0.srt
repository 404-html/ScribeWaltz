1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,070
How are you feeling now?
Fun Back at work.

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:12,570
What line of work are you in?
Waste Management.

3
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,404
Consultant

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,750
gangster is deeply ingrained in American
cinema.

5
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,930
The gun slinging bad asses of the
criminal underworld have had enormous

6
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,300
success since their inception in the
silent era,

7
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,330
but how is it that the American gangster
I character still violent,

8
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:46,940
profane and cruel.
It's so glorified on the big screen.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,540
I want to explore a cycle analytic
approach to this question and see how

10
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:54,500
the American gangster embodies and nate
and universal human desires.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,440
Let's start with a simple question.
Who was the original gangster?

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,780
Where did this larger than life persona
come from?

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,850
With this question,
you run into problems.

14
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,630
I personally consider Rico Band Delo in
Little Caesar to be the first true

15
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,440
gangster,
one of the first talking gangsters.

16
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,770
He's also the first to have the iconic
accent,

17
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,860
indistinct speech role.
Now very familiar with

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,380
massage.
A shirt my way out of it,

19
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:16,860
like a joke for the Naga afterwards.

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,080
The promise that he isn't really a
gangster.

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,100
He's actually inspired to become a
gangster from a newspaper article about

22
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,740
Pete Montana to try to enter the
gangster world.

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,230
He's a copycat.
The very first gangster film is the

24
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:30,990
musketeers of pig alley,
and the name of the film originates from

25
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,230
a newspaper article about the shooting
of a gambler on quote,

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,400
New York's other side.
Perhaps the actual original depiction of

27
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:42,060
gangsters was in a collection of
photographs of the slums by Jacob Reese

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,730
with the famous photo bandits roost in
1890.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,920
The problem with the gangsters genre
begins here.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,130
This photo is staged,
constructed the shot to have its

31
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:53,160
trademark level of fear and fascination
that we know and love today,

32
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:56,970
and gangsters and the influence of this
picture on the gangsters genre is seen

33
00:01:56,971 --> 00:02:00,270
up and into the 21st century.
This brings me to my first point.

34
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,600
There is no original gangster.
Pretty much every gangster we know and

35
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,320
love is a copycat.
Michael Corleone,

36
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,240
military uniform and original distaste
for gang life borrows straight from Mike

37
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:12,450
powers in the public enemy,
and this shot in pulp fiction eludes

38
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:15,960
directly to the Godfather.
Tommy's erratic behavior in Goodfellas,

39
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,350
echoes cody Jarret in white heat.
Scarface is a remake,

40
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,590
and even the modern hood gangster
doesn't completely depart from

41
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:25,110
conventional gangsters.
They kept me in the hospital a week or

42
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,300
so.
I mostly stayed up thinking about my

43
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,010
cousin watching old games,

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,270
the movies,
some identification.

45
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,910
How about Miami?
This guy,

46
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,150
and of course the sopranos is famous for
referencing multiple gangster movies in

47
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:42,280
pretty much every episode.
Shimmy up a

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
what?
I thought I was out

49
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,220
separate buckets.
Every iconic gangster movie is in some

50
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:58,290
way copycat to make up.
What was your conversation with yourself

51
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,950
about how the violence should be?
I confess that I was very impressed with

52
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,450
Arthur pens,
a Bonnie and Clyde and thought about

53
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,170
that when watching sonny corleone get
shot without a doubt,

54
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:18,970
and I thought that the effects
of violence and money,

55
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,060
I'd always had an imaginative
and I'd like to think a good fellas

56
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,880
comes out of the tradition of something
as extreme

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,720
as the roaring twenties in scarface.
What's important to note here is that

58
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:36,880
every gangster borrowed something from
older gangsters,

59
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,970
and if you go back far enough,
the gangster isn't based in reality at

60
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:41,530
all.
There's only the artificially

61
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,890
constructed idea of the gangster.
This is a key point in understanding

62
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,340
American obsession with the gangster.
We're not actually obsessed with being

63
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,250
the leader of the criminal underworld.
We're obsessed with what being a

64
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,830
gangster represents.
Now we have to go back to the question

65
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,690
at hand.
What does it gangster represent and why

66
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:58,450
do we like them so much?
What does the gangster even if you think

67
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,580
it's just money or women than you're
wrong,

68
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,480
forgetting all about the money and
everything.

69
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,810
The best thing is we can find out what a
gangster wants because they tell us,

70
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,260
I don't want to be a product of my
environment.

71
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,910
I want my environment to be a product of
meat.

72
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,550
So what does that mean?
That line describes the desire that any

73
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,310
human fields and understands if you
watch any gangster movie,

74
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,900
each one has this similar idea.
I don't want to dance around other

75
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:28,450
people.
They to understand what this idea means.

76
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,190
You have to take a trip into the human
psyche.

77
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,980
I point to a quote from psychologist,
Adam Phillips.

78
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,040
We wouldn't think of anything as a
tragedy if we did not have a deeply

79
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,610
ingrained sense of order already there
to be a frontier when we're angry.

80
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,100
It's because something doesn't happen in
the way we want it to.

81
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,470
Even when you get mad at something as
simple as losing your keys,

82
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,220
it means your fantasy of an ideal world.
A world where everything is available to

83
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,040
you at your fingertips was disrupted in
the ideal life.

84
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,430
The rest of the world revolves entirely
around you.

85
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,060
Would you like to go walking in the
dining room with the donor?

86
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,070
So Dallas,
Dallas,

87
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,690
wearing a nice silk dress?
Never everybody waiting on you do like

88
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:02,980
it.
The gangster is the perfect embodiment

89
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,530
of this fantasy.
The world operates how the gangster

90
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:08,140
wants it to operate.
He can give us with the twitch of his

91
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,930
fingers when he walks into a room,
people offering them a place to sit,

92
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,960
to do business.
All he has to do is not disability of

93
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,900
the gangster,
transcends simple money or sex or

94
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,090
respect.
It is the idea that the gangster has

95
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:23,440
complete dominion over his world.
I want to make them an offer in the

96
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,540
Godfather.
What's the first thing Vito Corleone

97
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:29,140
asks?
Please come to me first.

98
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,990
In this scene,
America Bonasera acts as a threat to the

99
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:34,510
gangsters.
All powerful reach bonus here it goes to

100
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:37,390
the police first showing that he
believes more in the American justice

101
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,500
system than in Beto.
Even the lighting has bonused.

102
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,370
Sarah's face looked like a rat,
making him visually appear like a

103
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,280
trader.
He doesn't buy into the Godfather's

104
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,170
power,
but of course the godfather winds from

105
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:49,300
over in all of media.
That gangster is perhaps the closest

106
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,850
embodiment to a guy.
Superheros come close,

107
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,800
but even they have to fight villains and
save the world.

108
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,920
Gangsters have nothing to worry about.
The appeal of the gangster is not that

109
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,390
he's a gangster,
it's that he is all knowing and all

110
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:01,060
powerful.
If he doesn't want to pay the tab,

111
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,620
he doesn't have to imagine being able to
live like that.

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,840
I think in the movies,
the worst part about the gangsters.

113
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:08,750
Downfall isn't the actual death.
It's much worse than that.

114
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,090
It's one of the gangster goes back to
being just like us,

115
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,220
powerless and unable to control his
world.

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,440
This idea goes as far back as the public
enemy.

117
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,340
When the very physical and expressive
Tom Powers gets physically restrained

118
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,100
and mummified when he dies,
it's most present in goodfellas.

119
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,380
When Henry Hill goes into witness
protection program,

120
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,860
everybody had their hands out,
everything was for the taking,

121
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,310
and now it's all over and becomes just
like you and me have to wait around like

122
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,190
everyone else and as he closes the door,
we hear the sound of jail,

123
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,640
cell bars closing,
symbolizing his loss of the all powerful

124
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,530
aura of the game.

125
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:46,690
Of

126
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,060
course,
I haven't mentioned one crucial detail

127
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:51,800
about the gangster,
the over the top violence houses,

128
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,390
genres so successful with such violence.
In one episode of the Sopranos,

129
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:58,630
Tony Takes his daughter to visit
colleges on the way he recognized the

130
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:01,720
rat hudson down and strangles the rat to
death with a wide.

131
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,720
The creators of the show were hesitant
to make this episode because of its

132
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:07,120
hyper violence,
but made it anyway and it's brutal.

133
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,030
The shots are extremely close up and it
follows the strangling to the bitter

134
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:11,920
end.
The episode was praised by critics and

135
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:14,530
went on to win two entities,
which begs the question,

136
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,220
why do we like this horrific violence?
The answer comes from the idea of the

137
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:20,500
taboo,
something taboo is untouchable and

138
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,750
there's a fascination with things that
cannot be touched.

139
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,150
Subjects like drugs and violence are
taboo,

140
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,510
but the fact that they cannot be touched
gives them a level of power.

141
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,280
If you refuse to touch something and you
have to be at some level obsessed with

142
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,000
it,
if that thing didn't matter to you,

143
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,530
then you wouldn't care if you touched
it.

144
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,870
For some,
the taboo is rooted in superstition.

145
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:40,480
Mike and Aversion to peg boards or black
magic.

146
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,170
With that obsession comes a desire to
observe the taboo from a distance.

147
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,180
Naturally,
there's a draw to look at something that

148
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:49,900
holds so much power over us.
I know there are women like my best

149
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:52,990
friend,
but would've gotten out of bed the

150
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,120
minute that boyfriend gave them a gun to
hide.

151
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,190
I got to admit the truth.
It turned me on.

152
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,240
Speaking of rats in Victorian Society,
they were inexplicably taboo.

153
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
They were a symbol of the unclean and
we're certainly untouchable,

154
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,690
but a sociologist at the time wrote
detailed accounts of street performers

155
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,960
who are trained in handling and touching
super rents,

156
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,580
spectators would watch and discuss,
but also wonderment at the performance

157
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:19,610
ability to put his hand in a cage of
rafts without getting bit.

158
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,930
That performer in many ways had a
mystical power to be able to handle

159
00:08:22,931 --> 00:08:25,840
something that was so taboo and people
in the crowd at something.

160
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:29,170
They also found so repulsive and doesn't
it sound a lot like the gangster,

161
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,940
don't they have a certain power to do
things?

162
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:34,360
We would never have the guts to do
ourselves by participating in the taboo,

163
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,900
sex violence and the criminal life.
They have an appeal to them and the

164
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:41,080
distance between the movie screen and us
is the perfect amount of distance where

165
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:43,330
we get to observe but not touch the
taboo.

166
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,580
The gangster is certainly a complex
character,

167
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,490
but we're not all that different from.
We all want that respect,

168
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:51,220
status and controls.
The only difference is we don't have the

169
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:53,980
guts to do anything about it.
We're satisfied with seeing it on the

170
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:55,650
big screen and maybe that's a good
thing.

171
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,250
Or maybe

172
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,680
we're all a bunch of suckers and they've
been right all along.

173
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,950
As far back as I can remember,
I always wanted to be a gangster.

174
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,000
No,
I

175
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,790
would only,

176
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,300
uh.
