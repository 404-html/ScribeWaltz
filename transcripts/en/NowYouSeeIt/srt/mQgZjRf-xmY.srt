00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,710
When you hear the word improvisation,
what do you think of?

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,770
You May 1st think of Improv comedy.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,250
You see,
what I did is acting.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,220
You may have also thought of improvised
jazz breaks,

5
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:18,710
freestyle rap,
or even improvised explosive.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,610
The reason

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,540
each of these things still counts as
Improv is because Improv isn't defined

8
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,030
by the product,
but rather the process for making the

9
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:32,870
product improvising is creating and
performing spontaneously and without any

10
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:34,400
preparation.
So in film,

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,990
any dialogue,
camera shot,

12
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:39,740
or even a reaction that's unrehearsed or
unprepared can be improv.

13
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,370
Anthony Hopkins got an unrehearsed
reaction out of Jodie foster when he

14
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:46,000
went off script to make fun of her
accent Gfr,

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,800
the Dag a coal mine,
I mean just tingling and Alan Rickman

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,230
surprised expression in die hard comes
from the stuntmen dropping him on the

17
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,520
count of two,
not three.

18
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,760
There is no doubt that improv leads to
hilarious performances.

19
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,850
You don't know you're gay.
How I saw you make a spinach dip and a

20
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:06,230
Lopa sourdough bread once and actors
intuition can make for the best laughs,

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,570
tears or surprises,
no matter how subtle,

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,700
like the improvised clapping of the
joker.

23
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,460
Yeah.

24
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,680
In this essay,
I want to talk about the strengths and

25
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:18,550
limitations of Improv and why filmmakers
use different cinematic techniques to

26
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:22,390
make their films appear improvised.
The best improvisation is when actors

27
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:25,300
play the game of the scene.
In any improvised scene.

28
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,170
Each actor has certain rules for how to
act and react based on their character's

29
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:34,000
personality,
and what roles do is they free us up to

30
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,200
improvise,
right?

31
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:39,400
By giving ourselves these constrictions
that guide our impulses,

32
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,630
it funnels our creative process into
some kind of product.

33
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,590
The process of improvisation and those
rules help us create something.

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,220
The rules the actor must follow along
with the conflict between characters

35
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:55,120
makes an improvised scene work well.
Good at Improv stems from conflict and

36
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:57,580
personality with each character playing
the game.

37
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,610
Hey,
when you hear the most annoying sound in

38
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:05,611
the world,
Dustin Hoffman's reaction was

39
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:11,550
improvised.
When an actual taxi driver drove onset

40
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,140
during the filming of midnight cowboy

41
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,043
boy

42
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,960
reaction completely embodies his
character.

43
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,130
The conflict is realistic and it adds to
his character showing he's not as smooth

44
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:27,820
and cool as tries to appear.
The same applies to dramatic Improv.

45
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,850
Robert De Niro perfectly embodies travis
is loneliness,

46
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,140
isolation,
paranoia,

47
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:34,170
and aggression.
With this improvised scene,

48
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,780
you talking to me,
talking to me,

49
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,390
play the game,
follow the rules.

50
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,420
Improvisation doesn't work when
characters don't play the game in

51
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:47,340
pixels.
Adam Sandler has a meeting with the

52
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,820
president and other executives and out
of nowhere he just starts going around

53
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:53,730
the room insulting people.
The conflict makes no sense and the

54
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:56,010
insulting doesn't go along with
Sandler's personality.

55
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,770
I'm convinced Adam Sandler partially
improvise the scene and it's painful to

56
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,080
watch because it doesn't come close to
playing the game.

57
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,390
GRANDPA,
I'll see you around maybe a nursing

58
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:06,224
home.

59
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,380
One limitation of improvisation is
oftentimes the lack of a resolution to

60
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:14,130
the scene referred to as the button.
The button is the final moment before

61
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:18,000
the end of the scene that resolves the
conflict with a final joke or comment

62
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,950
key,
and peele very consistently has the

63
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:22,800
button at the end of their sketches that
neatly ends the game.

64
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,810
For example,
they have a sketch where college

65
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:27,960
football players state their names and
the game is that their names get more

66
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:32,820
and more ridiculous.
Call royal smoochy walls versus Meyer.

67
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,660
The button is a resolution to the chaos
of the names and ends the sketch

68
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,310
perfectly.
Dan Smith,

69
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,490
Byu.
Some improvise scenes don't have the

70
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,590
button.
The result is seems that either go too

71
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:46,320
long or have an unsatisfying ending.
Director.

72
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:49,110
Judd apatow has great improvised scenes
with great jokes,

73
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:51,330
but the drawback is the scenes don't
really end.

74
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,660
They sometimes kind of just stopped.
The nature of spontaneity means an

75
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:57,990
improvised scene can't always be
structured as well as a scripted scene.

76
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,930
This isn't always the case for
improvisation though sometimes the

77
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:03,480
ending is perfect,
but it's not a certainty with a scene

78
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:06,570
that's entirely improvised.
Why don't you just make 10 louder and

79
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:09,750
make tend to be the top number and make
that a little loud?

80
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,350
These cards are 11

81
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,020
Martin Scorsese likes to mimic
improvisation in his films.

82
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:21,260
Despite them actually being scripted.
He makes the scenes look like a

83
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,860
documentary as if they're unrehearsed to
the point where he blurs the line

84
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:28,910
between documentary and fiction.
The effect is films that seem extremely

85
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:32,570
realistic and spontaneous means streets
appears very improvised.

86
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,550
The opening title sequence in a home
video aspect ratio has characters act

87
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,990
very naturally.
The camera shots are all handheld.

88
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,070
The music is to sal chick and even the
text was super imposed using blown up

89
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:45,590
typewriter text.
A method commonly reserved for

90
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:49,190
documentaries and home videos.
The opening sequence shows everyday life

91
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:51,530
for this group of Italian Americans in
New York.

92
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,770
The use of footage and action that looks
improvised makes the movie seem more

93
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:57,740
casual and realistic.
Contrast this movie with something like

94
00:04:57,741 --> 00:05:00,560
the Godfather with an epic score,
dramatic deaths,

95
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,970
intense acting and cryptic dark lighting
and you see how mimicked improvisation

96
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,920
gives a totally different mood to a
movie.

97
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,760
The fictional documentary style goes as
far back as citizen Kane when the news

98
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:14,870
on the march sequence recreated real
life new segments making Charles Kane

99
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:18,350
seemed like a real world figure while
also establishing the contrast between

100
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,140
his public and private life.
My wife used to farm and she was

101
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:22,480
nervous.
She had also,

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,990
it's a wonderful,
amazing cuisines.

103
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,490
She used to fall asleep.
Improv does more than just make us

104
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:30,950
laugh.
Improvisation is a process that makes

105
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:33,980
for great scenes.
Sometimes an actor's best tool is

106
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:37,610
getting into character and seeing what
can happen spontaneously and even when

107
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:39,980
it's imitated.
The improvised documentary look,

108
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,200
adds realism to a film.
So don't forget,

109
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:45,530
an actor can give a great performance
based solely on the process they go

110
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:46,370
through.
Internally.

111
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,850
Masa Graham,
much.

112
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:51,200
I gray,
I'm Martha Graham or Twyla Twyla Twyla

113
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,390
are Michael [inaudible].
Michael Kid might go,

114
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:54,920
kid Michael,
kid on Madonna,

115
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,450
Madonna,
Madonna,

116
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,600
but you keep it all inside.
Thanks for watching.
