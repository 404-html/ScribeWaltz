1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,330
Nope.
Yes.

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,460
Stupid Pass.
Then you've got the arms left.

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,443
Yes,
I have

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,100
just a flesh wound in life.
When somebody gets injured,

5
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:10,320
it's just a stroke of bad luck.
But in movies,

6
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:13,500
it's never an accident.
An injury is a calculated and meaningful

7
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:17,220
choice by a writer or director to tell
us more about a character or reinforce

8
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:19,170
certain thematic ideas.
Each injury,

9
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,120
whether it's blindness or becoming
handicapped,

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,240
represents the symbolic handicap captain
who they are as a character.

11
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,700
And many of the most memorable
characters and movie moments were

12
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,070
greatly enhanced by this literary
concept.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,170
So let's give some characters at
diagnosis.

14
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,740
Oh No,
I just keep bringing it up.

15
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,910
What do you get back in again?
First,

16
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,030
I have to convince you that injuries are
much more than just physical in the

17
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:40,560
film.
So let's say we have a character

18
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:43,080
returning from combat adjusting to
civilian life.

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,390
How do we show his inner conflict
symbolically?

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,180
Give him a limp.
A limp literally hinders his mobility,

21
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,790
reflecting his struggle to adapt to this
new lifestyle.

22
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,420
Um,
I know that you'll therapist thing,

23
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:54,440
so limp psychosomatic,
correct camera,

24
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,370
right?
So when he gets the thrill of the chase

25
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:58,620
and the limp finally goes away,
we know what that means.

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,750
You said you forgot this.

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,960
The ability to stand and walk normally
is a symbol of strength and self

28
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,850
confidence.
Why do you think the secret service

29
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,700
didn't allow any pictures taken of FDR
in a wheelchair?

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,390
Walking or the lack of it makes for a
powerful image in forrest gump.

31
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,880
Lieutenant Dad's character arc.
It gets represented through his

32
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:20,040
injuries.
He wants to die a hero on the

33
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,360
battlefield.
When he fails,

34
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:24,720
he loses the ability to walk.
His injury directly contrasts forrest

35
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:27,420
who went from handicap to always running
in later scenes.

36
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,960
Lieutenant Dans frustration is always
shown through his reliance on others to

37
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,420
move because he can't move himself where
he wants to be.

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,940
When he finally gets as close as he can
to the heavens,

39
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:37,890
challenging the fate he was supposed to
have.

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,920
That's when he finally moves on his own
and eventually I got new legs custom

41
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,470
made titanium alloy.

42
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,900
The fixing of an injury always reflects
the way a character,

43
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,230
his inner self is being fixed too.
If you want to character to have a

44
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,420
crutch in their psyche,
give them a literal one.

45
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,900
There will be blood starts with theory
scenes depicting the dangerous world of

46
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:00,990
drilling underground.
Daniel plainview breaks is like falling

47
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:04,590
into a well and has to crawl all the way
from the well in the middle of nowhere

48
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,320
to the nearest town through an injury
and how he beats it.

49
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,560
We learned about his ruthlessness better
than dialogue could ever tell us.

50
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,060
It's in a way that justifies his actions
in the movie as much of a bastard as

51
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:20,061
this man proves himself to be that
courage that it would have taken to do

52
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:28,791
that actually gives him the heroic right
for almost everything that he does

53
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,830
throughout the rest of the movie.
But it doesn't always have to be

54
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:37,020
grandiose.
You can even give a character a fake

55
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:38,790
injury to play with our expectations.

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,910
Bonnie and Clyde Clyde cutoff his toe to
get out of doing work in prisons,

57
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,810
and this impairment relates directly to
sexual impotence with Bonnie in

58
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,600
literature and film.
A physical ailment can often indicate a

59
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:57,040
sexual element.
For a man,

60
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,660
he's limped in more ways than one.
I ain't much of a loverboy in rear

61
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,400
window.
Jeff is physically bound to a

62
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,800
wheelchair.
He doesn't want to marry you.

63
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,620
Lisa and his physical restrictions from
his injury compliment his view that he's

64
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,810
perhaps being sexually restricted as
well

65
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,570
off to act,
but what about characters like professor

66
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,790
x and Yoda?
They both have issues with walking,

67
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,190
but there's some of the most powerful
characters in their worlds.

68
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,720
I think a lot of mentors have physical
handicaps because it reflects how they

69
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,090
pay for mind over body.
They've transcended physical limitations

70
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,100
to the point where it doesn't reflect
weakness,

71
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,660
a similar injury,
his blindness,

72
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,990
this trope goes as far back as oedipus
rex when the blind man can tell the

73
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:35,410
future.

74
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,380
While oedipus is the ones seeing things
incorrectly in movies,

75
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:41,860
not being tricked by the world around
you seems to give you a spiritual wisdom

76
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,760
instead.
Also,

77
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,670
have you ever noticed that every
superhero has a movie where they lose

78
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:47,350
their powers,
they can't shoot webs,

79
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,750
they don't have their suit or they get
blasted with Kryptonite?

80
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,210
It's because when your life is
threatened to when you're no longer

81
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,460
invincible,
benny become relatable because what's

82
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:58,210
more human than being mortal when to
pretty much invincible superheros fight.

83
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:00,160
It's kind of boring.
Where are the stakes?

84
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,920
How can we relate to them?
Iti was such a revolutionary movie

85
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:05,790
because for the first time the Ilien
wasn't a giant monster,

86
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,190
huge impenetrable creature.
He was innocent and most importantly he

87
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:12,640
could get sick making him human.
I think one of my favorite examples of

88
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:15,700
bringing out humanity through injuries
is in terminator two Arnold

89
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:19,210
Schwarzenegger is an emotionless robot,
but by the end of the movie he grows on

90
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,360
you and it comes from his selflessness
and how he lets himself get hurt.

91
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,020
Even with no sympathetic dialogue and no
discernible emotion and a murderer

92
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,090
streak.
The terminators still gets a hug in the

93
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,670
end and we empathize with him because he
got hurt.

94
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,050
You know what?
Here's the thing about die hard,

95
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,500
die hard one.
The original John McLean,

96
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,960
just this normal guy,
you know,

97
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,970
he's just a normal New York City cop who
gets his feet cut and gets beat up,

98
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,420
but he's an everyday guy and die hard
for,

99
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,640
he is jumping a motorcycle into a
helicopter air,

100
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,110
you know,
he's invincible.

101
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,600
At the end of the day,
major injuries reminds you of your

102
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:59,170
mortality and may make you reconsider
what's important to you and film the

103
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,810
same principles apply.
So the next time somebody gets hurt,

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,790
remember that it's never just a flesh
wound.

105
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,890
Come back here and take off kind of by
though.

106
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,343
Thanks for watching.

107
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,510
You
said.
