00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,370
The dollies.
Zoom is one of the most disorienting and

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:07,110
flashy camera techniques of all time
and it shows up in some of the most

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:09,600
beloved scenes in cinematic history.
It's famous for,

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:12,390
it's bizarre look,
but the shot also teaches us a lot about

5
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:14,490
filmmaking.
It shows the different kinds of lenses

6
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:17,070
and how to use them.
It enhances the emotion of the scene and

7
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:19,950
it can be used in subtle places.
You may not have even noticed.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,670
Let's see how
the dollies zoom or sometimes called the

9
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:27,810
vertical effect started in hitchcock's
film vertigo in 1958 you need a smooth

10
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:29,880
track and steady zoom to pull it off
nicely,

11
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:33,000
which is why it wasn't developed sooner.
The shot is essentially an optical

12
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,420
illusion because by zooming in or out on
the camera lens while tracking the

13
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:39,450
camera forward or backward,
the result is the foreground stays in

14
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:40,200
the same position.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,390
While the background appears to squeeze
or stretch,

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,150
depending on which direction you go,
it actually teaches an important

17
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:47,850
principle of filming camera Lens.
If you ever wanted to see the difference

18
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,510
between wide angle and telephoto lenses.
A simplified example would be to observe

19
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:55,440
at.compare how it begins to how it ends.
The dollies soon shot can start like a

20
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:58,650
telephoto lens for the camera is far
away and the focal length is bigger.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,740
There's less background insight because
the lens concentrates on a smaller

22
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,840
portion of,
but when you change focal lens by

23
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:06,450
zooming out while also pushing the
camera forward,

24
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,630
you can observe more of the background
while keeping the foreground in the same

25
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:11,790
place.
The result is filming the same thing,

26
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:14,250
but the camera expands to see more of
the background.

27
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,710
The change in focal length takes in a
wider area,

28
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:19,230
so you go from a telephoto shot to a
wide angle shot.

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,190
You generally use telephoto and closeups
to keep attention on the foreground when

30
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:25,560
you move the camera around while using a
telephoto Lens,

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,980
the background whips quickly behind the
foreground because the camera takes in

32
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,650
less of the background.
It makes for some pretty cool shots.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,770
People also tend to look better and
telephoto because their faces aren't

34
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,560
stressed by the wider Lens.
Wide Angle takes in more of the

35
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:39,540
background,
so it's better for outdoor shots.

36
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,570
When you want to capture the landscape,
so each lens is a tradeoff,

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,230
the dollies and captures the transition
from one kind of lens shot to the other

38
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,600
and it leads to different emotional
responses for the viewer.

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,970
Vertigo uses the dollies zoom to give a
sense of height.

40
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,240
This increase in height perfectly
embodies how the telephoto has a more

41
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:57,060
narrow view of the background,
so we'd go from capturing a lot of the

42
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,590
background to capturing very little.

43
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,870
The results is a dizzying optical
illusion.

44
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,690
The shot is unsettling,
even a little bit nauseating for some

45
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:07,140
because it's physically impossible to
experience without some kind of lens

46
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:08,550
alteration.
In goodfellas,

47
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:11,790
the diner scene becomes all the more
confusing as the landscape shifts around

48
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,760
them and impossible ways.
Just as Henry's world is crushing and

49
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:17,370
his paranoia grows,
the impossible movement of the diner

50
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,860
shows just how disoriented he feels.
The zoom makes the world literally close

51
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:23,520
in around him as getting caught seems
almost inevitable.

52
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,890
As I mentioned before,
the Wide Angle Lens makes people look a

53
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,380
bit off with the famous Dolly's zoom in
jaws,

54
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,770
the shot shifts to a wide angle look,
which makes his face look just a bit

55
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:34,890
more stretched and unnatural,
and it unconsciously adds to the rest of

56
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:36,930
the freakiness of the shock.
Those three examples,

57
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,370
vertigo,
jaws and Goodfellas,

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,250
or the Goto examples,
whenever anybody mentions the dollies

59
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:43,020
zoom,
the promise that when teaching the shot,

60
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:46,110
the examples usually stop there,
which is a shame because it makes a shot

61
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,270
seem like a one off effect for legendary
movies,

62
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,790
but it's actually a lot more versatile
and common than that.

63
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,640
It's out of this world.
Visual look makes it commonly used for

64
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,800
the supernatural or the feeling of a
drug trip.

65
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,320
I particularly enjoy.
It's used in the Lord of the rings

66
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:01,690
because the widening of the holes in the
trees gives the visual feeling that the

67
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:04,300
forest is opening up a portal for the
enemy to come.

68
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,030
It's almost always used out of movies,
climactic ethic moment,

69
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,160
so if you're a hero fails,
it adds to the punchline.

70
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,800
The shot has even found its way into
animation.

71
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,930
Bradford uses it extensively in his
films.

72
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,350
The food critic flashback gets enhanced
with a dollar zoom effect to simulate

73
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:22,360
the transportation from one world to
another.

74
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,460
Animation,
particularly computer generated,

75
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:27,910
has a distinct opportunity to use the
photo in interesting ways because of

76
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:30,400
animations,
complete control of object placement.

77
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,820
As remy relates to chef Gusteau,
the dollies whom is no longer used to

78
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:35,470
disorient the viewer,
but to show them,

79
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:38,650
get physically closer together,
indicating a relationship is born.

80
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,010
The incredibles has a seemingly
impossible Dolly's.

81
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:43,600
Soon as Mrs incredible gets closer to
the temptation.

82
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,990
Both instances are non disruptive,
but also draw our attention to certain

83
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,480
parts of the shot with its trademark
squeezing effect.

84
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,610
The Delis,
whom is certainly a fantastical shot at

85
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,410
the disposal of the filmmaker.
But remember,

86
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:56,510
it's more than just a cheap trick.
Alfred Hitchcock use different depths or

87
00:03:56,511 --> 00:03:59,950
says he used it to show paranoia,
and Brad Bird used it for visual cues.

88
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,110
So be on the lookout for it.
Thanks for watching.

89
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,390
[inaudible].
What are you staring at fucker?

90
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,410
[inaudible].
