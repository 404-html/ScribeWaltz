1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,200
This is a hub us.
So Darla,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,720
y'all can't be seen in this.
Behind every memorable character is a

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:10,260
meticulously chosen wardrobe.
Whether the costume is extremely flashy

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,080
or completely blends in.
Costume design provides an amazing

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:16,560
opportunity to give us insight into a
character and the world around them

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,650
because just like in the real world,
what you wear says a lot about you.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,100
I'm always said there's an awful lot you
can tell about it.

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,260
Posting by those shoes.
I want to take a look at costume design

9
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,480
as a tool for filmmakers to tell their
story.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,310
In many of cinemas,
most important movies,

11
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:33,060
costume designers are the secret heroes,
the people who immerse us within a world

12
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:36,360
seamlessly and effectively without
getting nearly the same recognition as

13
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:39,920
actors or directors.
So let's get sketching the plus to hod

14
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:43,740
dialing.
The word costume invariably gets

15
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:47,070
associated with how the wean dress up
and pretending to be somebody else.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,870
And sometimes that's the function of
clothing.

17
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:49,704
In a movie,
he was,

18
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,890
didn't pick a moon,
but the majority of costume design

19
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,260
operates on completely opposite
principles.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,560
Their goal is to create authentic and
realistic people on the screen.

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,030
Not Actors playing dress up.
Oh,

22
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,270
it's not a costume.
Costume design is an added layer towards

23
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:09,780
the immersive magic of film period.
Clothing is meant to place you in the

24
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:12,630
time period of the movie.
Gone with the wind is famous for its

25
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:16,520
engaging costume design of while there
is some 1930s flare in the hairstyle,

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,040
the clothes still manage to immerse the
audience in the civil war era and

27
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,410
accurately reflect scarlet's fall from
grace.

28
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,770
The way she designs her own clothing
also serves as a nice metaphor for the

29
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:29,430
need to literally and figuratively
reconstruct herself after the war.

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,130
At its best.
Costume design is a vital layer of world

31
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:34,680
building and it works well in totally
foreign places.

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,810
When people talk about the original star
wars,

33
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:40,320
they usually praise the plot characters
or special effects with the costume

34
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:43,590
design was also fantastic.
It combines what we're used to seeing

35
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,720
with the completely alien princess
layers.

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,320
Costume design is right in the middle of
looking like she's from a foreign planet

37
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,720
and looking like royalty as we
understand it.

38
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,400
And all the designs,
the robots,

39
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:56,190
generals and soldiers,
their wardrobe is alien enough to

40
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:58,470
transport us to an exciting and
different worlds,

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,920
but familiar enough to keep us grounded.
And while we already understand our

42
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,070
immersive costuming is more difficult
than you may think edith had the winner

43
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:08,700
of eight Oscars for costume design and
the inspiration for edna mode designed

44
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:10,830
for many movies taking place in present
day.

45
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,560
So she just dressed her characters in
the style of her time.

46
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,420
Problem is by the time the movie was
shot,

47
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:18,030
edited and released,
the style would change and the dresses

48
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:18,870
became tacky.

49
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,650
So she had to anticipate the future and
make something look modern but not tied

50
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,710
down to a specific trend.
And she was one of the first to address

51
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,480
this issue.
That's still shows up today,

52
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,870
striking the balance between looking too
dated or too generic.

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,750
So a movie made in the 70s might have
generic costuming,

54
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:37,620
but a movie about the seventies embraces
the old school style to bring about the

55
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:40,590
nostalgia of a loss time.
It's why eight mile looks like you could

56
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:43,590
have taken place at any time,
but rappers look ridiculous in their

57
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:45,570
music videos that came out the same
year.

58
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,810
Fashion is not the primary.
The primary effort in motion pictures is

59
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,480
to tell a story.
The plane hoodie works as a blank slate,

60
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:58,950
emphasizing mnms quest to succeed purely
on talent and nothing flashy while also

61
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,940
attention on his face.
Either way,

62
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,640
costuming is supposed to compliment the
style of your film,

63
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,220
whether you're going for realism or
something more flashy.

64
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,650
Along with our immersion,
many costume choices are to make

65
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:11,890
characters stand out of their worlds.
Willy Wonka's introduction takes place

66
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,430
over 30 minutes into the movie and the
praise always goes to gene wilder is

67
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,920
amazing performance,
but it's also an example of great

68
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:21,190
costume design while all the other
characters dressing clothing stylized

69
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:24,790
from the late 18 hundreds or as cowboys
and other characatures won because

70
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,400
wardrobe is a hybrid of the Victorian
jacket tail.

71
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,910
And buttoning of the 19th century,
but the collar and color scheme all

72
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,260
embody the style of the 1970s so we get
a character who visually stands out as

73
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,630
both out of his world and ahead of his
time.

74
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,540
The costuming in the remake emphasizes
the out of this world part,

75
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,990
but it has no grip in reality,
so it makes him seem more like a cartoon

76
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:47,260
caricature than an out of touch
visionary Bonnie and Clyde takes place

77
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:50,620
in the 1930s but their style,
wardrobe and obsession with the media

78
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:54,760
put them right into the 1960s it helps
make them appear antiestablishment much

79
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:58,720
like the young people in the real worlds
during the making of this film in 1967

80
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,210
Michael Corleone,
where's his military uniform to stand

81
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,570
out amongst the classy gangster suits,
but as he gets sucked into the life,

82
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:07,360
his clothing makes the appropriate
transition for gangsters.

83
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,790
Wardrobe indicates a transition into the
Mafia.

84
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,450
This example of costume design actually
does play into the initial concept of

85
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,180
wearing a costume.
The gangster gets new attire to try to

86
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,970
fit into high society,
but no matter what they stand out as

87
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,040
gangsters.
In many movies you can tell they aren't

88
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,140
really high society.
They're just playing dress up

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,993
gangster

90
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,850
like other gangsters.
Walter White place dress up to help him

91
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,550
feel like a gangster,
but eventually he becomes the gangster.

92
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:39,510
He was only imitating before costumes.
Give us insight into the character

93
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,790
wearing it.
Luke skywalker's wardrobe has the visual

94
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,850
aesthetic of martial arts gear implying
he's undergoing training.

95
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,300
Obi wan Kenobi is dressed like a monk
because he's doing the teaching in the

96
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:51,150
force awakens the roles that have
reversed and so have the costume

97
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:52,260
choices,
new teacher,

98
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,540
new students,
the shoes and the opening of strangers

99
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,960
on a train tell us which character is
more well off and which character is

100
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:59,820
more of an every man.
It may just be me,

101
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:02,100
but the black and white shoes looked
somewhat menacing.

102
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,010
They really stand out in the frame by
being so bright and flashy.

103
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,580
Tyler durden is costume design in fight
club always contrast the color Palette

104
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:11,550
of the setting and other characters
almost like he isn't supposed to be

105
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,540
there in the first place.

106
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,550
Along with actor personality and
direction,

107
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:17,820
color scheme and costume design is an
impressive and effective way to make a

108
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:20,850
character stand out or blend in in 500
days of summer.

109
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:24,150
The opening title sequence establishes
the wardrobe color for the two

110
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:26,670
characters,
Brown for Tom and blue for summer.

111
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,890
Throughout the movie,
the coloring shifts around them.

112
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,650
When summer enters Tom's world,
the setting is colored Brown.

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,380
While summer's world is blue,
the dance sequence has all the actors

114
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:37,620
dressed in blue to represent Tom.
Thinking about summer costume coloring

115
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,230
gives us mental cues as to how the story
is progressing.

116
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,680
And by the end of the movie we realize
their colors don't mix and they part

117
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:45,840
ways.
Movies become classics when all of the

118
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:48,150
production elements come together to
make something great.

119
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,520
And that includes costuming.
So when you look back at your favorite

120
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:51,900
characters,
think about what they're wearing.

121
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,540
And of course remember the most
important rule of costume design,

122
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,700
not kicks.
Thanks for watching.

123
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,963
[inaudible]

124
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,380
slightly trends full,
just a bit of a break from the norm,

125
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,730
just a little slot in the break.
The monotony of all that.
