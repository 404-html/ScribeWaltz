1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,210
What a character chooses to drink says a
lot about them,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,720
about teenage shaken.
If they get a shot of whiskey,

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:08,700
they're cool.
If they order a fine chardonnay,

4
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:12,030
they're probably trying to go for class,
but there's wondrich used in cinema that

5
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:16,950
requires a bit of explanation as to
drinking 1% is that because you think

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:20,070
you're fat?
Probably the first thing that comes to

7
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,410
mind when you think of milk is youth and
innocence.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,160
When a 16 year old uses his charm and
grace to mimic being a pilot,

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,770
we're reminded of his age by his drink
of choice.

10
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:32,790
Would you like a drink after takeoff
milk in a clockwork orange,

11
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:36,120
the adolescent streak mill,
a gentle reminder that all this mayhem

12
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,130
is being caused by kids.
James Deane,

13
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:40,630
famously nurses,
a bottle of milk in such a way that we

14
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:44,040
get a visual cue of his conflicts
between maturity and adulthood.

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,450
Of course,
if you don't drink milk,

16
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,850
then your manly,
Oh God,

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,820
am I outside them?
I I got a bowler nails for breakfast

18
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,020
this morning.
Yes,

19
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,160
so without an ame milk,
the right this wig,

20
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,340
sorry to keep you waiting.
If you want to go for a deep reading,

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,070
you could say that Kevin's spilling milk
in home alone is a symbol of his lack of

22
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:04,770
maternal nourishment.
Or You could say John Hughes just wanted

23
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:07,500
the visual joke of everybody crying over
spilled milk,

24
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,250
but this only scratches the surface.
Many adults also drink milk and that's

25
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:14,310
where it gets more complicated.
Milk is a symbol of childishness,

26
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,380
so it's humorous to see Leon,
the professional,

27
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,320
a hypermasculine assassin,
drinking it throughout the movie.

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,270
It fits into the comedic moments of the
movie,

29
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:25,110
but it also sheds light on his maternal
side as he takes Matilda under his wing.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,030
In this instance,
drinking milk is a joke,

31
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:29,610
but many times drinking milk has the
opposite intent.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,010
It's creepy.
There's something off about a grown man

33
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:35,400
drinking milk and filmmakers seem to be
well aware of this intuition in

34
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:38,130
hitchcock suspicion.
The audience suspects that the milk may

35
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,380
be poisoned.
It's an eerie choice to have milk,

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,740
a drink we associate with innocence and
purity be the drink that may be

37
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,420
poisoned.
I don't think it would have had nearly

38
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,300
the same effect if it were a cup of
coffee or a shot of whiskey.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,760
There's something delightful about
making milk threatening.

40
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,620
We see this again and inglorious
bastards.

41
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,280
Colonel Hans Londa chugs a glass of milk
from Lofa deeds farm and it has the

42
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:58,170
creepy factor,
but there's more to it than that.

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,530
I quote a social theorist,
Roland barthes and his take on milk.

44
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,920
It's purity associated with the
innocence of a child is a token of

45
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,070
strength of a strength,
which is not revulsive,

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,270
not congestive,
but calm white,

47
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:11,220
lucid.
The equal of reality.

48
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,680
Me,
you have a wash

49
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,330
should cover.

50
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,430
So when a villain grabs the glass of
milk,

51
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,530
it's creepy,
but it also shows their power.

52
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,100
They're conquering the pure and innocent
by consuming it and there's a strength

53
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:29,170
to that.
When I saw Mad Max fury road in

54
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:31,540
theaters,
the only time people audibly cringed in

55
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,460
the crowd wasn't during an action
sequence.

56
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,390
It was when this happened,

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,260
Western culture has an aversion to
breastmilk,

58
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,710
seeing it as taboo to drink as an adult.
It's a little wonky.

59
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,080
That's because that's from Debbie's left
breast.

60
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,810
Greg,
the choice to harvest breast milk in the

61
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:51,870
movie further alienates the post
apocalyptic world from our own.

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,360
In short,
Mad Max fury road is a movie about

63
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,300
fluids.
Women are exploited for their breast

64
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,380
milk.
Men are exploited for their blood and

65
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:01,120
the populous is exploited by controlling
the water supply.

66
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,810
The complete control of these liquids by
a Wharton Joe shows his dominion over

67
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,240
his world and the milk is no exception.
In fact,

68
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,400
his sons drink the milk to keep up their
muscle mass.

69
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,430
Reinforcing the idea that consuming milk
is a sign of strength.

70
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,160
What's so great about using these
liquids in the film is that it allows

71
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,370
mad max to introduce plot points and
character arcs non verbally.

72
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,640
After Mad Max performance,
his first selfless act for Furiosa,

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,660
he washes himself with milk symbolizing
the start of his transformation from a

74
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:29,560
selfish man only looking for survival to
one who cares in nurtures for others,

75
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,400
the turn to completely trusting Furiosa
is symbolized by him giving her his

76
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,960
blood.
Another liquid symbol,

77
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,270
mad max fury road is a prime example of
milk.

78
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,460
Enhancing the visual storytelling of a
movie.

79
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,910
Milk is a powerful storytelling device.
It can show someone as a child,

80
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:46,510
but it can also be used to unsettle show
character strength or give information

81
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,430
about the plot.
So the next time you see a character

82
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:49,930
drinking something,
ask yourself,

83
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,330
thanks for one,

84
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,270
whoever it is,
a cool,

85
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,380
slightly trends full,
just a bit of a break from the norm.

86
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,980
Just a little slump in the break from
monotony of all that hard.
