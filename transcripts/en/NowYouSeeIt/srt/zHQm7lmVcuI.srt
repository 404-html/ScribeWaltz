1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,883
MMM,

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,590
no,

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,830
we've all had daydreams about being able
to fly.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,650
We can't defy the laws of physics,
but we can still dream about it.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,930
So what does it mean when a character in
a film gets to fly?

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,890
Let's look at a classic example in the
adults of the community showing

7
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:21,080
conformity,
hostility to anything new,

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,930
xenophobia,
suspicion and a lack of imagination or

9
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:26,990
bearing down on our young heroes.
They've even set up a roadblock at just

10
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,760
the moment when things look worse to the
bicycles.

11
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:31,940
Leave the earth and with it,
the earthbound grownups we see escape,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,360
wonder magic and freedom through flight.
Flying is freedom.

13
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,400
Let's do some closer readings of flying
and film.

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,940
Jenny and forrest gump wants to be free.
She wants to fly away from her troubles.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,220
She has a sexually abusive alcoholic
father.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,210
She praised a flyaway,

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,370
but does she get her wings?
Kind of.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,160
The police do take her to her
grandmother,

19
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:54,970
so she's technically free from her
father,

20
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,950
but this camera shot tells a different
story.

21
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,270
The camera moves up into the sky and
birds fly away with us,

22
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:03,940
but Jenny stays put on the ground in a
literal sense.

23
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:06,340
She does get freed from her father,
but figuratively,

24
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:08,800
she's still stuck.
She can't fly away from the emotional

25
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,380
damage her father cost.
Look at the shot of her as an adult

26
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:13,660
still falling to the ground at the sight
of her old house.

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,930
The camera shot is placed firmly at
ground level reflecting that she still

28
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:18,730
grounded.
She failed to free herself from the

29
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:20,560
shackles of her past.
Throughout the movie,

30
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:23,110
we see her trying to fly away and fail
each time.

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,370
I think I a flap.
This bridge,

32
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,600
the closeup on her shoes,
shows Jenny trying to leap out of them,

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,390
but she can't.
She stuck later.

34
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,760
She tries to using drugs to forget her
abuse and fly away.

35
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,550
The song freebird playing in the
background during this scene is

36
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:39,160
definitely no coincidence.
Now when she wants to fly,

37
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:41,110
she's higher up in a building and
wearing high heels,

38
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:43,720
but no matter how much she tries
extending herself upwards,

39
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,330
she's still slips and facing the reality
that she can't fly.

40
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,040
She can't escape the scars of her
childhood,

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,010
only when Jenny goes back home to forest
that she start to emotionally recover.

42
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,530
Nobody can fly away from their past,
but we can confront it,

43
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,360
accept and move on.
She dies,

44
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:00,300
but she doesn't die alone are trapped.
She dies in the company of people she

45
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:02,880
loves and that's when she truly becomes
free like a bird.

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Sometimes in film,
the character does feel like they're

47
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,430
flying.
We can see parallels between Jenny's

48
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,070
attempted fight and roses,
flight and titanic in the beginning.

49
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:19,160
Suicide off the back of the titanic
seems to be the only chance of escape.

50
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:22,790
Rose has from her rich plain lifestyle
and unwanted marriage with Jack.

51
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,470
However,
she can now embrace a new found beauty

52
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:26,990
in her life at the front of the boat.
Look at the difference between these

53
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:30,320
static dark closeups on the back of the
ship and the sweeping shots of color in

54
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,570
the later seen.
We perceive some innate beauty to the

55
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:34,730
idea of flying that's reflected in
titanic.

56
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,940
Birdman has such an interesting
portrayal of flight because in the film

57
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:44,480
are hero Reagan Thompson rejects flight.
He chooses to stay on the ground and

58
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:47,510
perform his play in Birdman.
Flight is still a symbol of freedom,

59
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,340
but it's a freedom.
Reagan wants to avoid.

60
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,380
Reagan wants to stay grounded and face
reality.

61
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,780
His place seeks to comment on the issues
of being human.

62
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,030
With flight.
A person escapes the struggles of being

63
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,100
human,
so flight means we no longer need the

64
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:01,570
philosophical discussions being human
because we've escaped the need for them,

65
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,030
rick and wants to stay on the ground
because he wants to make art.

66
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:06,670
That actually means something.
If he flies and makes superficial

67
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,580
superhero movies,
he'll be unable to make any profound

68
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,820
commentary on the human condition
because through flight he has escaped

69
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,460
the human condition.
He stays on the ground so he can comment

70
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,230
on the struggles of being grounded in
his play.

71
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,060
So what about the flight at the end of
the film?

72
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,650
I think this is a different kind of
flight,

73
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,690
mainly because it's not just him that
sees it.

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,670
His daughter does.
By this time in the film,

75
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,860
Reagan has overcome the need to please
others.

76
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,470
He does is play and does what he wants
purely for himself.

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,380
He transcended our needs as humans to
fit in and please others,

78
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,720
and we see this transcendence
represented through flight.

79
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,230
He achieved a higher sense of being both
literally and symbolically,

80
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,630
so maybe we can't defy the laws of
physics and fly,

81
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,510
but if you manage to figure out yourself
and your place in the universe,

82
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,463
it's sure

83
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,290
this is.
This is falling with style.

84
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,390
Thanks for watching.
