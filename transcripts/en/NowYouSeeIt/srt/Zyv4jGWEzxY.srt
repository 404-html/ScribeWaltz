1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,030
In a few moments,
he will have written the funniest joke

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:08,031
in the world and as a consequence he
will die laughing.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,070
Ah Ha.

4
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,630
I think it's wrong to say either style
of comedy is better.

5
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,170
I find it kind of annoying when people
say British comedy is always smarter,

6
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,810
or whittier.
Have you seen arrested development or 21

7
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,820
jump street or even a spongebob episode?

8
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,940
Be careful,
Patrick.

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,490
Being an artist is a heavy
responsibility.

10
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,300
Each work of art is like a child and
must be treated as such.

11
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,690
It was just going to draw a cartoon.
Okay.

12
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:56,560
Why didn't you say so?

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,870
This definitely very smart writing on
both sides of the Atlantic,

14
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,450
but that doesn't answer the question.
What makes them different?

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,580
After weeks of research?
My answer is still.

16
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:06,250
I don't know,
but let's give it a shot.

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,580
No one could read it and live.

18
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,660
Oh

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,320
No,

20
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,510
no,
I don't.

21
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,830
I didn't change.
I mean the difference,

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,100
you know,
if we're talking about the big to

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,950
Britain and America,
sorry,

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,000
rest of the world.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,270
I think the first step is to take a
British comedy and see how it's American

26
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,910
adaptation changed.
What's the difference between David,

27
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:52,230
Brent and Michael Scott by season to the
US office begins its movement away from

28
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,300
the UK.
Originally we even see a subtle

29
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:57,570
cinematic change by brightening the
lights in the office while originally

30
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:59,880
just a way to differentiate it from the
UK version.

31
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,300
The added brightness seems to serve as a
nice metaphor for the adaptation as a

32
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,050
whole,

33
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,050
but the big differences,
the Americans are more optimistic and

34
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:12,660
uh,
and last due to the fact that Americans

35
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:17,100
are told they can become the next
president of United States and

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,940
British people to told it won't happen
to you.

37
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,060
And they carry that.
I carry that with them.

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,350
There's no doubt that America lightened
up the show.

39
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,930
Michael Scott had his failures,
but there's a hope to it.

40
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,300
In one episode he wasn't invited to
Jim's party,

41
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:33,790
but shows up anyway,
genuinely hurt and bitter.

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,750
Wow.
Who opened the morgue for this thing?

43
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,070
He picks a duet song and no one will
sing it with him.

44
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:41,470
Reluctantly,
Jim joints in giving Michael a big

45
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:44,620
cheesy smile and an overall happy ending
to the episode.

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,080
But when David Brent performance,
it's still funny,

47
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:50,050
but at different kinds of funny,
nobody pities him or cheers them on.

48
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,460
They all just watched you.
Been embarrassing.

49
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,860
There's no happy ending and it's not
very hopeful.

50
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,360
Or look at how both characters wrap up
their time on the shelf.

51
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,750
Spoiler alert,
Michael Scott clits to move with his

52
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:14,120
fiance to call Rato and David Brent begs
for his job back.

53
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,250
I will try twice as hard.
I really,

54
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:20,240
well I not being complacent and I'll
turn this place around if we just say

55
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,840
that it's not definite now.
And of course this doesn't include the

56
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,790
Christmas special,
which was a lot happier.

57
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,300
Put it this way.
The American coming here like John

58
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,240
Belushi or someone like that is do you
know that scene in a animal house where

59
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:37,600
the
fellow playing folk music on a guitar

60
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,340
and John Belushi picked up the guitar
and destroys it and the cinema just

61
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:46,470
smashes it.
And then where goes his eyebrows up a

62
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:47,840
camera and I want to say,
God,

63
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,020
he's so great with a British comedian
would want to play the focusing.

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,970
We want to play the failure.
Get an engine started near the

65
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,660
five by five,
so maybe the difference is the

66
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:08,720
optimistic American dream versus the
dark British reality.

67
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,490
At least that's what many people think
about it.

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,450
Europe is just basically a gene pool of
people whose answers to said,

69
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,373
oh,
don't.

70
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,970
I don't think I can risk their are risk
of America is a gene pool of people say,

71
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,823
well,
that's risky,

72
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,010
but I think that answer is too easy
because you have to ignore the fact that

73
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:28,730
Americans love the failures like Sean
from Shaun of the dead and plenty of

74
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:32,150
modern American sitcoms feature losers
who never get their redemption.

75
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,220
Frankly,
I think it's an outdated theory.

76
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,870
The past television era of married with
children and Seinfeld and friends always

77
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:47,950
featured the classic wise guy who always
had the funny one liner for every moment

78
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:50,020
to say,
you know how to take the reservation.

79
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,520
You just don't know how to hold it.

80
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,670
I think in the last 10 years,
we're starting to see a self awareness

81
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,460
of this American dream optimism style of
comedy,

82
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,040
and it's always sunny.
There certainly is that feeling of hope

83
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,930
in the characters.
They think they can accomplished

84
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,150
anything,
but they always take it way too far by

85
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:07,680
becoming violent,
cruel,

86
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:11,160
and hilariously backstabbing.
It's almost a critique on American

87
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:13,380
optimism in America.
You're supposed to succeed,

88
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,060
but at what cost?
Completely gone.

89
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,230
We're definitely gonna.
Need a silencer gun?

90
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,500
Find no guns,
no guns up.

91
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,400
Piano wire.
Okay.

92
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:20,410
Maybe we can use the panel.
Why?

93
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,710
Whatever it is.
Be The guy to pull the trigger on this

94
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:26,940
thing to mention.
They always fail in face the

95
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:30,780
consequences and it seems like not one
single thing ever works out for Larry

96
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:34,340
and curb your enthusiasm.
I need to step out of the car please.

97
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,230
Oh,
come on.

98
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,010
Are you serious?
Did episode of Louie ends with his date

99
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:41,580
running into a helicopter to escape?
It doesn't get more pathetic than that.

100
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,540
So maybe some American comedy pokes fun
at the hope and lighthearted nature of

101
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,270
past sitcoms,
or maybe American comedy is even

102
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:51,960
shifting towards that British cynicism
or maybe will always hold that American

103
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:55,590
optimism in our hearts and even in the
millennial generation where the American

104
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:57,470
dream seems to do nothing but screw
over.

105
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,340
It'll always be ingrained in our culture
and mindset to shrug it off and keep on

106
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,990
trying.
I'm not gonna take no for an answer

107
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:06,290
because I just refuse to do that because
I'm a winter and winter is we don't

108
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,950
listen to words like like no or or don't
or stop.

109
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,080
Those words are just not in our
vocabulary.

110
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,360
I know this is a topic a lot of people
get passionate about it,

111
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:16,430
but I hope the comment section doesn't
get too heated.

112
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,890
At least I don't expect some kind of
Spanish influence.

113
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,680
Nobody expects the Spanish inquisition.
Thanks for watching.

114
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,590
Just a bit of a break for just a little
above that.
