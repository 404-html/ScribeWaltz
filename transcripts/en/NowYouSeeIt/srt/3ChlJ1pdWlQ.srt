1
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,120
Welcome to now you see this video of a
train was first screen to a group of

2
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:16,970
people in France in January of 18,
96.

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,240
Legend has it that the viewers of the
film were so overwhelmed by what looked

4
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:23,540
like a train coming right at them that
many hid under their seats or ran to the

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,810
back of the room in fear of getting hit.
The truth of the story is debated,

6
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,810
but what's certain is that seeing a
video for the first time have a train

7
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:32,780
coming towards you would probably leave
you pretty shocked and amazed.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,970
So the question is even more than a
century later,

9
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:38,530
can we be just as moved by film or are
we desensitized because we know that

10
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:40,250
things on screen aren't actually
happening.

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,610
I want to explore the war film because
we're films have such great potential to

12
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:51,850
shock and amaze us through their sheer
scope and powerful subject matter.

13
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,860
How can film to portray war and what
techniques do filmmakers used to picked

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,140
war and the soldiers that fight them can
film portray war realistically.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,240
Let's take a look at two types of war
films,

16
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,100
probe war and Anti War French filmmaker
friends,

17
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:08,590
swatch Hifu is often attributed with
saying there's no such thing as an

18
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:11,020
antiwar film.
While Steven Spielberg said in an

19
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:14,830
interview with Newsweek magazine,
of course every movie good or bad is an

20
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:16,540
antiwar movie,
so who's right.

21
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,240
I want to argue that while neither of
these statements is correct,

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,430
they do give insight into the nature of
film,

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,250
but before arguing,
if a film is pro or anti war,

24
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,420
we have to define pro and anti war.
A definition like antiwar portrays war

25
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,110
in a bad light and pro war portrays
we're in a good light is somewhat of an

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,160
oversimplification.

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,300
A lot of war films show a combination of
positive and negative aspects of war.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,770
They were expendable.
For example,

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,700
shows Japanese airplanes blowing up a US
pt boat and killing a soldier.

30
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,740
Look at this shot of John Wayne
collapsing at the side of the boat way

31
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:48,820
down by his combat boots,
the camera following him to the ground.

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,440
This scene reflects wars,
cruel,

33
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:51,430
dangerous,
and dead.

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,910
But if we look at the movie as a whole,
it's definitely a pro war propaganda

35
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:55,930
film.
Look at this shot up,

36
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:59,000
General Macarthur commander of the army,
he towers over the camera,

37
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:02,260
speaks little and is treated by the
soldiers as a celebrity please.

38
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,300
He's looked at as a hero and savior up
for the United States and this and along

39
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:10,590
with lots of pro war sentiment in the
film shows that they were expendable as

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,600
much more pro war than Antigua.
I think a better definition for a pro

41
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:20,280
war film would be a film that shows the
benefits of war outweighing the cost and

42
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,590
an antiwar film shows the cost of war
outweighing the benefits.

43
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,170
A modern example of a probe war film is
American sniper.

44
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,620
Clint Eastwood makes the claim that the
film is antiwar and it definitely has a

45
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:33,070
lot of aspects of an antiwar film.
The film shows that word isn't always

46
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,560
black and white and can cause serious
emotional trauma.

47
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,980
But what makes it pro war is that Chris
Kyle believes he did the right thing.

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,840
I'll just protect them.
My Gosh,

49
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,820
they were trying to kill our soldiers.
And,

50
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:45,580
uh,
I'm willing to meet my creator and as

51
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:46,660
for every shot that I took,

52
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,890
the film is pro war because it conveys
that despite all the trauma of war war,

53
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,790
I'm blessed with the gift of aggression.
Overpowering need to protect the flock,

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,900
rare breed live to confront the wolf.
They were the sheepdog.

55
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,190
The benefits of war outweigh the costs
and worry is unnecessary evil against

56
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,860
those who caused terror.
It's with films like American sniper

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,050
where I think Spielberg is wrong in his
statement about war.

58
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,440
Films or films normally don't make out
war as something to look forward to,

59
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,720
but they can certainly make wore out as
necessary.

60
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:26,740
Pro War films use heroes and an idea of
the greater good to convey the message

61
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,990
that war is necessary.
It's antiwar film,

62
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:32,800
showcase the brutality and cruelty of
war to portray combat negatively.

63
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,550
To get a look at how filmmakers you send
them a tography to have an antiwar film

64
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,290
show the horrors and realities of
combat.

65
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,130
One has to look no further than the DJ
scene in saving private Ryan.

66
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,030
The transition from the old man in the
opening scene to the beaches of Normandy

67
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,480
is done with a jarring smash cut.
We don't fade.

68
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,430
We don't zoom in.
It's a fast and abrupt transition.

69
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,940
It gives the effect of being forced into
the scene without adequate preparation.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,270
The shot of the endless rows of anti
landing barriers on the beach looks

71
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,120
eerily similar to the rows of tombstones
in the graveyard.

72
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:09,210
We just saw in the earlier scene a
foreshadowing of what's to come.

73
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,750
We get several closeups of soldiers and
they certainly aren't the typical war

74
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:15,230
heroes.
The first image of our hero is his hand

75
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,740
shaking,
a sign of fear.

76
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,550
Compare that to the grand introduction
of John Wayne on a squadron of pt boats

77
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,610
that are basically showing off to the
camera or even American sniper where

78
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,560
Chris Kyle first gets shown with this
huge,

79
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:26,730
powerful sniper rifle.

80
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,600
The Omaha beach scene shows a war fought
by the terrified not by the heroic or

81
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,430
masculine.
The killing on the beach is best

82
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:36,120
described as pure chaos.
The camera shake point of view shots and

83
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:40,020
minimal movement blur all work together
to pull the viewer onto the battlefield

84
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:42,450
alongside the other soldiers.
With all these effects,

85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,050
this scene definitely conveys that the
costs of war outweighed the benefits.

86
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,860
A great way for a film to Portray Warren
in negative way is to make war scenes as

87
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:52,830
realistic as possible by putting us in
the real world.

88
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,760
We feel the terror and get a sense that
war may not be worth all the turmoil it

89
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:59,160
causes.
Waltz with Bashir is another great

90
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:02,580
example of pulling us into the action
and showing how work could have such

91
00:05:02,581 --> 00:05:05,070
devastating effects.
The movies and animation war,

92
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,190
film and the resulting effect is that
were removed from the reality and the

93
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,980
film because it's animated and doesn't
look realistic.

94
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,700
Then in the last minute or so,
the film quickly cuts to actual footage

95
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:17,010
of the aftermath of the massacres in
Lebanon.

96
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,860
The result is heart wrenching.
It jars us from the spectacle of the

97
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:24,210
animation into the harshness of reality.
We see widows crying dead bodies and

98
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:27,120
it's all thrown at us with no
preparation for the transition from

99
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:30,360
cartoons to reality.
The effect is extremely powerful and we

100
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:34,050
realized that what we were originally
seeing only an animated characters is in

101
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:38,160
fact exactly the reality of war and that
reality is horrific suffering.

102
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,830
If that's not an antiwar film,
then I don't know what it is.

103
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,370
I do see where the food is coming from
when he says there's no such thing as an

104
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:46,710
antiwar film.
He's saying that film by nature

105
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:49,200
contained spectacle.
Since we're not actually on the

106
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:51,480
battlefield and our safe in our movie
theater seats,

107
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,810
we don't completely feel exactly like
the soldiers do because we're removed

108
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:55,620
from the reality.

109
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,820
This removal makes it difficult to
construct a film that truly leaves

110
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:00,710
people,
discussed it at war because we're safe

111
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,690
from it.
We can enjoy watching the destruction of

112
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,190
film in the theater.
Famous director,

113
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,740
Samuel Fuller,
upon watching the very antiwar,

114
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,400
full metal jacket stated that it was
just another goddamn recruiting film.

115
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,730
Even when films try to criticize war,
sometimes they can still give the effect

116
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:17,240
of making more glamorous cinema as an
art form is limited because no matter

117
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,180
how John we are to the movie,
there's always that barrier from

118
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,370
reality.
A train on screen doesn't frighten us

119
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,700
like it would in real life,
so maybe we are a little desensitized by

120
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,740
the screen.
We aren't shocked like the viewers of

121
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,720
the train were back in 18,
96.

122
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,700
Some may say that's a limitation to
film,

123
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,180
but to others it's a challenge.
It's a challenge all filmmakers have to

124
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,280
tackle.
They have to surprise and astonish us

125
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,030
even when we're used to watching film
and maybe not every blockbuster these

126
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,700
days can blow you away,
but every once in a while if you're

127
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,890
lucky,
you get to see a film that hits you like

128
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:46,230
a free

129
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,840
train.
Thanks for watching.
