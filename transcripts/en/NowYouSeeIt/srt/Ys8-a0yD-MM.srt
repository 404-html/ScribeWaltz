1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,760
Let's do a psychology experiment.
Let's show our audience has seen

2
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:07,090
consisting of eight shots in the story
it tells is suspicious,

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:10,420
but a little ambiguous and open to
interpretation of girls in her

4
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:12,760
apartment.
When a guy walks suspiciously past her

5
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,770
window,
she goes outside to check it out.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,530
After the video,
we ask our audience a couple open ended

7
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,360
questions and see what they think about
it.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,280
How did it make them feel?
Did they like it?

9
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:23,260
Did they not like it?
Stuff like that.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,250
Now let's show that same video to a
different audience,

11
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,570
but change one thing,
mirror every shot,

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,210
so now any movement left to right
becomes right to left.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,000
The question is,
does this edit change anything?

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,550
Just character direction,
effect how the audience perceives the

15
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,320
character or the entire scene as a
whole.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,720
The answer is yes and a lot more than
you think,

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,250
but why does it matter which way he
went?

18
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,280
To understand why direction change is so
important.

19
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,560
We have to talk about the three axes of
movement.

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,920
There are three directions.
Onscreen of character can move right and

21
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,520
left up and down and forward and
backward the direction a character moves

22
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:01,340
matters in a scene.
Moving towards the camera shows power

23
00:01:01,341 --> 00:01:04,160
domination and aggression and moving
away shows weakness.

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,600
Similarly,
characters being looked down on appear

25
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,080
weak and high up characters are much
more dominant.

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,780
Rabbi you
our these two explanations make sense.

27
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,640
Of course,
someone low and far away from the camera

28
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:21,340
will be perceived differently from
someone high up and close,

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:23,990
but

30
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,930
the final character movement,
lateral movement going from right to

31
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:29,990
left is a lot less obvious.
What makes one side of the screen

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,050
different from the other?
Why does movement right to left matter?

33
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,110
The answer comes from time and language
in western culture.

34
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:39,800
Left to right indicates the progression
of time our language reads from left to

35
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:42,020
right.
Books began from the left and finished.

36
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:45,170
Once we get to the right in video games,
play your start on the left side and

37
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,240
finished the level on the right.
On any line.

38
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:50,300
Graph time increases as we move right in
our everyday life.

39
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:52,250
Movement towards the right indicates
time,

40
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:56,030
progress and normality and movement
towards the left indicates moving back

41
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:58,520
in time,
abnormality and regression from this

42
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:01,760
thinking came the theory amongst film
scholars that people will interpret left

43
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:04,880
to right movement as more natural and
normal than right to left movement

44
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:08,720
because of how our brains naturally
process moving images and this idea of

45
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:12,080
time and normality in left to right
movement gets applied in a variety of

46
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:13,130
films,
for example,

47
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,430
Lord of the rings maintains its left to
right movement during the journey from

48
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:17,720
the Shyer to mount doom.

49
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,180
Left right.
Movement is maintained during the big

50
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,750
travel shots and it's a subtle visual to
indicate the clear goal to reach a

51
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:26,870
specific destination.
Compare that clear objective to the last

52
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:29,330
scene in full metal jacket.
It consists of two shots,

53
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:32,330
one shot of soldiers moving left to
right past burning buildings,

54
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:35,750
and another shot of them moving right to
left with burning buildings still in the

55
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,570
background to be abrupt.
Lateral direction change makes it look

56
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:41,960
as if they randomly switched directions
and it gives the implication of the

57
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,710
soldiers are wandering aimlessly.
Stanley Kubrick uses lateral direction

58
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:49,640
change to make some commentary about the
army's unclear objectives and perhaps

59
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:51,740
commentary on the Vietnam war as a
whole.

60
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,010
Lateral character movement can also tell
a story in one scene,

61
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:57,590
in full metal jacket,
soldiers move to the right towards some

62
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,980
combat zone.
Offscreen and wounded soldiers get

63
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,040
carried away from the combat zone.
Moving from the right side to the left,

64
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,860
there's a subtle visual reinforcement
here that were the soldiers headed.

65
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,380
Offscreen is where men get brought back,
wounded it.

66
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,580
This lateral technique is similarly done
subtly in platoon and saving private

67
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,414
Ryan.

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,920
Wait,
sir.

69
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,570
What you can do so left to right is
observed as positive,

70
00:03:32,571 --> 00:03:35,090
progressive and normal,
or at least that's what many film

71
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,640
theorists assumed.
It's only in the last five years or so

72
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:40,400
that researchers started empirically
testing lateral movement.

73
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:43,040
In 2012,
Cleveland State University conducted an

74
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:46,220
experiment by showing a sequence of
eight shots to a group of people.

75
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,680
They showed the exact same shots to
another group of people,

76
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:51,680
but reversed all left to right movement
to right to left movement.

77
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:55,220
Each group answered several specific
questions and several open ended ones.

78
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:58,430
About how they felt after watching the
results confirmed what many film

79
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:01,070
theorists had assumed,
but had never had any hard evidence to

80
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:04,850
prove the experimenters analyzed open
ended questions for key words.

81
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,490
For example,
24 point eight percent of responders

82
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:08,690
used anxious,
nervous,

83
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,670
uneasy,
suspenseful to describe the video.

84
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:13,130
And 11 point nine percent said fearful,
frightened,

85
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:13,700
or scared.

86
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,820
The most statistically significant
difference between the two groups was

87
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:19,070
what the experimenters called the
negative effect.

88
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,320
Similar phrases including didn't like
the clip,

89
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:22,460
liked the clip,
good,

90
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:23,330
bad,
interesting,

91
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,190
boring,
and strong and weak were the phrases

92
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:27,260
that different the most between the two
videos.

93
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,830
So for the left to right video members
consistently used words like good,

94
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,170
interesting and strong,
while the ones who saw or right to left

95
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,610
use words like bad,
boring,

96
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:37,250
and weak audiences,
perceived left to right movement

97
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,710
positively and right to left movement
negatively.

98
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,670
This study provides a huge opportunity
for filmmakers by something as simple as

99
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:46,880
switching character movement.
A director can instill a negative or

100
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:49,070
positive emotional response on the
audience,

101
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,980
but it seems some directors have already
caught onto this difference in left to

102
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:55,010
right and right to left,
going as far back as Alfred Hitchcock,

103
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,440
Alfred Hitchcock.
Stranger on a train opens with the

104
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:01,040
protagonist and antagonist showing only
their feet and legs walking.

105
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,610
They walk towards each other as if to
imply their paths will eventually cross.

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,120
If our study is true and left to right,
movement is perceived as more positive

107
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:10,490
than right to left.
Then this opening scene has already

108
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:14,240
subconsciously established that the
right to left character is an antagonist

109
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:16,430
and the left to right character is a
protagonist,

110
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,130
so not only can left right indicate a
progression of time,

111
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,470
it can even indicate something positive
or negative.

112
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,550
Roger Ebert fully supported the idea
himself as he explains in his 2008

113
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:28,790
article how to read a movie.
Roger Ebert goes further to say even the

114
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,270
left and right sides of the screen are
perceived as either more positive or

115
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,310
more negative.
I character on the right fields more

116
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:37,010
positive and in control.
While the one on the left seems weaker,

117
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:39,650
perhaps more sinister.
This is a common recurring theme,

118
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,090
right?
Good left bad,

119
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,040
and various filmmakers use this
technique.

120
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,300
Still smarting from.
Oh,

121
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,940
come on,
come on.

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,080
Yeah.
Infinity Ebert

123
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,440
makes the claim that these conventions
of right and left extend beyond our

124
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,780
language and culture.
He says that in all his years of

125
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:02,450
watching movies,
Asian cinema uses similar left versus

126
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,700
right techniques,
and the study supported this belief,

127
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,250
religious belief,
right or left hand numbness and race all

128
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,400
did not significantly affect the
audience's perception of lateral

129
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,151
movement.
Of course,

130
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:14,420
there are no absolutes in filmmaking and
sometimes what's contrary to the rule

131
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:16,040
works just as well,
but either way,

132
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,700
this study shows that there really is a
difference between left and right in the

133
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:20,990
film.
It's only so recently that any empirical

134
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,540
testing on film techniques has actually
been conducted.

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,050
Roger Ebert claims while convincing.
We're only speculation at the time,

136
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,590
but have now been proven to an extent.
I contacted Cleveland State University,

137
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,410
the ones who publish this study,
and they're still currently conducting

138
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:35,660
experiments,
testing film theories on audience

139
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,700
members.
It's really exciting to see that even

140
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,190
after 100 years,
we're still learning new things about

141
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,660
filmmaking to this day,
what it was.

142
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,840
One speculation has now been followed up
with concrete evidence,

143
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,700
so the next time a character crosses the
screen,

144
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,563
ask yourself,

145
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,940
thanks for watching.
I wanted to clarify the video experiment

146
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:58,950
that I show isn't the original video
experiment.

147
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,540
The original one hasn't been published
yet.

148
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,730
It hasn't been posted,
although they published the article.

149
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:04,320
They haven't posted the video that they
used,

150
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,390
so I just took what they talked about it
in the article and I recreated it.

151
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,600
I encourage you guys to look at the

It's amazing.
It goes very in depth.

153
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:13,440
Talks about things.
I didn't talk about Lincoln in the

154
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:14,640
description.
Also,

155
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:18,240
I talk about film theorists in the video
and I don't refer to specific names,

156
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:19,670
but really I'm referring to coolest
shop.

157
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,110
He's the man.
He's been doing all this film theory

158
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,520
stuff.
I'm in the seventies.

159
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:27,270
He was coming up with these three axes
of movement theory and how people

160
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:30,330
interpret movement in film and so I
encourage you to look him up.

161
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,550
I'm going to add some of his writing and
the description as well.

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,720
Thanks guys.
