1
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,460
This is Jack Nugen and you're watching
now you see it.

2
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,360
Let's talk about how the film inglorious
bastards is actually making fun of you.

3
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,000
Couldn't.
Tarantino is one of the most popular and

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,310
consistently violent mainstream
directors.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,680
His films focus on people committing
violence.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,960
Criminals who killed contract killers,
a black market gun runner who killed a

7
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:35,480
former assassin,
killing for revenge,

8
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:38,060
a special Walmart two unit who's one
goal is killing nets,

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,460
more contract killers.
And finally his newest film,

10
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:43,670
the hateful eight coming out fall 2015
we'll start Samuel L.

11
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,570
Jackson,
as you guessed it,

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,270
as contract killer.
There's no doubt that Terentino's films,

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,900
especially as higher budget ones display
this sort of hyper violence with

14
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:54,860
numerous and exaggerated deaths.
Vanity Fair made a nice chart telling

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,140
each duck in a tarantino film at how
that person died.

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,620
Showing just a file.
It is,

17
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:01,490
scopes can be Terentino's eighth till
inglorious bastards.

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,480
Ace,
no exception.

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,380
The film needs 57 killed,
not cleaning the 340 teeth deaths from

20
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:08,700
the fire.
And the fear at the end of the film is

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,540
averages to one kristen to death.
About every two and a half minutes.

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,823
No,
that's fine.

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,310
Even with all this violence,
inglourious basterds was a huge

24
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:20,450
financial and critical success earning
over $300 million in eight academy award

25
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:22,670
nominations.
The majority of Terentino's films did

26
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:24,200
well in the box.
In fact,

27
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,690
of the nine films,
charity Tino has directed eight have

28
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:29,900
earned a triple their original budget.
So what does it say about us,

29
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:32,540
the viewers who pay to see and enjoy
Terentino's films?

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,630
Do we like violence?
Is it wrong for us to enjoy movies where

31
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:37,880
people die left and right turn to,
you know,

32
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:41,150
realize is this chuck position and you
mean goes so far as to criticize us,

33
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:43,270
the viewers for finding hyper violence
in his,

34
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:44,340
yeah,
so entertaining.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,120
Let's take a look at inglorious bastards
and see how we critique an audience that

36
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:52,280
glamorizes violence.
Inglorious bastards is about a World War

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,530
II special unit named the bastards whose
mission is to blow up a cinema where

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,800
dozens of high ranking Nazi soldiers in
the lead watcher I propaganda film,

39
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,490
including killer himself.
The film shown at the cinema is about

40
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:07,491
Friedrich solar and Nazi soldier who
single handedly kills 215 brushings from

41
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,560
a guard tower.
The film titled Nation's Pride is

42
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:14,400
extremely violent from what we see.
The film consist of little more than

43
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,490
shots of Friedrich's older shooting and
killing thousands of Russian soldiers.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,770
The crowd of Nazis loves it.
They cheer and laugh at each step of

45
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,790
praising the film hill even tells the
director of the film,

46
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,130
this is your best film,
yet we can't help but look at the

47
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:29,280
audience watching nuisance priding find
them a bit humorous and ridiculous.

48
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,730
They do this repetitive,
tasteless and unnecessarily killing,

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,740
entertaining and well made.
To us.

50
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,140
It appears to be nothing but a cheap
spectacle movie.

51
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,780
But think about it.
It doesn't sound familiar.

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,270
The Nazi viewers or audience members
watching a film,

53
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,490
but so are we watching inglorious
bastards.

54
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,970
It's a film with NFL.
Don't we react with similar praise to

55
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:50,940
quint Terentino's hyper violence.
Psalms 20 where the audience members,

56
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,260
I want to suggest to the Terentino's is
trying to say us viewing inglorious

57
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,990
bastards is similar to the Nazis viewing
nation's pride.

58
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,600
We cheer a death even when it's
tasteless and glorifies unnecessary

59
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,390
violence.
We see just as much excessive violence

60
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,540
inglorious bastards as the Nazis do when
nations pri,

61
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,130
while the bastards are in the middle of
their plan to blow up the building,

62
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,880
the owners of the cinema in a separate
attack like the whole cinema on fire and

63
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,640
lock the exit doors so the Nazi crowd is
trapped in burnt alive.

64
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,640
Even though the bathrooms mission to
kill everyone in the cinema is

65
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,800
fulfilled,
they still shoot into the crowd of

66
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,440
Nazis.
More unnecessary violence and blogged a

67
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:27,400
cinema even more unnecessary violence.
There's ridiculous files throughout the

68
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,800
film.
People caught off scalps get beat to

69
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:32,470
death with baseball bats and get shot in
the testicles.

70
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,160
Both nation's pride and inglorious
bastards contain excessive violence.

71
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,530
Similarities don't stop.
They're both protagonists.

72
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:41,890
Carve Nazi symbols with a knife and are
overly faithful to their country.

73
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,650
Even the shots and nations private
inglorious bastards are similar.

74
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,080
Look at this shot of a person flying out
of the exploding cinema.

75
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,380
Notice the similarities between this
shot and these shots of soldiers falling

76
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:52,810
out of buildings during nation's pride
chair.

77
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,740
Tino is showing that his movie is not
far off from nation's pride.

78
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,950
Even the film titles are comparable
where inglorious bastards is the exact

79
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:01,420
opposite meaning of nations pri.

80
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,030
These films are similar,
so are their respective audiences.

81
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,880
US viewing inglorious bastards and the
Nazis viewing nations pri,

82
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,550
we both praise the violence in the film.
We both cheer on death.

83
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,950
We both get desensitized to the
brutality of it.

84
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,340
By comparing us to the Nazi viewers
Terentino's criticizing our love for

85
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:17,500
excessive violence.
We're a bunch of easy to please

86
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,620
dimwitted audience members who find
entertainment and senseless gruesome

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,500
killings in the same way that the Nazi
viewers are portrayed as simple minded

88
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:27,010
audience members find entertainment in
the over to top violence and nations

89
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,330
pride.
He's poking fun at us.

90
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,150
He's saying where as ridiculous as the
Nazi viewers are looking at other

91
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:35,710
instances of it sort violence and this
is by no means limited to include as

92
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,050
faster.
It's either Tarantino does this in all

93
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,500
of his other films as well.
He sometimes even use his death for

94
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:42,334
comedy.

95
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,700
I said
goodbye,

96
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,230
but I'm as you got to have an opinion.
I mean,

97
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:54,520
do you think that God came down from
Heaven and stop

98
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,190
an accident?

99
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,180
It takes skill to pawn audience into a
world where killing can make up a

100
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,820
punchline,
but there's more to it than that.

101
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,700
The screen desensitizes us.
We can remove ourselves from the

102
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,900
realities of death.
When we watch a film and terrence,

103
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:15,530
you don't knows it.
The extent we can see death as a joke

104
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,570
though is worth making fun of and
nations.

105
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:20,270
Pri provides a good allegory for how
ridiculous we can be.

106
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,510
Is it hypocritical that we can praise
violence in a film yet to announce it in

107
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,640
reality?
One final anecdote about the two films

108
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,180
and their audiences.
While nation's pride is playing shows,

109
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,580
sauna kills the real friedrich solar,
but nobody in the audience notices

110
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,350
because they're so engrossed in the
violence up to fill.

111
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,470
They think the gunshot noise is just
another sound effect is Tarantino making

112
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:39,470
your commentary about how we don't
address or notice deaths in reality and

113
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,450
only pay attendance to the ones in the
movies we adore.

114
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,990
Glorious bastards is not the only felt
to critique it's viewers,

115
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,550
which I need to film that features an
audience.

116
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:49,550
Consider if the directors making a
commentary about the audience actually

117
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:51,110
watching the film,
Wolf of Wall Street.

118
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:53,420
It's about the rise and fall of a
corrupt businessman named Jordan

119
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:55,280
Belfort.
He's unfaithful to his wife,

120
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:58,700
steals money from thousands of people,
has no one who truly loves him and

121
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,230
spends years in jail.
Logically,

122
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,000
we should look at Jordan Belfort as a
dishonest,

123
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,070
despicable man,
but look at the audience in the final

124
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,170
shot of the film.
Do they look like they despise him?

125
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,160
They adore him.
They want to be just like him,

126
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,450
rich and famous.
No matter how much dishonesty and

127
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:13,580
stealing it takes,
just like inglorious bastards.

128
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,910
The director of showing the flaws of us
as an audience is Jordan Belfort.

129
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,970
Really the type of person we should
strive to be like a clever director can

130
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:23,540
use audiences or even crowds of people
as a way of generalizing a society as a

131
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,830
whole.
It's most interesting.

132
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,750
However,
when the commentary is centered on the

133
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,820
viewers of the film who are far from
perfect.

134
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,580
So the next time you see any movie that
features an audience,

135
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,500
ask yourself,
are they making fun of me?

136
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,700
[inaudible].
