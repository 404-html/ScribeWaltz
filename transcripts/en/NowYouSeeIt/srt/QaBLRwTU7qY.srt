1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,860
The politicians can pretend it's
something else,

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,890
but Donald Trump calls it radical
Islamic terror.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,290
Right now,
I don't want to talk politics.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,380
I don't want to talk about who you
should vote for or whose campaign ads

5
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:13,750
are more effective.
What I do want to talk about is how

6
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:17,440
campaign ads brainwash you using 100
year old film making techniques.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,470
The technique is called the montage,
and it was one of the first visual

8
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:22,540
storytelling techniques and film to
start.

9
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,880
Let's watch the most famous montage of
all time.

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,470
So here's the question.
Do we ever actually see Marion Crane get

11
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:53,471
stabbed?
The closest contact the knife makes is

12
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:55,090
right here.
That's it,

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,030
but with montage,
with a series of images moving rapidly

14
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,910
across the screen,
you can convince the viewer they see her

15
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:04,000
stabbed repeatedly.
The scene consists of quick shots of the

16
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,370
knife,
Marion's body and Marion struggling and

17
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:08,740
screaming when seeing those images all
at once,

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,700
we associate the images with each other
and create a story in our brains of what

19
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:15,010
we saw.
Essentially we got brainwashed.

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,150
Now the third way is what one might call
pure shit.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Imagine the assembly.
All all bill and how come beat chain to

22
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,400
create a different idea.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,220
Here's another montage in citizen Kane.
In 1941,

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,820
it tells the story of Susan Cain being
forced to perform across the country

25
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,760
under the pressure of her husband,
Charles.

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,633
Okay,

27
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,870
here's a more contemporary montage with
two people shooting up heroin.

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,980
We didn't actually see anyone do the
drug,

29
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,740
but the assembly of the images told the
story for us.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,510
Now we have a closed up.
They would show what he listens to.

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,350
You saw a woman holding a baby,
and

32
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,090
now we come back to his reaction to what
is smile now?

33
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:24,111
What is he as a character?
He's a kindly man is sympathetic,

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,070
so let's see how campaign ads do it.
The world a president has to grapple

35
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:31,710
with.
Sometimes you can't even imagine.

36
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,620
That's the job and she's the one who's
proven.

37
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:38,160
She can get it done.
Securing a massive reduction in nuclear

38
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,500
weapons.
In Hillary Clinton's new world campaign

39
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,180
ad,
we cut from the White House and it's

40
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:45,600
long white pillows to Hillary Clinton
walking in front of more long white

41
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:49,020
pillars to her walking off the plane to
her talking with Vladimir Putin.

42
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,650
Now these editors have thousands and
thousands of pictures of Hillary Clinton

43
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:54,210
to choose from.
For this commercial,

44
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,900
it is no coincidence that they chose an
image of the White House and then three

45
00:02:57,901 --> 00:03:01,870
clips of common activities and locations
we associate with presidents,

46
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,990
the walking by the White House pillars,
the leaving Air Force One,

47
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:08,950
the talking with other world leaders all
reinforced with the use of the phrase

48
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,190
that's the job.
These editors are using a montage of

49
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,100
images to make us Imagine Hillary
Clinton as president.

50
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,530
When we see her working hard in these
familiar spaces,

51
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,980
we imagined her filling those same shoes
and see her as a president in a

52
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,420
positive,
familiar way,

53
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,900
but montage and campaign ads can also go
from positive to threatening.

54
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,690
Now,
let's take the middle piece of film

55
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,240
away.
The woman with the child,

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,300
but leave his two pieces of promos.
They will.

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,540
Now we'll put in a piece of film of a
girl in a bikini.

58
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,260
He looks
good in a bikini.

59
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,100
You smile.
What is he now?

60
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,910
A dirty old man.
He's no longer a little bit nine

61
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,940
gentleman who loves baby.
That's different.

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,150
That's what film can do for you.

63
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,610
All right?
More not just abroad,

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,690
but here at home with the clear and
present threat of radical Islamic

65
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:05,770
terrorism.
On the march,

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,660
we must secure our borders.
Washington continues to fail us with

67
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,320
groups like the gang of eight that
support amnesty and allow sanctuary

68
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:14,860
cities.

69
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,340
This video shows radical terrorists and
illegal immigrants in a menacing,

70
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,830
dark green tint,
followed by the capital in front of a

71
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,990
thunderstorm,
followed by Marco Rubio.

72
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,690
This montage,
along with the tent and grainy found

73
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:27,670
footage.
Look cinematically associates,

74
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:30,850
Marco Rubio with something Americans
fear the most terrorism.

75
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,140
The montage manipulates the audience to
see Rubio at has policies as terrorist

76
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,600
friendly.
What immediately follows is Ted Cruz in

77
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:40,240
bright saturated light speaking in front
of a large crowd,

78
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,850
surfing as a metaphorical savior to
Marco Rubio.

79
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:44,380
In the first half of the Commercial

80
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,840
America needs Ted Cruz.
The one proven conservative for

81
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:49,450
president,

82
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,550
uh,
Donald Trump ad uses a similar technique

83
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:55,330
by fading out from Hillary Clinton and
Barack Obama to Muslim looking people

84
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,940
and an ambulance carrying an injured
person in the background.

85
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:58,240
Yeah,

86
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,580
the politicians can pretend it's
something else,

87
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,640
but Donald Trump calls it radical
Islamic terror.

88
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,900
These montages are carefully assembled
to associate Clinton and Obama with

89
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:09,820
terrorism,
with the right images in the right

90
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,410
order.
You can create whatever emotional

91
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,720
response that you want.
I want to make it clear that this video

92
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:17,260
is supposed to be nonpartisan.
Republican ideology allows for more

93
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:21,010
brutal campaign ads because they want to
show Democrats are soft on terrorism,

94
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,760
democrats to be just as brutal because
also portray Republicans as vicious

95
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,480
warmongers.
Think about it,

96
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,210
I would bomb the out of home.
One of these republicans carpet bomb

97
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:34,350
them into oblivion,
could actually be president.

98
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,550
Here we see a montage generalizing the
Republican candidates,

99
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:40,160
keeping them in low saturation,
low quality footage,

100
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,950
and physically shrinking them in small
aspect ratios,

101
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,880
and of course Hillary's clips are bright
and take up the whole street aid who can

102
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,800
stop them?
Hillary Clinton.

103
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,340
I wouldn't be surprised if Hillary
campaigners made a montage of wounded

104
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:55,370
soldiers like Nixon did in one campaign
out in 1968,

105
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,010
never had so much military and

106
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,400
diplomatic power been used so
ineffectively as in Vietnam.

107
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,250
The point is that the assembly of images
is extremely powerful.

108
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,830
Everybody does it,
and it's not just limited to movies.

109
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,740
This form of cinematic brainwashing
happens all the time,

110
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,290
not only in campaign ads but also other
commercials.

111
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,590
Beer commercials don't sell beer.
They sell an idea and that idea is

112
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:20,870
conveyed through a montage of people
smiling,

113
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,370
being social,
and having fun,

114
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,140
so know that more goes into campaign ads
than you might've thought,

115
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,780
and remember not to just vote for the
candidate who's editor.

116
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,110
Put images together the best.
My name is Jack Newton and I approved

117
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:34,570
this message.
Thanks for awhile.

118
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,060
Slightly full.
Just a bit of a break from the norm.

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,760
Just a little slot in the break,
but may not need a ball bat hot.
