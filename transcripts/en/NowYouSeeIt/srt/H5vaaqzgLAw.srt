1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,560
Yes,

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,260
Hollywood is a crazy world.
Even crazier history.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,840
It's conniving,
competitive and above all risky.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,990
I think to analyze movies,
it's important to understand the context

5
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:19,240
surrounding the production of the movie
that's mentioned.

6
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:20,620
It's also extremely interesting,

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,000
separate Hollywood's life into five
distinct areas and see the thievery,

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,880
desperation and failure in the industry.
Starting with

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,100
the first movies actually began far away
from Hollywood,

10
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:43,410
California.
All movies before 1911,

11
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,750
like the great train robbery in the
first Frankenstein movies were filmed

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,900
entirely on the east coast.
In fact,

13
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:51,600
the all too familiar term cliffhanger,
most likely,

14
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,990
originates from a series called the
peril of poly in 1914,

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,930
which was filmed in the former motion
picture capital of the country,

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,340
Fort Lee,
New Jersey.

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,560
The move to Hollywood happened for
several reasons.

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,960
It was cheaper.
There was nice weather year round in

19
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:05,850
California,
provided a lot of distinct film

20
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:07,890
locations.
Nothing illustrates this better than

21
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:10,620
paramount's description of the region.
One reason hardly talked about,

22
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,690
however,
is the fact that these million dollar

23
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:16,380
motion picture industries were fleeing
to California so they could more easily

24
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:18,150
break the law in 1891.

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,660
Thomas Edison patented the kinetic
breath that technology used to film

26
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,870
movies with his patent.
He had a legal monopoly on the entire

27
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,300
industry,
even at control over movie projectors

28
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:30,180
and film distributors.
Edison aggressively sued many people

29
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,360
using his adventure,
going so far as to hiring thugs to smash

30
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:37,260
cameras and rate independent studios.
Filmmakers like Fox and paramount had to

31
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:40,440
flee to the west coast so they could
make their movies outside of Edison's

32
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,720
influenced.
So technically any movie made before

33
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:45,240
1917,
not from Thomas Edison's production

34
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,800
company was completely illegal.
In 1917,

35
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:50,280
in the United States,
supreme court ruled his monopoly

36
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:54,030
unlawful and against public interest.
It's interesting how an industry founded

37
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,360
on breaking the rules is now
aggressively taking video essays down on

38
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:59,760
Youtube despite their obvious fair use.
But I digress.

39
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,193
Shall we try it right?

40
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,720
In the late 19 tents,
America cinema transitioned into what

41
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:16,120
we're familiar with,
the booming Hollywood industry.

42
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,150
The industry skyrocketed.
A key innovation was the addition of

43
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:22,630
dialogue in the late 19 twenties,
which kept the industry afloat popular

44
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:24,430
and innovative throughout the Great
Depression.

45
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,330
The era between 1917 in the late 19
forties is commonly referred to as

46
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:31,050
studio system Hollywood.
This is one production companies had

47
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,460
decade long contracts with actors,
directors,

48
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,260
and writers.
If you think the movie industry has

49
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:38,020
monopolized now,
know that five studios had control of

50
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:42,460
absolutely everything in the 19 forties.
Each major company had ownership of

51
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,630
actors,
directors,

52
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,610
distribution,
and even the movie theaters.

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,970
Creators could only make it an industry
if they stuck with one company for

54
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:53,110
almost their entire careers by signing
longterm and sometimes very unfair

55
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:56,740
contracts out of this era came.
Classics such as Gone With the wind,

56
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,500
Snow White and the seven dwarves and the
original Kong.

57
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,040
One interesting aspect of this time
period is that with so many movies being

58
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,560
made and so many people flocking to the
theater movie,

59
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:09,040
companies could afford producing movies
with medium sized budgets and scripts

60
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,790
that weren't necessarily blockbuster
material like citizen Kane and Casa

61
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,331
Blanca.
Nowadays,

62
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:17,200
big companies pull most of their time
and resources into several big budget

63
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:18,960
movies a year,
which is quite a shame.

64
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,850
The end of this era came from another
battle with the courts.

65
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,330
The Supreme Court ruled against
paramount pictures saying ownership of

66
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,840
the theaters and distribution of their
films was a restriction of fair trade.

67
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,380
This loss of control of distribution
protected independent filmmakers,

68
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,270
but meant to decline in the big
industry.

69
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,430
The next hit to movie popularity was
television.

70
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,040
Television hurt the industry.
Since many people could stay at home to

71
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:47,750
get their entertainment.
Movie viewership plummeted in the 30,

72
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,710
60 percent of people went to the movie
theaters at least once a week,

73
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:54,070
but since the 19 sixties,
the number has consistently stuck around

74
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,920
only 10 percent to combat TV.
Movies had to do what?

75
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:59,680
TV couldn't do,
big screens and big budgets.

76
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,220
The Hollywood epic came into fruition.
This is when movies got absolutely

77
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:05,590
insane.
Cinema scope lenses stretched the screen

78
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:07,780
to almost twice the size of conventional
film.

79
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,330
There were movies like Cleopatra in
1963,

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,720
which was the highest grossing film of
the year and still didn't make back its

81
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,940
budget.
One of its huge hundred foot set pieces

82
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:20,020
had to be built twice in two separate
countries because the lead Elizabeth

83
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,920
Taylor got sick

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,230
soon.
The new Hollywood era broke through.

85
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,260
Starting with Bonnie and Clyde,
film school trained directors gained

86
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:34,680
major influence in the industry as
opposed to the producers of old

87
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:37,590
Hollywood with low budget hits like jaws
by Steven Spielberg,

88
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:39,600
Star Wars by George Lucas and the
Godfather,

89
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:40,530
right?
Francis Coppola.

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,710
Producers gave more control to the
filmmakers who in turn produced more

91
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:44,910
provocative,
diverse,

92
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:46,650
and innovative movies.
Personally,

93
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:49,920
I find this atmosphere the most
conducive to amazing filmmaking,

94
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,840
but it came at a price with such
freedom.

95
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:55,380
Several films got way out of hand.
Many directors took their power too far

96
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:57,600
and movie budget skyrocketed out of
control.

97
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,110
Apocalypse now as an extreme example,
there's a documentary on the production

98
00:05:01,111 --> 00:05:04,710
process of the movie called heart of
darkness that I absolutely recommend I

99
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:08,160
cannot come close to describing the
mayhem of making that movie in such a

100
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:10,920
short video.
Hurricanes heart attacks a coup in the

101
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:11,760
country they filmed.

102
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,290
It's crazy with apocalypse now in 1979
and the box office bombed heaven's gate

103
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,140
in 1980 bankrupting a huge production
company.

104
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,990
Producers tighten their grip on
filmmakers,

105
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,030
which makes absolute sense,
and what happened was in the seventies,

106
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:26,100
all those filmmakers that dig a final
cut,

107
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,000
the budgets grew and grew and each one,
one after the other had a financial

108
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:32,820
disaster that almost tore down the
studios.

109
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,100
If you treat the movie industry like an
actual business,

110
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,970
it's definitely one of the riskiest one
movie the public hates and it cripples

111
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,100
the company.
Millions are on the line and with

112
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:44,310
continuously decreasing ticket sales
companies had to adapt.

113
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,110
Now we're at the movie industry as we
know it today with home video in the

114
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:51,390
nineties and streaming services like
Netflix.

115
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:54,420
It's hardly worth it to drive all the
way to a movie theater anymore,

116
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,940
so companies make a handful of movies
and promote them.

117
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,650
Crazy superheros and fantasy movies
dominate box office sales because those

118
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,690
are the movies that are worth seeing on
the big screen.

119
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,810
Movies like pop star in the nice guys
bond this year because they're light

120
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,990
comedies and frankly I'm willing to wait
for them to come to Netflix and a couple

121
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,970
of months.
What's amazing about this era is that it

122
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,610
gets easier and easier to make feature
length movies.

123
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,970
I bought a used dslr camera tripod,
memory card case,

124
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:20,680
and editing software for less than $600.
You don't need a huge movie of

125
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,090
conglomerate to get your voice heard and
your art noticed.

126
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,310
Hollywood becomes more and more obsolete
every day.

127
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,020
So pick up your iphone,
hit record,

128
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:27,920
and say,
action.

129
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,083
Thanks for watching.

130
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,360
Just
need a ball bat.
