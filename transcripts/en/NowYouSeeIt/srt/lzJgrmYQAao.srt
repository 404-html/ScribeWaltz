1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,260
In a womb,
in a world world or old world.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,690
You know what?
Hey,

3
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:15,060
make sure your phone's turned off.
I think we're getting some feedback out

4
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:20,061
here.
A trailer boils down to four main

5
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:22,770
elements,
plot,

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,120
characters,
conflict,

7
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,410
and the cliffhanger.
Really,

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,770
each trailer is its own unique short
story that happens to pull all its clips

9
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:30,810
from one movie.
The only real difference between a

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:32,820
trailer and a short story is the
cliffhanger.

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,730
A trailer's main goal is to get people
to want to see the movie.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,280
The cliffhanger is basically what's
missing from the trailer,

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,910
the part that has to be enjoyed by
purchasing an $11 ticket to see the

14
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,370
movie yourself.
So how do you make a trailer that's so

15
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:46,260
good?
It's safe to say the movie will do well

16
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:47,320
to stop.
Okay.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,650
Safety first.
Safety is safety is first.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,050
Let's look at the history of trailers
structure and see why.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,180
Even today,
some trailers are still pretty

20
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:58,410
forgettable since the 1950s trailers had
a narrator basically just tell us the

21
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,630
four elements.
They'd say who the characters were,

22
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:02,460
what the conflict was,
the plot,

23
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,110
and whatever makes the movie worth
seeing.

24
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,770
Now here at Connie Tam and all the other
wonderful people and this unforgettable

25
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:09,990
stories,
clips from the movie only accompany the

26
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:11,910
narration.
So for the majority of cinematic

27
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,890
history,
the trailer was more or less a sales

28
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:16,080
pitch by some narrator.
Tell us the character,

29
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,960
tell us the conflict,
tell us why it's worth seeing and show a

30
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:22,440
few clips to keep us from getting bored.
Maybe throw in some silly music if it's

31
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:25,200
a comedy or something epic,
if it's action or drama.

32
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,720
Although some trailers from this time
were very well made.

33
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,570
The psychos trailer,
it's narrated by Alfred Hitchcock as he

34
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:33,390
walks through the bates motel and in
this house,

35
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,380
the most die,
a horrible event took place.

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,800
But as trailers had to get shorter to
fit into TV commercial breaks,

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,900
they became more formulaic.
Think about the stereotypical inner

38
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,050
worlds trailer.
It's a narrator telling us the

39
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:48,030
characters telling us the plot,
the conflict,

40
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:51,890
and the cliffhanger at new door cop,
John McLean to see his wife

41
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,610
and it's not just for action movies.
Comedies have a similar formula.

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,280
Tell us everything.
Sprinkle in some jokes along the way.

43
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,810
Her name is Samantha Baker and today is
her 16th birthday.

44
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,110
The problem arose when this format
became predictable and boring.

45
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,710
The inner world style of trailer now
gets parodied more often than actually

46
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:15,140
used in a world where laughter was king.
Uh,

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,560
no.
In a world.

48
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,870
Yeah.
I do have to be careful generalizing

49
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,840
though because while the majority of
trailers did follow the formula,

50
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,870
there have always been trailers that
stands out.

51
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,330
Yeah,

52
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,540
I need to talk to Mary came over last
night.

53
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,320
I want a salad last night because I was
upset that Joe was getting married and

54
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,560
before I knew what we were kissing and
nationally short we did it,

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,590
they take it,
but eventually even the average trailer

56
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,560
started getting more creative and most
importantly more efficient.

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,410
The short story of the trailer is
limited to around two minutes.

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,170
If there's any way to say more in less
time than perfect.

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,350
First cut out the narrator and
incorporate voiceovers from characters

60
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,450
in the movie.
This change makes the most sense.

61
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,860
If we use character voice,
so for,

62
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:55,950
we could have plot and conflict
introduced while also introducing the

63
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:59,350
characters.
So I'm going to have to science the shit

64
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,184
out of it.
Second,

65
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,450
we don't need the character telling us
the cliffhanger show,

66
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:04,450
the cliffhanger.
We want to see light sabers if we're

67
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,940
seeing a star wars movie,
so the best way to make a trailer for

68
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:10,330
star wars tease us and to the trailer
right before the light sabers hit,

69
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,850
the trailer is sending a message.
If you pay for a ticket,

70
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:17,851
you will get to see this.
Third is the built start with something

71
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:20,720
familiar,
something normal then disrupted.

72
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,300
Does it live on the Great Plains of
Africa?

73
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,030
No.
Hey,

74
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,740
make the clips,
get faster,

75
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,950
the music louder and then peak followed
by some resolution.

76
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,970
Many early trailers never did this,
but it's since become the norm,

77
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,710
but that's the problem.
These techniques have become so normal

78
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,050
that they aren't enough to make a
trailer stand out anymore.

79
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,260
The vague dialogue,
the over the top music,

80
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,210
it's very familiar to us.
Like that last line of the trailer

81
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,360
that's supposed to be really epic,
but it's so vague that it hardly makes

82
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:54,720
any.

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,020
Since I saw you,
I believed it was side.

84
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,780
It's something new can come into this
world.

85
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,940
One way trailers combat with monotony,
it's through making more unique trailers

86
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:10,880
where the sequence of shots gives the
four main elements instead of a

87
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:14,630
voiceover telling us the conflict and
telling us the plot with the right clips

88
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:18,110
from the movie in the right order.
We see the plot and conflict in the

89
00:04:18,111 --> 00:04:21,290
American sniper trailer.
Chris Kyle has his sights on a child he

90
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:25,010
may have to shoot to protect his team.
Chris Kyle's internal conflict,

91
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,010
not addressed in voiceover but in the
sequence of clicks

92
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,980
and the cliffhanger,
whether he pulls the trigger,

93
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,570
maybe show a scene between the two main
characters in their secret identities

94
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,650
and cut back and forth between their
talk and them as superheroes.

95
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,600
I have a bad history with stress,
like clowns

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,720
show an entire scene in a movie,
not with cut after cut and not with

97
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:59,120
ridiculous music and voiceover in the
background.

98
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,570
Just a good scene that makes for a
memorable trailer and partly why the

99
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:05,030
furious seven trailer one the golden
trailer award.

100
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,940
I think in a lot of ways movie trailers
are like car commercials.

101
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,460
The majority of commercials are
relatively the same.

102
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,560
Show the car driving around and looking
cool.

103
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:16,370
While a narrator brags about the car,
half the car stop announced its name and

104
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:19,250
show the brand logo.
Obviously this type of commercial gets

105
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:22,040
car salt because it's used all the time,
but it's boring.

106
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,710
It may be cheaper and easy to write,
but it's so familiar.

107
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,520
It's the unique car commercials that go
viral or are really funny or different

108
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,730
that are probably the most valuable
because they create buzz and get shared

109
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,920
all across social media.

110
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,390
Pauline,

111
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,440
maybe most trailers will continue with a
more formulaic presentation of the four

112
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,330
elements,
but those ones that stand out,

113
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,460
the cool trailers,
do you want to share on facebook and

114
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:46,860
talk about with their friends?
Those are the ones with the bank for

115
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:47,694
their,
yeah.

116
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,040
Damn.
