1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,670
I mean the guys in that Prince Movie,
Purple Rain,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,880
that shit was so gay fucking 80 style.
It was sitting and I was gone.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,870
What about the time?
There's no doubt that every era of

4
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:16,170
movies looks back on previous era's one
full generation before.

5
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:18,900
It's far enough back to reflect on while
still being fresh.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,740
So it's pretty common for directors and
producers to make movies and TV shows

7
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,220
that take place in that previous
generation in the generation they grew

8
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:28,110
up in.
It's a wonderful life goes from the

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,500
forties to the twenties back to the
future goes from the eighties to the

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,770
fifties and that's 70 show goes from the
two thousands to the seventies and the

11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:38,970
same thing goes for the 2010 looking
back on the 1980s but this era seems to

12
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:43,290
have more of a craze than a simple Omaj
to the eighties countless movies and TV

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:43,741
shows,
gift,

14
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:46,080
meticulous detail to the movies,
video games,

15
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:49,800
and overall style of that era,
all to critical acclaim and box office

16
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:50,490
success.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,910
Nothing encapsulates our current
obsession with the 1980s more than ready

18
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:57,960
player one a novel turned movie about a
future world where people use virtual

19
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,990
reality to relive old eighties pop
culture and media.

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,850
It doesn't get more eighties obsessed
than that.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,970
I think there are several reasons.
The eighties phenomenon is so much more

22
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:08,490
prominent than the nostalgia of other
generations.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,710
For one thing,
the eighties was the birth of audio

24
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:14,100
visual entertainment with the music
video creating a whole new art form that

25
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:17,880
continues to influence movies today.
It was also the golden age of TV movies.

26
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,060
The teens watching those movies have
since become the movie creators and

27
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:24,780
creating thematically complicated
teenagers paved the way for casting more

28
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,300
kids in lead roles.
But I want to focus on the eighties

29
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:30,750
phenomenon for another reason,
entirely the perfect timing of the 80s

30
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:35,220
created movies designed to be Omaj to
later on movies begging to be revisited,

31
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,740
and that's because of how the directors
and producers made them.

32
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,010
And to understand the eighties creators,
you have to understand where they came

33
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:43,080
from.
Mid Sixties till late seventies films in

34
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:45,120
a period referred to as new age
Hollywood.

35
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,450
We're defined by deviation from
classical cinematic norms.

36
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,640
These films questioned the Hollywood
system,

37
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:54,150
creating more experimental movies,
movies that challenge John or norms,

38
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:56,850
conventional filming techniques and the
Hollywood production code.

39
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,670
Maybe the pinnacle of new age.
Hollywood was Bonnie and Clyde,

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,030
a movie with insane violence,
sexually confused characters and

41
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:05,730
counterculture sentiment.
And in this hotbed of cinematic

42
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,970
experimentation came the pioneers of the
80s blockbuster,

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,060
the creative talent with a hyper
awareness of Hollywood conventions,

44
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,610
conventions.
They themselves knew how to abide by

45
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:16,470
when they wanted and break when they
didn't.

46
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,830
So the eventual leaders of the 80s
blockbuster where the first generation

47
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:23,220
of filmmakers to grow up during
classical Hollywood and then rise to the

48
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:25,980
top during a period of extreme
experimentation.

49
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,730
So their film language is based on
previous films and their style is driven

50
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:32,280
by how they follow or break film
conventions.

51
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,290
And how do I know that's how they made
their movies?

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,920
Because online there's a transcript of
perhaps the two most important eighties

53
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:42,510
directors conceiving the idea for one of
the best movies of the 1980s Steven

54
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,670
Spielberg and George Lucas Discussing
Indiana Jones,

55
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,700
raiders of the lost Ark.
A lot of people enjoy reading the banter

56
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,940
between the two directors and how they
thought of the iconic sequences in the

57
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,920
movie.
But I want to discuss these transcripts

58
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:56,580
with a new Hollywood eighties Omaj
perspective because as you read it,

59
00:02:56,581 --> 00:03:00,520
you realize how their entire means of
communicating comes from building off of

60
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:03,790
previous movies.
Lucas pitched the movie as a Spaghetti

61
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,100
Western or James Bond,
but in the 30s they describe me,

62
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,680
Indiana Jones by comparing him to other
movie characters,

63
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,170
he's professional like me,
food aid from the seven Samurai,

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,300
he has to go against people like Eli
Wallace from the good,

65
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,134
the bad and the ugly.

66
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,460
He's a John Wayne,
Clint Eastwood,

67
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,040
Sean Connery,
kind of professional but scruffy like

68
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,290
Humphrey bogart in treasure of Sierra
Madre.

69
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,440
The action should be like the wind and
the lion and the jungle is King Kong

70
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:23,951
ish.
There.

71
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,950
Language is built on entirely Oman and
in doing so,

72
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:30,850
they create a completely fresh character
and story by using old movies.

73
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,010
But it's more than just using old to
create new.

74
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,640
These creators also want it to capture
the spirit of movies before new age

75
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:40,210
Hollywood movies with less social
commentary and more classic Hollywood

76
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,150
find a movie to instill.
The eighties mindset was undoubtedly

77
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:47,170
star wars in 1977 George Lucas describes
the phenomenon himself.

78
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,620
My main reason for making star wars was
to give young people an honest,

79
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:53,140
wholesome fantasy life.
The kinds my generation had.

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,790
We had westerns,
pirate movies,

81
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,070
all kinds of great things.
Where are the romance,

82
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,690
the adventure,
and the fun that used to be in

83
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:00,460
practically every movie ever made.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,800
He criticized the 70s TV shows at the
time,

85
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,890
like Kojak and the 6 million men that
were popular and well made,

86
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:08,830
but also extremely bleak and almost too
realistic.

87
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,220
Basically they missed out on the fun.
So the 80s blockbuster brought back what

88
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,290
made movies entertaining in the first
place?

89
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,010
James Cameron's the terminator is
inspired by 1950 Psi Phi and the outer

90
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:18,561
limits,
uh,

91
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:21,670
1960 Scifi show,
as are a lot of other eighties movies

92
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:24,610
like e t and ghostbusters.
And notice how these later movies don't

93
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,940
make aliens horrific or bleak.
They make aliens whimsical and fun.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,820
Even the princess bride,
a fantasy movie seems to perfectly

95
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,400
capture the George Lucas and Steven
Spielberg spirit.

96
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,180
Many sixties and seventies teen movies
are defined by their oversized

97
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:40,090
characters or plots with extreme sexual
deviations.

98
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,000
This is Robinson you're trying to
seduce.

99
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,000
John Hughes was one of the first to
create an honest portrayal of teenagers,

100
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,060
one defined by clumsy romance and
entertaining hi-jinks.

101
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,210
I think Roger Ebert sums up what these
eighties creators accomplished in his

102
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:55,210
review of Indiana Jones.
This movie celebrates the stories we

103
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,690
spent our adolescent searching for in
the pulpit adventure magazines in the

104
00:04:58,691 --> 00:04:59,830
novels,
in comics,

105
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,530
even in the movies.
So I think that's the biggest reason why

106
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,980
eighties movies are so popular today and
why stranger things has dozens of

107
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,180
eighties movies.
References.

108
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,840
San Junipero won two emmy's and it is
the highest grossing horror movie of all

109
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:13,090
time.
The movies of the 80s capture the spirit

110
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:16,210
of entertainment and these modern Oh
matias want to do the same when you

111
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:17,990
watch another 80s movie made in the
present day,

112
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,400
notice how there's almost always some
shot where we see what blockbuster is

113
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:24,580
currently out in theaters at the time.
Eighties movies reinvigorated that

114
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:27,970
Hollywood blockbuster and that's why we
look back to that time period when we're

115
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:30,640
trying to do the same today.
So the next time you see a big budget

116
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,950
eighties movie coming out,
remember there's some part of that

117
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,790
director trying to capture the spirit
that made 80s movies so timeless and fun

118
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,740
to watch because they really did have
everything

119
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,450
sporks in it.
I you kidding?

120
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,590
Same Shane fighting torture,
revenge,

121
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,990
giant monsters,
chases,

122
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,560
escapes,
troll love miracles.

123
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,100
Those are some too bad we're trying to
stay away.
