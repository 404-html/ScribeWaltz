1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,180
Let me give you an image that's a
cliche,

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,970
but it's an image.
John Wayne.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,760
Oh God.
Couldn't we start with someone easier?

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,760
Let me ask you a question.
Has John Wayne ever been at a loss of

5
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:12,900
words?
Seriously,

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,320
go watch your favorite John Wayne
Classic and pay attention to how he

7
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:19,260
speaks over his 40 year career
regardless of his age,

8
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,250
character,
or mood.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,990
He almost always talks,
but the same.

10
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:26,310
Iconic masculine confidence and control.
He always has the right thing to say in

11
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,090
as few words as possible.
Envelope.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,930
That'll be the day even when he's angry,
he's not really angry.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,930
He never loses his cool.
He never stammered screams or even

14
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:40,050
improvises.
Lost my temper in 40 years,

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,900
but pilgrim,
you caused a lot of trouble this

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,200
morning.
Might've got somebody killed somebody

17
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,830
out a belt,
chewing them out.

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,380
Even at his worst.
He doesn't lose that cool John Wayne

19
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,240
presence,
and there's actually something amazing

20
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:53,490
about that ability,
and I'm not saying this makes him a bad

21
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,301
actor.
Actually,

22
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,000
many studio Hollywood actors had a
limited vocal range.

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,340
Whether Humphrey Bogart was a private
investigator.

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,730
Actually,
Jack,

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,480
if he didn't eat a nightclub owner where
I'm going,

26
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,660
you can follow what I've got to do.
You can be any product or even an

27
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,730
Irishman.
I would hoping that maybe in the state

28
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:12,990
of mind,
he always had his trademark voice.

29
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,280
It explains why some actors at that time
are so easy to imitate it.

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,040
You got any girlfriends at the same
problem bringing them over and John

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,873
Wayne is no exception.

32
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:29,220
The John Wayne still seems to stand out.
His complete control.

33
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,130
His whole persona has an almost mythic
quality to it,

34
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,100
so you're a men's only good for one node
at a time.

35
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,520
It's as if he's created a certain idea
for masculine authority through his

36
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:41,310
voice.
There's an idea of talking like John

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,230
Wayne,
but post-classical method acting ushered

38
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:45,900
in a wave of chameleon.
Actors like Marlin Brando,

39
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,490
Robert De Niro,
and Meryl Streep,

40
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,700
actors who morphed to their voices and
disappeared into their roles.

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,030
Any attempt at imitating Daniel Day,
Lewis would probably result in simply

42
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,060
imitating one of his characters,
not the actual actor,

43
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,660
because he does them all so differently.
The use of complex voice acting not only

44
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:04,440
created more immersive performances,
but actors and directors now use voice

45
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,690
in more complicated ways to tell their
story.

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,700
It's not always about what a character
says,

47
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:12,360
but how and when they say it,
voice shows the characters control of a

48
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,100
scene or their lack of control.

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,040
I want to use voice acting as a means
for analyzing one of the most

50
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,110
complicated characters in film.
Daniel,

51
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:22,410
plainview in there will be blood and I
think to understand Daniel plainview,

52
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,960
you have to first understand talking
like John Wayne.

53
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,380
Get off your heart and head into the
Solo.

54
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,180
John Wayne's big break came in 1939 in
stagecoach and his introduction starts

55
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:36,630
his streak of vocal control right from
the beginning.

56
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:40,950
John Wayne has a mastery of voice after
a long montage of stage coach ride and

57
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:44,430
he's the one that can stop the entire
narrative with a single command and

58
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,620
notice what else is going on.
In his introduction shot,

59
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,180
he immediately establishes himself as a
master of his own movement through his

60
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,880
flashy gun turn,
the epic pushing of the camera toward

61
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:57,750
his face and the mythical quality of the
background like he manifested out of the

62
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:00,820
West.
Here we see fearlessness and mastery and

63
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:02,560
the whole film stops to accommodate him.

64
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,910
The remainder of the scene presents
another interesting phenomenon.

65
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,570
Invoice in 1939 editors.
We're still tinkering with how to cut

66
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:14,170
dialogue and the camera would stay on a
character most or all the time they were

67
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,420
talking except for John Wayne.
In this scene,

68
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,720
you'll notice he's the only character
that talks while the camera focuses on

69
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:23,170
other characters and they expect to see
you riding shotgun on this run.

70
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,550
Marshall,
as he talks,

71
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:28,150
it cuts to reactions or he talks away
from the camera as he approaches the

72
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:30,310
stage coach.
Even in his first big movie,

73
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,720
even as Ringo,
the kid,

74
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,060
and even right at his character
introduction,

75
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:36,520
his voice could control the movement all
on its own.

76
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,340
He has an almost directorial influence
on the story.

77
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:42,730
There's a distinct power to talking
without being seen in the same way that

78
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:45,430
a narrator of a story has a godlike
quality to them.

79
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,181
If they talk,
well,

80
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:48,250
not interviewed,
that means they're still controlling the

81
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:51,340
scene even when they aren't there.
In John Wayne's introductory scene,

82
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:54,700
we see two methods of showing control,
directing the narrative through voice

83
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,550
and controlling the camera,
and he's not the only one to control

84
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,440
this wet,
please.

85
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,660
We actually also here Daniel plainview,
before we see him speaking,

86
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,500
I've traveled over half our state like
John Wayne.

87
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,320
He shows narrative control in his
character introduction.

88
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,990
He establishes he's the only one
qualified to drill,

89
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,790
and when people try to interrupt his
narrative,

90
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,650
he ignores them.
What is your offer?

91
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,450
We're wasting time.
I do my own drilling.

92
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,120
His authority does get challenged when
the crowd uproars,

93
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:30,910
but he simply leaves changing the
narrative to what he wants.

94
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,860
Refusing to not have total control.

95
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,580
No,
no,

96
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,820
no.
There's no confusion.

97
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,480
Doesn't take the leash

98
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,550
and controls the movement of the camera.
It stops when he stops.

99
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,310
It moves.
When he moves after another voice of God

100
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:47,750
transition,
we see him get elise.

101
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,690
How he wants shifting the conversation
to be about family,

102
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:53,150
to win them over.
Another way to show control in a movie

103
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,280
is through controlling the voices of
others.

104
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,860
This can be as simple as regulating when
people talk

105
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,880
or regulating what they're allowed to
say,

106
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,840
man,
we

107
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,060
associate what people say with what
they're thinking,

108
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,740
what they believe in,
and what they want.

109
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,980
If you control what someone can say,
you control everything about them.

110
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,650
Shame my name.
In any scene,

111
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,350
a character's voice can show control in
these factors,

112
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,200
how voice directs the narrative,
how the voice controls the shot,

113
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:26,330
and how characters control the voices of
others.

114
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,390
It's usually a combination of the three
double you motherfucker.

115
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,550
In reality,
everybody wishes they had the control of

116
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:37,130
voice like John Wayne.
Even when people disagree with him,

117
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:40,580
he still drives the narrative and it has
complete mastery of the world around

118
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,290
him.
He may sometimes be a flawed hero,

119
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:46,070
but the floor is never in his voice,
so we always had some level of control.

120
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,660
In Red River,
he gets betrayed,

121
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:50,510
but his voice makes it clear that he'll
end up with what he wants.

122
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,830
Every time you turn around and expect to
see me one time,

123
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:58,220
you'll turn around and I'll be there,
but the problem with John Wayne's

124
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,140
authority,
it never gets questioned.

125
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,960
Even when he loses,
he still talks in that confident air,

126
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,140
never completely losing his mastery of
the world of the West.

127
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,530
What makes there will be blood so well
written is how carefully each scene

128
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,140
tests,
power dynamics through voice and Daniel

129
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,770
Plain fuse iconic presence does get
challenged in inventive ways to the

130
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:19,340
point where the film seems to question
whether or not a John Wayne like vocal

131
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,950
control is ever possible or even
desired.

132
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,920
Daniel plainview actually gets a pretty
worthy opponent in the film.

133
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,790
Eli Sunday is a gifted orator and he
constantly questions playing views,

134
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,090
vocal authority.
Do you started to

135
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,740
take a seemingly benign conversation?
Plainview has with Eli Sunday.

136
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,920
What appears to be Eli,
just making a simple request is actually

137
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,140
a carefully coated fight for vocal
control.

138
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,560
Eli starts with some innocent Chit Chat,
which plain view doesn't engage in

139
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,970
spirit seem high.

140
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,770
Then Eli chooses to see himself without
being offered.

141
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,670
Here we see Eli taking initiative,
contrasting his brother's politeness in

142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,970
an earlier seed.
Can I sit down please?

143
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,870
The scene becomes about vocal control.
When Eli asks to speak at the induction

144
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:08,310
of the well,
I will bless the.

145
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:12,450
Well actually he doesn't ask.
He says he will directing the speech as

146
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,070
he wants it.
Before you begin,

147
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:15,660
you should introduce me.
Of course,

148
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:18,120
plainview correction,
but Eli ignores his correction.

149
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,100
You'll see me walk up.
He even provides him a script and then

150
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:28,101
you could say the proud son of these
hills who tended his father's flock,

151
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,900
plainview bates,
him letting him pick the time.

152
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,300
Well,
let's make it 4:00 then and then it cuts

153
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:36,000
to the actual induction where Eli is
supposed to speak,

154
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,850
but plainview directs it his way,
pulling up the little girl and

155
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:40,290
performing his own script.

156
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,080
He does it all on his own.
Ignoring Eli's request.

157
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,770
The camera hovers on Eli as plainview
blesses the well and his voice of God

158
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:48,660
dominates the scene,
and Eli,

159
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,840
he even manipulated Eli's words and
makes them his own number one name for

160
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,950
the lovely ms dot every Sunday here by
my side,

161
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,590
a proud daughter of these hills and a
simple sequence plain view gives up the

162
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:00,930
win.
Let's Eli's guard down and deans back

163
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,140
control of directing the moment how he
wanted controlling the camera and

164
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:07,440
controlling Eli's words,
but Eli shouldn't be underestimated as a

165
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,840
character.
He speaks very well and is the vocal

166
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:12,480
leader of the town.
It's two directors pitted against each

167
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:14,220
other.
One directs the congregation.

168
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,250
The other directs the oil.
The next focal showdown between the two

169
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:20,370
comes in Eli's territory.
When plain view has to get baptized.

170
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,460
Notice Eli already starts in control.
When we hear his voice,

171
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:28,080
before we see him speak,
I truly wish everyone could be saved.

172
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:32,700
Don't chew.
He directs when the congregation speaks.

173
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,200
Of course,
plainview resists,

174
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:37,950
but Eli subjugates him.
He has to respond to as directed by Eli.

175
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,760
What do you want me to show you?
Life forces him to say exactly what he

176
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:45,930
wants and what he's insecure about.
I have a bend in my child

177
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,380
and in a complete reversal,
Eli speaks as the voice of God

178
00:08:53,381 --> 00:08:55,120
throughout.
While we focus on plain,

179
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,080
it's a total opposite to the last
confrontation you like,

180
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,090
gives him the lines and he has to recite
them,

181
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,690
forcing plainview to for the first time,
lose his vocal control.

182
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,820
The next time they see each other is at
the end of the movie.

183
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,770
Even though Eli asks for help in this
scene,

184
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:16,040
he still starts off in control.
The camera follows him and he asserts

185
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:19,130
himself by making them drinks.
When plain view agrees to work with him,

186
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:24,040
he says he'll do it on one condition.
I'd like you to tell me that you are to

187
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,270
have been false prophet
because God is a superstition and now

188
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:32,230
playing view is the director.
Again.

189
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,053
No,

190
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,213
put your glass down.

191
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,600
In theory,
plainview has bested him,

192
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:45,870
but it doesn't really feel like a John
Wayne kind of local control.

193
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,730
I did watch
beach.

194
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,350
It's a bastardized version because at
the end,

195
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:54,720
plain winds,
but he's not in control.

196
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,040
He spirals completely out of control.
Towards the end,

197
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,540
he phones from the mouth,
stutter,

198
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,630
screams,
and grunts.

199
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,880
He loses mastery of everything in this
scene.

200
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,250
Even his walk,
when we think of John Wayne's grace,

201
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,460
it's also in his walk.
Plainview stumbles around incomplete,

202
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,323
erratic,
chaotic,

203
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,023
yes.

204
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,710
He doesn't have control at all.
Another relationship that showcases his

205
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:21,200
lack of vocal control is with his
adopted son,

206
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,690
hw at first do they work together as
partners,

207
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:26,690
but when he becomes deaf,
they lose their ability to communicate

208
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,530
and in short,
plainview doesn't know what to do with

209
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:32,600
him.
He's no longer an asset to the company

210
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:34,520
in plainview,
sends him away years later,

211
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:38,150
hw returns with his translator,
and plainview tries to control him

212
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:41,750
vocally by forcing him to speak,
becoming threatened when he considers

213
00:10:41,751 --> 00:10:45,080
how a competitor you speak instead of
your little dog wolf,

214
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,500
full,
full,

215
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:45,971
full,
full,

216
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:46,790
full,
full.

217
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,560
So again,
he gets vocal control,

218
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:51,950
but at what cost?
It's cruel and doesn't feel like mastery

219
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,680
in a lot of what he says.
Daniel plainview may have the vocal

220
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,330
influence,
but he's a con man.

221
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,240
In one of his monologues,
he elegantly talks about the schools,

222
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,730
he'll build the wheat,
he'll grow and the importance of family

223
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:04,100
values,
but the visual show only men and no

224
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:07,520
school's irrigation or farmland,
just people preparing the drilling.

225
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,180
His Voice of God authority tricks us
even though plain view constantly talks

226
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:14,300
about bringing wealth to the town,
there are actually very few signs of him

227
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:17,450
improving the town.
There's a sort of false sense of control

228
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:19,790
when he talks.
He vocally controls Eli,

229
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,580
but not himself.
He can't vocally control his son because

230
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,430
he lost his hearing,
but he tries anyway and he can't control

231
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,980
the work he does.
He has to lie about the benefits of his

232
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:30,830
drilling and much of the dangers of
worker out of his control.

233
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,400
We expect playing views monologue to be
true because narrators are supposed to

234
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:36,950
guide the story.
One John Wayne movie that follows these

235
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:40,370
principles of narration is Red River,
which has a monologue that's almost

236
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:43,400
identical to plain views.
If you replace oil drilling with cattle,

237
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,740
good hungry people to make them strong,
make them grow.

238
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:49,920
The key

239
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,980
difference though is that John Wayne's
hypermasculine advertisement of his

240
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,150
cattle business is actually taken
seriously,

241
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,000
whereas there will be blood codes plain
view as a fraud.

242
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,540
John Wayne's movie seemed to have some
unrealistic ideals for heroes,

243
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,570
whereas there will be blood shows,
the more sinister sides of being in

244
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:06,760
control,
and I know I said John Wayne always has

245
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:09,040
vocal control,
but even he loses it in some of his

246
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:14,041
later movies that says
this chaotic shooting of Buffalo sheds

247
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:18,640
light on the darker side to his
supposedly mastery.

248
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,130
Regardless,
many of his earlier films create an idea

249
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,880
of a hypermasculine male with complete
control of what they say and how they

250
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,860
say it.
There's a certain fantasy to sounding

251
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:30,040
like John Wayne Chandler and the easy
way you'll learn the hard way,

252
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,520
but movies like there will be blood
bring into question the validity of such

253
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:35,530
a one dimensional kind of control.

254
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,380
Having such vocal authority actually
doesn't end well.

255
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,320
If someone really had as mainly a
dominion over their world,

256
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,980
they wouldn't end up like a cool suave
John Wayne riding into the sunset.

257
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,580
They'd probably become the erratic,
miserable and lonely Daniel plainview

258
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,580
because at the end of the day,
the old western heroes aren't real.

259
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,030
That level of mastery is not only
unrealistic but also dangerous.

260
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,350
Think about it.
Why couldn't Daniel,

261
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,720
plainview have let Eli Sunday give that
speech?

262
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,150
What difference does it make if he gave
his little blessing?

263
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,160
Daniel plainview explains it himself.
I have a competition,

264
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,850
no one else to succeed,
and maybe that hypermasculine

265
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:13,930
unfaltering thinking is no way to live
and no fantasy to strive towards.

266
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,360
Never Apologize,
Mr. to sign of weakness.

267
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,600
When studying voice John Wayne makes for
a great place to start.

268
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,830
His way of speaking is hyperbolic and he
represents the ability to vocally master

269
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:24,340
a scene.

270
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,930
His purest vocal power,
however,

271
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:29,650
feels unrealistic in dangerous when
studying more vocally complicated

272
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,900
characters.
One can use John Wayne's power as a

273
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:35,590
starting point and see how a character
succeeds in the John Wayne level of

274
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:38,470
vocal control and how they fail.
Do they control the camera?

275
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:40,930
Do they control the narrative and do
they control others,

276
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,630
and also at what cost?
