1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,990
Welcome to.
Now you see it.

2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,300
Disney films have made great strides in
their portrayal of women from the

3
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:20,920
entirely domestic and dependence snow
white in 1937 Oh

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,360
to the adventurous and unconstrained
Maretta in 2012 a princess just not

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,510
please her weapons on the team.
It's hard to go a single day on the

6
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:36,170
Internet without finding yet another
blog post about free spirited women in

7
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:38,510
Disney movies,
especially the Disney princesses.

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,240
They all praised Disney movies for
making great steps towards women's

9
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,280
rights in our society.
But who cares?

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,980
These are just movies.
Shouldn't we stop relying on fictional

11
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:49,400
storytelling to comment on reality?
I want to argue the film is in fact,

12
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:52,970
one of the best methods of commenting on
a society and a Disney princess can have

13
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:57,530
more influence on the society than any
politician or leader women.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,660
Every popular film to some extent
conforms with the society.

15
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,790
It was maiden.
Think about it.

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,060
If a movie was released this year that
generalized all African Americans as

17
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:08,420
unintelligent and sexually aggressive
towards women and also made out the Klu

18
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,700
Klux Klan is heroes,
would it be a commercial success?

19
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,460
Probably not that wouldn't conform to
the values of our present society,

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,850
but in the early 19 hundreds this kind
of film could be a critical hit because

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,080
that's society conform to those beliefs.
And it was in 1915 the birth of a nation

22
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,630
was released and became the highest
grossing film of the year despite

23
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,910
generalizing African Americans as
unintelligent.

24
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:28,580
And the KKK is heroes.
What I'm saying is people don't like

25
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:30,410
seeing movies that greatly contradict
their views.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,410
So the most commercially successful
movies generally avoid so much

27
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:35,360
controversy that nobody pays to see the
movie.

28
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,400
In other words,
commercially successful movies or a

29
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:40,370
commentary on what the popular beliefs
were at the time of its making.

30
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,080
Of course,
there are plenty of thought provoking

31
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,290
society critiquing movies out there,
but we certainly don't see them topping

32
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,600
the box office.
So where do the Disney princesses fit

33
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:49,730
into this?
Disney produces some of the most popular

34
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:53,510
films of all time with 13 of the 25
highest grossing films in history from

35
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:55,910
The Walt Disney Corporation,
the Disney princess films,

36
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:58,700
or some of their most successful.
Let's take a look at how Disney films

37
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,580
can form with the societies they were
made in snow white takes place in

38
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:05,180
Germany in the 15 hundreds but it's very
much a portrayal of life for women in

39
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:08,000
America when it was made in 1937 women
at this time,

40
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,700
we're taught that their place was in the
home and snow white is a perfect

41
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,410
representation of that view.
For her,

42
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:15,080
a home is the only safe place.
The outside world is scary.

43
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,670
Her safety is in a house where she fees,
cooks and cleans for others and her life

44
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,970
is eventually saved by a man.

45
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,240
Snow white is more telling a description
of the societal perceptions of women at

46
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:25,340
that time been any textbook through
fiction.

47
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:28,760
We get a taste of reality area reflects
society's portrayal of women during the

48
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:32,150
creation of the little mermaid.
In 1989 America has accepted the

49
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,810
deviation from the nuclear family and a
woman's role outside of the home area

50
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:38,150
leaves her home.
The ocean inserts for her destiny,

51
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,920
but what does she in search for?
A man,

52
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,850
1989 America still believes a woman's
main goal is to find a husband and start

53
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,710
a family.
Society has not yet reached the

54
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:48,020
milestone of seeing women independent of
a man.

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,390
And that is reflected in the popular
cinema of that era.

56
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,880
Maretta and brave show society's current
view of winning.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,290
She is fierce,
independent,

58
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,880
and doesn't need a man.
In fact,

59
00:02:55,881 --> 00:02:58,370
she outperforms other men in her world,
in our society.

60
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,080
We now recognize women can do anything a
Manton do and don't need men in their

61
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,540
lives to be happy.
Women can now choose their own faith.

62
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,030
When you see a film,
it may take place in the past or the

63
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,070
distant future.
But the film has always subtly

64
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:11,170
commenting about the society.
It was maiden.

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,380
Wally is about a future where humans had
to escape an inhabitable planets.

66
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,440
But it's really a commentary about how
we mistreat the environment today,

67
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,970
who long it takes place in ancient
China.

68
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,390
But it's about how masculine qualities
are not exclusive to men in our current

69
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,770
society.
So here's a question.

70
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,550
Films are influenced by society's views,
but can society's views be influenced by

71
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,710
film?
They reach such a wide audience and can

72
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:33,220
provide such powerful messages that they
change society's views in radical ways.

73
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,670
Like when jaws led to a huge drop in
beach tourism when men started forming

74
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,460
their own fight clubs after fight club
or when a movie inspires some

75
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:42,880
southerners to bring back the KKK.
Philadelphia is such an important film

76
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:46,340
because it was the first production to
portray on man with the HIV virus and it

77
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,290
was a major inspiration for the founding
of an international AIDS Awareness

78
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,560
Association in 1997 Philadelphia touch
the hearts of Americans and brought an

79
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:55,210
awareness to the struggles of the
disease.

80
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,340
In a way,
a simple awareness campaign never could

81
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,174
have.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,610
What makes Disney princesses so
important is that they're marketed

83
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,410
towards families and especially
children,

84
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,990
children specifically.
Girls idolize these princesses.

85
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,670
They dress up like them,
they mimic them.

86
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,190
They act just like them.
Don't we want to raise girls who become

87
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:16,550
women with strong views of themselves.
If Disney princesses presented meaning

88
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:19,490
domesticating values for women,
then women will become that through

89
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:22,100
mimicking that behavior.
Disney princesses shaped the character

90
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:25,110
of the children that watch because girls
want to be the princesses they see on

91
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:27,200
screen.
So what characters should we show them?

92
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,970
Thanks for watching.
