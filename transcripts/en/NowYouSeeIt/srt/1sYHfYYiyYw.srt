1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,350
Fear of terrorism is widespread in
America.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:06,100
Many Americans have actually changed how
they live their daily lives.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,430
A significant number of Americans say
they avoided sporting events,

4
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:12,700
concerts,
and other public events because of their

5
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:13,630
fear of terrorism.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,840
Let me ask you a question.
What are people most afraid of?

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,680
You may think it's insects or natural
disasters or even public speaking,

8
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:25,580
but an extensive survey conducted by
Chapman University in Twenty 15 said the

9
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:29,420
biggest fears and Americans are cited as
the quote manmade disasters.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,820
These fears include bio warfare,
terrorism,

11
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:34,580
and nuclear attacks.
Forty four percent of Americans are

12
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:36,890
afraid or very afraid of terrorist
attacks.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,300
Compare that to 28 percent for public
speaking and 25 percent for insects.

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,700
Fear of terrorism actually peaked
following nine slash 11,

15
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:46,880
as the majority of Americans will
worried that they or someone they knew

16
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:50,210
would be a victim of a terrorist attack.
I want to suggest that what the public

17
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:54,380
fears is mirrored in Hollywood cinema,
especially the Zombie movies directly

18
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:56,060
following nine slash 11.
But to start,

19
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:59,000
we have to go back in time to the horror
movies of the 19 fifties.

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,030
So let me rephrase the first question.
What were people most afraid of?

21
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,530
Insane.
Nineteen 51.

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,330
We all know the atomic bomb is very
dangerous that may be used against us.

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,830
We must get ready for it.

24
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,150
With the Korean War,
Soviet nuclear testing and mccarthyism

25
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:16,270
in full force.
In 1950 polls showed an astounding 68

26
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:19,990
percent of Americans thought the Soviet
Union would use an atomic weapon against

27
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:23,080
the United States.
This fear was even used later as a scare

28
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:27,430
tactic in an infamous campaign ad by
Lyndon Johnson showing just how powerful

29
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:28,560
the fear was on the pump.

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,580
What are the stakes?
And all of God's children are to go into

31
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:41,570
the dark.
We must either love each other

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,390
are we must die.

33
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,540
So how did horror movies reflect this
fear?

34
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,230
The 19 fifties brought on a wave of
disaster movies were aliens are monsters

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,540
attack like war of the worlds,
the Blob,

36
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:55,300
and the thing from another world.
When you watch battle scenes from the

37
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:58,960
original war of the worlds or attack of
the 50 foot woman or Godzilla,

38
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,380
you notice the parallels between these
horror movies and the destructive nature

39
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:03,970
of the atomic bomb.
In fact,

40
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:08,080
the director of Godzilla was very blunt
about his intentions with the now iconic

41
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,090
monster.
He said,

42
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,110
quote,
the theme of the film from the beginning

43
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:14,620
was the tear of the bond.
Mankind had created the bottom and now

44
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:17,620
nature was going to take revenge on
mankind for Americans.

45
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:20,140
However,
the fear was channeled towards the

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,790
Soviet Union,
our biggest global threat at the time,

47
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,090
in the same way that Godzilla stomps on
buildings and is immune to bullets,

48
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,300
so to win an atomic bomb,
wipe out cities and be entirely

49
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:29,680
unstoppable by us.

50
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,010
Maybe it's no coincidence that the
Japanese film Godzilla was such a huge

51
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:36,280
success in America.
The Japanese fear of the bomb was just

52
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,410
as relevant to Americans at the time.
Now,

53
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:41,470
let's jump to the 21st century.
We're no longer threatened by a huge

54
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:43,540
visible global superpower.
Actually,

55
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,430
the fear of terrorism is quite the
opposite.

56
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,690
It's nothing like Godzilla.
A giant monster who drops in on a city,

57
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,030
a terrorist hides in the shadows,
disguise themselves as an everyday

58
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:55,270
citizen and causes society to collapse
from the inside out.

59
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,640
So here's my point.
It doesn't.

60
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,980
The method of destruction for a
terrorist sound a like the method of

61
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,510
destruction for Izombie.
First,

62
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:04,120
it's important to note the explosion of
the Zombie Genre.

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,140
Io Nine posted a nice graph showing a
boom in Zombie movies in the early two

64
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,590
thousands paralleling with mainstream
video games like resident evil and call

65
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,080
of duty and spilling into other media
like the TV show,

66
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:14,920
the walking dead.

67
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,770
There's no doubt that zombies have
infected the public conscience.

68
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,950
Twenty eight days later is one of the
first successful Zombie movies to come

69
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,890
out following nine slash 11,
and it highlights contemporary fears of

70
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:27,130
terrorism and decay of social order.
The scene that most strongly ties the

71
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:29,890
movie to terrorist fears is actually the
very first scene.

72
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,730
The deadly virus is created in a lab by
making chimpanzees watch footage of

73
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,410
Arabic mobs,
fighting police,

74
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:39,190
burning cars and beating each other up.
This virus is literally created from

75
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:41,800
Arabic violence.
I particularly like this shot,

76
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,980
which makes the human look like it's
regressing back into a terrifying

77
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,110
animal.
An important element of the Zombie genre

78
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,440
is that the enemy comes inside a
community and spreads from person to

79
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:52,570
person.
This sounds eerily similar to the method

80
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:55,600
of attack for a terrorist.
Sleeper cell hides within our board was

81
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:58,000
ready to strike and once we can finally
spot it,

82
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:00,670
it's too late to stop.
I think another key difference between

83
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,890
fifties,
monster movies and Zombie movies is the

84
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:04,840
role of the government.
In monster movies,

85
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,730
the government often fights against the
enemy,

86
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,010
but in 28 days later,
the government hasn't

87
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,950
abandoned them.
There's no government horses to go home

88
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:18,951
and there's always a government during a
bunker or plane.

89
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,030
There's no government police.

90
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,630
Not only that,
but in the movie,

91
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,210
the soldiers actually fight against the
protagonist.

92
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,420
In the 21st century with the
controversial invasion of Iraq and

93
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:32,360
government surveillance,
terrorism has brought on a distrust of

94
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:35,330
our own government where the 19 fifties
government was always joining in the

95
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:37,880
fight against a common enemy.
It appears that during a Zombie

96
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:40,160
apocalypse,
we shouldn't count on any government to

97
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:42,650
protect us.
What's so special about cinema is that

98
00:04:42,651 --> 00:04:45,920
it's such a democratic art form when it
comes to art forms like painting,

99
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,010
music or creative writing.
The message is only channeled through

100
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:50,420
one person,
but with cinema,

101
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:53,000
the final work is the product of dozens
of people.

102
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,610
Not only that,
but a production process as expensive as

103
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:59,150
making a movie requires that mainstream
movies appeal to as many people as

104
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:00,170
possible.
As a result,

105
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:03,830
movies tend to be a window into the
general mindset of the society it was

106
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:04,280
made in.

107
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,460
This means that the subject matter of
the successful horror movie has in its

108
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:10,340
subtext,
a reflection of the general fears of the

109
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:13,520
environment it was made in.
There are things that regardless of time

110
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,770
period and society,
humans are scared of.

111
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,000
The dark is a universal fear because we
can't identify the threat.

112
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,970
So a movie like don't breed seems to do
well because like jaws and the ending of

113
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:25,850
silence of the lambs,
it's scary when the threat can see you,

114
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:28,460
but you can't see that it's a timeless
fear.

115
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,650
But what about fears that do change over
time?

116
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,840
I talked about monster movies versus
Zombie movies,

117
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:36,560
but I also think mainstream horror
movies about religion or another perfect

118
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:39,710
example,
religion is at an all time low in the

119
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,431
United States.
More importantly,

120
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:43,820
the fear of damnation is low,
meaning that religious groups tend to

121
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:47,930
spend less time on the pain and torment
of hell in their teachings and more time

122
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,510
on the love and forgiveness that comes
from salvation.

123
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,750
This idea is especially true in the
Catholic Church who revised their

124
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:58,751
catechism in 1994 to remove the literary
fire and description of hell in favor of

125
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,790
a metaphorical place,
symbolizing the loss of one's faith.

126
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,720
So how is this idea shown in modern
movies around 40 or so years ago?

127
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,540
Most movies about the supernatural
centered around religion.

128
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,050
The devil is often the center villain.
In successful movies like Rosemary's

129
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:14,540
baby,
the omen and the exorcist nowadays,

130
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,610
those supernatural beings are still
present,

131
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:20,540
but religion is largely ignored.
The ghost is a former mental patient or

132
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,420
some unexplained being.
The exorcist is about a child being

133
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,330
possessed by the devil or Finn has a
very similar premise,

134
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:29,840
a child who is acting strangely,
but religion is hardly even mentioned.

135
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,170
The fact is that people don't find the
devil as scary as they used to,

136
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,370
partly due to less religion and partly
due to a conscious choice to focus less

137
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:40,280
on damnation in religious doctrine.
There's no doubt that there are

138
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:43,640
detectable trends in what horror movies
choose to find scary.

139
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,320
If you want to know what people are
afraid of,

140
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,590
you could run an expensive and time
consuming statistical study,

141
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,170
or you could just look at what horror
movies they find scary,

142
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,090
so the next time someone says,
don't be scared,

143
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:54,800
it's just a movie.
Don't believe them.

144
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,963
Thanks for watching.

145
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Slightly full break from the norm.
Just a little slot in the need of all

146
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:04,660
back home.
