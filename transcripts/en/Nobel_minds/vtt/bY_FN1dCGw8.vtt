<v Speaker 1>everyday lives that bring light to </v>

10
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:05.774
<v Speaker 1>poorer communities and reduce energy </v>

11
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:11.624
<v Speaker 1>are and where we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chemistry prize is about seeing now </v>

12
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:20.291
<v Speaker 1>for the first time we have microscopes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can see molecules and the economics</v>

13
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:21.184
<v Speaker 1>prize helps tell us how we can better </v>

24
00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:14.331
<v Speaker 3>had a discussion presentation of some </v>
<v Speaker 3>data and uh,</v>

25
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.193
<v Speaker 3>I was so excited by these data and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>I got this annoying phone call and it </v>

26
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:22.494
<v Speaker 3>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a number that I didn't recognize and I </v>

<v Speaker 3>just know I normally don't answer the </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone stuff that I don't know the </v>

28
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:30.174
<v Speaker 3>number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I suddenly got this female </v>

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.873
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the Nobel prize laureates here </v>

35
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>who danced for joy when she heard she </v>
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>

36
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.603
<v Speaker 1>EADWEARD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muybridge is your wife a couple of both </v>

37
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.310
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also your,</v>

38
00:03:13.311 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 1>your colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor John O'keefe,</v>

39
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.843
<v Speaker 1>who is not with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were given the prize in medicine or </v>

40
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were on an airplane.</v>

41
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.843
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I actually got to know it after </v>

43
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 4>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I landed at Munich airport.</v>

44
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.394
<v Speaker 4>I was going to institute and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was met by a woman and a </v>

45
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.373
<v Speaker 4>representative from the airports that </v>
<v Speaker 4>picked me up and I asked why does you </v>

46
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 4>come to the gate of the plane?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she told me that,</v>

47
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won the price,</v>

48
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.813
<v Speaker 4>I didn't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she said it was a plank for a </v>

49
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 4>price for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the Max Planck Society.</v>

50
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:48.724
<v Speaker 4>So she mixed it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then finally I started checking my </v>

51
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:56.880
<v Speaker 4>phone and then hundreds of messages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then one from urine.</v>

52
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.723
<v Speaker 4>Hanson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>

53
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.860
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

54
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was not there yet.</v>

55
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 4>And he said that it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Call me back and then I.</v>

56
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's how you found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.550
<v Speaker 1>And I'm Stefan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

58
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>so you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I think you were accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't you?</v>

60
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I had a project discussion with</v>

61
00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:17.864
<v Speaker 1>the postdoc because we have seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>something new and exciting with our </v>

62
00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:23.610
<v Speaker 1>sharp light microscope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will want as a chemist Laurie,</v>

63
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 1>as I say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.203
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually I wanted to know whether </v>

65
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.670
<v Speaker 1>this has been seen somewhere else and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put down the paper where I felt that</v>

66
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.563
<v Speaker 1>it could be perhaps mentioned there or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not and I want to start at the paper to </v>

67
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:38.510
<v Speaker 1>see what it was known on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that is totally new,</v>

68
00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.540
<v Speaker 1>what we've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out to be new.</v>

69
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.070
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the phone rang,</v>

70
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.953
<v Speaker 1>the phone rang and I was surprised of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in towns chemists </v>

71
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>laureates here,</v>

00:06:55.181 --> 00:07:00.181
<v Speaker 1>So two of the three Nobel Prize winners </v>
<v Speaker 1>in physics because your,</v>

120
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.091
<v Speaker 1>your colleague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>

121
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Achan Psyche again is not with us </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor Nakamura.</v>

122
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:05.203
<v Speaker 1>So I think you live in California </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're at University of Santa </v>

123
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.253
<v Speaker 1>Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it must have been an earthly our for </v>

124
00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:11.104
<v Speaker 1>you when you were told.</v>

125
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So basically I,</v>

126
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.970
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got the phone call out CPM,</v>

127
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 6>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's him as I was sleeping and also I</v>

128
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.090
<v Speaker 6>am the but the sub one day before I know</v>
<v Speaker 6>my is totally to me and know you have to</v>

129
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:29.160
<v Speaker 6>put the cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe dad possibility.</v>

130
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.330
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

131
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 6>I left my cell phone next to my bed and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the answer to this,</v>

132
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.330
<v Speaker 1>what kind of for war and so it wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge surprise for you.</v>

133
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.470
<v Speaker 1>What about your colleagues here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Ammonia?</v>

134
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might get worse in praying from.</v>

136
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.860
<v Speaker 5>Not Weird in Japan to try and get on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ice.</v>

137
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:54.300
<v Speaker 5>So many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many email title.</v>

138
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.270
<v Speaker 5>The congratulations from graduation </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to.</v>

139
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.930
<v Speaker 5>I didn't understand why to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

140
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 5>So I moved to the final destination to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Leon and found many journalists came the</v>

141
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 5>exit of the whole farm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Find that our funding.</v>

142
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 1>So you actually Leon in France where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>found out.</v>

143
00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:19.360
<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And professors on zero.</v>

144
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.253
<v Speaker 1>You are the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so winner of the Nobel Prize in </v>

145
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:22.894
<v Speaker 1>economics this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think you'd miss the initial </v>

146
00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 1>coordinate because your phone was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>vibrate.</v>

147
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Were you working on some great new </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory?</v>

148
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.773
<v Speaker 5>Did Not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

149
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.870
<v Speaker 5>I was working on the European Research </v>
<v Speaker 5>Council grant or is it kind of already.</v>

150
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 5>We also have to get money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every scientist and like my vibrator,</v>

151
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to be bothered so I put my</v>
<v Speaker 5>phone on vibrate.</v>

152
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.663
<v Speaker 5>So they kept calling and calling and </v>
<v Speaker 5>calling and then I have funny or the </v>

153
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 5>phone vibrating and I looked at it at a </v>
<v Speaker 5>45,</v>

154
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.680
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>46,</v>

155
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 5>46.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is Sweden what's going on?</v>

156
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.140
<v Speaker 7>So I took it and you're getting then you</v>
<v Speaker 7>wonder,</v>

157
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.160
<v Speaker 7>is that a joke?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

158
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.003
<v Speaker 7>it was not a joke because you're here </v>
<v Speaker 7>now let's carry on with you professor </v>

159
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.210
<v Speaker 7>too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because um,</v>

160
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.263
<v Speaker 7>you would given the Nobel prize </v>
<v Speaker 7>basically for various theories that all </v>

161
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 7>come under one umbrella as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of how to structure markets,</v>

162
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 7>regulate,</v>
<v Speaker 7>regulate big business and so on,</v>

163
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 7>to better benefit the consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I know that um,</v>

164
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 7>when you were giving your ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was listening to the citation,</v>

165
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 7>they sort of compared your theories to a</v>
<v Speaker 7>baker,</v>

166
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.113
<v Speaker 7>how I'm a baker,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a selling bad bread and has no </v>

167
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 7>competition is going to carry on selling</v>
<v Speaker 7>the bad bread rather extensively.</v>

168
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 7>And your theory helps set us how we can </v>
<v Speaker 7>tackle that kind of market abuse.</v>

169
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's why it's free.</v>

170
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.463
<v Speaker 7>There's always dance shows at firms with</v>
<v Speaker 7>child noncompetitive can raise price or </v>

171
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 7>offer low quality.</v>

172
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 7>So you have to work through it in two </v>
<v Speaker 7>different ways.</v>

173
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:55.404
<v Speaker 7>One is onto trust or competition policy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You intervene to avoid abuses of domain </v>

174
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 7>and position on that nurtures which will</v>
<v Speaker 7>raise the price and lower quantity.</v>

175
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:04.843
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're kind of regulate directly today </v>

176
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 7>comes and the electricity in banks and </v>
<v Speaker 7>the likes.</v>

177
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 7>So our work has been to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

178
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 7>apply Game Theory and information </v>
<v Speaker 7>economics to that kind of situation,</v>

179
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:16.134
<v Speaker 7>so as to provide series and unpack all </v>
<v Speaker 7>the work that could lpars those </v>

180
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 7>authorities to deal with big firms.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Can you see now,</v>

181
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.033
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>areas where we have monopolies or only </v>

182
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.203
<v Speaker 7>got police where they are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 7>crowding out competition and they </v>

183
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:31.674
<v Speaker 7>themselves perhaps or a bit inefficient </v>
<v Speaker 7>and give expensive products for the </v>

184
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:36.564
<v Speaker 7>consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Could you think that's quite a common </v>

185
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:39.230
<v Speaker 7>problem in the world now?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a common probably.</v>

186
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.460
<v Speaker 7>It has always been.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean we're still,</v>

187
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 7>today comes connectricity on railroads </v>
<v Speaker 7>are what we call essential facilities or</v>

188
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 7>bottlenecks which are extremely costly </v>
<v Speaker 7>to reproduce.</v>

189
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.030
<v Speaker 7>So you have not shown monopolies and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

190
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 7>you have to give access to create </v>
<v Speaker 7>competition.</v>

191
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:53.124
<v Speaker 7>So part of our work was to think about </v>
<v Speaker 7>how to create the access to those </v>

192
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:58.430
<v Speaker 7>bottlenecks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you also have,</v>

193
00:10:58.431 --> 00:10:59.180
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

194
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.013
<v Speaker 7>an old high tech industries you like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have like Google and Microsoft and </v>

195
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 7>are large fixed costs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>

196
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:08.124
<v Speaker 7>building a search engine that allows </v>
<v Speaker 7>network side is because there are lots </v>

197
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:12.114
<v Speaker 7>of apps and people want to inter operate</v>
<v Speaker 7>and so in the end you tend to have </v>

198
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:16.914
<v Speaker 7>monopolies at some point of time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the important thing is that a new </v>

199
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 7>firms which are more efficient can enter</v>
<v Speaker 7>to replace those monopolies if needed.</v>

200
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.170
<v Speaker 7>I want to go to the audience here </v>
<v Speaker 7>because we've got a couple of questions.</v>

201
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Economic students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

202
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.343
<v Speaker 1>we have one here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just say your name briefly and then put </v>

203
00:11:31.431 --> 00:11:33.190
<v Speaker 1>your question please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maria.</v>

204
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you ask what do you think it is</v>

205
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:36.854
<v Speaker 1>more effective to regulate large </v>
<v Speaker 1>entities like Spain or the United </v>

206
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom or maybe smaller ones like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catalonia and Scotland.</v>

207
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before you answer that,</v>

208
00:11:47.091 --> 00:11:48.470
<v Speaker 1>let's just see if there's any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

209
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young lady behind you.</v>

210
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Just give us your name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My name is.</v>

211
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.713
<v Speaker 1>You authored that you work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have to be influenced by your </v>

212
00:11:58.961 --> 00:11:59.794
<v Speaker 1>political ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as economics and politics are </v>

213
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.200
<v Speaker 1>quietly related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your recommendations for future</v>

214
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>economies to remain as much as possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politically neutral.</v>

215
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to answer that first of all,</v>

216
00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:15.554
<v Speaker 1>is it easier?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Regulation easier when it's for </v>

217
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.050
<v Speaker 1>cause?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's it,</v>

218
00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:19.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just regulate parts of the </v>

219
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:22.084
<v Speaker 1>financial institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Globalization means you need a global </v>

220
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:25.414
<v Speaker 1>regular.</v>

221
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Question is a very important one for one</v>

222
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.430
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lots of those firms now like bang socks,</v>

223
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.273
<v Speaker 5>she multinationals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we have to regulate at a broader </v>

224
00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in Europe for example,</v>

225
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.463
<v Speaker 5>the banking union which tries to </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually regulate at the ECB level of </v>

226
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:43.234
<v Speaker 5>the European Central Bank level and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>antitrust authorities also tried to </v>

227
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:47.614
<v Speaker 5>cooperate more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more and more with each other because </v>

228
00:12:49.181 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 5>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

229
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 5>Google is a worldwide enterprise of </v>
<v Speaker 5>course.</v>

230
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.900
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's uh,</v>

231
00:12:53.901 --> 00:12:54.734
<v Speaker 5>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's only point in saying and you </v>

232
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.773
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>climate change also ease of use thing </v>

233
00:12:58.661 --> 00:12:59.494
<v Speaker 5>that you have to regulate that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the world level regulated at the </v>

234
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:02.674
<v Speaker 5>country level is not going to lie </v>
<v Speaker 5>because then the pollution is going to </v>

235
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 5>migrate somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you need a world agreement for that.</v>

236
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your citation they said that um,</v>

237
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.953
<v Speaker 1>you don't shy away from the politics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you've been quoted in the </v>

238
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:19.800
<v Speaker 1>press gave me advice to the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>government about its massive deficit and</v>

239
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.650
<v Speaker 1>telling them that they have to reform or</v>
<v Speaker 1>die and so on.</v>

240
00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:26.070
<v Speaker 1>So you don't shirk the political area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>

241
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.633
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to be neutral in the sand that </v>

242
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:32.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm never comment on 40 titian and </v>
<v Speaker 5>politics or you know,</v>

243
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.660
<v Speaker 5>support a candidate or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

244
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:35.494
<v Speaker 5>I think it's very important because </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise you are linked to a party or </v>

245
00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:39.244
<v Speaker 5>to some ideas and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and basically discredited because they </v>

246
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:42.274
<v Speaker 5>will say you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are saying that not because of your </v>

247
00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 5>science because it has those particular </v>
<v Speaker 5>leaning.</v>

248
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:49.770
<v Speaker 5>So actually when I got to price also </v>
<v Speaker 5>John,</v>

249
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:54.370
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to know whether for Walmart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40th and nobody was able to say and also</v>

250
00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.213
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to know whether I was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>provocateur and the Thai market person </v>

251
00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.553
<v Speaker 5>and they weren't able to send.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason is that I just say what </v>

252
00:14:03.191 --> 00:14:06.190
<v Speaker 5>my son says and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was I like it or not,</v>

253
00:14:06.191 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 5>I just go for it and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then Jonah is didn't extrapolate.</v>

254
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:11.621
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

255
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:12.161
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're saying,</v>

256
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:12.994
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they try to decide soon in support of </v>

257
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:18.700
<v Speaker 5>this color of this person or this part </v>
<v Speaker 5>in and that I disliked political</v>

258
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.020
<v Speaker 1>kind of unbiased and you stick to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

259
00:14:21.021 --> 00:14:23.030
<v Speaker 1>but you do have very strong political </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions.</v>

260
00:14:23.031 --> 00:14:23.864
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been quoted as saying that you </v>

261
00:14:24.651 --> 00:14:25.484
<v Speaker 1>think the euro is a flawed currency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in what could loosely be </v>

262
00:14:29.481 --> 00:14:33.260
<v Speaker 1>described as a EU?</v>
<v Speaker 1>EU superstate your big federalist?</v>

263
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:34.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big fit out is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

264
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.810
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean do you always on institutions how</v>

265
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.220
<v Speaker 5>little bit weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a currency union,</v>

266
00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:41.054
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>institution which goes through is a </v>

267
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.383
<v Speaker 5>currency union like the US for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or us as a currency union but also as a </v>

268
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:48.284
<v Speaker 5>common budget has common lowe's and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have that in Europe and I would </v>

269
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 5>like to have that in Europe as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's a bit difficult to do right now</v>

270
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:55.934
<v Speaker 5>because there's such a difference </v>
<v Speaker 5>between a northern Europe and south </v>

271
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.443
<v Speaker 5>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

272
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Speaker 5>we should have done that earlier of </v>
<v Speaker 5>course.</v>

273
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.630
<v Speaker 5>But hopefully that will.</v>

274
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.080
<v Speaker 1>But you say you're a big federal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

275
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:15:07.041 --> 00:15:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you look around European countries at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment and you know,</v>

277
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.653
<v Speaker 1>you in the phone nasional in France did </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well with the parliamentary </v>

278
00:15:13.231 --> 00:15:17.130
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the UK Independence Party in the</v>

279
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:17.520
<v Speaker 1>United Kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

280
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.353
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your opinions perhaps a slightly going </v>

281
00:15:19.471 --> 00:15:21.390
<v Speaker 1>against the tide of public opinion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

282
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.451
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm afraid.</v>

283
00:15:22.451 --> 00:15:24.700
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's true that Jemena in Sweden,</v>

284
00:15:24.701 --> 00:15:25.534
<v Speaker 5>you see what's happening and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening almost in every country in </v>

285
00:15:28.061 --> 00:15:28.894
<v Speaker 5>Europe where you rehab the casino for </v>
<v Speaker 5>big countries and the parties and it's </v>

286
00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:34.590
<v Speaker 5>very hard to understand them and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>should,</v>

287
00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:35.424
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should understand the word story is </v>

288
00:15:37.241 --> 00:15:41.250
<v Speaker 5>leading you a is leading us and people </v>
<v Speaker 5>just don't fly on.</v>

289
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.930
<v Speaker 5>And also that very bad economics and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>of those parties,</v>

290
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.360
<v Speaker 5>those extremist parties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've terrible economics,</v>

291
00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:47.770
<v Speaker 5>but people don't realize that.</v>

292
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Edward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's turn to what you did.</v>

293
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was divided into two,</v>

294
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:53.920
<v Speaker 1>the price between your work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor o'keeffe's.</v>

295
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since he's not here,</v>

296
00:15:55.791 --> 00:16:00.791
<v Speaker 1>just to sort of paraphrase that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified what are known as place cells</v>

297
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.023
<v Speaker 1>working with rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kind of tells us about the </v>

298
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:04.994
<v Speaker 1>workings of the inner gps in our brains </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tell us how we know where we are </v>

299
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.803
<v Speaker 1>and where we're going and how we store </v>
<v Speaker 1>that information so we can use it for </v>

300
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 1>the next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

301
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.080
<v Speaker 1>So tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell us more about why his discovery was</v>

302
00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:22.420
<v Speaker 1>so significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You muybridge,</v>

303
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.790
<v Speaker 1>you listen to the small electrical </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulses in the brain and the brain says,</v>

304
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:32.290
<v Speaker 1>because they talk about sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical pulses and one such a pulse,</v>

305
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.260
<v Speaker 1>you can magnify a soda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a 10,000,</v>

306
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.094
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more in amplitude and then you can </v>

307
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.470
<v Speaker 1>listen to it and then a place that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be silence,</v>

308
00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 1>silence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silence,</v>

309
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.493
<v Speaker 8>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 8>pop,</v>

310
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.673
<v Speaker 8>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 8>pop,</v>

311
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.693
<v Speaker 8>pop,</v>

312
00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:54.120
<v Speaker 1>and whenever the rat is coming back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain place in the environment,</v>

313
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.163
<v Speaker 1>you had the same popcaan sound like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>popcorn bag in the microwave oven and </v>

314
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.103
<v Speaker 1>it's such a beautiful sound for us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got about half a million to a </v>

315
00:17:04.951 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 1>million place cells in our brains in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippocampus at least,</v>

316
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.270
<v Speaker 1>which is somewhere near the temples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

317
00:17:12.271 --> 00:17:13.104
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just somewhere that you identified a </v>

318
00:17:15.481 --> 00:17:20.481
<v Speaker 1>separate set of nerve cells involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>navigation which are activated when Irak</v>

319
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:25.500
<v Speaker 1>passes certain locations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence the grid cells.</v>

320
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.210
<v Speaker 1>So just you tell us about those.</v>

321
00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.253
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the difference is that the place of </v>

322
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.910
<v Speaker 5>subtle Keith discovered they are usually</v>
<v Speaker 5>active at one location.</v>

323
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.890
<v Speaker 5>The sales,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we discovered,</v>

324
00:17:34.891 --> 00:17:39.000
<v Speaker 5>we call them grid cells because they are</v>
<v Speaker 5>active at many locations.</v>

325
00:17:39.001 --> 00:17:42.660
<v Speaker 5>And those many locations form agreed </v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

326
00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:43.494
<v Speaker 5>very periodic map or the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's almost like a coordinate system </v>

327
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 5>a while you have points that</v>

328
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 4>are at regular distances.</v>

329
00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.393
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since we're talking about useful </v>

330
00:17:53.421 --> 00:17:54.950
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this discovery,</v>

331
00:17:54.951 --> 00:17:56.930
<v Speaker 1>helping us understand how the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

332
00:17:56.931 --> 00:17:59.780
<v Speaker 1>but do we know illnesses like brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases like Alzheimer's,</v>

333
00:17:59.781 --> 00:18:03.020
<v Speaker 1>that sense of space and where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going is one of the first things to go.</v>

334
00:18:03.021 --> 00:18:06.830
<v Speaker 1>So what kind of application might your </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery health,</v>

335
00:18:06.831 --> 00:18:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's and other mental.</v>

336
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.713
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see two things about </v>

337
00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:11.514
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

338
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.383
<v Speaker 4>a dot area that contains those cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's usually the first one to be </v>

339
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:16.374
<v Speaker 4>affected in Alzheimer's disease and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a problems with a navigation and so </v>

340
00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.853
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so it's very important for </v>

341
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:23.964
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it also say that it's perhaps even </v>

342
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:27.504
<v Speaker 4>more important because it allows us to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand the basic principles of how </v>

343
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:34.320
<v Speaker 4>the brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these cells are so easy to measure.</v>

344
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.130
<v Speaker 4>It's actually provided a window into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>working principles of the brain.</v>

345
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.353
<v Speaker 4>And I think this is basic research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We understand how the brain works and </v>

346
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:43.404
<v Speaker 4>then in the future I can go and t will </v>
<v Speaker 4>also understand other diseases because </v>

347
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:50.190
<v Speaker 4>we get to the fundamental principles of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain,</v>

348
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.800
<v Speaker 4>like what are the diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia,</v>

349
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.320
<v Speaker 4>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety disorders,</v>

350
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.320
<v Speaker 4>the whole spectrum because they all </v>
<v Speaker 4>depend on,</v>

351
00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.680
<v Speaker 4>on some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

352
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.350
<v Speaker 4>a rather small number of the working </v>
<v Speaker 4>principles that is used by the brain.</v>

353
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that sauce.</v>

354
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

355
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.221
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

356
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:09.054
<v Speaker 3>and the interesting thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then resend to hear that if you </v>

357
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:13.260
<v Speaker 3>have a window and you can put the </v>
<v Speaker 3>window,</v>

358
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:17.430
<v Speaker 3>just remove part of the skull and put </v>
<v Speaker 3>the window and use these guys.</v>

359
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Microscopes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

360
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.033
<v Speaker 1>we'll come to these guys microscopes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the audience who's got a question </v>

361
00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:27.290
<v Speaker 1>for the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this dynamic duo.</v>

362
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the two of you working </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and was very successful,</v>

363
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.060
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you can tell us a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

364
00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:35.894
<v Speaker 1>How is it if your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your colleague at work is at the same </v>

365
00:19:39.771 --> 00:19:40.604
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife or husband infused seed or </v>

366
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.910
<v Speaker 1>each other?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time?</v>

367
00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.243
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you one thing at least I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to sit home and then get the </v>

368
00:19:49.541 --> 00:19:51.250
<v Speaker 3>critics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't a dinner</v>

369
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.780
<v Speaker 1>finished my bread?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>

370
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.623
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rare species because there are very </v>

371
00:19:58.761 --> 00:20:03.761
<v Speaker 1>few women at this table sign with </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists.</v>

372
00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I will use more exact scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precise language.</v>

373
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.520
<v Speaker 1>You are the only female amongst these </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel laureates.</v>

374
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.970
<v Speaker 1>That's true and I often sit around this </v>
<v Speaker 1>table when I've done this program in the</v>

375
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:23.180
<v Speaker 1>false and they're a new female science </v>
<v Speaker 1>laureate,</v>

376
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.520
<v Speaker 1>so I have to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it that you know,</v>

377
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.720
<v Speaker 1>particularly at the top of the pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the scientific community and academic</v>

378
00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:32.670
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are very few.</v>

379
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:35.370
<v Speaker 1>My brother even in your own country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway.</v>

380
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.523
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not part of my background in </v>

381
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:41.484
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have to just pick it up and of </v>

382
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 3>course when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when when you need to.</v>

383
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.843
<v Speaker 3>When when you get such a price,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are sort of top of a pyramid and in </v>

384
00:20:52.931 --> 00:20:53.764
<v Speaker 3>order to come to that pyramid you need a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pool and the pool you need is a lot of </v>

385
00:20:59.201 --> 00:21:04.201
<v Speaker 3>women here and then it's become sharper </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sharper up to the top.</v>

386
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:10.050
<v Speaker 3>So it's just about we need to get more </v>
<v Speaker 3>women interested and also more women who</v>

387
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:18.250
<v Speaker 3>can trust themselves so that I think I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>good enough to win the Nobel prize.</v>

388
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

389
00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.940
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be in science,</v>

390
00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:22.774
<v Speaker 3>you have to work a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to travel a lot and especially </v>

391
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 3>a mom and here is unlike their bias,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but especially a mom who doesn't want to</v>

392
00:21:30.611 --> 00:21:35.611
<v Speaker 3>leave the chamber conferences when and </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls were very small and,</v>

393
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 3>and leaving a baby while you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>breastfeeding.</v>

394
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:39.460
<v Speaker 3>You don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

395
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's painful.</v>

396
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I've tried it once and never ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any other comments from here,</v>

397
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:44.973
<v Speaker 3>Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but thick.</v>

398
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.380
<v Speaker 9>My wife and I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

399
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.080
<v Speaker 9>met at Janelia.</v>
<v Speaker 9>She's a neuroscientist.</v>

400
00:21:49.081 --> 00:21:49.914
<v Speaker 9>And same thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is that it's a two heads or even though </v>

401
00:21:54.841 --> 00:21:57.090
<v Speaker 9>she's in a different field than I am,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

402
00:21:57.091 --> 00:21:57.924
<v Speaker 9>two heads are better than one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's sort of common principles that </v>

403
00:22:00.481 --> 00:22:01.314
<v Speaker 9>we can help each other out at work and </v>
<v Speaker 9>we can help with the child rearing and </v>

404
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.040
<v Speaker 9>tag team take off,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

405
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:07.883
<v Speaker 9>time is necessary for the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But one thing we don't do is no pillow </v>

406
00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:12.930
<v Speaker 9>talk about science.</v>

407
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.553
<v Speaker 1>Once we get home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sciences will tell us where the rubbish </v>

408
00:22:18.621 --> 00:22:22.480
<v Speaker 1>out and that kind of conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want a stress free environment.</v>

409
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.730
<v Speaker 1>And Professor Mona your views on this.</v>

410
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:26.863
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what I see happening is some </v>

411
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.663
<v Speaker 9>improvements in these numbers over time.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I bet if you looked at those numbers 10 </v>

412
00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:32.204
<v Speaker 9>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you see that there are better now </v>

413
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.333
<v Speaker 9>because some of these new policies that </v>
<v Speaker 9>are being put in place to help with </v>

414
00:22:37.131 --> 00:22:40.880
<v Speaker 9>child rearing that or help with sort of </v>
<v Speaker 9>alternative ways of,</v>

415
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.030
<v Speaker 9>of helping across this barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So we're working hard on it.</v>

416
00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:44.983
<v Speaker 9>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we're working very hard to get more </v>

417
00:22:46.731 --> 00:22:50.090
<v Speaker 9>women in at high levels of the professor</v>
<v Speaker 9>at,</v>

418
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.320
<v Speaker 9>at,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in the United States.</v>

419
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.763
<v Speaker 9>I think.</v>

420
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.990
<v Speaker 10>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Definitely in Germany,</v>

421
00:22:53.991 --> 00:22:54.824
<v Speaker 10>I think the number of female students in</v>
<v Speaker 10>physics and chemistry has gone up </v>

422
00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.980
<v Speaker 10>substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So when I started out of 100 students,</v>

423
00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:04.220
<v Speaker 10>we have maybe two or three little women.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Now it's 20.</v>

424
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Your Chancellor Angela Merkel is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist?</v>

425
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

426
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Is wonderful module there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

427
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.740
<v Speaker 1>And she works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a scientist too,</v>

428
00:23:11.741 --> 00:23:13.030
<v Speaker 1>didn't she?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't just study it.</v>

429
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

430
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:18.400
<v Speaker 1>What about the experience in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women scientists in Japan,</v>

431
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.563
<v Speaker 1>how do they do</v>

432
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.760
<v Speaker 10>in terms of the statistics?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

433
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.800
<v Speaker 10>we are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The development are only 80 percent.</v>

434
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:32.090
<v Speaker 10>Eight percent of the women in my </v>
<v Speaker 10>university.</v>

435
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.360
<v Speaker 10>He know where you're immersed.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You are per se so.</v>

436
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 10>Well one of the top level university,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but still</v>

437
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.820
<v Speaker 1>eight percent women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Natural Universe where you will.</v>

438
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank.</v>

439
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 1>So let's</v>

440
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.873
<v Speaker 7>turn to the chemist laureate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you basically working independently </v>

441
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:57.040
<v Speaker 7>came up with a solution to make </v>
<v Speaker 7>microscopes work much better so that now</v>

442
00:23:58.011 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 7>for the first time we can look inside </v>
<v Speaker 7>cells to see molecules,</v>

443
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.973
<v Speaker 7>but how did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because I mean microscopes had been </v>

444
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:06.464
<v Speaker 7>around for ages.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The prize recognizes super resolution </v>

445
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.173
<v Speaker 7>fluorescence microscopy and some people </v>
<v Speaker 7>might not know what this fluorescents </v>

446
00:24:14.391 --> 00:24:18.500
<v Speaker 7>business areas so I can illustrate it a </v>
<v Speaker 7>little bit and give you a few of the key</v>

447
00:24:18.501 --> 00:24:20.060
<v Speaker 7>ideas here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's a liquid.</v>

448
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.610
<v Speaker 7>There are a lot of molecules in this </v>
<v Speaker 7>vial,</v>

449
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.600
<v Speaker 7>maybe 10 to the 24th.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's one with 24 Zeros after it,</v>

450
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.033
<v Speaker 7>but inside this we also have some </v>
<v Speaker 7>fluorescent molecules that and we want </v>

451
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:35.480
<v Speaker 7>to be able to see these molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So let me just illustrate the idea.</v>

452
00:24:35.481 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 7>I have a green laser here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a green laser pointer that's a green,</v>

453
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:40.004
<v Speaker 7>very green,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when I shine it through this </v>

454
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:42.794
<v Speaker 7>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the fluorescent molecules inside give </v>

455
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:46.304
<v Speaker 7>you a more of a yellowish color and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can see that I can just like a light </v>

456
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.150
<v Speaker 7>saber only where the beam is going.</v>

457
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.570
<v Speaker 7>It's hitting the molecules and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>molecules are sending light back.</v>

458
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.220
<v Speaker 7>That's what we mean by fluorescents.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so what we are doing,</v>

459
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:06.221
<v Speaker 7>and these microscopes is using lasers </v>
<v Speaker 7>and this property I just showed that the</v>

460
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.110
<v Speaker 7>molecules themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he meant like bags,</v>

461
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:10.003
<v Speaker 7>like little tiny light sources and it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>because 25 years ago one of the ways to </v>

462
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.490
<v Speaker 7>achieve super resolution relies on being</v>
<v Speaker 7>able to see single molecules.</v>

463
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 7>That's what I worked on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you can actually now with your eyes,</v>

464
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 7>look into a microscope and see the light</v>
<v Speaker 7>coming from individual molecules.</v>

465
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.580
<v Speaker 7>So Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean the,</v>

466
00:25:28.581 --> 00:25:29.414
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the chemistry prize was awarded because </v>

467
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
<v Speaker 7>it's about seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what is this seeing actually do.</v>

468
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.963
<v Speaker 7>What kind of diseases might it help is I</v>
<v Speaker 7>always feel uncomfortable when media </v>

469
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:47.681
<v Speaker 7>tries to project us into technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It will have applications,</v>

470
00:25:48.471 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 7>but it's very difficult to predict.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's one of the things with technology</v>

471
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:52.994
<v Speaker 7>in general is it's very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 7>predict what the ultimate ultimate </v>

472
00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:56.954
<v Speaker 7>benefits will be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you're willing to predict he's </v>

473
00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:01.684
<v Speaker 7>winning.</v>

474
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.003
<v Speaker 7>Question to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean we have used the high resolution </v>

475
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.150
<v Speaker 7>in order to find out key processes going</v>
<v Speaker 7>on.</v>

476
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 7>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in HIV.</v>

477
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.620
<v Speaker 7>So biology,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm quite quite confident,</v>

478
00:26:18.621 --> 00:26:22.640
<v Speaker 7>will be strongly impacted by the </v>
<v Speaker 7>microscopes that we have invented,</v>

479
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.043
<v Speaker 7>professor managing feel queasy about </v>
<v Speaker 7>answering what kind of future </v>

480
00:26:26.031 --> 00:26:27.290
<v Speaker 7>applications.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

481
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.483
<v Speaker 7>the real point is you see in much </v>
<v Speaker 7>greater detail than what you saw before </v>

482
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:32.983
<v Speaker 7>and you see surprises,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you see things that weren't necessarily </v>

483
00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:36.014
<v Speaker 7>expected and all of these super </v>
<v Speaker 7>resolution methods or something like </v>

484
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.063
<v Speaker 7>recognizing that the cell is something </v>
<v Speaker 7>like a little city where there are many </v>

485
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.280
<v Speaker 7>molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 7>proteins that are moving around a little</v>

486
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 7>motors and DNA and RNA and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if you only look at it very,</v>

487
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:53.880
<v Speaker 7>very high up in the sky where it's only </v>
<v Speaker 7>fuzzy,</v>

488
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:54.923
<v Speaker 7>you don't see what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>super resolution lets you see far more </v>

489
00:26:57.661 --> 00:27:01.920
<v Speaker 7>clearly that is a factor five,</v>
<v Speaker 7>10 or more better already.</v>

490
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.233
<v Speaker 7>And the point is then you see surprises.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Things that we didn't understand about </v>

491
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:09.870
<v Speaker 7>the cell biology.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You've benefited from these guys.</v>

492
00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.813
<v Speaker 7>Discovery something</v>

493
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.460
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

494
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:13.463
<v Speaker 4>The advances in microscopy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the advances that allow </v>

495
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 4>microscopes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fluorescence microscopes to be used in,</v>

496
00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:22.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in living animals.</v>

497
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.110
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

498
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.943
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the resolution that the three lawyers </v>

499
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.733
<v Speaker 4>have worked on today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's even beyond what we can use at the </v>

500
00:27:29.741 --> 00:27:31.480
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think this will come.</v>

501
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

502
00:27:33.011 --> 00:27:36.800
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm professor of Nakamura along with</v>

503
00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:37.634
<v Speaker 1>professor I Kosaki you were awarded the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel Prize in Physics for your blue </v>

504
00:27:42.201 --> 00:27:43.034
<v Speaker 1>light emitting diode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made possible a highly efficient </v>

505
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.133
<v Speaker 1>light source that's now replacing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>incandescent light bulb that Thomas </v>

506
00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Edison gave us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've had red,</v>

507
00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.820
<v Speaker 1>green emitting diodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For what?</v>

508
00:27:55.821 --> 00:28:00.200
<v Speaker 1>About 50 years in your blue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One has been around for about 20 years.</v>

509
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:01.363
<v Speaker 1>You combine the blue with the red and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the green and perhaps you can show us </v>

510
00:28:04.041 --> 00:28:05.500
<v Speaker 1>what happens professor knocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura.</v>

511
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a biscuit.</v>

512
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.190
<v Speaker 6>We thought a brewer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you cannot make quite big.</v>

513
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 6>The is of the led lighting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that a point to point?</v>

514
00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:15.324
<v Speaker 6>Right source.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we can't use dance to make any kind </v>

515
00:28:17.831 --> 00:28:21.370
<v Speaker 6>of shape of light.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>

516
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:26.120
<v Speaker 6>this is a site coordinator,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he puts some kind of feed into it to</v>

517
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:28.030
<v Speaker 6>be from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They found gonna ship.</v>

518
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.370
<v Speaker 6>This is the best,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a right to enforce the act art,</v>

519
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:32.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

520
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.770
<v Speaker 1>so this kind of lights is amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's brought a,</v>

521
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.793
<v Speaker 1>the potential of a cheap source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy for communities all over the </v>

522
00:28:42.441 --> 00:28:43.274
<v Speaker 1>world that don't have access tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also bringing down energy </v>

523
00:28:47.241 --> 00:28:48.340
<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

524
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a more efficient use of</v>

525
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.313
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at this is can't be opened by buttery </v>

526
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.470
<v Speaker 6>mobile cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ipad or kind of mobile device.</v>

527
00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:01.260
<v Speaker 6>Have to use this thing to make these </v>
<v Speaker 6>sprays.</v>

528
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.410
<v Speaker 6>And also most important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that a southern country?</v>

529
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.610
<v Speaker 6>So the country?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

530
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.800
<v Speaker 6>No electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>only energy source.</v>

531
00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:09.743
<v Speaker 6>Like a Sunday night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just sort of say and sort of our charge </v>

532
00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:17.080
<v Speaker 6>the battery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>daytime and nighttime edited it.</v>

533
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.173
<v Speaker 1>So you have solar power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of device and a battery with </v>

534
00:29:22.371 --> 00:29:23.204
<v Speaker 1>the blue led giving the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white light and it's how much would </v>

535
00:29:27.141 --> 00:29:28.310
<v Speaker 1>that cost as a device?</v>

536
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.183
<v Speaker 6>I see now</v>

537
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 1>$10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

538
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.490
<v Speaker 1>So a person could use that $10 with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>source of solar power.</v>

539
00:29:36.491 --> 00:29:39.160
<v Speaker 1>And how long would that last for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

540
00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Three years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

541
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

542
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.920
<v Speaker 10>Especially in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Electricity generation.</v>

543
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:59.190
<v Speaker 10>Maybe you remember that day in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 10>they had the big earthquake in Japan,</v>

544
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:06.350
<v Speaker 10>so the above the old nuclear power print</v>
<v Speaker 10>stuff now,</v>

545
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.840
<v Speaker 10>so the new group or a presence,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a bride,</v>

546
00:30:12.531 --> 00:30:13.364
<v Speaker 10>the 30 percent of director issue,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but now it all stopped so we have to </v>

547
00:30:18.631 --> 00:30:19.464
<v Speaker 10>adapt another way.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So the led is very important to reduce </v>

548
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.220
<v Speaker 10>energy consumption.</v>

549
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:31.460
<v Speaker 1>The they enable price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is that electricity lighting accounts</v>

550
00:30:31.461 --> 00:30:36.461
<v Speaker 1>for about 20 percent of global energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>use through the use of your white led in</v>

551
00:30:37.161 --> 00:30:39.470
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could come down to five percent.</v>

552
00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Not only do these light bulbs last 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times as long as the incandescent bulb,</v>

553
00:30:44.091 --> 00:30:44.924
<v Speaker 1>they also contain no mercury and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>application also is the ultra violet </v>

554
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.190
<v Speaker 1>light can be used to clean polluted </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

555
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.143
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a buyer a day to use folk are basically </v>

556
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.043
<v Speaker 6>to kill bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are able to bias a bias by that virus </v>

557
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.373
<v Speaker 6>and also to a pure water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the Po Po buyers are basically you </v>

558
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.170
<v Speaker 6>can't you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you read it back bucket you.</v>

559
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.950
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It killed bacteria.</v>

560
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Purify light on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but professor like a Marie,</v>

561
00:31:17.161 --> 00:31:17.994
<v Speaker 1>you had a very publicized fight with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation that was funding your </v>

562
00:31:21.991 --> 00:31:24.510
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You felt that your,</v>

563
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.673
<v Speaker 1>you weren't properly remunerated for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>research that you did to develop the </v>

564
00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:31.930
<v Speaker 1>blue led,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would give them what?</v>

565
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.813
<v Speaker 1>A bonus of $180 and they went to and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could potentially make millions and </v>

566
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.870
<v Speaker 1>millions out of this invention.</v>

567
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:41.470
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy,</v>

568
00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.100
<v Speaker 6>he's says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I moved to the United States and my full</v>

569
00:31:45.101 --> 00:31:45.934
<v Speaker 6>comm company started the lawsuit against</v>
<v Speaker 6>using got infringement over 30 to </v>

570
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.540
<v Speaker 6>secret.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I became so angry about,</v>

571
00:31:52.541 --> 00:31:53.080
<v Speaker 6>to my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

572
00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.650
<v Speaker 6>to my former company.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So as a counter lawsuit I started that.</v>

573
00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.553
<v Speaker 6>A lawsuit I guess in my former company </v>
<v Speaker 6>using the Japanese pop into roll out </v>

574
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.600
<v Speaker 6>through South Dakota is even if I could </v>
<v Speaker 6>do embed for company as an employee,</v>

575
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.710
<v Speaker 6>potential rights belong to me.</v>

576
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.620
<v Speaker 1>So the patient rights in Japan belonged </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the inventor,</v>

577
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.550
<v Speaker 1>the company that employs the inventor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was lucky for you</v>

578
00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.380
<v Speaker 6>if I have any.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really meant it all.</v>

579
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:30.410
<v Speaker 6>So it measures so but the but quote and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I quote,</v>

580
00:32:30.921 --> 00:32:32.310
<v Speaker 6>the judge says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

581
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.413
<v Speaker 6>how the incidents to be drawn to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>company if the agreement over the </v>

582
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.110
<v Speaker 6>document but the judge also same damn </v>
<v Speaker 6>fool</v>

583
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.180
<v Speaker 10>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You have a right to get that.</v>

584
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.120
<v Speaker 10>These are not brutal compensation fee.</v>

585
00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.420
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was very reasonable.</v>

586
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't happy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

587
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.153
<v Speaker 1>It made you a millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about $8 million </v>

588
00:32:57.041 --> 00:32:58.420
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad at all.</v>

589
00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.433
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel around the table here </v>

590
00:33:01.331 --> 00:33:02.590
<v Speaker 1>that in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

591
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.493
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property and patent rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whether your inventions all used in </v>

592
00:33:07.361 --> 00:33:11.140
<v Speaker 1>the future in a way which is basically a</v>
<v Speaker 1>money spinner.</v>

593
00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel that you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a number of paths for our stuff?</v>

594
00:33:14.591 --> 00:33:15.424
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are infringed on left and </v>

595
00:33:17.381 --> 00:33:19.210
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And frankly we don't care.</v>

596
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.103
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

597
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you can either spend your time talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lawyers all the time and be miserable</v>

598
00:33:24.431 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 1>or you can get back in the lab and </v>
<v Speaker 1>invent something else that you looked to</v>

599
00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:28.840
<v Speaker 1>your fault tool company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

600
00:33:28.841 --> 00:33:31.600
<v Speaker 1>would he not have appreciated it if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented?</v>

601
00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't invent things for his company </v>

602
00:33:35.531 --> 00:33:39.510
<v Speaker 1>that just sold poor stuff on my kids.</v>

603
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.000
<v Speaker 10>Very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I started out in my scientific career is</v>

604
00:33:43.001 --> 00:33:43.834
<v Speaker 10>writing a patent in 1990 before I had a </v>
<v Speaker 10>postdoctoral job and this turned out to </v>

605
00:33:48.191 --> 00:33:51.400
<v Speaker 10>be extremely helpful because at the </v>
<v Speaker 10>latest stage in my career,</v>

606
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:53.770
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I run out of support,</v>

607
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:54.663
<v Speaker 10>institutional support and so I use this </v>
<v Speaker 10>patent and basically licensed it to a </v>

608
00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.110
<v Speaker 10>small company in Finland that gave me </v>
<v Speaker 10>money,</v>

609
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:03.023
<v Speaker 10>hundred thousand dollars in return and </v>
<v Speaker 10>they use this money in a very critical </v>

610
00:34:05.531 --> 00:34:06.364
<v Speaker 10>period to do my research.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And that nine months of research that </v>

611
00:34:10.151 --> 00:34:12.310
<v Speaker 10>was funded by,</v>
<v Speaker 10>by $100,000</v>

612
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.730
<v Speaker 10>really got me that.</v>

613
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Glad to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was very forced.</v>

614
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.130
<v Speaker 1>So your patient patients can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely lifesaving.</v>

615
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

616
00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.030
<v Speaker 1>what about here where you can't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>patient?</v>

617
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Yours is just the knowledge isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody trust?</v>

618
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.510
<v Speaker 1>What about youtube?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for us,</v>

619
00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:33.483
<v Speaker 3>simple to say that neuroscience is a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>family and we share a lot of both ids </v>

620
00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:43.860
<v Speaker 3>and a data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from our lab,</v>

621
00:34:43.861 --> 00:34:44.694
<v Speaker 3>we put data on the Internet so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people can analyze it and the two </v>

622
00:34:48.361 --> 00:34:49.194
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that we give very good data and </v>

623
00:34:51.991 --> 00:34:52.824
<v Speaker 3>the second thing is then we don't need </v>
<v Speaker 3>that money anonymous since when did the </v>

624
00:34:57.381 --> 00:34:58.530
<v Speaker 3>animal research?</v>

625
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.970
<v Speaker 10>So we've got a question from the </v>
<v Speaker 10>audience.</v>

626
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.490
<v Speaker 10>My question relates to research in </v>
<v Speaker 10>Africa.</v>

627
00:35:02.491 --> 00:35:05.860
<v Speaker 10>We know that huge successes have been </v>
<v Speaker 10>made in the West and uh,</v>

628
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:10.910
<v Speaker 10>in my opinion is a lack of collaboration</v>
<v Speaker 10>with researchers in Africa.</v>

629
00:35:11.221 --> 00:35:14.550
<v Speaker 10>We just resorted to the outbreak of </v>
<v Speaker 10>Ebola for example.</v>

630
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.150
<v Speaker 10>How could this be explained and what was</v>
<v Speaker 10>this push to?</v>

631
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.013
<v Speaker 10>Global health.</v>

632
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.121
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

633
00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:21.830
<v Speaker 1>We'll take another question from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor</v>

634
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 10>and my question was a little bit related</v>
<v Speaker 10>to question is,</v>

635
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:31.110
<v Speaker 10>are experimental science because high is</v>
<v Speaker 10>our main tool.</v>

636
00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:32.843
<v Speaker 10>How do you identify that's power kill </v>
<v Speaker 10>that will turn into a fire because so </v>

637
00:35:36.451 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 10>many time lens on</v>

638
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.670
<v Speaker 11>something and then because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 11>have enough elements to pack it up,</v>

639
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.060
<v Speaker 11>sometime that tends to just it on the </v>
<v Speaker 11>side,</v>

640
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:45.894
<v Speaker 11>but how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 11>what does it get to get the level of </v>

641
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 11>price?</v>
<v Speaker 11>How do we identify it?</v>

642
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well,</v>

643
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.420
<v Speaker 9>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Eric Betzig a few points there.</v>

644
00:35:53.421 --> 00:35:54.210
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

645
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.620
<v Speaker 9>because I have opinions on all of them </v>
<v Speaker 9>but I don't want to just touch on it.</v>

646
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:02.070
<v Speaker 9>But you're a very interesting story </v>
<v Speaker 9>because here you are a Nobel laureate in</v>

647
00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:05.190
<v Speaker 9>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But I think in your own words you said I</v>

648
00:36:05.191 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 9>was lousy at chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I sucked at chemistry.</v>

649
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:12.531
<v Speaker 9>That was my exact.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And in fact none of you is a chemist and</v>

650
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.060
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>well yeah,</v>

651
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:14.780
<v Speaker 9>you all,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you all,</v>

652
00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.613
<v Speaker 9>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Famous your department physical </v>

653
00:36:19.441 --> 00:36:22.450
<v Speaker 9>chemistry but your physicist and do your</v>
<v Speaker 9>more like physicists.</v>

654
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:24.560
<v Speaker 9>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 9>with that,</v>

655
00:36:24.561 --> 00:36:25.720
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but uh,</v>

656
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.780
<v Speaker 9>the committee cited to specific papers </v>
<v Speaker 9>for me to get the prize and both of them</v>

657
00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:33.180
<v Speaker 9>happy while I was unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

658
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:34.620
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but,</v>

659
00:36:34.621 --> 00:36:36.990
<v Speaker 9>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in terms of the spark thing,</v>

660
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:38.303
<v Speaker 9>I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what you want to do is you want to </v>

661
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:44.820
<v Speaker 9>immerse yourself in problems and try to </v>
<v Speaker 9>not sweep problems under the rug,</v>

662
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:45.683
<v Speaker 9>but focus on problems and outstanding </v>
<v Speaker 9>problems and try to put pieces of a </v>

663
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:51.090
<v Speaker 9>puzzle together to solve these.</v>

664
00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:51.923
<v Speaker 9>And if a good scientist I think gets </v>
<v Speaker 9>this monomaniacal focus on the problem </v>

665
00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.640
<v Speaker 9>and you may not have all of the </v>
<v Speaker 9>problems,</v>

666
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:00.474
<v Speaker 9>but at least in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the solutions have come when I'm not </v>

667
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:07.620
<v Speaker 9>directly looking at the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but through the subconscious mind,</v>

668
00:37:07.621 --> 00:37:12.621
<v Speaker 9>either I was pushing my daughter around </v>
<v Speaker 9>in a stroller or so poincare talks about</v>

669
00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:13.524
<v Speaker 9>this in his book about how you have to </v>
<v Speaker 9>just starve your mind of everything </v>

670
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:21.060
<v Speaker 9>except the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So the subconscious is forced to work on</v>

671
00:37:21.061 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 9>it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And then he was taking a vacation,</v>

672
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.150
<v Speaker 9>stepping on a bus and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 9>sudden he had this flash of insight.</v>

673
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.460
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's kind of for me,</v>

674
00:37:29.461 --> 00:37:32.190
<v Speaker 9>I have great confidence in my </v>
<v Speaker 9>subconscious mind.</v>

675
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.910
<v Speaker 9>I've described you as a counter reaction</v>
<v Speaker 9>to chemist and how you,</v>

676
00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:35.744
<v Speaker 9>you're not good at chemistry at school,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but you also had a bit of a kind of </v>

677
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:39.384
<v Speaker 9>disdain for academia and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>life in the ivory tower and if fact you </v>

678
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 9>quit academia research and went to work </v>
<v Speaker 9>for your family's tool business.</v>

679
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:49.500
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>So,</v>

680
00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.363
<v Speaker 9>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I still don't think I would ever be </v>

681
00:37:51.871 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 9>comfortable in a standard academic </v>
<v Speaker 9>environment in some ways.</v>

682
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:56.423
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've always just wanted to work at the </v>

683
00:37:58.051 --> 00:37:58.884
<v Speaker 9>bench and in some ways the standard </v>
<v Speaker 9>model seems to me an incredibly </v>

684
00:38:01.351 --> 00:38:02.184
<v Speaker 9>inefficient way to do research because </v>
<v Speaker 9>you train somebody to excel at bench </v>

685
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:07.464
<v Speaker 9>science through their postdoc and then </v>
<v Speaker 9>you make an assistant professor out of </v>

686
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:11.454
<v Speaker 9>them and rip that all away from them and</v>
<v Speaker 9>stick them in an office and make an </v>

687
00:38:13.831 --> 00:38:14.664
<v Speaker 9>administrator out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I've been fortunate both at Bell Labs </v>

688
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:20.460
<v Speaker 9>and then where I work now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>they believe in,</v>

689
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:25.010
<v Speaker 9>in allowing scientists be scientists and</v>
<v Speaker 9>not administrators and,</v>

690
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:25.903
<v Speaker 9>and people begging for grants and so I </v>
<v Speaker 9>can be in the lab and be more </v>

691
00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:30.780
<v Speaker 9>productive.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Stefan.</v>

692
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.790
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>We also had a question about,</v>

693
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:33.920
<v Speaker 9>um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

694
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.310
<v Speaker 9>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 9>other viruses</v>

695
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Speaker 7>and so on and we're told all the time </v>
<v Speaker 7>now the antibiotics and not as effective</v>

696
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:43.700
<v Speaker 7>as they used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Does your work in any way relate?</v>

697
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 7>How would you answer that question?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The context of your work?</v>

698
00:38:46.151 --> 00:38:48.670
<v Speaker 7>Because before you can cure something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have to understand.</v>

699
00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:49.630
<v Speaker 7>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>

700
00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.473
<v Speaker 7>And I think microscopes allow us better </v>
<v Speaker 7>to understand what's going on including </v>

701
00:38:54.341 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 7>the disease cell and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think to some extent below to allow to</v>

702
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:03.050
<v Speaker 7>send much better how drugs work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>

703
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.100
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can imagine that,</v>

704
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.993
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>seeing things now at a cellular level </v>

705
00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.920
<v Speaker 7>will affect treating diseases </v>
<v Speaker 7>substantially.</v>

706
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.370
<v Speaker 7>So in conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Olivia,</v>

707
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:14.283
<v Speaker 7>do you think that the best science is </v>
<v Speaker 7>useful science and all these putting </v>

708
00:39:19.141 --> 00:39:19.974
<v Speaker 7>Nobel laureates we have around.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is your final word of advice to </v>

709
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.690
<v Speaker 7>anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to get back</v>

710
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:31.220
<v Speaker 4>to the question or basic science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think it's so important that we</v>

711
00:39:31.221 --> 00:39:32.054
<v Speaker 4>also spend efforts around understanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>things where we don't know what it will </v>

712
00:39:36.351 --> 00:39:41.000
<v Speaker 4>be useful for because the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this specialty perhaps we'll see that</v>

713
00:39:41.001 --> 00:39:42.220
<v Speaker 4>in neuroscience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

714
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.380
<v Speaker 4>you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand the brain enough to</v>

715
00:39:45.381 --> 00:39:47.210
<v Speaker 4>know actually what is useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

716
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.063
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as we get more knowledge about </v>

717
00:39:50.331 --> 00:39:53.540
<v Speaker 4>how the brain works,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that it will be important for,</v>

718
00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:57.410
<v Speaker 4>for the whole range of psychiatry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>neurology and so on</v>

719
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.420
<v Speaker 7>and for us professional.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But there's,</v>

720
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:04.700
<v Speaker 7>there's many ways in which these two </v>
<v Speaker 7>ideas are intermingled.</v>

721
00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:06.170
<v Speaker 7>A.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>

722
00:40:06.171 --> 00:40:08.210
<v Speaker 7>I agree that basic science is very </v>
<v Speaker 7>important,</v>

723
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:09.283
<v Speaker 7>but sometimes basic science can be </v>
<v Speaker 7>driven by some technological need and </v>

724
00:40:12.681 --> 00:40:17.510
<v Speaker 7>there's many examples of where the </v>
<v Speaker 7>technology has an has something new that</v>

725
00:40:17.511 --> 00:40:20.090
<v Speaker 7>needs to be invented and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 7>gets people's mind thinking,</v>

726
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:21.183
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can come up with an idea that might </v>

727
00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.293
<v Speaker 7>make that work and then new science </v>
<v Speaker 7>comes out of the ability of that new </v>

728
00:40:26.181 --> 00:40:27.014
<v Speaker 7>method to see new things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the original single molecule where it </v>

729
00:40:29.491 --> 00:40:30.324
<v Speaker 7>came from,</v>
<v Speaker 7>work at IBM on exploring an optical </v>

730
00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:36.560
<v Speaker 7>storage scheme and the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 7>limits of a completely different optical</v>

731
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.560
<v Speaker 7>storage game completely out in left </v>
<v Speaker 7>field and,</v>

732
00:40:39.561 --> 00:40:40.394
<v Speaker 7>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we saw a single molecules as a result </v>

733
00:40:42.051 --> 00:40:44.590
<v Speaker 7>and then that blossomed into </v>
<v Speaker 7>applications.</v>

734
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.433
<v Speaker 7>In biology.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>

735
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:46.603
<v Speaker 7>you just have to have both,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you have to have some interplay </v>

736
00:40:48.861 --> 00:40:52.460
<v Speaker 7>between them and stable,</v>
<v Speaker 7>continued funding for the basic science.</v>

737
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:57.780
<v Speaker 7>What about your advice to budding Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 7>scientists and economists because you're</v>

738
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:00.440
<v Speaker 7>a real superstar now in France.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wherever you go,</v>

739
00:41:00.441 --> 00:41:01.274
<v Speaker 7>you're stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

740
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:05.090
<v Speaker 7>photographs and resident and we know the</v>
<v Speaker 7>Prime Minister Manuel Val said that this</v>

741
00:41:05.091 --> 00:41:07.630
<v Speaker 7>was a poke in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All these people who were being emptied,</v>

742
00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:11.540
<v Speaker 7>French gallic passionate and so are you </v>
<v Speaker 7>happy being a French area?</v>

743
00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.300
<v Speaker 7>It's trey nice to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

744
00:41:14.301 --> 00:41:16.610
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of pride in my country </v>
<v Speaker 7>about this,</v>

745
00:41:16.611 --> 00:41:17.600
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

746
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:18.483
<v Speaker 7>the concert in my honor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I turned on so qwiff and then there </v>

747
00:41:21.141 --> 00:41:25.610
<v Speaker 7>was a big banner on the Cto of my city,</v>
<v Speaker 7>12 meter by 15.</v>

748
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.613
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The CTO for two weeks and I got stopped </v>

749
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.560
<v Speaker 7>me in the street,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but in the end,</v>

750
00:41:30.561 --> 00:41:31.460
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's flattering,</v>

751
00:41:31.461 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 7>but this guy wants to do is to go back</v>

752
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.873
<v Speaker 1>to my lab and the Japanese and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese media have been really huge in </v>

753
00:41:42.441 --> 00:41:43.274
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presidents don't comb with three </v>

754
00:41:45.171 --> 00:41:46.004
<v Speaker 1>Japanese Nobel laureates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your superstars on the Uw </v>

755
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Professor Nakamura,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you said you know,</v>

756
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:54.770
<v Speaker 1>your battle with the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation.</v>

757
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:55.604
<v Speaker 1>You'd left in disgust and went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States because you felt that you </v>

758
00:41:58.581 --> 00:41:59.414
<v Speaker 1>could develop your work better there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how'd you feel holding two </v>

759
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.560
<v Speaker 1>directions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan is claiming you was that great.</v>

760
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.760
<v Speaker 1>One of the great stars.</v>

761
00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.613
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

762
00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:12.580
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'd be getting bored in Japan.</v>

763
00:42:12.581 --> 00:42:13.414
<v Speaker 6>So that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As I moved to the United States to </v>

764
00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:17.800
<v Speaker 6>challenge a new scenes waterways as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>scientist,</v>

765
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.590
<v Speaker 6>I have to do new things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>new talent,</v>

766
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.521
<v Speaker 6>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is.</v>

767
00:42:21.521 --> 00:42:23.710
<v Speaker 6>I moved to the United States and about </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

768
00:42:23.711 --> 00:42:24.960
<v Speaker 6>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that,</v>

769
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.160
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that now I'm a US citizen.</v>

770
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.113
<v Speaker 6>I have my us citizenship stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll find definitely people find </v>

771
00:42:30.401 --> 00:42:32.860
<v Speaker 6>their might use this or they become </v>
<v Speaker 6>angry.</v>

772
00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.780
<v Speaker 6>Noble Nordic for United States.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Japan.</v>

773
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:47.280
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about what your just </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that the United States,</v>

774
00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:53.010
<v Speaker 10>they're right by law.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I have a rate of a different opinion.</v>

775
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:56.033
<v Speaker 10>You might get it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's like an engineering science and </v>

776
00:42:58.081 --> 00:42:58.914
<v Speaker 10>know for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you might find the most important thing </v>

777
00:43:02.071 --> 00:43:06.460
<v Speaker 10>is to imagine the future system or </v>
<v Speaker 10>imagined the future for,</v>

778
00:43:06.461 --> 00:43:09.660
<v Speaker 10>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the Microsoft Bill Gates.</v>

779
00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.840
<v Speaker 10>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so what would the itch like an inpatient</v>

780
00:43:12.841 --> 00:43:13.674
<v Speaker 10>oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Of course I understand that a </v>

781
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:18.950
<v Speaker 10>fundamental basic study,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the very important,</v>

782
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:19.933
<v Speaker 10>but for us the most important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>so basic studies to freaking direction </v>

783
00:43:24.241 --> 00:43:26.840
<v Speaker 10>should we go.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So stuff on him.</v>

784
00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.433
<v Speaker 10>I think it's best to concentrate on </v>
<v Speaker 10>problems that seem to be very difficult </v>

785
00:43:31.891 --> 00:43:33.430
<v Speaker 10>to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

786
00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:36.600
<v Speaker 10>I think those problems are the most </v>
<v Speaker 10>interesting problems,</v>

787
00:43:36.601 --> 00:43:38.460
<v Speaker 10>the most rewarding problems,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but there's,</v>

788
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.450
<v Speaker 10>of course there's risk in taking a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>tackling such problems.</v>

789
00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 10>So therefore I think we have to embrace </v>
<v Speaker 10>not only taking risks,</v>

790
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.770
<v Speaker 10>but also we have to embrace the </v>
<v Speaker 10>failures,</v>

791
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.160
<v Speaker 10>especially also to honor those people </v>
<v Speaker 10>who try heart,</v>

792
00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.720
<v Speaker 10>do their best but fail,</v>

793
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.080
<v Speaker 1>but don't start with this is a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

794
00:43:57.081 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 1>I want to fix it.</v>

795
00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.380
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that may be like that,</v>

796
00:44:01.381 --> 00:44:05.460
<v Speaker 10>but sometimes you get an idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 10>you want to do and that comes out of the</v>

797
00:44:05.461 --> 00:44:09.570
<v Speaker 10>blue.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I'm with intuition of course.</v>

798
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.130
<v Speaker 10>And usually if you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if you do it out of intuition,</v>

799
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.983
<v Speaker 10>intuition is passion.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And yet you have to be passionate about </v>

800
00:44:15.661 --> 00:44:16.494
<v Speaker 10>what you do.</v>

801
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is about passion.</v>

802
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.550
<v Speaker 1>And you need a vision so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

803
00:44:21.551 --> 00:44:26.460
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a burning question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a burning question,</v>

804
00:44:26.461 --> 00:44:31.461
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's microscopes are leds or </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy or neuroscience,</v>

805
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:36.030
<v Speaker 1>then that is to start at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is leading you forward.</v>

806
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:37.103
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't care about methods or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a salary or whatever you </v>

807
00:44:40.891 --> 00:44:41.724
<v Speaker 1>have because it's so burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't stop a passion or an </v>

808
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:45.690
<v Speaker 1>obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obsession.</v>

809
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your psychologist,</v>

810
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you should know all about sessions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

811
00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Eric Betzig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would your advice</v>

812
00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.300
<v Speaker 9>to the potential?</v>
<v Speaker 9>No,</v>

813
00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.540
<v Speaker 9>we're just been said passion.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>

814
00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.560
<v Speaker 9>but a lot of times I see kids in high </v>
<v Speaker 9>school or college who are in science who</v>

815
00:45:04.401 --> 00:45:06.630
<v Speaker 9>are in some ways pushed in a science </v>
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>

816
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:11.600
<v Speaker 9>and sometimes their motivations are to </v>
<v Speaker 9>please their parents or something else.</v>

817
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:12.493
<v Speaker 9>And if you would rather be a rap star or</v>
<v Speaker 9>rather be a painter or rather be </v>

818
00:45:18.861 --> 00:45:19.694
<v Speaker 9>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 9>just follow your passion because in the </v>

819
00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.533
<v Speaker 9>end the purpose of the passion is get </v>
<v Speaker 9>you past the failures and to get you so </v>

820
00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:33.020
<v Speaker 9>that you work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Because every field of endeavor it comes</v>

821
00:45:33.021 --> 00:45:33.854
<v Speaker 9>down in the end to hard work and hard </v>
<v Speaker 9>work is kind of like compound interest </v>

822
00:45:37.941 --> 00:45:38.774
<v Speaker 9>in a bank.</v>
<v Speaker 9>If you work 10 percent harder than the </v>

823
00:45:40.611 --> 00:45:41.444
<v Speaker 9>other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it actually multiplies year-by-year </v>

824
00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:48.830
<v Speaker 9>until all of a sudden your experiences </v>
<v Speaker 9>twice or triple the other guy.</v>

825
00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.490
<v Speaker 9>And then you can excel in your field and</v>
<v Speaker 9>then you win a Nobel prize.</v>

826
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:54.430
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who cares about that?</v>

827
00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.800

<v Speaker 1>the greatest brains working currently in</v>
