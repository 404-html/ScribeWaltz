00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Zina puddle.</v>

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.063
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the concert hall in Stockholm</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the Nobel prize winners received </v>

3
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.093
<v Speaker 1>their awards from the king of Sweden for</v>
<v Speaker 1>their outstanding contributions to </v>

4
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature and Economics.</v>

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.953
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time that this year's </v>
<v Speaker 1>laureates or repairing together on </v>

6
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>television and they've been joined by </v>
<v Speaker 1>their family and friends who've traveled</v>

7
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:34.250
<v Speaker 1>to Stockholm to share in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrations.</v>

8
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:35.084
<v Speaker 1>And we are also joined by students from </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in Sweden who are going to be </v>

9
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:43.961
<v Speaker 1>putting their questions to our laureates</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this year's Nobel mine.</v>

10
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:11.780
<v Speaker 1>So we have discoveries on repairing </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged DNA,</v>

11
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 1>which increase our knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

12
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.883
<v Speaker 1>cure tropical diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in economics we throw light on the </v>

13
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>links between poverty consumption and </v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare.</v>

14
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.713
<v Speaker 1>And the literature prize gives voice to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the voiceless in authoritarians </v>

15
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laureates,</v>

16
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>congratulations to you all.</v>

17
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

18
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.503
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go straight away to our first </v>

19
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Speaker 1>question from our audience here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is Martin.</v>

20
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Martin please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your first question to our laureates.</v>

21
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.230
<v Speaker 3>So there are a lot of the prices and </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitions in all of your fields and I</v>

22
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:54.064
<v Speaker 3>just wanted to have your opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think it is a good addition to </v>

23
00:01:58.301 --> 00:01:59.134
<v Speaker 3>motivate people to get engaged or do you</v>
<v Speaker 3>think it inspires unnecessary </v>

24
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:03.874
<v Speaker 3>competition?</v>

25
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.890
<v Speaker 4>So well I kind of miss or never </v>
<v Speaker 4>competitive.</v>

26
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 4>We have something called perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>competition which economists believe in.</v>

27
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.423
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure the Nobel does much of </v>

28
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:22.094
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been very impressed by how much </v>

29
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.323
<v Speaker 4>positive um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just general happiness and wellbeing it </v>

30
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 4>seems to generate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

31
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.493
<v Speaker 4>it's clear though over the years in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>past there certainly is some resentment </v>

32
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 4>on behalf of people who don't win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never felt that personally.</v>

33
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:48.040
<v Speaker 4>But you hear discussions stairs when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>pass by.</v>

34
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.460
<v Speaker 4>I have not experienced any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd been very fortunate that way.</v>

35
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 4>But I do think in the past people have </v>
<v Speaker 4>felt that a whole area,</v>

36
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that should have been recognized,</v>

37
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 4>never was recognized,</v>

38
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 5>for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sure,</v>

39
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 5>and that's a more legitimate feeling </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

40
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's some people who feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they should have been writing guys.</v>

41
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.103
<v Speaker 5>They're more not,</v>

42
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>you are a professor date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in saying that,</v>

43
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure you deserved your price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let me just see what,</v>

44
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:14.754
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else poor madre to professor </v>

45
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.440
<v Speaker 1>moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.440
<v Speaker 6>Well I think it's useful and bringing </v>
<v Speaker 6>visibility to science fields.</v>

47
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I uh,</v>

48
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.343
<v Speaker 6>agree with Angus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that there have been instances </v>

49
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:29.184
<v Speaker 6>where people have felt certainly in my </v>
<v Speaker 6>field that the certain areas that were </v>

50
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:39.180
<v Speaker 6>worthy of a prize were neglected.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

51
00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:42.270
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so there is a value judgment I think in,</v>

52
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:44.520
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in selection of the fields.</v>

53
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.220
<v Speaker 3>Professor Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a,</v>

54
00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:48.960
<v Speaker 3>it does not create competition among </v>
<v Speaker 3>sign,</v>

55
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.500
<v Speaker 3>just don't compete for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And secondly,</v>

56
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it's inevitable and it also adds</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice little bit of,</v>

57
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something special,</v>

58
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time just kinda enjoy.</v>

59
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.463
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's sort of inspirational </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not confrontational and certainly </v>

60
00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:09.200
<v Speaker 3>not inducing and not the juice of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of competition.</v>

61
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.573
<v Speaker 3>And the chemistry failed our way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Been very fortunate and that the three </v>

62
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 3>winners worked on different mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of DNA repair and we had no competition.</v>

63
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.440
<v Speaker 3>So we've been fortunate to have it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

64
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.250
<v Speaker 3>And so in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no competition.</v>

65
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.930
<v Speaker 1>It rounded off the chemist there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Thomas Lindahl okay.</v>

66
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.883
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a healthy competition is a good </v>

67
00:04:35.811 --> 00:04:36.650
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

68
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.300
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's uh,</v>

69
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.980
<v Speaker 5>excellent different scientist goes a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit of a stray with his idea,</v>

70
00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:46.760
<v Speaker 5>send that sample Dale's correct them and</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

71
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.810
<v Speaker 5>I think it would be too comfortable if </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was no competition at all.</v>

72
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.683
<v Speaker 5>Huh.</v>

73
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you met us on Alec Serve,</v>

74
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:57.210
<v Speaker 1>which obviously you are the literature </v>
<v Speaker 1>laureate,</v>

75
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

76
00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:00.300
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that a spirit line,</v>

77
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Alex overage is speaking in Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.100
<v Speaker 1>and I know the question was specifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>about science,</v>

79
00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:08.550
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of receiving the Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 1>prize,</v>

80
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.520
<v Speaker 1>as Professor Deaton said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

81
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>it's a real accolade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

82
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 1>do you feel that it's going to help you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way,</v>

83
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:18.990
<v Speaker 1>do what you do better?</v>

84
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>

85
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just cause [inaudible] [inaudible] no.</v>

86
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] [inaudible] no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they deal with sweat.</v>

87
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.713
<v Speaker 7>Delish murals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Trixie [inaudible] premiums in a love </v>

88
00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:47.534
<v Speaker 7>with the deal</v>

89
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.983
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

90
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>the physicist professor aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's and then,</v>

91
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to go first?</v>

92
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Professor Cogito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

93
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.753
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

94
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.283
<v Speaker 3>We both wanted to understand what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] properties of neutrinos and </v>

95
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:03.914
<v Speaker 3>we have the same gold and coming from </v>
<v Speaker 3>different experiments and we are very </v>

96
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:10.664
<v Speaker 3>much</v>

97
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 1>complimentary rather than competitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>complimentary rather than competition.</v>

98
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>So I'm getting the sense of that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin,</v>

99
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:21.340
<v Speaker 1>your question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

100
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>perhaps encouraging competition is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>not getting much traction here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't Macdonald.</v>

102
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

103
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.970
<v Speaker 8>I think the scientists are primarily </v>
<v Speaker 8>motivated by the science.</v>

104
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.210
<v Speaker 8>They're attempting to understand our </v>
<v Speaker 8>universe more completely.</v>

105
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.920
<v Speaker 8>I think they're quite satisfied when </v>
<v Speaker 8>they recognize themselves that they have</v>

106
00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:42.670
<v Speaker 8>made a breakthrough and have understood </v>
<v Speaker 8>things more completely.</v>

107
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.923
<v Speaker 8>I think when there is the recognition </v>
<v Speaker 8>like this by such a respected body as </v>

108
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:48.870
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

109
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.833
<v Speaker 8>people who define the Nobel prize,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's something that is highly respected </v>

110
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.293
<v Speaker 8>in the community.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It adds to the joy of having made a </v>

111
00:06:59.861 --> 00:07:01.120
<v Speaker 8>significant discovery.</v>

112
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.473
<v Speaker 1>So nobody really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does anybody resonate briefly on what </v>

113
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:08.730
<v Speaker 1>professor Deaton said about some sad </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage,</v>

114
00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 1>tormented souls going around saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

115
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I should have won the Nobel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have won the Nobel.</v>

116
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:14.054
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has anybody come across any of such </v>

117
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:16.694
<v Speaker 1>individuals?</v>

118
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.290
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

119
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.520
<v Speaker 3>I have a comment when you mom more then </v>
<v Speaker 3>why I should that none.</v>

120
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.203
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Juan didn't know about when you see a </v>

121
00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:28.990
<v Speaker 3>major breakthrough in your field.</v>

122
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.340
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

123
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.173
<v Speaker 3>I personally feel very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should admit that discover not that </v>

124
00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:39.451
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is something called Crispr is very</v>

125
00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:46.561
<v Speaker 3>hot in our field and I wish I would bet </v>
<v Speaker 3>that just color myself,</v>

126
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.090
<v Speaker 3>I would give anything for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

127
00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:53.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

128
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.453
<v Speaker 3>it's not competition per se,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is a US scientists and </v>

129
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 3>individuals drive to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to discover an important thing.</v>

130
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for your honesty professor </v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

131
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.073
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we were moving to a specific </v>

132
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:09.940
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is for you,</v>

133
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Professor Angus Deaton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your of course economics laureates,</v>

134
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:13.774
<v Speaker 1>and you won your prize for really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shedding a great deal of light on </v>

135
00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:17.554
<v Speaker 1>the links between poverty consumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>and welfare and what implications there </v>

136
00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>are for policy makers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

137
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.010
<v Speaker 1>particularly in setting levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxation from instance.</v>

138
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Speaker 1>But let's see what comes up from our </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

139
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.143
<v Speaker 1>Andrea with</v>

140
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.500
<v Speaker 8>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have a short question.</v>

141
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.670
<v Speaker 8>Is Fighting inequality a realistic aim?</v>

142
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.030
<v Speaker 9>MMM hmm.</v>

143
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.400
<v Speaker 3>It's maybe a short question though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure if short answer,</v>

144
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean here I think is the essence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the matter,</v>

145
00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 3>which has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have tools to fight inequality.</v>

146
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have in United States are much</v>

147
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>more</v>

148
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 4>progressive tax system presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

149
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 4>we could spend more money on education </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless I'm on the fence.</v>

150
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 4>I've heard as he's talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

151
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.260
<v Speaker 4>and there's lots of things you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

152
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:08.094
<v Speaker 4>so the question is not having the tools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's realistic in the sense that we </v>

153
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:12.740
<v Speaker 4>have the tools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

154
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.140
<v Speaker 4>It's unrealistic in the sense that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics is extraordinarily difficult.</v>

155
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who have all the money,</v>

156
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 4>all it's got to have a lot of political </v>
<v Speaker 4>power and they're not very interested in</v>

157
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:26.604
<v Speaker 4>fighting inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what do you do if you think </v>

158
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 4>there's too much in equality or </v>
<v Speaker 4>inequality is reached dangerous levels,</v>

159
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:37.190
<v Speaker 4>which I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I think the best thing to do is,</v>

160
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.123
<v Speaker 4>is you have to participate in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>democratic process and persuade other </v>

161
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 4>people that it's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For instance,</v>

162
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:45.140
<v Speaker 4>by being on a TV show like that.</v>

163
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.100
<v Speaker 1>So it is can be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see?</v>

164
00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:50.590
<v Speaker 1>But it's a lack of political will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tools are the,</v>

165
00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned taxation sort of in </v>
<v Speaker 1>passing,</v>

166
00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:53.464
<v Speaker 1>but just briefly outline for us then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the tools that can be used to </v>

167
00:09:57.461 --> 00:09:58.840
<v Speaker 1>reduce inequality?</v>

168
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.331
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

169
00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:00.820
<v Speaker 4>a lot of tax tools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

170
00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:04.210
<v Speaker 4>one of them for instances like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>inheritance tax for example.</v>

171
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.910
<v Speaker 4>But many of us have always thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

172
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.863
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fairly stiff inheritance taxes were a </v>

173
00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:11.104
<v Speaker 4>good thing because it helps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it stops you having this hereditary </v>

174
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.153
<v Speaker 4>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What Thomas picketty famously is called </v>

175
00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:18.820
<v Speaker 4>patrimonial capitalism,</v>

176
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.713
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French economist has written a lot </v>

177
00:10:20.621 --> 00:10:21.520
<v Speaker 1>about inequality.</v>

178
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.463
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think many of us think it's good </v>

179
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:25.464
<v Speaker 4>for each generation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>each group of kids who are born each </v>

180
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 4>generation to have an equal chance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just depending on what their parents</v>

181
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 4>have and two ways of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is um,</v>

182
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

183
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.233
<v Speaker 4>and Harrison's taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another is trying to equalize the </v>

184
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:42.444
<v Speaker 4>opportunities at schools and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>big concern in the United States now </v>

185
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:47.070
<v Speaker 4>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

186
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.440
<v Speaker 4>the best schools are going to the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

187
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 4>off the well off people and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 4>hard,</v>

188
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.550
<v Speaker 4>much harder than it was in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>generation for kids,</v>

189
00:10:56.551 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 4>for poor families to get into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get a really first class education.</v>

190
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 4>And that's absolutely vital</v>

191
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.310
<v Speaker 1>professor as he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

192
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:07.430
<v Speaker 1>would you mind mind bringing you in just</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this particular point?</v>

193
00:11:07.431 --> 00:11:08.264
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I hope you don't mind saying </v>

194
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:12.740
<v Speaker 1>that you were born in Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

195
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.110
<v Speaker 1>One of eight children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

196
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.500
<v Speaker 1>And your parents could not read or </v>
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

197
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.140
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write and here you are a Nobel laureate,</v>

198
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.420
<v Speaker 1>completely exemplifying what professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>did</v>

199
00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:24.723
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>United State has 25% of total prisoner </v>

200
00:11:28.871 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 3>population and that has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality.</v>

201
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.260
<v Speaker 3>It has to do with lack of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is a problem.</v>

202
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.343
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a recent article in </v>
<v Speaker 3>New England Journal Medicine comparing </v>

203
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.290
<v Speaker 3>the health care system and in Turkey and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States,</v>

204
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:55.090
<v Speaker 3>it's much better in Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey not have the resource,</v>

205
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.160
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here we,</v>

206
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:57.994
<v Speaker 3>we pass the [inaudible] or Obama care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a universal healthcare system </v>

207
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.613
<v Speaker 3>and we're still fighting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a growth in the United States still </v>

208
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 3>fighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

209
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:10.084
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I come from a country where </v>

210
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.400
<v Speaker 3>the resources and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

211
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 3>and so on are not as it does as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>

212
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.170
<v Speaker 3>I think in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a certain aspect,</v>

213
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 3>in terms of equal opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>

214
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.130
<v Speaker 3>education and Tokyo is free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have that,</v>

215
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.773
<v Speaker 1>but it was just your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own individual personal story </v>

216
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.113
<v Speaker 1>illustrates that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're given that equality of </v>

217
00:12:37.441 --> 00:12:40.100
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody of your,</v>

218
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 3>of background can rise to top can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wish my adopted country would take</v>

219
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.780
<v Speaker 3>the necessary steps to do that.</v>

220
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.330
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

221
00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was another question for you,</v>

222
00:12:52.431 --> 00:12:55.460
<v Speaker 1>professor Deaton and that's from David </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gandolfi.</v>

223
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.323
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>

224
00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.753
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you professor [inaudible] for </v>

225
00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:02.820
<v Speaker 3>coming here and think 12 the Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 3>laureates.</v>

226
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:03.953
<v Speaker 3>My question is specifically you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressed some criticism about foreign </v>

227
00:13:08.281 --> 00:13:10.680
<v Speaker 3>aid to poor countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now why is that?</v>

228
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

229
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.943
<v Speaker 4>so let me start by saying that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>critical a tall of the wish to help </v>

230
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:23.530
<v Speaker 4>people in poor countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think a lot of what we're doing in</v>

231
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:24.364
<v Speaker 4>terms of foreign aid right now is </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually not helping a tall and there's </v>

232
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:27.964
<v Speaker 4>lots of things we can do from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside which will make the new </v>

233
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:34.870
<v Speaker 4>innovations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the new discoveries and so on,</v>

234
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:35.973
<v Speaker 4>which will help poor countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think countries that have very large </v>

235
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:39.663
<v Speaker 4>aid and flows into the domestic economy </v>
<v Speaker 4>that tends to undermine the sort of </v>

236
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:46.490
<v Speaker 4>responsible government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

237
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.370
<v Speaker 4>that you need in order for development </v>
<v Speaker 4>to have any chance of taking place.</v>

238
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.473
<v Speaker 4>I think that sort of aid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a bill here is my example of </v>

239
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:57.880
<v Speaker 4>exactly the sort of aid that really </v>
<v Speaker 4>works,</v>

240
00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.003
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is we can spend money in the </v>

241
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:01.684
<v Speaker 4>United States and Sweden and so on to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get the sort of discoveries that save </v>

242
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:08.770
<v Speaker 4>millions of lives or save Fifo for being</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought blind.</v>

243
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a sort of aid.</v>

244
00:14:10.691 --> 00:14:14.410
<v Speaker 4>So I'm not a blanket against aid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if we can help spend money,</v>

245
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:15.244
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Merck made that drug available through </v>

246
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:19.720
<v Speaker 4>the World Bank that too many people </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the world.</v>

247
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.590
<v Speaker 4>And you know that that's a huge gift </v>
<v Speaker 4>from rich countries to poor countries,</v>

248
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:26.963
<v Speaker 1>don't you rulers in Africa because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't trust them for what they'll do </v>

249
00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:29.490
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

250
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 4>Or we're creating dodgy rulers by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

251
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:32.944
<v Speaker 4>basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to raise anything from </v>

252
00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:37.500
<v Speaker 4>your own population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll keep you in business by giving you</v>

253
00:14:37.501 --> 00:14:38.940
<v Speaker 4>a norms of sums of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

254
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.833
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're making the dodgy rulers even </v>

255
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.450
<v Speaker 4>dodgier and that's the one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>central problem.</v>

270
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:33.873
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that has led to a genre that you </v>

271
00:15:35.651 --> 00:15:36.484
<v Speaker 1>describe as a documentary novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the citation said that you have the </v>

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.243
<v Speaker 1>Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the three medicine and </v>

357
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.150
<v Speaker 1>physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a laureate,</v>

358
00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but to your two colleagues are not with </v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

359
00:22:29.401 --> 00:22:30.234
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you two from China who was awarded the </v>

360
00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:35.660
<v Speaker 1>prize for discovering a very effective </v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria treatment,</v>

361
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.990
<v Speaker 1>artemisinin derived from natural plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly enough,</v>

362
00:22:38.991 --> 00:22:42.650
<v Speaker 1>she actually went and referred to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese book on h on medicine,</v>

363
00:22:42.651 --> 00:22:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Chinese medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 1,700</v>

364
00:22:45.321 --> 00:22:46.310
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

365
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.413
<v Speaker 1>but you were also awarded the prize </v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Campbell with professor a </v>

366
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:52.470
<v Speaker 1>murderer from Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

367
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.353
<v Speaker 1>and he sent you some soil when he sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>the institute that you're working at </v>

368
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.750
<v Speaker 1>some soil samples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from that do you manage to derive,</v>

369
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment for terrible tropical diseases</v>

370
00:23:03.711 --> 00:23:08.510
<v Speaker 1>elephantiasis where the limbs really </v>
<v Speaker 1>swell and river blindness,</v>

371
00:23:08.511 --> 00:23:13.511
<v Speaker 1>which is a terrible affliction that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha has ruined lives millions of lives.</v>

372
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:19.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you won the prize for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's hear what the question is from</v>

373
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Falls Forsberg.</v>

374
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:22.663
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you</v>

375
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.013
<v Speaker 10>professor Campo.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Where do you think that the next </v>

376
00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:29.180
<v Speaker 10>generation of antibiotics will come </v>
<v Speaker 10>from?</v>

377
00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.140
<v Speaker 10>Are they coming primarily from the </v>
<v Speaker 10>nature itself?</v>

378
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.633
<v Speaker 10>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think they are most likely to come </v>

379
00:23:37.941 --> 00:23:38.774
<v Speaker 10>from nature.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I think we have a approach this </v>

380
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.353
<v Speaker 10>evenly in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We sometimes get caught up with very </v>

381
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:54.131
<v Speaker 10>sophisticated modern technology and its </v>
<v Speaker 10>possibilities of finding new drugs.</v>

382
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.143
<v Speaker 10>It's odd and reassuring to me that all </v>
<v Speaker 10>three of us involved in this particular </v>

383
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.930
<v Speaker 10>prize,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

384
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.540
<v Speaker 10>worked with plants,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

385
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.603
<v Speaker 10>or products of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I recently made a proposal Arcane </v>

386
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.250
<v Speaker 10>back to what I've been making for over </v>
<v Speaker 10>40 years.</v>

387
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:17.563
<v Speaker 10>But my proposal now is to have a much </v>
<v Speaker 10>greater scouring of the world for novel </v>

388
00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:32.480
<v Speaker 10>microorganisms or animals or plants that</v>
<v Speaker 10>may provide the next leads.</v>

389
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.700
<v Speaker 10>And there are talents out there that I </v>
<v Speaker 10>think could it be brought to bear.</v>

390
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.320
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>

391
00:24:39.321 --> 00:24:40.154
<v Speaker 10>if,</v>
<v Speaker 10>if countries can put men outside of the </v>

392
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:45.530
<v Speaker 10>earth and bring them back to Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

393
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 10>one would think they could solve some of</v>
<v Speaker 10>these problems.</v>

394
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.863
<v Speaker 1>But when you were working on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try on what led to Ivermectin and you </v>

395
00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:54.874
<v Speaker 1>talked about how you went to Togo in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa when it was really uplifting for </v>

396
00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:02.620
<v Speaker 1>you to see the children being treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this terrible illness,</v>

397
00:25:02.621 --> 00:25:04.930
<v Speaker 1>which their parents and grandparents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

398
00:25:04.931 --> 00:25:07.180
<v Speaker 1>literally rendered blind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

399
00:25:07.181 --> 00:25:10.630
<v Speaker 1>was that a motivating factor for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of compassion?</v>

400
00:25:10.631 --> 00:25:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Was that part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

401
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.450
<v Speaker 10>the motivation for they get beard was </v>
<v Speaker 10>inspirational to me.</v>

402
00:25:15.451 --> 00:25:19.200
<v Speaker 10>It was uplifting for me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It was a fabulous thing for me,</v>

403
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:25.190
<v Speaker 10>but most researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 10>even in medical fields and setting aside</v>

404
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:28.223
<v Speaker 10>certain idealistic physicians,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but most researchers and medical field </v>

405
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.363
<v Speaker 10>are interested in the research and they </v>
<v Speaker 10>are interested in doing research that </v>

406
00:25:35.821 --> 00:25:36.654
<v Speaker 10>might turn out to be good,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but there is their motivation is </v>

407
00:25:39.331 --> 00:25:42.900
<v Speaker 10>basically the curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the scientific challenge.</v>

408
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.243
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>certainly was saw that it'd be great if </v>

409
00:25:47.281 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 10>this was useful,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but uh,</v>

410
00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.350
<v Speaker 10>which is not done for reasons of </v>
<v Speaker 10>compassion.</v>

411
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.840
<v Speaker 10>And I think that's a frequent </v>
<v Speaker 10>misunderstanding.</v>

412
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.080
<v Speaker 10>But also by way of perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 10>let me say this,</v>

413
00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.100
<v Speaker 10>that's when I was employed by the Merck </v>
<v Speaker 10>pharmaceutical company many years ago.</v>

414
00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.053
<v Speaker 10>I was employed specifically and solely </v>
<v Speaker 10>to try and find a new drug for </v>

415
00:26:07.171 --> 00:26:09.180
<v Speaker 10>schistosomiasis,</v>
<v Speaker 10>a tropical disease,</v>

416
00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.133
<v Speaker 10>sometimes called snail fever.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And that spelled hot sandwich build </v>

417
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.230
<v Speaker 10>hardship.</v>

418
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.290
<v Speaker 10>I bill her ties.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It was,</v>

419
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:18.900
<v Speaker 10>and I worked on that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>solely focused on that for seven years I</v>

420
00:26:18.901 --> 00:26:23.901
<v Speaker 10>had an unblemished record of failure and</v>
<v Speaker 10>I had a wonderful time doing it.</v>

421
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:26.123
<v Speaker 10>I was not the slightest bit discouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I intended to spend with the rest of my </v>

422
00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:32.100
<v Speaker 10>life doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But I got into a lot of other things.</v>

423
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:36.210
<v Speaker 10>And that project was carried on by other</v>
<v Speaker 10>people in my department for many,</v>

424
00:26:36.211 --> 00:26:39.180
<v Speaker 10>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I was never asked you to stop doing it.</v>

425
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.280
<v Speaker 10>I never ceased to be funded for doing </v>
<v Speaker 10>it.</v>

426
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 10>And I think there are lots of discussion</v>
<v Speaker 10>we should have about</v>

427
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.890
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody pick up a,</v>

428
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:51.891
<v Speaker 1>although despite this breakthrough of </v>
<v Speaker 1>treating these terrible diseases,</v>

429
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.040
<v Speaker 1>compassion was not necessarily the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivating factor.</v>

430
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor [inaudible]</v>

431
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.960
<v Speaker 5>we work on cancer research so people </v>
<v Speaker 5>also call the time,</v>

432
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.310
<v Speaker 5>are you finding any new drugs for </v>
<v Speaker 5>counselors are trained,</v>

433
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.900
<v Speaker 5>can we cure cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

434
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.950
<v Speaker 5>I hope that will be an important </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequence of what we are doing.</v>

435
00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:11.784
<v Speaker 5>But as I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's still the side effect of what we </v>

436
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:15.024
<v Speaker 5>are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we are really trying to do is </v>

437
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:19.980
<v Speaker 5>understand the world we are living in </v>
<v Speaker 5>how cells function.</v>

438
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.740
<v Speaker 5>Once we know that we can develop new </v>
<v Speaker 5>drugs and all kinds of other nights</v>

439
00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.940
<v Speaker 3>I have follow up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

440
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:32.390
<v Speaker 3>I have not been this jealous of Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 3>prize in medicine my entire life.</v>

441
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.223
<v Speaker 3>I rarely buy why an I heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said this is the way to give no value </v>

442
00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.153
<v Speaker 3>for somebody.</v>

443
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

444
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.153
<v Speaker 3>I had a lab meeting that morning and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>usually discuss our experiments and I </v>

445
00:27:59.471 --> 00:28:04.471
<v Speaker 3>just didn't discuss the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I discussed Nobel and Madison and I this</v>

446
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.520
<v Speaker 3>cost heroes and these guys are my,</v>

447
00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:08.521
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

448
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:10.320
<v Speaker 1>What they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can I say their professors,</v>

449
00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.163
<v Speaker 1>San Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's an expert in DNA and </v>

450
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:13.554
<v Speaker 1>maybe jeans and that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might try and isolate the mvg and </v>

451
00:28:16.531 --> 00:28:21.531
<v Speaker 1>use yourself and then a forward tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice about everybody now.</v>

452
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.033
<v Speaker 1>So well that I just didn't see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chemists Nobel laureates have come </v>

453
00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:28.380
<v Speaker 1>in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chemistry Nobel.</v>

454
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:28.681
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

455
00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:32.240
<v Speaker 1>let's go to our specific question on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

456
00:28:32.241 --> 00:28:37.070
<v Speaker 1>your work on repairing damaged DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emma Erickson,</v>

457
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.430
<v Speaker 1>you have a question.</v>

458
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.500
<v Speaker 11>Do you think that the future is strategy</v>
<v Speaker 11>of the,</v>

459
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:43.733
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>curing cancer will be to repair the </v>

460
00:28:47.181 --> 00:28:51.320
<v Speaker 11>reparation systems of DNA or,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

461
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.100
<v Speaker 11>will the changes in behavior be more </v>
<v Speaker 11>important?</v>

462
00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.600
<v Speaker 1>So should people change their behavior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor,</v>

463
00:28:58.601 --> 00:28:59.590
<v Speaker 1>moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderate,</v>

464
00:28:59.591 --> 00:28:59.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

465
00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.540
<v Speaker 6>Certain behaviors are directly caused </v>
<v Speaker 6>cancer.</v>

466
00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.600
<v Speaker 6>Smoking as one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

467
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.460
<v Speaker 6>alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that I'm not going to that</v>

468
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:15.290
<v Speaker 1>my personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my personal kalea man who enjoys a tip.</v>

469
00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drink out.</v>

470
00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.050
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] my personal belief is that </v>
<v Speaker 6>the alcohol,</v>

471
00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.610
<v Speaker 6>alcohol itself is not known to the a </v>
<v Speaker 6>carcinogen,</v>

472
00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:24.910
<v Speaker 6>but one of its metabolic products is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

473
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.540
<v Speaker 6>and I think it's quite clear that </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain,</v>

474
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.860
<v Speaker 6>it's probable in my view that certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>food products may have a cancer causing,</v>

475
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.660
<v Speaker 1>could you say some food products because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're happy not to have headlines.</v>

476
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean there have been any of them been </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressed in there,</v>

477
00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:45.623
<v Speaker 6>popular media and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think the evidence is incomplete </v>

478
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.333
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think the evidence will be </v>

479
00:29:51.901 --> 00:29:54.030
<v Speaker 6>forthcoming and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this,</v>

480
00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.613
<v Speaker 6>I think we'll probably go a long way to </v>
<v Speaker 6>reducing or potentially reducing the </v>

481
00:29:59.551 --> 00:30:01.650
<v Speaker 6>incidence of cancer in the human </v>
<v Speaker 6>population.</v>

482
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:02.763
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think the evidence will come </v>

483
00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 1>because we have about the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast,</v>

484
00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:08.420
<v Speaker 1>the English breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

485
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:09.893
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago it was debatable whether </v>

486
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 1>smokers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll say 50 years ago</v>

487
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.860
<v Speaker 6>it's debatable whether I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

488
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.220
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes cause cancer and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's quite clear.</v>

489
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.160
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's completely unequivocal and</v>

490
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not alcohol though.</v>

491
00:30:23.551 --> 00:30:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you eat cured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>processed meats are cooked.</v>

492
00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.630
<v Speaker 1>You too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

493
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.650
<v Speaker 1>if he's good enough for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor moderate.</v>

494
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:31.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

495
00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.643
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say not as I did a professor has he </v>

496
00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:38.574
<v Speaker 1>Sandra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause your particular work focused very </v>

497
00:30:39.631 --> 00:30:40.464
<v Speaker 1>much on um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some exposure to sun and Uva damage </v>

498
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.753
<v Speaker 1>ultra violet down yet he was still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some babies don't mean that spine off </v>

499
00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:49.873
<v Speaker 1>there are</v>

500
00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.293
<v Speaker 3>vigorous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like k itself and why men being a </v>

501
00:30:55.281 --> 00:30:57.660
<v Speaker 3>carcinogen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no doubt that uh,</v>

502
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sun exposure ultraviolet cause just came</v>

503
00:31:01.731 --> 00:31:03.950
<v Speaker 3>cancer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

504
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

505
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:09.200
<v Speaker 3>people do some bait and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

506
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:12.060
<v Speaker 3>how you change people's behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to do it.</v>

507
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.130
<v Speaker 1>We'll move onto our physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

508
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.203
<v Speaker 1>Laurie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's now to cocky Kavita and author </v>

509
00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:18.683
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's because you won your prize </v>
<v Speaker 1>for neutrinos telling us that neutrinos </v>

510
00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:27.980
<v Speaker 1>which are this subatomic particle which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is ubiquitous in our universe,</v>

511
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:32.640
<v Speaker 1>used to be thought that it had no mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've discovered that it does have some</v>

512
00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:36.990
<v Speaker 1>mass and I understand that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of these things passing through</v>

513
00:31:36.991 --> 00:31:39.720
<v Speaker 1>our body and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

514
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.130
<v Speaker 1>in some way it will help us understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the universe works better.</v>

515
00:31:44.131 --> 00:31:47.250
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very brief summary of your,</v>

516
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you won the prize for.</v>

517
00:31:49.081 --> 00:31:52.770
<v Speaker 1>But let's get our question from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth Elisabet.</v>

518
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Lily blood your question please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the physics laureates.</v>

519
00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.850
<v Speaker 12>Do you think that mankind will benefit </v>
<v Speaker 12>in the future from researchers in fields</v>

520
00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:04.204
<v Speaker 12>beyond applied physics such as Astro </v>
<v Speaker 12>particle physics in more ways than by </v>

521
00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:10.780
<v Speaker 12>increasing our general knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 12>universe?</v>

522
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.980
<v Speaker 12>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Professor Macdonald,</v>

523
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.613
<v Speaker 8>the greater degree to which you can </v>
<v Speaker 8>understand the details of the laws of </v>

524
00:32:19.501 --> 00:32:22.030
<v Speaker 8>physics to better you are to apply such </v>
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>

525
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.483
<v Speaker 8>I'll give you an example,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even from the such esoteric and </v>

526
00:32:26.431 --> 00:32:30.000
<v Speaker 8>difficult to detect particles as </v>
<v Speaker 8>neutrinos,</v>

527
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.630
<v Speaker 8>neutrinos are outside the general </v>
<v Speaker 8>experience of,</v>

528
00:32:33.631 --> 00:32:34.650
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>of humans.</v>

529
00:32:34.651 --> 00:32:35.484
<v Speaker 8>Maybe once in your lifetime and the </v>
<v Speaker 8>trainer will stop in your body and </v>

530
00:32:37.921 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 8>change one at home and do something else</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you won't even notice it.</v>

531
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 8>But that's really the only influence </v>
<v Speaker 8>that you have.</v>

532
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:44.594
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and yet there are something like 6 </v>

533
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.290
<v Speaker 8>billion neutrinos going through your </v>
<v Speaker 8>fingernail per second from the sun.</v>

534
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.513
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we use those neutrinos from the sun to </v>

535
00:32:54.261 --> 00:32:55.094
<v Speaker 8>understand the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fusion processes that are taking place </v>

536
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:02.150
<v Speaker 8>that power the sun with great accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In fact,</v>

537
00:33:02.151 --> 00:33:02.984
<v Speaker 8>the puzzle that we solved a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that neutrinos do change from one type </v>

538
00:33:06.771 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 8>to another,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which implies they have mass.</v>

539
00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:11.043
<v Speaker 8>I was able to sort out what could have </v>
<v Speaker 8>been a problem with the calculations of </v>

540
00:33:15.861 --> 00:33:16.694
<v Speaker 8>how many neutrinos are produced and </v>
<v Speaker 8>therefore the understanding of the </v>

541
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:21.320
<v Speaker 8>basic,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

542
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 8>fusion power of the sun confined by </v>
<v Speaker 8>gravity.</v>

543
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 8>It's now been determined that these </v>
<v Speaker 8>calculations are accurate,</v>

544
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:34.640
<v Speaker 8>too much better than 10%.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those are the same types of calculations</v>

545
00:33:34.641 --> 00:33:35.474
<v Speaker 8>that are being applied and to try to </v>
<v Speaker 8>harness fusion power here on earth </v>

546
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:39.674
<v Speaker 8>confined by magnetic fields.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so it's a prime example of how </v>

547
00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:46.040
<v Speaker 8>knowing the pure physics as accurately </v>
<v Speaker 8>as you can,</v>

548
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.113
<v Speaker 8>enables you then to apply those laws of </v>
<v Speaker 8>physics and trying to move forward with </v>

549
00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:51.494
<v Speaker 8>applied physics.</v>

550
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Casita.</v>

551
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.213
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's interesting that Professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arch Mcdonald there talks about how I </v>

552
00:33:57.281 --> 00:33:59.820
<v Speaker 1>think it's one of the three types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrinos is,</v>

553
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.790
<v Speaker 1>is from the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And mentioning this idea,</v>

554
00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:07.030
<v Speaker 1>a few nuclear fusion is what I want you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to ask you about because it often people</v>

555
00:34:07.031 --> 00:34:11.080
<v Speaker 1>are looking at that now as a source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy for us.</v>

556
00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is this,</v>

557
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.193
<v Speaker 1>is this something which your discovery </v>
<v Speaker 1>that neutrinos have mass could perhaps </v>

558
00:34:18.281 --> 00:34:23.260
<v Speaker 1>help us harness nuclear fusion from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the sun better?</v>

559
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.050
<v Speaker 13>Let me mention the application of pure </v>
<v Speaker 13>physics into the,</v>

560
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.280
<v Speaker 13>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 13>applied science wanting another example.</v>

561
00:34:32.281 --> 00:34:34.620
<v Speaker 13>Not neutrino physics.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Okay,</v>

562
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:42.070
<v Speaker 13>well this a year is the a 100 years of </v>
<v Speaker 13>general later activity.</v>

563
00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:49.290
<v Speaker 13>People thought this is really a pure </v>
<v Speaker 13>science,</v>

564
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.020
<v Speaker 13>no application to daily life.</v>
<v Speaker 13>However,</v>

565
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:56.123
<v Speaker 13>after wine 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 13>we cannot leave without the knowledge </v>

566
00:35:00.911 --> 00:35:01.744
<v Speaker 13>of,</v>
<v Speaker 13>to narrow their activity because gps is </v>

567
00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:08.870
<v Speaker 13>based on Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

568
00:35:08.871 --> 00:35:10.620
<v Speaker 13>later activity.</v>
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>

569
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:11.753
<v Speaker 13>we use GPS.</v>
<v Speaker 13>But if we have no idea but [inaudible] </v>

570
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.780
<v Speaker 13>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 13>the GPS doesn't work.</v>

571
00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 13>So didn't know Lira tvt which was </v>
<v Speaker 13>thought to be pure theoretical,</v>

572
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.980
<v Speaker 13>pure basic science.</v>
<v Speaker 13>Is it two hours a day?</v>

573
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:37.450
<v Speaker 13>He died after 100 yet?</v>
<v Speaker 13>So maybe new t knows.</v>

574
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.180
<v Speaker 7>Could it also be great fun?</v>

575
00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.593
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to bring in a grantee </v>

576
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.483
<v Speaker 1>Nordstrom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've got a question which is </v>

577
00:35:44.721 --> 00:35:47.780
<v Speaker 1>very related to the answer you've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>already given.</v>

578
00:35:47.781 --> 00:35:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Professor Guy Cogito.</v>

579
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:50.463
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm wondering if you think that focus </v>

580
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.900
<v Speaker 7>off academia should be on fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 7>research,</v>

581
00:35:55.901 --> 00:35:56.734
<v Speaker 7>so to find out how the world really </v>
<v Speaker 7>works or if we should focus more on </v>

582
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:04.770
<v Speaker 7>application and product development.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who'd like to pick pick up on that?</v>

583
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:07.880
<v Speaker 7>And then professor calculators already </v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of addressed that.</v>

584
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've done that too.</v>

585
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 6>I think history is clearly shown us time</v>
<v Speaker 6>after time.</v>

586
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:18.021
<v Speaker 6>The of the power of knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 6>knowledge comes from basic science or,</v>

587
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:21.040
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

588
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:21.873
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

589
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.300
<v Speaker 6>Basic research and other fields and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

590
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:26.783
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's hard to develop new things </v>
<v Speaker 6>if you do not understand how the world </v>

591
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:31.704
<v Speaker 6>works.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's really the goal of basic </v>

592
00:36:34.651 --> 00:36:37.080
<v Speaker 6>science and I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's an intrinsic value.</v>

593
00:36:37.081 --> 00:36:37.914
<v Speaker 6>I would argue that every major metro </v>
<v Speaker 6>modern medical advance is directly tied </v>

594
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.500
<v Speaker 6>to advances in basic science.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

595
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we Atlanta Elixir richer.</v>

596
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.033
<v Speaker 1>I want you to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously you're not a </v>

597
00:36:48.771 --> 00:36:49.604
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your writing is very much based on </v>

598
00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:53.523
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And research which you get from the </v>

599
00:36:55.421 --> 00:37:00.421
<v Speaker 1>people you talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who bear witness to the upheavals in the</v>

600
00:37:00.881 --> 00:37:04.110
<v Speaker 1>events that you have drawn on for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

601
00:37:04.111 --> 00:37:05.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

602
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.770
<v Speaker 1>really is picking up the professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modric she's point that,</v>

603
00:37:08.771 --> 00:37:09.604
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to anchor what you do on </v>

604
00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.570
<v Speaker 1>research in your case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking to people.</v>

605
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:20.993
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just cause I [inaudible] [inaudible] </v>

616
00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.890

<v Speaker 7>give us thank you professor eating.</v>

617
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:27.743
<v Speaker 7>You won't just give me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just wanted to come back a little bit </v>

618
00:38:29.321 --> 00:38:32.560
<v Speaker 7>to compassion and curiosity and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>know,</v>

619
00:38:32.561 --> 00:38:34.840
<v Speaker 7>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I,</v>

620
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 7>we all do this.</v>

621
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything I've heard about,</v>

622
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're actually doing the work,</v>

623
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 4>you're motivated by curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by trying to resolve puzzles,</v>

624
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.123
<v Speaker 4>by trying to resolve paradoxes and saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also remember as he is at a previous </v>

625
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:50.254
<v Speaker 4>meeting saying that one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments in his life is when he's in the </v>

626
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.103
<v Speaker 4>laboratory and he sees something and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks only God and I for the moment </v>

627
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.610
<v Speaker 4>understand those processes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

628
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean in my way I can think of things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that too.</v>

629
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:09.940
<v Speaker 4>There's a moment when I suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand something and everything fits</v>

630
00:39:09.941 --> 00:39:13.390
<v Speaker 4>into place and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just know a whole bunch,</v>

631
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.470
<v Speaker 4>you know those lights suddenly where </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was darkness and missed before and</v>

632
00:39:17.471 --> 00:39:21.250
<v Speaker 4>that's a wonderful feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so we don't do it for compassion.</v>

633
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.730
<v Speaker 4>We do it for that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Aha moment,</v>

634
00:39:24.731 --> 00:39:26.980
<v Speaker 4>that discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

635
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:30.970
<v Speaker 4>it's all within a social context in </v>
<v Speaker 4>which that are funding agencies.</v>

636
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:31.804
<v Speaker 4>I there their society who's deciding </v>
<v Speaker 4>which fields are really important to </v>

637
00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:36.034
<v Speaker 4>work on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people responding and economics </v>

638
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.310
<v Speaker 4>whenever those like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

639
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.183
<v Speaker 4>in the Great Depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was what caused some of the </v>

640
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:43.114
<v Speaker 4>greatest future Nobel laureates and </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people to move into economics </v>

641
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.330
<v Speaker 4>because they wanted to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was the compassion,</v>

642
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.840
<v Speaker 4>the drove people into economics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funding agencies,</v>

643
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:54.280
<v Speaker 4>it's poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the world.</v>

644
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.300
<v Speaker 4>And for me it's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for me it's been very direct,</v>

645
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.590
<v Speaker 3>lovely makeup client.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

646
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.740
<v Speaker 3>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a scientist I usually think that what</v>

647
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:06.603
<v Speaker 3>I say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll start scientists pay any </v>

648
00:40:09.391 --> 00:40:14.391
<v Speaker 3>attention to and I'm really gratified </v>
<v Speaker 3>and very happy that Dr Dayton,</v>

649
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:17.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as coach me twice.</v>

650
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.533
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I should say that actually </v>

651
00:40:22.011 --> 00:40:24.440
<v Speaker 1>interesting enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you as eastern jar or an MD,</v>

652
00:40:24.441 --> 00:40:25.274
<v Speaker 1>a medical doctor as you are to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Lindahl but you only lasted one </v>

653
00:40:29.001 --> 00:40:30.860
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a doctor and you only two years.</v>

654
00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:31.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

655
00:40:31.981 --> 00:40:36.010
<v Speaker 1>So you didn't have the compassion gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>to carry on health.</v>

656
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Professor Lindo weekly</v>

657
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:44.190
<v Speaker 5>like to go back to sweat Lana's comment </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we are in the privilege society,</v>

658
00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:45.604
<v Speaker 5>we can pursue our ideas without being </v>
<v Speaker 5>regarded with suspicion by the </v>

659
00:40:50.651 --> 00:40:51.484
<v Speaker 5>government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm old enough to have had called digs </v>

660
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.520
<v Speaker 5>and down some somber kin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eastern Germany,</v>

661
00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.433
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bit over 35 years ago and it was </v>

662
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:06.580
<v Speaker 5>Soviet stepped the local scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they immediately became my friends too.</v>

663
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:08.044
<v Speaker 5>I never met them before because we had </v>
<v Speaker 5>the common enemy and there were people </v>

664
00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:12.514
<v Speaker 5>in gray suits who are sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>room trying to figure out if we were </v>

665
00:41:15.341 --> 00:41:16.174
<v Speaker 5>doing something subversive in their mind</v>
<v Speaker 5>scientist for the same thing as </v>

666
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 5>terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

667
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 5>that was an uneasy feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

668
00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.533
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that has largely disappeared </v>

669
00:41:27.011 --> 00:41:27.844
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

670
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got some,</v>

671
00:41:29.161 --> 00:41:33.940
<v Speaker 1>a couple of questions now if I can go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anneli Borg first and then Rabiah Aau.</v>

672
00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:36.300
<v Speaker 1>But if you could both give us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

673
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.090
<v Speaker 1>your point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anna Lee.</v>

674
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.493
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my question is whether you would </v>

675
00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:46.631
<v Speaker 1>encourage young person or a student to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a scientist in your own field.</v>

676
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

677
00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Ruppia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

678
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:55.880
<v Speaker 1>what skills do you think for most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important on your way to success?</v>

679
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

680
00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:57.843
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would like to pick up on Annalee </v>

681
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.373
<v Speaker 1>Borg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you encourage a young person or </v>

682
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:03.760
<v Speaker 1>student to become a scientist in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>field?</v>

683
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Professing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say it.</v>

684
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you because I know that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a teacher,</v>

685
00:42:09.051 --> 00:42:13.790
<v Speaker 1>a chemistry teacher who you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really get on with and who failed you in</v>

686
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:15.200
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet here you are.</v>

687
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.370
<v Speaker 1>I can't mistreat laureate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

688
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:20.204
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

689
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.073
<v Speaker 5>Clean stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are some teachers that are very </v>

690
00:42:22.781 --> 00:42:27.781
<v Speaker 5>bad teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be stubborn in science.</v>

691
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.980
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you shouldn't be easily discouraged.</v>

692
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:40.180
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>occasionally you meet scientists to have</v>

693
00:42:40.181 --> 00:42:44.380
<v Speaker 5>some idea that's obviously wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they just spend years and years pursuing</v>

694
00:42:44.381 --> 00:42:47.250
<v Speaker 5>that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's exception of the,</v>

695
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:51.220
<v Speaker 5>I think it's much more common that </v>
<v Speaker 5>scientists give up too easily.</v>

696
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.153
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have an unusual observation and </v>

697
00:42:53.981 --> 00:42:57.260
<v Speaker 5>nature's telling you something here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are privileged,</v>

698
00:42:57.261 --> 00:42:58.094
<v Speaker 5>you have new information and that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't just put it in a drawer </v>

699
00:43:01.331 --> 00:43:02.590
<v Speaker 5>because you don't understand it.</v>

700
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Professor Dayton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually didn't start off.</v>

701
00:43:05.351 --> 00:43:06.910
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to become an economist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

702
00:43:06.911 --> 00:43:09.460
<v Speaker 1>You actually went into university to </v>
<v Speaker 1>study mathematics</v>

703
00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.020
<v Speaker 4>and then gave up on it already gave up </v>
<v Speaker 4>on me.</v>

704
00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say one thing though,</v>

705
00:43:15.711 --> 00:43:17.330
<v Speaker 4>and some of you are not going to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

706
00:43:17.331 --> 00:43:18.164
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mathematics I learned early on has </v>

707
00:43:20.451 --> 00:43:24.230
<v Speaker 4>been incredibly useful to me even though</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a mathematician.</v>

708
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.453
<v Speaker 4>And there's a very wide range of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sciences and economics and other things </v>

709
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 4>where mathematics is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

710
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push yourself as far as who cam,</v>

711
00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:36.920
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that direction.</v>

712
00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.213
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's obviously areas where it's more </v>

713
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:40.574
<v Speaker 4>important than others,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's often extremely important and </v>

714
00:43:42.801 --> 00:43:45.380
<v Speaker 4>it helps you think very clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

715
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.303
<v Speaker 4>as part of it,</v>

716
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.640
<v Speaker 3>we're all talk about how this or that </v>
<v Speaker 3>teacher made a big difference now lives,</v>

717
00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're not paid well,</v>

718
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:59.710
<v Speaker 3>they're not respected in society are our</v>
<v Speaker 3>best minds do not go into teaching.</v>

719
00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:04.570
<v Speaker 3>And I just hope that through this </v>
<v Speaker 3>medium,</v>

720
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:05.743
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both young scientist I young people and </v>

721
00:44:08.261 --> 00:44:11.740
<v Speaker 3>their parents encourage their children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the capable,</v>

722
00:44:11.741 --> 00:44:14.140
<v Speaker 3>intelligent children to become teachers.</v>

723
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.280
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one</v>

724
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.710
<v Speaker 1>thing I'd like to say in and use you as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an example,</v>

725
00:44:24.711 --> 00:44:25.544
<v Speaker 1>perhaps professor Bill Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that don't be scared of the </v>

726
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:29.534
<v Speaker 1>contradictions perhaps within you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know that you have a huge </v>

727
00:44:34.201 --> 00:44:39.201
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admiration and respect for parasites and</v>

728
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:42.540
<v Speaker 1>worms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet ironically,</v>

729
00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:46.170
<v Speaker 1>you've spent your life researching how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill them,</v>

730
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:47.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this,</v>

731
00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm bivalence here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know in your spec on you'd like to</v>

732
00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:53.670
<v Speaker 1>paint them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you paint worms.</v>

733
00:44:53.671 --> 00:44:58.200
<v Speaker 1>And when you met President Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave you a stuffed animal in the form</v>

734
00:44:58.201 --> 00:44:59.220
<v Speaker 1>of a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

735
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Pride of place in your home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

736
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:07.280
<v Speaker 1>and you also write poems about worms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping that you might be able to,</v>

737
00:45:10.821 --> 00:45:12.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us a rendition</v>

738
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:14.803
<v Speaker 10>and my poems,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I sometimes like to speak on behalf of </v>

739
00:45:18.231 --> 00:45:21.640
<v Speaker 10>the worms and gives them a chance to say</v>
<v Speaker 10>something.</v>

740
00:45:21.641 --> 00:45:24.650
<v Speaker 10>And then I do happen to have one in </v>
<v Speaker 10>particular,</v>

741
00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:29.480
<v Speaker 10>the case for a worm that causes river </v>
<v Speaker 10>blindness.</v>

742
00:45:29.481 --> 00:45:30.360
<v Speaker 10>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

743
00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:31.993
<v Speaker 10>I can imagine it being very frustrated </v>
<v Speaker 10>and getting more and more angry as </v>

744
00:45:35.661 --> 00:45:38.980
<v Speaker 10>people accuse it of causing blindness </v>
<v Speaker 10>when blind.</v>

745
00:45:38.981 --> 00:45:43.981
<v Speaker 10>This in fact is a chance of shoot of </v>
<v Speaker 10>their infection there.</v>

746
00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.373
<v Speaker 10>The causative agent does migrating </v>
<v Speaker 10>through the skin all over the body and </v>

747
00:45:48.531 --> 00:45:50.960
<v Speaker 10>some of them are going to end up in the </v>
<v Speaker 10>eye.</v>

748
00:45:50.961 --> 00:45:52.040
<v Speaker 10>And those humans,</v>
<v Speaker 10>of course,</v>

749
00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:53.630
<v Speaker 10>we were very,</v>
<v Speaker 10>very unhappy about it.</v>

750
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.583
<v Speaker 10>But I imagine I'm one of those where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 10>saying this and you have to remember </v>

751
00:45:58.611 --> 00:46:02.340
<v Speaker 10>that I think they're pretty frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't need your goddamned,</v>

752
00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.410
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>all I need is a piece of skin big enough</v>

753
00:46:06.411 --> 00:46:07.244
<v Speaker 10>to let me drop a few larvae in just </v>
<v Speaker 10>enough to make sure that they will be a </v>

754
00:46:11.811 --> 00:46:15.710
<v Speaker 10>pickup and delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Don't look at me that way.</v>

755
00:46:15.711 --> 00:46:17.500
<v Speaker 10>I don't need your God damn high.</v>

756
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:29.840
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

757
00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Bill Campbell at that actually thank you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all of our lawyers especially,</v>

758
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:40.510
<v Speaker 1>but both [inaudible] and renewed.</v>
