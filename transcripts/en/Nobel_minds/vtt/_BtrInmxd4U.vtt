<v Speaker 1>heard the news?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Randy Schekman.</v>

17
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

18
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.313
<v Speaker 2>I was deep asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my wife heard the phone and she </v>

19
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 2>blurted out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>

20
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I picked up the phone and I heard a soft</v>

21
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Swedish voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And although I'm not a religious person,</v>

22
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I blurted out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

23
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>And you knew that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>banana toast for your grandchildren.</v>

26
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I see that the banana toast all had </v>
<v Speaker 2>these seven things,</v>

27
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.203

<v Speaker 2>to get the recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.443
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

49
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:57.174
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd left home late morning because </v>

50
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 3>although I wasn't intending to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearing the announcement,</v>

51
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 3>I was intending to avoid these </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsequent to me dear attention.</v>

<v Speaker 3>for lunch.</v>

53
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.813
<v Speaker 3>And I went to an Arctic submission </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards and we walked home about </v>

54
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 3>three o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I was walking home,</v>

55
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.840

<v Speaker 3>the street,</v>

56
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.320

75
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.413
<v Speaker 5>I picked it up and I immediately dropped</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and it was dark and there were two </v>

76
00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:27.240
<v Speaker 5>buttons to push,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

77
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.800

85
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.600
<v Speaker 5>We'll talk about that in a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In medicine and physiology prize you,</v>

95
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:27.144
<v Speaker 6>accent because they never reached me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was Adam Smith who is the British </v>

96
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:31.494
<v Speaker 6>accent the British hasn't put and who </v>
<v Speaker 6>works for Nova Media and who thought I </v>

00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:37.020
<v Speaker 6>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I didn't.</v>

108
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:06.704
<v Speaker 7>the phone rang and I thought maybe I'll </v>
<v Speaker 7>just let it ring because it's too </v>

109
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:13.920
<v Speaker 7>difficult to get to the phone that I </v>
<v Speaker 7>thought about the,</v>

110
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 7>actually thought about the Nobel prize </v>
<v Speaker 7>and I thought,</v>

111
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 7>well that is a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I went and answered it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>students here will be very impressed to </v>

116
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:33.290

117
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.770
<v Speaker 8>I was listening to Don Pasquale and do </v>
<v Speaker 8>my back exercises,</v>

118
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.680

119
00:06:40.681 --> 00:06:41.514
<v Speaker 8>so thank you.</v>

120
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.320
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't come to you Michael it,</v>

121
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:45.154
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you tell the son what you were </v>

122
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.780
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you also in bed</v>

123
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.540
<v Speaker 8>chemistry?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's of course in California it was a to</v>

124
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:55.690
<v Speaker 8>16.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had gone to sleep an hour before,</v>

125
00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:58.240
<v Speaker 8>so that was pretty much asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

126
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.330
<v Speaker 8>what was interesting about the core,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not just the Swedish accent,</v>

127
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.610
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

128
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.653
<v Speaker 8>I guess a trick call people call you on </v>
<v Speaker 8>that day at that time and say you've </v>

129
00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:10.000
<v Speaker 8>just won the Nobel prize.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And last year,</v>

130
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:12.010
<v Speaker 8>apparently this had happened to somebody</v>
<v Speaker 8>the night before.</v>

131
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.010
<v Speaker 8>So this time we actually ask you a </v>
<v Speaker 8>question.</v>

132
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.940
<v Speaker 8>They tell you things that only they </v>
<v Speaker 8>could know.</v>

133
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.720
<v Speaker 8>Like we got drunk in Italy because as </v>
<v Speaker 8>soon as I had the news,</v>

134
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:20.554
<v Speaker 8>I ran.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And before I even updated my facebook </v>

135
00:07:22.511 --> 00:07:24.070
<v Speaker 8>entry,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I called my mother</v>

136
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.830
<v Speaker 1>who your mother and I have to mention </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

137
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I hope she won't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my saying Gertrude levied at 98,</v>

138
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.230
<v Speaker 1>you have traveled here to Sweden to join</v>
<v Speaker 1>a celebrations with your son.</v>

139
00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

140
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I think she just</v>

142
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.570
<v Speaker 9>[inaudible] is wonderful.</v>

143
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to ask you some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the economics.</v>

144
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Are Lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.273
<v Speaker 1>professor [inaudible] and professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>format for those of us trying to </v>

146
00:07:55.801 --> 00:08:00.130
<v Speaker 1>understand how that last financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis happened and uh,</v>

147
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.060
<v Speaker 1>worried about the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give us an overview.</v>

148
00:08:03.061 --> 00:08:05.700
<v Speaker 1>How far does your research help us do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

149
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:06.563
<v Speaker 1>Professor shooter?</v>

150
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're coming into a big disagreement.</v>

151
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 7>Lost lawyers agree on most things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>

152
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.240
<v Speaker 7>you've honed right in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then where gene and I disagree.</v>

153
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 7>Now I actually predicted the crisis in a</v>
<v Speaker 7>second addition to my book.</v>

154
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.353
<v Speaker 7>I believe that smart people can </v>
<v Speaker 7>partially predict the market and why </v>

155
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 7>shouldn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's,</v>

156
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.393
<v Speaker 7>it takes like anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you have to remember that you're </v>

157
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:35.864
<v Speaker 7>predicting human behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It involves a kind of broad judgment of </v>

158
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 7>bubbles,</v>
<v Speaker 7>speculative behavior and people.</v>

159
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say I'm professor farm.</v>

160
00:08:45.331 --> 00:08:46.164
<v Speaker 1>I mean I should just remind people </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadly speaking along with the lost </v>

161
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:49.684
<v Speaker 1>Peter Hansen who side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could not be with us because he's </v>

162
00:08:51.421 --> 00:08:52.254
<v Speaker 1>not well you were awarded the prize </v>
<v Speaker 1>jointly for launching hundred in </v>

163
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:56.364
<v Speaker 1>thinking to show that prices are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to predict in the short term and </v>

164
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 1>even harder in the long term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So professor Fama,</v>

165
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:07.581
<v Speaker 1>what's your answer to the questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can economists help us predict and avoid</v>

166
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:08.723
<v Speaker 1>financial?</v>

167
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 10>That's true about me.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Use the right words.</v>

168
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.014
<v Speaker 10>I believe that's the state of it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but I've looked at the records </v>

169
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.273
<v Speaker 10>systematically and tried to test for it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You cannot find it in the traces of the </v>

170
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 10>data.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

171
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.580
<v Speaker 10>so that's where we</v>

172
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 7>great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

173
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.330
<v Speaker 7>So what were you way on evidence about </v>
<v Speaker 7>statistical evidence about predictive?</v>

174
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 7>There's a difference in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now I'm married to a psychologist.</v>

175
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.290
<v Speaker 7>Maybe that's part of the reason he </v>
<v Speaker 7>always blames his way,</v>

176
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.603
<v Speaker 7>I believe in the unity of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think there are so many things </v>

177
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 7>outside of economics that people have to</v>
<v Speaker 7>wait.</v>

178
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 7>Psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sociology,</v>

179
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.850
<v Speaker 7>anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 7>political science,</v>

180
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 7>and now we're getting new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Neuropsychology.</v>

181
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

182
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.290
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these,</v>

183
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:02.350
<v Speaker 7>the what separates us is it </v>
<v Speaker 7>interpretation of human nature and about</v>

184
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:06.270
<v Speaker 7>the importance of the individual and the</v>
<v Speaker 7>state things that are,</v>

185
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.193
<v Speaker 7>and that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 7>although I think we are both scientists </v>

186
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:11.903
<v Speaker 7>and agree on some facts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the interpretation that different </v>

187
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.880
<v Speaker 7>gene Fama is one of the most successful </v>
<v Speaker 7>stock market predictors in the world.</v>

188
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.030
<v Speaker 7>He misinterprets,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he says I'm his,</v>

189
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.670
<v Speaker 7>he has dimensional fund advisors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is,</v>

190
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 7>can I say this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Managing $350 billion.</v>

191
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.613
<v Speaker 7>Huge Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why is he so why did these people come </v>

192
00:10:34.081 --> 00:10:36.140
<v Speaker 7>to him?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because he can predict the market,</v>

193
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.003
<v Speaker 7>not perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but well enough yet to outperform many </v>

194
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:40.884
<v Speaker 7>other f Eric and he's [inaudible] to me </v>
<v Speaker 7>is a science who knows how to predict </v>

195
00:10:46.721 --> 00:10:48.810
<v Speaker 7>the murder.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He just won't admit it.</v>

196
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 7>Well now you've brought up the subject </v>
<v Speaker 7>of money.</v>

197
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.840
<v Speaker 7>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let me,</v>

198
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.963
<v Speaker 7>let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've made a fortune out of predicting </v>

199
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.070
<v Speaker 7>what will my students crisis and they've</v>
<v Speaker 7>been kind enough to come with me.</v>

200
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 7>Handsome wafer professor should have </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

201
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 7>His theories,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>

202
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.510
<v Speaker 7>but it's not psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He can hate me.</v>

203
00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:10.344
<v Speaker 7>I explain it.</v>

204
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.630
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>what this company does is it,</v>

205
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.800
<v Speaker 10>it,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it uh,</v>

206
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:16.634
<v Speaker 10>forms portfolios.</v>
<v Speaker 10>They concentrate on particular kinds of </v>

207
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:19.574
<v Speaker 10>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So it's well understood that stocks are </v>

208
00:11:21.231 --> 00:11:24.530
<v Speaker 10>riskier than bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So if I phone or portfolio of stocks,</v>

209
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.700
<v Speaker 10>I can predict it in the long term that </v>
<v Speaker 10>will out likely outperform bonds.</v>

210
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.710
<v Speaker 10>In that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the market is predictable.</v>

211
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.300
<v Speaker 10>That's what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Okay.</v>

212
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.140
<v Speaker 10>But I don't think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you can predict whether the stock market</v>

213
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.360
<v Speaker 10>is going to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but that's a different story.</v>

214
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.303
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of debate here about </v>

215
00:11:40.181 --> 00:11:41.920
<v Speaker 1>economic students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the UK.</v>

216
00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:45.700
<v Speaker 1>We've got this debate wanting to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in policy debates.</v>

217
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.773
<v Speaker 1>We have one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a professor of economics at London </v>

218
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.360
<v Speaker 1>University who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:52.900
<v Speaker 1>my students are flipping the pages of </v>
<v Speaker 1>best sellers in economics.</v>

220
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 1>They want to get involved in policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>

221
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:56.134
<v Speaker 1>They're not happy with what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting in class because they feel they </v>

222
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>know better equipped to interpret what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

223
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Then students of archeology for </v>
<v Speaker 1>instance.</v>

224
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.623
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe it is your role as </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors of economics to teach your </v>

225
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:09.424
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates in your postgraduates how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to better understand the world of </v>

226
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 1>finance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I absolutely,</v>

227
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:15.634
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Jane and I are actually similar </v>

228
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 1>in that weird real world oriented and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jean,</v>

229
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 1>although his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't know it.</v>

230
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.243
<v Speaker 1>Listening to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's had a huge impact on the way </v>

231
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:29.770
<v Speaker 1>finances practice and it's very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done a lot.</v>

232
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Very generous isn't to your fellow nor </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

233
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.623
<v Speaker 1>I didn't use often that you get to at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Psu who'd been awarded the prize but a </v>

234
00:12:41.271 --> 00:12:45.130
<v Speaker 1>different interpretation and yet one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>still very generous like that in a,</v>

235
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 1>in his comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Students,</v>

236
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you want students of signs,</v>

237
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:49.384
<v Speaker 1>but does any of this resonate with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the kinds of lessons that </v>

238
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:54.484
<v Speaker 1>your getting from your professors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel that it equips you to </v>

239
00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 1>understand what's going on in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your own particular disciplines?</v>

240
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:02.471
<v Speaker 1>Any comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fees?</v>

241
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 1>In the students?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

242
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a comment here.</v>

243
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.280
<v Speaker 11>As a physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a undergraduate student,</v>

244
00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:11.360
<v Speaker 11>we are taught to analyze data in a real </v>
<v Speaker 11>world environment,</v>

245
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.390
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>famous experiments and around the world,</v>

246
00:13:14.391 --> 00:13:16.400
<v Speaker 11>like the large Hadron collider in </v>
<v Speaker 11>Geneva.</v>

247
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 11>So I definitely think that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

248
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:19.450
<v Speaker 11>our,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

249
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.660
<v Speaker 11>our schooling and education applies to </v>
<v Speaker 11>larger big world pictures for sure.</v>

250
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other comments on this point?</v>

251
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lady here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

252
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a economics in economics either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a neuroscientist,</v>

253
00:13:31.881 --> 00:13:36.350
<v Speaker 1>but we're taught to problem solve and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think critically and that should help in</v>

254
00:13:36.351 --> 00:13:38.870
<v Speaker 1>solving many problems that we're faced </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

255
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's one more just,</v>

256
00:13:41.901 --> 00:13:42.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

257
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:43.963
<v Speaker 1>I'm also a science student and I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I've learned in the last year on </v>

258
00:13:47.721 --> 00:13:48.554
<v Speaker 1>my master or eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the caters real tries us to think </v>

259
00:13:52.311 --> 00:13:57.080
<v Speaker 1>critically and understand the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also understand after five years</v>

260
00:13:57.081 --> 00:13:59.510
<v Speaker 1>that is really complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

261
00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.320
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

262
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.153
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that kind of sets the scene a </v>

263
00:14:02.811 --> 00:14:04.880
<v Speaker 1>little bit forwards to move into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

264
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.340
<v Speaker 1>into the scientists and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

265
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.200
<v Speaker 1>there's an underlying theme here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

266
00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:13.190
<v Speaker 1>should you as scientists teach the kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of signs that will help us address,</v>

267
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big problems of the day,</v>

268
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Jim Raffman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by equipping students with the skills of</v>

269
00:14:19.131 --> 00:14:21.830
<v Speaker 1>rigorous analytical thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking a problem,</v>

270
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.950
<v Speaker 1>breaking it down to component parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking which parts are are,</v>

271
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.370
<v Speaker 1>are solvable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ones can't be solved today,</v>

272
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.380
<v Speaker 1>and then directing you referred </v>
<v Speaker 1>appropriately.</v>

273
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.513
<v Speaker 1>That way of thinking can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the basis for solving problems of </v>

274
00:14:34.641 --> 00:14:35.474
<v Speaker 1>any kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're of immediate import or </v>

275
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.310
<v Speaker 1>whether they're problems we don't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about today.</v>

276
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what an education is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That what you're saying is,</v>

277
00:14:43.671 --> 00:14:46.370
<v Speaker 1>as you said in your speech when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>received the Nobel prize,</v>

278
00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:47.204
<v Speaker 1>it's a curiosity driven research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not research that's driven solving </v>

279
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.270
<v Speaker 1>a specific problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's [inaudible]</v>

280
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.010
<v Speaker 5>basically can never predict,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think we all agree on this,</v>

281
00:14:56.011 --> 00:15:00.730
<v Speaker 5>they could almost never predict where </v>
<v Speaker 5>something will lead in all of our work.</v>

282
00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.900
<v Speaker 5>There are examples of basic science that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've achieved in our laboratory,</v>

283
00:15:04.901 --> 00:15:05.734
<v Speaker 5>in our theoretical work that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>applications that one couldn't have </v>

284
00:15:08.201 --> 00:15:10.380
<v Speaker 5>imagined in my own work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

285
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.263
<v Speaker 5>what I did was a very basic problem in </v>
<v Speaker 5>how proteins are transported in yeast </v>

286
00:15:15.011 --> 00:15:15.844
<v Speaker 5>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which turns out having application and </v>

287
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.990
<v Speaker 5>liver cancer and ways that I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have imagined.</v>

288
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

289
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:21.944
<v Speaker 1>your research or medicine or physiology </v>
<v Speaker 1>helps us with the knowledge of a huge </v>

290
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:27.980
<v Speaker 1>range of illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes,</v>

291
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:30.770
<v Speaker 1>brain disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I should also say botox.</v>

292
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Botox obviously it has a magical purpose</v>

293
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:34.650
<v Speaker 1>because it helps people with that.</v>

294
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.320
<v Speaker 5>As I said in my remarks last night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my colleagues,</v>

295
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:39.363
<v Speaker 5>Rothman and sit half figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 5>nerve cells communicate with one </v>

296
00:15:43.181 --> 00:15:44.980
<v Speaker 5>another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It turns out that,</v>

297
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.260
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>botulism the disease,</v>

298
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>works by producing a toxin that,</v>

299
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.053
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inactivates protein molecules that they </v>

300
00:15:53.261 --> 00:15:54.440
<v Speaker 5>worked on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then that,</v>

301
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.620
<v Speaker 5>that has applications in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

302
00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.490
<v Speaker 5>Cosmetic word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

303
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:01.020
<v Speaker 5>or neuromuscular disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

304
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.660
<v Speaker 5>I have not used it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think I need it just yet.</v>

305
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:05.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

306
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:08.913
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

307
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Next to Terry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor check,</v>

308
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.333
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we want to go to one of our </v>

309
00:16:13.751 --> 00:16:17.020
<v Speaker 1>students here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A question about physics.</v>

310
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.083
<v Speaker 13>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 13>I am from the Royal Institute of </v>

311
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.543
<v Speaker 13>Technology.</v>
<v Speaker 13>And that was wondering what do you </v>

312
00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:22.170
<v Speaker 13>think?</v>
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

313
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.010
<v Speaker 13>Or what kinds of technological </v>
<v Speaker 13>applications do you think will come from</v>

314
00:16:26.011 --> 00:16:27.570
<v Speaker 13>the discovery of the Higgs Boson?</v>

315
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to prosser.</v>

316
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Professor Peter Higgs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

317
00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

318
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't know of any applications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

319
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.393
<v Speaker 3>you're asking about how you would make </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to have something which has been </v>

320
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.200
<v Speaker 3>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

321
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:43.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

322
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.323
<v Speaker 3>you have to put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to go to a lot of energy into </v>

323
00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 3>the making obit and then it lasts for an</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely short time.</v>

324
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

325
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 3>how can you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do anything useful with,</v>

326
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.620
<v Speaker 3>with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

327
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

328
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.570
<v Speaker 3>it's true that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

329
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.450
<v Speaker 3>politicals which have been discovered </v>
<v Speaker 3>previously,</v>

330
00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.200
<v Speaker 3>some of them have applications in </v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine for example,</v>

331
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 3>but they're relatively long lived </v>
<v Speaker 3>particles by our person's standards.</v>

332
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.753
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things which even when they were </v>

333
00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:22.710
<v Speaker 3>addressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe lost about a micro second.</v>

334
00:17:22.711 --> 00:17:26.090
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you make the move fast and relatively</v>

335
00:17:26.091 --> 00:17:26.924
<v Speaker 3>t tells you that they'll last longer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make beams and you can use them </v>

336
00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:31.853
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a cancer therapy and that sort of </v>

337
00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:34.494
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's okay for that kind of </v>

338
00:17:38.071 --> 00:17:38.850
<v Speaker 3>political,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

339
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.683
<v Speaker 3>but when you exploring this extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>high energy range where the things you </v>

340
00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:50.151
<v Speaker 3>produce just don't last very long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to how you could</v>

341
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.080
<v Speaker 2>actually control them and hears them.</v>

342
00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor on glow,</v>

343
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.560
<v Speaker 1>you shared the prize with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Professor Higgs for the physics,</v>

344
00:17:57.561 --> 00:17:58.394
<v Speaker 1>for the theory that explains why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny particles that make up atoms have </v>

345
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.550
<v Speaker 1>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be frank with you.</v>

346
00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:06.020
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the student,</v>

347
00:18:06.021 --> 00:18:09.350
<v Speaker 1>they're mentioned the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the higgs based on theory.</v>

348
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Everybody says including Professor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Higgs,</v>

349
00:18:11.451 --> 00:18:14.840
<v Speaker 1>that it should more accurately be known </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the b e h particle.</v>

350
00:18:14.841 --> 00:18:15.674
<v Speaker 1>The Robert Route who is unfortunately </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not able to receive the prize </v>

351
00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:19.964
<v Speaker 1>because he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it should be known as the Brown on </v>

352
00:18:22.071 --> 00:18:23.750
<v Speaker 1>glare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Higgs particle.</v>

353
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Does it annoy you that it's known as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Higgs Particle?</v>

354
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.453
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

355
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 9>You did what?</v>
<v Speaker 9>You did my miles.</v>

356
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:35.660
<v Speaker 9>Can you this question?</v>

357
00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put the wrinkles,</v>

358
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:42.700
<v Speaker 2>but I am not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way you want to solve this.</v>

359
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got was,</v>

360
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.580
<v Speaker 2>it annoys me just because it's not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>public of the whole,</v>

361
00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 2>the so called his mom was on the chairs </v>
<v Speaker 2>first not being introduced by age.</v>

362
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:58.723
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I have a complete admiration </v>

363
00:19:02.831 --> 00:19:04.460
<v Speaker 2>for his work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

364
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.080
<v Speaker 2>what should put things right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the media have a role in calling it,</v>

365
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.133
<v Speaker 2>well particular the Anglo Saxon fuse is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometime physics was kind of Taco game </v>

366
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:29.710
<v Speaker 2>know due to poor mode for even sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how also money things in bulk,</v>

367
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:39.703
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

368
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.140
<v Speaker 2>the contribution of English is </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

369
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

370
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.550
<v Speaker 2>and they have another teams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

371
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.710
<v Speaker 2>They detect the particular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

372
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

373
00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.293
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess one sentence since on their </v>

374
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:59.370
<v Speaker 2>detection and they're quite tight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they need money for that.</v>

375
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.113
<v Speaker 2>When I professor [inaudible] haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid because I didn't answer your </v>

376
00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:08.034
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

377
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.010
<v Speaker 9>I thought you were on,</v>

378
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.810
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

379
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have been many b,</v>

380
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.133
<v Speaker 2>which are played the whole before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory was remade and people who have </v>

381
00:20:20.461 --> 00:20:24.280
<v Speaker 2>made things after the theory is made and</v>
<v Speaker 2>as usual,</v>

382
00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:29.580
<v Speaker 2>this is complete nonsense to give the </v>
<v Speaker 2>name of a person,</v>

383
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.190
<v Speaker 2>any person in a group setting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's not the right one,</v>

384
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 2>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

385
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:38.844
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's reasonable to give all the </v>

386
00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.530
<v Speaker 2>particle a letter and personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

387
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.733
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

388
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I would propose that letter the age.</v>

389
00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.413
<v Speaker 9>Ah,</v>

390
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.420
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that final suggestion,</v>

391
00:20:59.421 --> 00:21:03.800
<v Speaker 1>take your name off Higgs Boson and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>call it the letter h h theory.</v>

392
00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your response.</v>

393
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.943
<v Speaker 3>I would be very happy with that solution</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the person's situation </v>

394
00:21:08.371 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 3>embarrasses me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

395
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.390
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

396
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Why does it embarrass you?</v>

397
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

398
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's come about so accidentally.</v>

399
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a recognition of,</v>

400
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:21.980
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

401
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.070
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

402
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.690
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was any sort of special,</v>

403
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal in this is story though.</v>

404
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.060
<v Speaker 3>There were many people involved as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as wise as I said.</v>

405
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.570
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

406
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.463
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so happened that my name has been </v>

407
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 3>attached to it for a number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>accidental reasons.</v>

408
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

409
00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.710
<v Speaker 3>that's unfair to the other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>

410
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.813
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to make a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the particle and what is called the </v>

411
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 3>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is how to,</v>

412
00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.080
<v Speaker 3>how would you get mass rather particles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

413
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy with the solution which is now</v>

414
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:02.430
<v Speaker 3>becoming common in particle physics </v>
<v Speaker 3>world to call it the b h mechanism.</v>

415
00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:04.450
<v Speaker 3>And that's to me the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

416
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.730
<v Speaker 3>the really the important part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Siri,</v>

417
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.973
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

418
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:08.853
<v Speaker 3>the particle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's soul should not carry anybody's </v>

419
00:22:11.321 --> 00:22:16.321
<v Speaker 3>name and the solution of giving it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>letter h because in the past my name has</v>

420
00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:19.630
<v Speaker 3>been attached or it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a good one.</v>

421
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.640
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

422
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we'll leave,</v>

423
00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 1>we'll leave that particular exchange </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and um,</v>

424
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 1>the student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next time you ask your question,</v>

425
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 1>be careful what you call it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

426
00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.400
<v Speaker 1>It will be professor Thomas Uhthoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

427
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you have one of the joint winners of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine physiology prize.</v>

428
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I just want to ask you what you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the application of your particular</v>

429
00:22:44.921 --> 00:22:45.754
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it matter to you that your </v>

430
00:22:47.711 --> 00:22:52.000
<v Speaker 1>discoveries for your work on um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vesicles and I won't go into too much,</v>

431
00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 1>but they kind of are an act as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>

432
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:56.250
<v Speaker 1>internal shipping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

433
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.243
<v Speaker 1>service or postman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can send materials around the </v>

434
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 1>settle can even fuse with its outer </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>

435
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.063
<v Speaker 1>But how important was it for you when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were doing your research that this </v>

436
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.470
<v Speaker 1>would actually help perhaps save lives?</v>

437
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.913
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was afraid you were going to ask me </v>

438
00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:13.594
<v Speaker 6>about the Hicks puzzle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think in a common theme in science is </v>

439
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.043
<v Speaker 6>we do science best we made on have an </v>
<v Speaker 6>application in mind because of the </v>

440
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 6>limits,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our imagination and creativity.</v>

441
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:32.340
<v Speaker 6>But in the end we feel mostly watered </v>
<v Speaker 6>when what we discover out of a quest for</v>

442
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:37.000
<v Speaker 6>knowledge leads actually to an </v>
<v Speaker 6>application.</v>

443
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:38.643
<v Speaker 6>And so what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think what my fellow laureates </v>

444
00:23:42.431 --> 00:23:43.264
<v Speaker 6>too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's extremely important for us </v>

445
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 6>to find that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't call it an accident,</v>

446
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 6>but serendipity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we do actually is useful.</v>

447
00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a motivating factor for all of you</v>

448
00:23:57.911 --> 00:24:00.370
<v Speaker 1>in your research or do you just see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a bonus</v>

449
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.800
<v Speaker 8>professor level?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What I would say is that,</v>

450
00:24:02.801 --> 00:24:03.634
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and to use an economic inc similarly </v>

451
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:07.913
<v Speaker 8>here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is that a research that is longer </v>

452
00:24:10.181 --> 00:24:13.660
<v Speaker 8>term is much,</v>
<v Speaker 8>much larger pay off.</v>

453
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:18.190
<v Speaker 8>And in some senses I think that this </v>
<v Speaker 8>sort of fits into what,</v>

454
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.093
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when you were saying you don't want to </v>

455
00:24:20.951 --> 00:24:23.500
<v Speaker 8>think about solving tomorrow's problems </v>
<v Speaker 8>today,</v>

456
00:24:23.501 --> 00:24:24.334
<v Speaker 8>you want to solve about problems that </v>
<v Speaker 8>haven't even been designed yet and then </v>

457
00:24:27.491 --> 00:24:28.324
<v Speaker 8>you'll have a massive impact.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I think this is a very critical </v>

458
00:24:30.071 --> 00:24:33.610
<v Speaker 8>thing because we are increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 8>wanting to solve short term problems.</v>

459
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.013
<v Speaker 8>And I think it is perhaps high energy </v>
<v Speaker 8>physics doesn't have a very direct </v>

460
00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:40.683
<v Speaker 8>practical application,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's really hard to imagine the </v>

461
00:24:43.331 --> 00:24:44.740
<v Speaker 8>applications that are going to come up.</v>

462
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The long views and I mean the,</v>

463
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.060
<v Speaker 1>these gentle recognize decades later </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the work they actually did.</v>

464
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:52.163
<v Speaker 1>I mean James Rothman just picking up </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point about research and the long </v>

465
00:24:54.511 --> 00:24:55.380
<v Speaker 1>view and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

466
00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.453
<v Speaker 1>would you be happy if you are a young </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist starting out today trying to </v>

467
00:24:58.951 --> 00:25:01.030
<v Speaker 1>embark on some research which needed </v>
<v Speaker 1>funding?</v>

468
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.423
<v Speaker 14>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I'd be very happy if I was a young </v>

469
00:25:03.421 --> 00:25:05.370
<v Speaker 14>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 14>I wouldn't be an old science,</v>

470
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.670
<v Speaker 14>but,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

471
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:09.660
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

472
00:25:09.661 --> 00:25:10.461
<v Speaker 14>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 14>we're,</v>

473
00:25:10.461 --> 00:25:11.294
<v Speaker 14>we're in a very challenging era before </v>
<v Speaker 14>for the very reasons that we heard a </v>

474
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.200
<v Speaker 14>moment ago from,</v>
<v Speaker 14>from Michael.</v>

475
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.610
<v Speaker 14>There's an increasingly,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

476
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:19.703
<v Speaker 14>increasing effort on the short term </v>
<v Speaker 14>short term success and it causes young </v>

477
00:25:24.811 --> 00:25:29.310
<v Speaker 14>scientists to take less in the way of </v>
<v Speaker 14>risk and to do more research.</v>

478
00:25:29.311 --> 00:25:31.830
<v Speaker 14>That's more incremental small step here,</v>
<v Speaker 14>a small step,</v>

479
00:25:31.831 --> 00:25:34.800
<v Speaker 14>they're more likely to reap a short term</v>
<v Speaker 14>reward.</v>

480
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.270
<v Speaker 14>But,</v>
<v Speaker 14>uh,</v>

481
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.500
<v Speaker 14>those of us around the table today,</v>
<v Speaker 14>I think each in our own way,</v>

482
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.633
<v Speaker 14>we're taking on problems that were very </v>
<v Speaker 14>challenging in our time quite some time </v>

483
00:25:45.511 --> 00:25:46.130
<v Speaker 14>ago.</v>

484
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.963
<v Speaker 6>We all feel an enormous increase in </v>
<v Speaker 6>pressure from public institutions or </v>

485
00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 6>rather from politicians and the public </v>
<v Speaker 6>foundations,</v>

486
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.840
<v Speaker 6>patient advocates,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

487
00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:02.530
<v Speaker 6>to do science that will lead to tangible</v>
<v Speaker 6>results tomorrow.</v>

488
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.943
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This cure that now and in my view that </v>

489
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:07.993
<v Speaker 6>never works because you can't cure </v>
<v Speaker 6>something you don't understand and our </v>

490
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 6>case physiology on dre or medicine </v>
<v Speaker 6>Professor Rochelle,</v>

491
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:15.563
<v Speaker 4>Samuel first try to solve problems which</v>
<v Speaker 4>are really difficult like how enzyme </v>

492
00:26:19.891 --> 00:26:20.724
<v Speaker 4>work Indo case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the mass in the universe and </v>

493
00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:30.080
<v Speaker 4>eventually some of the solutions has </v>
<v Speaker 4>application in lily to your question,</v>

494
00:26:30.421 --> 00:26:34.680
<v Speaker 4>what is missing in all of this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching politicians in the university,</v>

495
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:39.270
<v Speaker 4>people who will become politician to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand some concepts in science.</v>

496
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:43.080
<v Speaker 4>So in the future they will be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

497
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.453
<v Speaker 4>Making</v>

498
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:45.383
<v Speaker 1>this is this is something important that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all should be better educated in </v>

499
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:51.630
<v Speaker 1>science by examination.</v>

500
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.943
<v Speaker 8>It seems to me that I don't know if this</v>
<v Speaker 8>is necessary because I can go require a </v>

501
00:26:57.741 --> 00:27:02.510
<v Speaker 8>very narrow minded politician to say </v>
<v Speaker 8>that size hadn't had a massive effect on</v>

502
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.120
<v Speaker 8>everything we do over the last hundred </v>
<v Speaker 8>years.</v>

503
00:27:05.121 --> 00:27:08.490
<v Speaker 8>It seems to me that the general,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

504
00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.170
<v Speaker 8>maybe none targeted investment in </v>
<v Speaker 8>science that we've had at say,</v>

505
00:27:12.171 --> 00:27:14.840
<v Speaker 8>let's just say since the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 8>War has paid off,</v>

506
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.220
<v Speaker 8>unbelievably the living standard,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

507
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.800
<v Speaker 8>maybe that's where we have so many </v>
<v Speaker 8>people on earth,</v>

508
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.600
<v Speaker 8>but it's all part of the success of </v>
<v Speaker 8>science.</v>

509
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.570
<v Speaker 8>So it seems to me that we don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 8>justify every little</v>

510
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:26.680
<v Speaker 1>12 point that Professor Walsh and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

511
00:27:26.681 --> 00:27:27.514
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might suppose you're basically saying </v>

512
00:27:27.971 --> 00:27:31.000
<v Speaker 1>scientific illiteracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people need to be better educated,</v>

513
00:27:31.001 --> 00:27:32.530
<v Speaker 1>public politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

514
00:27:32.531 --> 00:27:33.364
<v Speaker 1>it's scientific illiteracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more acceptable than other forms of </v>

515
00:27:35.741 --> 00:27:36.150
<v Speaker 1>relief.</v>

516
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.950
<v Speaker 8>I have thought about that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If I said,</v>

517
00:27:37.951 --> 00:27:39.330
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh Shakespeare,</v>

518
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:41.220
<v Speaker 8>who cares about him?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't think my God.</v>

519
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.230
<v Speaker 8>But if somebody says a billion,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a million,</v>

520
00:27:43.231 --> 00:27:44.730
<v Speaker 8>what difference does it make?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

521
00:27:44.731 --> 00:27:45.920
<v Speaker 8>that's a pretty big error.</v>

522
00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.180
<v Speaker 5>People need to learn much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>statistically.</v>

523
00:27:48.181 --> 00:27:51.210
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there is a check when,</v>

524
00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.053
<v Speaker 5>and then she has a tremendous ignorance </v>
<v Speaker 5>of science in the u s which </v>

525
00:27:54.581 --> 00:27:58.930
<v Speaker 5>unfortunately is fostered by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>political process right now.</v>

526
00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.900
<v Speaker 5>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

527
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a great deal of disbelief.</v>

528
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.690
<v Speaker 5>It basic scientific principles in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>United States that drives the,</v>

529
00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>politics.</v>

530
00:28:07.001 --> 00:28:11.590
<v Speaker 5>There's a dismissal of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a disbelief in climate change,</v>

531
00:28:11.591 --> 00:28:16.150
<v Speaker 5>in spite of the overwhelming evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So w w we have to do a better job.</v>

532
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.280
<v Speaker 5>It used to be that the government,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

533
00:28:18.281 --> 00:28:19.114
<v Speaker 5>I've been the beneficiary of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have all been the beneficiary of an </v>

534
00:28:21.341 --> 00:28:23.220
<v Speaker 5>investment in science starting with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

535
00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.160
<v Speaker 5>the end of World War II with the sputnik</v>
<v Speaker 5>era in the United States.</v>

536
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.970
<v Speaker 5>It was enormous investment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's science,</v>

537
00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.360
<v Speaker 5>science education that's diminished </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly in the public.</v>

538
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.513
<v Speaker 1>So it's not happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think science is getting </v>

539
00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:34.990
<v Speaker 1>funding sufficient,</v>

540
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.441
<v Speaker 5>not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

541
00:28:36.441 --> 00:28:37.261
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then what,</v>

542
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:40.970
<v Speaker 5>what is funded is being managed more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>much more so than it used to be.</v>

543
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.030
<v Speaker 5>I said Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

544
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:42.863
<v Speaker 7>As an economist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would like to point out that </v>

545
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:50.060
<v Speaker 7>scientific research provides a public </v>
<v Speaker 7>good that benefits the entire world.</v>

546
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.610
<v Speaker 7>So one country,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's take Sweden.</v>

547
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 7>Politicians here would rationally think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why should we pay for it?</v>

548
00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.973
<v Speaker 7>The rest of the world will do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If we pay 1 million kroner for some </v>

549
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:03.714
<v Speaker 7>research project,</v>
<v Speaker 7>only a tiny part of that will benefit </v>

550
00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:07.950
<v Speaker 7>Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'll go all over the world.</v>

551
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:08.963
<v Speaker 7>So part of the defense of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 7>research has to be a cosmopolitan </v>

552
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.463
<v Speaker 7>publix,</v>

553
00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:16.483
<v Speaker 1>what professor said have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you scientists have to </v>

554
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:19.284
<v Speaker 1>communicate better with the public and </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians about what it is you are </v>

555
00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:24.624
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have a question I think from one </v>

556
00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 1>of the students here about this subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

557
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Ricard the Gui,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Karolinska Institute.</v>

558
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:32.843
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder if you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do scientists communicate bad leaders </v>

559
00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:38.550
<v Speaker 1>science?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we avoid the misunderstanding and</v>

560
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:43.551
<v Speaker 1>gain a better presence on public debates</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this point of communication?</v>

561
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:44.853
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor farmer economists obviously </v>

562
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:47.590
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not a pure science,</v>

563
00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 1>your social scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are asked to comment every hour,</v>

564
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 1>every day of the week because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis and so on.</v>

565
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you make a good job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with the public?</v>

566
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:57.803
<v Speaker 8>I don't think we make it clear and </v>
<v Speaker 8>distinguishing between the things we </v>

567
00:30:03.451 --> 00:30:04.284
<v Speaker 8>know based on research that had been </v>
<v Speaker 8>done and opinions that we have based on </v>

568
00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:10.830
<v Speaker 8>our own interpretation of things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think we do a good job on that.</v>

569
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.053
<v Speaker 8>I think too many economists are willing </v>
<v Speaker 8>to talk too much about things that they </v>

570
00:30:15.091 --> 00:30:17.490
<v Speaker 8>really don't know a lot about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

571
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.640
<v Speaker 8>I try to avoid that immature mentality </v>
<v Speaker 8>successful.</v>

572
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:21.560
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

573
00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.480
<v Speaker 1>and they do lots of media interviews </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

574
00:30:23.481 --> 00:30:25.550
<v Speaker 1>asked to predict what is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're actually,</v>

575
00:30:25.551 --> 00:30:29.030
<v Speaker 1>before he got the Nobel prize and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>was much interested in me,</v>

576
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.790
<v Speaker 1>then afterward they became interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

577
00:30:31.791 --> 00:30:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I said I didn't change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still a dumb guy.</v>

578
00:30:34.131 --> 00:30:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You thought I was two months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Sheila,</v>

579
00:30:36.681 --> 00:30:37.514
<v Speaker 1>you do interact a lot with apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've written books which are supposed </v>

580
00:30:41.961 --> 00:30:44.870
<v Speaker 1>to be accessing if a student as it's on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you write books,</v>

581
00:30:44.871 --> 00:30:45.704
<v Speaker 1>which is supposed to be accessible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>even people who haven't started </v>

582
00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:48.554
<v Speaker 1>economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your view on how economists </v>

583
00:30:50.061 --> 00:30:50.894
<v Speaker 1>communicate with the public?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that economists have been </v>

584
00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:58.190
<v Speaker 1>too much in the science model of </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>

585
00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Concise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Short.</v>

586
00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some of that is good </v>
<v Speaker 1>concise,</v>

587
00:31:01.251 --> 00:31:06.251
<v Speaker 1>short journal articles that make a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow but frontier contribution that we</v>

588
00:31:08.871 --> 00:31:11.930
<v Speaker 1>model ourselves after a physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly I think.</v>

589
00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.573
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's an older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different tradition that's also </v>

590
00:31:15.801 --> 00:31:16.634
<v Speaker 1>valuable and that is writing books that </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw together theory and practice and </v>

591
00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:27.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the profession tends to,</v>

592
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.090
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written a book that is rare,</v>

593
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.230
<v Speaker 1>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh that's a,</v>

594
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.263
<v Speaker 1>they call it a popular realization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that some of these </v>

595
00:31:36.651 --> 00:31:37.860
<v Speaker 1>books that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they red,</v>

596
00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:38.694
<v Speaker 1>are popular realizations at all there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their synthesis that can operate at a </v>

597
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.540
<v Speaker 1>level of an ordinary intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's online as well.</v>

598
00:31:47.541 --> 00:31:48.950
<v Speaker 1>You provide lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

599
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.510
<v Speaker 1>you can take my car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also provide lectures online.</v>

600
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:55.290
<v Speaker 8>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

601
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:56.553
<v Speaker 8>in the last say 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 8>communication has undergone an </v>

602
00:31:59.661 --> 00:32:02.030
<v Speaker 8>incredible revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And at the time when,</v>

603
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.183
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>facebook has been phased out for </v>

604
00:32:03.891 --> 00:32:05.810
<v Speaker 8>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which has been phased out for a snapshot</v>

605
00:32:05.811 --> 00:32:06.644
<v Speaker 8>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it seems to me that the only way we can </v>

606
00:32:09.771 --> 00:32:13.730
<v Speaker 8>communicate thing is not to communicate </v>
<v Speaker 8>with people in their forties,</v>

607
00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:14.893
<v Speaker 8>even if the way is the community.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was people in their teens and early </v>

608
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.033
<v Speaker 8>twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it seems to me that everyone here </v>

609
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.520
<v Speaker 8>should be on facebook</v>

610
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:30.860
<v Speaker 1>freely accessible to non students as </v>
<v Speaker 1>students ever won a science.</v>

611
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

612
00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.550
<v Speaker 1>get some feedback here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who thinks that scientists do a good job</v>

613
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:40.550
<v Speaker 1>of communicating with the public and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>see people their hands up who thinks,</v>

614
00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 1>does scientists do a good job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with the public?</v>

615
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you think scientists do a bad job of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with the public</v>

616
00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.013
<v Speaker 6>mine</v>

617
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.583
<v Speaker 1>who thinks that these Nobel laureates </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been doing a good job of </v>

618
00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:58.691
<v Speaker 1>communicating it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So know you've got a good,</v>

619
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.043
<v Speaker 1>you got a good response to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just asked you whether you feel that </v>

620
00:33:02.601 --> 00:33:03.434
<v Speaker 1>sometimes scientists are running ahead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what society both understands and </v>

621
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:12.170
<v Speaker 1>thinks is acceptable and without going </v>
<v Speaker 1>into various examples here,</v>

622
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.213
<v Speaker 1>it's really a question about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential misuse of your discoveries or </v>

623
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.470
<v Speaker 1>a potential lack of understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what your discoveries may bring about.</v>

624
00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so many examples.</v>

625
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of the Belgian geneticist </v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

626
00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:29.120
<v Speaker 1>who brought about gm who says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Montague,</v>

627
00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:29.954
<v Speaker 1>Mark Van Montague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who says that society fears science </v>

628
00:33:33.441 --> 00:33:36.530
<v Speaker 1>because it upsets the traditional way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

629
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:37.543
<v Speaker 1>Do any of you worry at night about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>your various discoveries may be misused </v>

630
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:41.654
<v Speaker 1>in the future?</v>

631
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:42.993
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

632
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.320
<v Speaker 2>To turn the question just a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is an overselling our part</v>

633
00:33:50.331 --> 00:33:54.710
<v Speaker 2>sometimes of what science can do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just use an example,</v>

634
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:59.711
<v Speaker 2>the war on cancer in the 1970s under </v>
<v Speaker 2>President Nixon real,</v>

635
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.810
<v Speaker 2>it really wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't an enormous investment.</v>

636
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:05.270
<v Speaker 2>A lot of science was done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but cancer was not cured.</v>

637
00:34:05.271 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't over promise what we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver.</v>

638
00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:11.940
<v Speaker 6>Is there overhype professor said hop on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the part of scientists.</v>

639
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.833
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that communicating with the </v>

640
00:34:14.551 --> 00:34:15.384
<v Speaker 6>public,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's probably one of the biggest </v>

641
00:34:17.161 --> 00:34:17.994
<v Speaker 6>mistakes we are scientists have made </v>
<v Speaker 6>because we haven't communicated the </v>

642
00:34:21.481 --> 00:34:22.314
<v Speaker 6>magnitude of the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We haven't communicate how difficult it </v>

643
00:34:25.321 --> 00:34:26.011
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>

644
00:34:26.011 --> 00:34:26.844
<v Speaker 6>don't understand a cancer cell or to </v>
<v Speaker 6>understand the brain and people expect </v>

645
00:34:30.331 --> 00:34:34.410
<v Speaker 6>us to solve this and to have solutions </v>
<v Speaker 6>tomorrow and that's our fault.</v>

646
00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.273
<v Speaker 6>Why do you think that happens?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because we claim to make discoveries as </v>

647
00:34:39.151 --> 00:34:41.400
<v Speaker 6>a community that aren't there.</v>

648
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:42.583
<v Speaker 1>And do you think you're asked the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions sometimes or pushed into </v>

649
00:34:44.681 --> 00:34:47.390
<v Speaker 1>saying things you shouldn't say by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media?</v>

650
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:50.650
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's blaming the media again.</v>

651
00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>

652
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the DP guilty,</v>

653
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.560
<v Speaker 2>the communication of tides is the basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>education to begin with.</v>

654
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.463
<v Speaker 2>Do you see either sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can try to give a vague idea </v>

655
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.620
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

656
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.870
<v Speaker 2>to people about how they can be cured </v>
<v Speaker 2>about some cancer.</v>

657
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Then they may understand something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

658
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.950
<v Speaker 2>But if you try to explain something </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is deeper,</v>

659
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make a deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean basic far right,</v>

660
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.173
<v Speaker 2>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they don't have any mathematical </v>

661
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:38.573
<v Speaker 2>basis to understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the difficulty comes already from </v>

662
00:35:42.361 --> 00:35:43.950
<v Speaker 2>the first year.</v>

663
00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.793
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said at the start that you are all </v>

664
00:35:47.691 --> 00:35:48.524
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously Alice Munro won the prize for </v>

665
00:35:50.391 --> 00:35:53.280
<v Speaker 1>literature and one of the chemistry </v>
<v Speaker 1>laureates,</v>

666
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Martin Karplus can't be with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously another man.</v>

667
00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:01.130
<v Speaker 1>What is it about science and women check</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Michael Levitt?</v>

668
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem is with the age </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of the gentleman here.</v>

669
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

670
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.280
<v Speaker 2>we all did our work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

671
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.810
<v Speaker 2>the work that I was credited for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did as an assistant professor.</v>

672
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.820
<v Speaker 2>That was back at a time when there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>few women.</v>

673
00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.530
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were no women in my department.</v>

674
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 2>There are many more women that we hire </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

675
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:15.961
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

676
00:36:15.961 --> 00:36:16.794
<v Speaker 2>I look forward to in 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll still be just as young </v>

677
00:36:19.981 --> 00:36:21.010
<v Speaker 2>interviewing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

678
00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:22.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of women.</v>

679
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I like you and still no botox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor Higgs,</v>

680
00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.250
<v Speaker 2>lack of women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

681
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:27.783
<v Speaker 3>and my kind of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are interesting differences </v>

682
00:36:29.931 --> 00:36:34.250
<v Speaker 3>between different countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least at least within Europe.</v>

683
00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until I went to Italy,</v>

684
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:42.800
<v Speaker 3>I think my prejudice would have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

685
00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:43.731
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

686
00:36:43.731 --> 00:36:44.564
<v Speaker 3>the southern Catholic countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're less likely to have women </v>

687
00:36:48.981 --> 00:36:49.814
<v Speaker 3>scientists in the northern mostly </v>
<v Speaker 3>Protestant countries because of the </v>

688
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:59.470
<v Speaker 3>attitudes of the Catholic Church to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>women ought to be doing.</v>

689
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.660
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the other way round.</v>

690
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:03.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

691
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:04.723
<v Speaker 3>it's Italy which has the largest </v>
<v Speaker 3>proportion of women in physics and the </v>

692
00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.270
<v Speaker 3>northern countries do rather badly by </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison.</v>

693
00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:15.363
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting point you </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise there professor higgs because </v>

694
00:37:16.991 --> 00:37:17.824
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is famous for its very efficient </v>

695
00:37:19.781 --> 00:37:20.614
<v Speaker 1>and effective childcare system actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a very low number of professors </v>

696
00:37:23.801 --> 00:37:26.020
<v Speaker 1>right across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only in science,</v>

697
00:37:26.021 --> 00:37:29.260
<v Speaker 1>it's only about 21%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since we have some students from here,</v>

698
00:37:29.261 --> 00:37:30.094
<v Speaker 1>universities in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this gender is </v>

699
00:37:32.141 --> 00:37:33.000
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

700
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.933
<v Speaker 1>I would like to comment on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Haig said that religion has </v>

701
00:37:37.751 --> 00:37:42.310
<v Speaker 1>some impact on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think in earlier generation,</v>

702
00:37:42.311 --> 00:37:43.144
<v Speaker 1>the head nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can look at this room is full of </v>

703
00:37:45.641 --> 00:37:48.370
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are gaining power and we are starting</v>

704
00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:52.360
<v Speaker 1>to do science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we still have to take a lot of risks</v>

705
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:55.420
<v Speaker 1>and to do a lot of difficult choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

706
00:37:55.421 --> 00:38:00.421
<v Speaker 1>I had to move from my country because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the maternity's and s and those problems</v>

707
00:38:00.881 --> 00:38:03.160
<v Speaker 1>in my country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still problematic.</v>

708
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.370
<v Speaker 1>That's why I moved to northern country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which country?</v>

709
00:38:06.371 --> 00:38:07.330
<v Speaker 1>You are from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portugal.</v>

710
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

711
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Another person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another science student.</v>

712
00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:13.203
<v Speaker 15>I'm in a social sciences which is full </v>
<v Speaker 15>of women and in the social worker who </v>

713
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:18.324
<v Speaker 15>was this even more women and still in </v>
<v Speaker 15>Sweden we have men that are on the top </v>

714
00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:24.243
<v Speaker 15>of the Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 15>the top positions in both society and </v>

715
00:38:28.451 --> 00:38:31.030
<v Speaker 15>science,</v>
<v Speaker 15>so that must reflect something.</v>

716
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.720
<v Speaker 15>Even when there is basically all the </v>
<v Speaker 15>women in the field,</v>

717
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:38.703
<v Speaker 16>usually what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 16>you have kids as a male and the female </v>

718
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.123
<v Speaker 16>and accepts the pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 16>which usually people are only way maybe </v>

719
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:45.634
<v Speaker 16>for a few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 16>The kids is something you get together </v>

720
00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:50.410
<v Speaker 16>and say if it's a female problem,</v>
<v Speaker 16>you should also be a main problem.</v>

721
00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.650
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

722
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Student?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

723
00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I see somebody there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

724
00:39:00.111 --> 00:39:00.944
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

725
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.093
<v Speaker 17>Phd Student and molecular biology.</v>
<v Speaker 17>There are a lot of women in science now </v>

726
00:39:05.581 --> 00:39:06.414
<v Speaker 17>as someone else's plan it out.</v>
<v Speaker 17>And I don't think that there are less </v>

727
00:39:09.031 --> 00:39:09.864
<v Speaker 17>opportunities for women in science.</v>
<v Speaker 17>I think that if you want to have a </v>

728
00:39:11.941 --> 00:39:13.980
<v Speaker 17>family and a career,</v>
<v Speaker 17>that's your choice.</v>

729
00:39:13.981 --> 00:39:17.540
<v Speaker 17>And I think that there are many examples</v>
<v Speaker 17>of successful women's science.</v>

730
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.050
<v Speaker 17>Science has to,</v>
<v Speaker 17>I've made it happen.</v>

731
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.080
<v Speaker 17>Maybe not sitting at the table today,</v>
<v Speaker 17>but maybe they'll be sat at the table in</v>

732
00:39:22.081 --> 00:39:22.914
<v Speaker 17>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 17>And I,</v>

733
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.350
<v Speaker 17>I think that the future have,</v>
<v Speaker 17>will reflect that.</v>

734
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.030
<v Speaker 17>But I think that the opportunities are </v>
<v Speaker 17>there,</v>

735
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.073
<v Speaker 1>but that's around you shut your not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned about encouraging women to </v>

736
00:39:31.901 --> 00:39:32.734
<v Speaker 1>study science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to ensure that everyone from </v>

737
00:39:34.751 --> 00:39:38.170
<v Speaker 1>all walks of life can have access to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

738
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.033
<v Speaker 5>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm very concerned about public higher </v>

739
00:39:40.451 --> 00:39:41.284
<v Speaker 5>education.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That may not be as much an issue in </v>

740
00:39:43.571 --> 00:39:45.430
<v Speaker 5>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in the United States,</v>

741
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.060
<v Speaker 5>the individual states have decreased </v>
<v Speaker 5>their support,</v>

742
00:39:49.061 --> 00:39:51.130
<v Speaker 5>supportive public,</v>
<v Speaker 5>higher education,</v>

743
00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:52.300
<v Speaker 5>particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

744
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:53.263
<v Speaker 5>there's virtually an inverse </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship between the funding of </v>

745
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:59.950
<v Speaker 5>prisons in the United States and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>funding of public higher education.</v>

746
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:00.963
<v Speaker 5>And I think this has been much to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>detriment of the middle class who </v>

747
00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:06.280
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't necessarily have that in large </v>
<v Speaker 5>numbers,</v>

748
00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 5>have access to the elite institutions </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are represented around this table.</v>

749
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.550
<v Speaker 5>You disappointed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very disappointed.</v>

750
00:40:12.551 --> 00:40:14.890
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I came from a middle class family.</v>

751
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 5>I could work a summer job and pay for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole year,</v>

752
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.233
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>room board books that that is no longer </v>

753
00:40:21.851 --> 00:40:23.170
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

754
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:24.020
<v Speaker 5>I think that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

755
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.350
<v Speaker 5>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has damaged access to,</v>

756
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:27.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the,</v>

757
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.760
<v Speaker 5>the highest reaches of science at least </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the United States.</v>

758
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Anybody else on this issue of access in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK?</v>

759
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Professor next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a similar debate about it.</v>

760
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.290
<v Speaker 3>Similar situation where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

761
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:40.533
<v Speaker 3>I mean my generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of public funding going to </v>

762
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.580
<v Speaker 3>universities and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a generation of,</v>

763
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.043
<v Speaker 3>of academics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just in science but other fields </v>

764
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.100
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

765
00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 3>who came from all kinds of social </v>
<v Speaker 3>backgrounds.</v>

766
00:41:00.671 --> 00:41:04.810
<v Speaker 3>But now it's been made much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult by the present policies,</v>

767
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:05.703
<v Speaker 3>policies of introducing fees and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people from poor backgrounds or simply </v>

768
00:41:11.921 --> 00:41:13.300
<v Speaker 3>deterred from trying.</v>

769
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.583
<v Speaker 1>Are you worried that actually this </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis in funding some countries is </v>

770
00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:19.624
<v Speaker 1>going to jeopardize their future as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being centers of excellence where you </v>

771
00:41:23.471 --> 00:41:24.304
<v Speaker 1>can get the kind of people like q who </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with the discoveries and just </v>

772
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:28.684
<v Speaker 1>think about the fact that as far as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand sociological studies suggest </v>

773
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 1>that social mobility</v>

774
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.480
<v Speaker 6>in the United States is now lower than </v>
<v Speaker 6>Europe and that sort of puts it on.</v>

775
00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:42.360
<v Speaker 6>So we always used to be that social </v>
<v Speaker 6>mobility look at me and man,</v>

776
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.863
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the United States was better than a </v>

777
00:41:45.361 --> 00:41:47.000
<v Speaker 6>New York and now it's the opposite</v>

778
00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.633
<v Speaker 1>center of excellence is going to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to move back to Europe as well as </v>

779
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.280
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I hope that we'll move to Asia.</v>

780
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Asia you're already is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

781
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.350
<v Speaker 14>Moving away from the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 14>not black and white,</v>

782
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.213
<v Speaker 14>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 14>but integrated way where it comes back </v>

783
00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 14>to research support,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it comes down to public education.</v>

784
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:12.490
<v Speaker 14>It comes down to a v a value system of,</v>
<v Speaker 14>of uh,</v>

785
00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.620
<v Speaker 14>immediacy versus a longer term view.</v>
<v Speaker 14>And a and I think it going to,</v>

786
00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.040
<v Speaker 14>well I think in part it's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 14>a lot of it has gone already to Europe.</v>

787
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 14>Europe had a tremendous task of </v>
<v Speaker 14>rebuilding after World War II.</v>

788
00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:28.940
<v Speaker 14>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 14>that's largely done in the sciences,</v>

789
00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:31.880
<v Speaker 14>especially China.</v>
<v Speaker 14>China is it,</v>

790
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:32.743
<v Speaker 14>you know in Asia are very hungry to be </v>
<v Speaker 14>major players but they tend to be still </v>

791
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:41.330
<v Speaker 14>quite short term focus.</v>
<v Speaker 14>The China thinks in five year plans,</v>

792
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.510
<v Speaker 14>it's a 50 year plan.</v>
<v Speaker 14>If it's a plant,</v>

793
00:42:43.511 --> 00:42:45.590
<v Speaker 14>any kind of a plan at all,</v>
<v Speaker 14>it's more like an intent.</v>

794
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.833
<v Speaker 1>And do you think there are certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures that better encourage free </v>

795
00:42:49.211 --> 00:42:50.044
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blue skies thinking that brings </v>

796
00:42:51.371 --> 00:42:52.630
<v Speaker 1>about the great discoveries.</v>

797
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:59.310
<v Speaker 7>I was thinking that the United States </v>
<v Speaker 7>had a more public spirit after World War</v>

798
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.023
<v Speaker 7>II then it does now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Marshall Plan is an example of </v>

799
00:43:03.791 --> 00:43:07.300
<v Speaker 7>something that happened to then that was</v>
<v Speaker 7>an aid program to Europe.</v>

800
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.180
<v Speaker 7>It wouldn't happen now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that the,</v>

801
00:43:10.181 --> 00:43:11.014
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the climbing support for education is </v>

802
00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:13.563
<v Speaker 7>another example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wanted to remind us that we are here </v>

803
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:17.703
<v Speaker 7>at the legacy of Alfred Nobel who had a </v>
<v Speaker 7>tremendous public spirit and that's one </v>

804
00:43:22.061 --> 00:43:26.050
<v Speaker 7>reason why the Nobel prize is a renewed </v>
<v Speaker 7>inspiration.</v>

805
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:27.263
<v Speaker 1>Talking about access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you now have access to the air of the </v>

806
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 1>powerful in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to be using this new found</v>

807
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.733
<v Speaker 1>recognition that you have to put forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case that you'd be making about </v>

808
00:43:42.361 --> 00:43:45.360
<v Speaker 1>greater access or any other issue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come to you,</v>

809
00:43:45.361 --> 00:43:46.110
<v Speaker 1>professor love it</v>

810
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.610
<v Speaker 8>for,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's really important to have an</v>

811
00:43:47.611 --> 00:43:48.444
<v Speaker 8>issue after getting the Nobel prize.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You have to do something with the rest </v>

812
00:43:50.221 --> 00:43:52.740
<v Speaker 8>of your life and besides science with </v>
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>

813
00:43:52.741 --> 00:43:54.960
<v Speaker 8>I'll continue to do.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think an issue for me that is really,</v>

814
00:43:54.961 --> 00:43:59.961
<v Speaker 8>really worrying is that the the youth to</v>
<v Speaker 8>be people who have positions between the</v>

815
00:44:00.481 --> 00:44:04.320
<v Speaker 8>ages of 20 and 40 and that whole </v>
<v Speaker 8>generation is slowly disappearing.</v>

816
00:44:04.321 --> 00:44:07.890
<v Speaker 8>It's becoming very hard to become an </v>
<v Speaker 8>independent scientist.</v>

817
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:12.690
<v Speaker 8>If you're younger than 40 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>30 or 40 years ago,</v>

818
00:44:12.691 --> 00:44:17.640
<v Speaker 8>you could be in your early twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that this is can be explained in</v>

819
00:44:17.641 --> 00:44:18.474
<v Speaker 8>many ways sociologically,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I think that it's as if you have </v>

820
00:44:21.961 --> 00:44:22.794
<v Speaker 8>another one when you're finished </v>
<v Speaker 8>university here instead of getting a </v>

821
00:44:24.781 --> 00:44:27.210
<v Speaker 8>position in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it can take 15 years.</v>

822
00:44:27.211 --> 00:44:28.680
<v Speaker 8>And I think this is a huge waste of </v>
<v Speaker 8>talent</v>

823
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.860
<v Speaker 1>because we see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

824
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:30.853
<v Speaker 1>talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young town bringing up things like </v>

825
00:44:31.831 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

826
00:44:33.691 --> 00:44:36.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to drop out of college even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

827
00:44:36.211 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 1>to have found Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>

828
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

829
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Yahoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a good sign.</v>

830
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:46.690
<v Speaker 2>It's a general society problem and </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic problem that things,</v>

831
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:48.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more seeing the possibility of </v>

832
00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:59.140
<v Speaker 2>funding students to help them to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] in Belgium,</v>

833
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's very difficult otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

834
00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:04.383
<v Speaker 1>Very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody got any idea about how they're </v>

835
00:45:07.061 --> 00:45:07.894
<v Speaker 1>going to be using the new influenced as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Nobel laureate to in some way better </v>

836
00:45:12.491 --> 00:45:13.324
<v Speaker 1>the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only as a scientist but beyond the </v>

837
00:45:14.651 --> 00:45:17.560
<v Speaker 1>realm of science?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Marshall,</v>

838
00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.140
<v Speaker 1>did you have your hand up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will find it out eventually.</v>

839
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Professor Fama and I'm going to continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what I've been doing.</v>

840
00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:27.450
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

841
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:28.383
<v Speaker 1>my simple attitude is everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>creates economic output adds to </v>

842
00:45:33.311 --> 00:45:34.144
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My plumber is perhaps as important as I </v>

843
00:45:36.561 --> 00:45:38.020
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had a good one,</v>

844
00:45:38.021 --> 00:45:38.854
<v Speaker 1>but you may not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one may not be as important as </v>

845
00:45:40.451 --> 00:45:44.410
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody that contributes something</v>

846
00:45:44.411 --> 00:45:48.820
<v Speaker 1>to output makes everybody else bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

847
00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.870
<v Speaker 1>better off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm good at what I do.</v>

848
00:45:50.871 --> 00:45:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Why would I try to do something I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at good at?</v>

849
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.170
<v Speaker 1>I think I can make the world better if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue what I'm doing.</v>

850
00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.633
<v Speaker 1>Eugene Fama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much and didn't </v>

853
00:46:03.371 --> 00:46:04.204
<v Speaker 1>We've heard what this year's Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 1>laureates have to say about the role of </v>

854
00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.160
<v Speaker 1>science and Economics in today's </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

855
00:46:09.161 --> 00:46:12.130
<v Speaker 1>We've also heard from the students here </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Sweden,</v>

856
00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.203
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what they think the road of </v>

857
00:46:14.591 --> 00:46:15.424
<v Speaker 1>science should also be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows there may be a future Nobel </v>

858
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:18.513
<v Speaker 1>Prize winner amongst you all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you to the family and friends of </v>
