00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.583
<v Speaker 1>Hello and welcome to the concert hall in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stockholm where this year's Nobel </v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:05.634
<v Speaker 1>laureates received their awards from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>king of Sweden for their outstanding </v>

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:14.361
<v Speaker 1>contributions to science and economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they join us small and elite group.</v>

4
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>And this is the first time that there'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a pairing together on TV.</v>

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.763
<v Speaker 1>And we've also invited the family and </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends to our audience as well as some </v>

6
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>of the best and brightest students from </v>
<v Speaker 1>across Stockholm.</v>

7
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>And they will be putting their questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and comments to our laureates.</v>

8
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.173
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year we have discoveries in the </v>

9
00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:57.364
<v Speaker 1>development of small machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand times thinner than a strand </v>

10
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Speaker 1>of hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you believe that?</v>

11
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.233
<v Speaker 1>We also delve into strange forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter that could lead to super false </v>

12
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>computing and does it make economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to pay bosses,</v>

13
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>big checks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salaries,</v>

14
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 1>bonuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing while they're amongst</v>

15
00:01:17.741 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>the topics that we'd be discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this year's Nobel laureates,</v>

16
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:21.484
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome to your and renewed </v>

17
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>congratulations to all of you.</v>

18
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

19
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.123
<v Speaker 1>I hope you don't mind starting off by </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that the average age of this </v>

20
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>year's lawyers is 72 you're all 65 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

21
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.453
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trend is to award the Nobel prizes </v>

22
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.133
<v Speaker 1>later in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's a good thing that you </v>

23
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>should wait longer to be recognized for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your work?</v>

24
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask you first,</v>

25
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Oliver Hart because your father died at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of 106 and he published his most</v>

26
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 1>significant scientific paper when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>71.</v>

27
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.280
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

28
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:08.950
<v Speaker 3>I think he was going a little too slowly</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

29
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to answer your question,</v>

30
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:18.451
<v Speaker 3>I think certainly in economics they tend</v>
<v Speaker 3>to want to be sure that the contribution</v>

31
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.193
<v Speaker 3>that I'm recognizing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is one that's going to survive the test </v>

32
00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:26.674
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I can understand that because </v>

33
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:29.440
<v Speaker 3>things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

34
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.440
<v Speaker 3>people get very excited about things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

35
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Speaker 3>so some sort of hot topic and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>turns out,</v>

36
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:36.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

37
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:39.130
<v Speaker 3>10 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem so important.</v>

38
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:39.910
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

39
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 3>they often wait 30 years and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

40
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.653
<v Speaker 3>And that's going to lead to the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>ages you're talking about it which </v>

41
00:02:46.361 --> 00:02:47.320
<v Speaker 3>people win prizes.</v>

42
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could one of the reasons be that there's</v>

43
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 1>so much theory now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>apparently a hundred years ago there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were a thousand physicists and now there</v>

45
00:02:57.011 --> 00:03:00.410
<v Speaker 1>were apparently a million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do the physicists think?</v>

46
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.303
<v Speaker 1>Did you think it takes longer for real </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent to shine through because there's </v>

47
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>just so much information you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilate?</v>

48
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it takes longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just as you say,</v>

49
00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:11.934
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of quantitative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miss so many smart physicists around </v>

50
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:15.994
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you tell which piece of work is </v>

51
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>going to be significant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

52
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for anger as a chemist.</v>

53
00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.530
<v Speaker 1>the prize acknowledges the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of incrementalism,</v>

55
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on the shoulders of giants as </v>

56
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it kind of goes against the,</v>

57
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>in Eureka moment in the bath that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>often associate with science,</v>

58
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>of course we stand on the shoulders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>giants.</v>

59
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.693
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we work with the knowledge that was </v>

60
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.203
<v Speaker 1>experienced and developed before us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are these certain moments </v>

62
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:50.914
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>in in time that my colleagues and myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and others in the field experience where</v>

64
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:55.984
<v Speaker 1>you suddenly realize that you have made </v>
<v Speaker 1>a breakthrough and that opens up a new </v>

65
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:00.784
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might take several years before it's </v>

66
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>recognized that a new field has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened.</v>

67
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>But John Pierre has survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>you're a chemist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could ask you this.</v>

69
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>When we're thinking about drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccines and that kind of thing.</v>

70
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do need fast science.</v>

71
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Do we to fix urgent problems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the Zika virus or,</v>

72
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.523
<v Speaker 1>or whatever because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't hang around for ages waiting </v>

73
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:26.570
<v Speaker 1>for vaccines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

74
00:04:26.571 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

75
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:30.784
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably all of us around this </v>

77
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic scientists,</v>

78
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.920
<v Speaker 1>we are mostly interested in basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and um,</v>

79
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the research we do,</v>

80
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I could lead to new drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new vaccines and all that.</v>

81
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.333
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in our everyday research who are </v>

82
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 1>quite far away from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just see what the students in our</v>

83
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>audience thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Students,</v>

84
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:57.334
<v Speaker 1>just a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few comments from some of you about </v>

85
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 1>sort of life in the fast lane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the slow lane.</v>

86
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:02.554
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world that you inhabit today is </v>

87
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 1>quite different from when these Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 1>laureate started studying.</v>

88
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>instantly knowledge and information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People talk about information overload,</v>

90
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>the distractions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constant digital stimulation.</v>

91
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.103
<v Speaker 1>confusing inflammation with knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who feels that perhaps we should have </v>

93
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>more emphasis on longterm effort and </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>

94
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:26.723
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

95
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.570
<v Speaker 4>I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may be in reason chair technology may</v>

96
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.320
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

97
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 4>affected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

98
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 4>student,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the young,</v>

99
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.340
<v Speaker 4>young generation negatively in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

100
00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:38.040
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they have gotten less patients </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps,</v>

101
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when conducting research.</v>

102
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:41.040
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

103
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.043
<v Speaker 1>see your attention span might not be as </v>
<v Speaker 1>good as it might be because of the </v>

104
00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:46.340
<v Speaker 1>constant bombardment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

105
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

106
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Any more comments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.130
<v Speaker 1>I think when these gentlemen probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>started out,</v>

108
00:05:52.131 --> 00:05:52.964
<v Speaker 1>they had only a couple of journals </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcopy whereas we have basically the </v>

109
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:58.034
<v Speaker 1>entire Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you just have to have a </v>

110
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>better filter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still great,</v>

111
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>great breakthrough with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you mentioned,</v>

112
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>don't come around like every other week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't happen.</v>

113
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I think nowadays year have often the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impression that you have so many options</v>

114
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>and alternatives that might be a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to focus on one specific goal.</v>

115
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 5>I do think that one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>important challenges for the educational</v>

116
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:24.104
<v Speaker 5>system nowadays is to teach students how</v>
<v Speaker 5>to select information that they can </v>

117
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 5>found find on the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in that sense it's very important to</v>

118
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.920
<v Speaker 5>be able to use the media as an </v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunity rather than a threat.</v>

119
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.853
<v Speaker 1>What's the phrase that does seem to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of a kind of generational divide I </v>

120
00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:44.664
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or how people approach their work today </v>

121
00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>and how you ordered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

122
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's as dramatic as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>described because we,</v>

123
00:06:54.451 --> 00:06:55.284
<v Speaker 1>we're not faced with two journals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but benny journals and we were faced </v>

124
00:06:58.081 --> 00:07:02.910
<v Speaker 1>with having to read these journals </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than to access them quickly.</v>

125
00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:03.744
<v Speaker 1>We had to go to library,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was much more time consuming than </v>

126
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:07.884
<v Speaker 1>it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get information much more </v>

127
00:07:09.031 --> 00:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>quickly today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good.</v>

128
00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:11.394
<v Speaker 1>Then you think that you just got his </v>
<v Speaker 1>time going to the library and that kind </v>

129
00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:15.750
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bengt Holmstrom as an economist,</v>

130
00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:16.570
<v Speaker 1>what's your here?</v>

131
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.290
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we think very much about </v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobel prizes when we do our research.</v>

132
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:23.890
<v Speaker 6>So I think the key is who is the nature </v>
<v Speaker 6>of research and how it's evolving.</v>

133
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.480
<v Speaker 6>So it gets to the issue about has it </v>
<v Speaker 6>sped up or something like that.</v>

134
00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.250
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in economics at least,</v>

135
00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:32.080
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>despite all the journals,</v>

136
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.890
<v Speaker 6>it turns out that it's harder and takes </v>
<v Speaker 6>longer to get publications.</v>

137
00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:39.280
<v Speaker 6>But maybe the whole functional </v>
<v Speaker 6>publications has changed.</v>

138
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 6>The Internet started with physicist </v>
<v Speaker 6>circulating their papers at cern.</v>

139
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

140
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.510
<v Speaker 6>now there's a huge overload of papers </v>
<v Speaker 6>coming in there with the branch,</v>

141
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.540
<v Speaker 6>geophysics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

142
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.230
<v Speaker 6>everything is put on the archive for </v>
<v Speaker 6>most immediately.</v>

143
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:57.843
<v Speaker 6>And of course it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it used to be easy to read what was put </v>

144
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:05.310
<v Speaker 6>out every day or every month,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but now there's so much coming in.</v>

145
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get down to this filtering problem.</v>

146
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.360
<v Speaker 6>It facilitates our work,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no doubt.</v>

147
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.333
<v Speaker 6>But I missed something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is to read an article by accident </v>

148
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.040
<v Speaker 6>40 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to his,</v>

149
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and to take a journal,</v>

150
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 6>just walls and all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

151
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:29.780
<v Speaker 6>you find a nice drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

152
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:30.663
<v Speaker 6>you read the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you read it more in detail and this is </v>

153
00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:37.690
<v Speaker 6>totally accidental and it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 6>accident nowadays.</v>

154
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.553
<v Speaker 6>You read what you are prepared to read,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go to a journal on the Internet and </v>

155
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:48.090
<v Speaker 6>just look at what you want to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are no accidents anymore.</v>

156
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Senate serendipity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serendipity and always that.</v>

157
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

158
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.060
<v Speaker 1>some interesting thoughts there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's,</v>

159
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.913
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now take some of our first questions </v>

160
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 1>from the audience and Rebecca Loudin </v>
<v Speaker 1>your question please.</v>

161
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.650
<v Speaker 7>So I remember when I was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 7>choose a degree for university,</v>

162
00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:07.484
<v Speaker 7>that basic signs was not a very popular </v>
<v Speaker 7>field to go into among the students in </v>

163
00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:11.354
<v Speaker 7>my class.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So how do you think we could encourage </v>

164
00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:14.024
<v Speaker 7>more young people to be interested in </v>
<v Speaker 7>and wanting to pursue a career in basic </v>

165
00:09:17.781 --> 00:09:20.510
<v Speaker 7>science and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>put silver,</v>

166
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.533
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>recent studies and surveys to show that </v>

167
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.550
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nowadays,</v>

168
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.320
<v Speaker 7>young scientists are under extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

169
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.223
<v Speaker 7>extremely high pressure to publish,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to secure funding and a tenure track </v>

170
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.993
<v Speaker 7>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And this often leaves serve very little </v>

171
00:09:41.091 --> 00:09:43.160
<v Speaker 7>energy and time to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

172
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.790
<v Speaker 7>to do high quality research and to </v>
<v Speaker 7>pursue interest in ideas.</v>

173
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.560
<v Speaker 7>So what is your perspective on this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you end pen.</v>

174
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:51.700
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

175
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.910
<v Speaker 1>My question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

176
00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:53.744
<v Speaker 1>what is your opinion towards a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>trend of reducing funding for </v>

177
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.630
<v Speaker 1>fundamental fundamental science </v>
<v Speaker 1>research?</v>

178
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take that last question first from</v>

179
00:10:02.511 --> 00:10:03.344
<v Speaker 1>UN pan about the global trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says reduced funding for fundamental </v>

180
00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:12.210
<v Speaker 1>scientific research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Fraser,</v>

181
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see a difference in,</v>

182
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:18.260
<v Speaker 1>in the research were fundamental and </v>
<v Speaker 1>applied scientific research?</v>

183
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.530
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

184
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.363
<v Speaker 8>no I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think there is no difference between </v>

185
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.840
<v Speaker 8>fundamental research and applied </v>
<v Speaker 8>research.</v>

186
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:25.674
<v Speaker 8>I think there's only good research and I</v>
<v Speaker 8>think the two marriage into each other </v>

187
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:29.574
<v Speaker 8>very nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I spent time in industry and did some </v>

188
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 8>very fundamental work when I was with </v>
<v Speaker 8>imperial chemical industries,</v>

189
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 8>corporate laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that is where most of the ideas that</v>

190
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:39.750
<v Speaker 8>led to my,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

191
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 8>discoveries in the early nineties came </v>
<v Speaker 8>from.</v>

192
00:10:42.451 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 8>So,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

193
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 8>I've never seen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

194
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.133
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

195
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.133
<v Speaker 8>the mnr situation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've just seen good research and maybe </v>

196
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:49.500
<v Speaker 8>not so good research.</v>

197
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.063
<v Speaker 1>Judge my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to pick up some of those </v>

198
00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:52.384
<v Speaker 1>points that we heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

199
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people talk a lot about,</v>

200
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pressure to get tenure.</v>

201
00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean that you have to do a lot to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>tenure and that makes people write a lot</v>

202
00:11:03.461 --> 00:11:05.210
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But actually I,</v>

203
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.190
<v Speaker 3>when I look around and see my colleagues</v>
<v Speaker 3>who've got tenure,</v>

204
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:14.050
<v Speaker 3>many of them also seem to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce many papers.</v>

205
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 3>And I think the reason they do it so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't read it,</v>

206
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:18.640
<v Speaker 3>they're not under the prior the garden </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore,</v>

207
00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:21.640
<v Speaker 3>but they still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just to get grants,</v>

208
00:11:21.641 --> 00:11:22.474
<v Speaker 3>it's because I think to some extent they</v>
<v Speaker 3>like to feel busy and they like to be </v>

209
00:11:26.891 --> 00:11:27.724
<v Speaker 3>able to tell people what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And actually it's quite difficult to be </v>

210
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.300
<v Speaker 3>engaged in a longterm project because </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you know,</v>

211
00:11:34.301 --> 00:11:35.350
<v Speaker 3>where you meet someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

212
00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:36.580
<v Speaker 3>what are you up to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

213
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:37.803
<v Speaker 3>not much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

214
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.823
<v Speaker 3>nothing</v>

215
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.120
<v Speaker 1>in places it doesn't set in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they got the 10 year put their feet</v>

216
00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:42.954
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

217
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

218
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

219
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:47.280
<v Speaker 3>the thing is I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that you,</v>

220
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 3>you would hope they would then say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

221
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm now free to do a 10 year project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's</v>

222
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 9>mentally difficult to do that.</v>

223
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 10>I always give my students that want to </v>
<v Speaker 10>go into an academic career,</v>

224
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 10>the following at fry's walk on two feet,</v>
<v Speaker 10>one going align of research,</v>

225
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 10>but at least you get some decent paper </v>
<v Speaker 10>so that you can ride a grant application</v>

226
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:09.874
<v Speaker 10>or people recognize that you do some </v>
<v Speaker 10>decent work and then work also on some </v>

227
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 10>fairly challenging question on where you</v>
<v Speaker 10>might not have a paper in the next three</v>

228
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:19.354
<v Speaker 10>or four or five years,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but where you will make a name in the </v>

229
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 10>world for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Of course that's risky.</v>

230
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 10>The debt will stay said the states maybe</v>
<v Speaker 10>for your next career.</v>

231
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 10>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you cannot deny that there is a pressure</v>

232
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:34.180
<v Speaker 10>to publish some papers because we had </v>
<v Speaker 10>our papers.</v>

233
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:35.014
<v Speaker 10>You might not have the possibility to </v>
<v Speaker 10>get a grant or the next step or 10 year </v>

234
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:39.454
<v Speaker 10>or so,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but you should focus on what are </v>

235
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:45.810
<v Speaker 10>important questions because we forget </v>
<v Speaker 10>that sometimes they're,</v>

236
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 10>the main purpose of science is to ask </v>
<v Speaker 10>the right questions.</v>

237
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 10>So about all this information and </v>
<v Speaker 10>knowledge is,</v>

238
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.613
<v Speaker 10>it's great to know a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but it's better to ask the right </v>

239
00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.194
<v Speaker 10>questions.</v>

240
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.590
<v Speaker 9>Professor Castilla it's one question was</v>
<v Speaker 9>how do we encourage more young people to</v>

241
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:05.460
<v Speaker 9>go into science?</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's,</v>

242
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.603
<v Speaker 9>I think that's a very difficult thing to</v>
<v Speaker 9>do because if you think about it from </v>

243
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:14.200
<v Speaker 9>an,</v>
<v Speaker 9>most people are going to science,</v>

244
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.630
<v Speaker 9>okay they go in very enthusiastic study </v>
<v Speaker 9>harder,</v>

245
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:17.590
<v Speaker 9>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 9>et cetera.</v>

246
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:18.483
<v Speaker 9>But the chances of being very successful</v>
<v Speaker 9>are actually law and so you'll never </v>

247
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:25.834
<v Speaker 9>going to get rich for example of Eh </v>
<v Speaker 9>maybe chemistry medicine and so it's </v>

248
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:30.634
<v Speaker 9>different.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But certainly in physics you'll never </v>

249
00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:32.674
<v Speaker 9>get rich doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So why do you know you've bought your </v>

250
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:38.644
<v Speaker 9>prize now that your well actually </v>
<v Speaker 9>reached the very top and then a little </v>

251
00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:43.751
<v Speaker 9>bit anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

252
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 9>it's wonderful to have this price.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But if you think about is monetary value</v>

253
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.540
<v Speaker 9>is monthly values,</v>
<v Speaker 9>not much.</v>

254
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 9>Not after the tax man as as had this cup</v>
<v Speaker 9>has had is cut.</v>

255
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.820
<v Speaker 9>So the money's not the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's more the satisfaction of doing,</v>

256
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:02.783
<v Speaker 9>of producing something in physics.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But how do you know which piece of </v>

257
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:10.321
<v Speaker 9>information is is significant and which </v>
<v Speaker 9>is not something 99.9%</v>

258
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 9>of the stuff out there is not so </v>
<v Speaker 9>significant.</v>

259
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:18.541
<v Speaker 9>This is noise and the one and the 0.1%</v>
<v Speaker 9>that is significant out there.</v>

260
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.680
<v Speaker 9>You've got to know it significant.</v>
<v Speaker 9>How do you know what significant,</v>

261
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 9>you have to be familiar with the </v>
<v Speaker 9>subject.</v>

262
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:27.520
<v Speaker 9>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>

263
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.230
<v Speaker 9>it's a very difficult problem.</v>

264
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.770
<v Speaker 6>You obviously have identified that north</v>
<v Speaker 6>0.1%.</v>

265
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.233
<v Speaker 6>I think one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>overlooked in this conversation is that </v>

266
00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:39.650
<v Speaker 6>mentoring is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

267
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.420
<v Speaker 6>and when you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

268
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.393
<v Speaker 6>how can we improve the on the system?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think if we maintain a good mentoring </v>

269
00:14:46.671 --> 00:14:47.504
<v Speaker 6>system that is critical and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>think these other things that much it </v>

270
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 6>came through from your comment about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

271
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

272
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 6>giving advice to students.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I have been,</v>

273
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.030
<v Speaker 6>I would say I've been very lucky to have</v>
<v Speaker 6>wonderful mentors,</v>

274
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 6>one of which sits in the audience here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>having good colleagues and so on.</v>

275
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:09.730
<v Speaker 6>And I think looking at it as a monetary </v>
<v Speaker 6>issue or,</v>

276
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.750
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or Korea concern is,</v>

277
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.900
<v Speaker 6>is just far too narrow and is your </v>
<v Speaker 6>mental health.</v>

278
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 6>But Wilson is sitting in the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

279
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.493
<v Speaker 6>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Put your hand up top is not just my </v>

280
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:23.540
<v Speaker 6>mentor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a mentor of many,</v>

281
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 6>many find students and a two Nobel prize</v>
<v Speaker 6>winners.</v>

282
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.450
<v Speaker 6>He looks really young to be a mentor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But anyway,</v>

283
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.610
<v Speaker 6>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our next question please.</v>

284
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.670
<v Speaker 6>From Kerstin</v>

285
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.110
<v Speaker 7>blend,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

286
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.053
<v Speaker 7>recently it seems as though governments </v>
<v Speaker 7>and the general public are rejecting </v>

287
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:44.603
<v Speaker 7>experts and ignoring their advice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where in the past it was held in much </v>

288
00:15:48.331 --> 00:15:49.710
<v Speaker 7>higher esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

289
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.690
<v Speaker 7>what do you think is driving this trend?</v>

290
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.910
<v Speaker 6>Bengt Holmstrom you worried about </v>
<v Speaker 6>experts,</v>

291
00:15:54.911 --> 00:15:55.744
<v Speaker 6>advice being rejected by public opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm worried about the public rejecting </v>

292
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.050
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not just the experts,</v>

293
00:16:05.051 --> 00:16:05.884
<v Speaker 6>but it's what our representatives and </v>
<v Speaker 6>have the ability or should have the </v>

294
00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:11.524
<v Speaker 6>ability to process complex information.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And today's situation seems to be </v>

295
00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:17.704
<v Speaker 6>characterized by people thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can go directly to the source and </v>

296
00:16:22.301 --> 00:16:26.230
<v Speaker 6>not have anybody interpret it and </v>
<v Speaker 6>therefore they are very subject,</v>

297
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.070
<v Speaker 6>very much subject to misunderstanding </v>
<v Speaker 6>what is going on.</v>

298
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.450
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so yes,</v>

299
00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:32.284
<v Speaker 6>I'm very rarely it is though the complex</v>
<v Speaker 6>this use this be understood by the </v>

300
00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:39.910
<v Speaker 6>experts in ordinary people in they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>capable of working it out themselves.</v>

301
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.103
<v Speaker 6>Here's where the lead is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't mean in this context that it </v>

302
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:46.180
<v Speaker 6>needs to be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this is,</v>

303
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.333
<v Speaker 6>this is really part of our democratic </v>
<v Speaker 6>system that there are some people who </v>

304
00:16:51.131 --> 00:16:53.620
<v Speaker 6>know more than the others and not </v>
<v Speaker 6>before,</v>

305
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.380
<v Speaker 6>not necessarily because they're smarter </v>
<v Speaker 6>or anything like that,</v>

306
00:16:56.381 --> 00:16:57.214
<v Speaker 6>but they have just been handed the task </v>
<v Speaker 6>to process the information on a broader </v>

307
00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:04.770
<v Speaker 6>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what seems to be happening now is as</v>

308
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.370
<v Speaker 6>total total almost ejection two four for</v>
<v Speaker 6>this principle.</v>

309
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the,</v>

310
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to call it distrust of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experts,</v>

311
00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 3>but sort of working around them isn't so</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

312
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:17.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

313
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once upon a time,</v>

314
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.113
<v Speaker 3>if there was anything wrong with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to the doctor and you assume that </v>

315
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:24.320
<v Speaker 3>what the doctor was telling you is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

316
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.260
<v Speaker 3>Now you can go on the Internet and find </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

317
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Speaker 3>get a lot of information about what </v>
<v Speaker 3>might be wrong with you.</v>

318
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:31.940
<v Speaker 3>And I think that can be actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>productive.</v>

319
00:17:31.941 --> 00:17:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you can end up knowing more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the doctor about a particular thing</v>

320
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:36.824
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least being able to bring to </v>

321
00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:40.610
<v Speaker 3>their attention something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

322
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.300
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and um,</v>

323
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:45.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

324
00:17:45.311 --> 00:17:48.860
<v Speaker 3>if you go on the web and you look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>things carefully and you might even read</v>

325
00:17:48.861 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 3>some articles so you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exaggerate your competence to understand</v>

326
00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:54.510
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can get a sense of it.</v>

327
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a good thing.</v>

328
00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.003
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and figure if you did that say with </v>

329
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:00.744
<v Speaker 3>global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would undoubtedly end up with the </v>

330
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 3>conclusion that the science says this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really serious problem.</v>

331
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:12.230
<v Speaker 3>What's worrying is when people find </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who says it's not a problem and</v>

332
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:13.980
<v Speaker 3>focuses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

333
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.080
<v Speaker 3>they then focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

334
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:21.000
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole tsunami of information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real point that we are all facing is</v>

335
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:23.250
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quality of information.</v>

336
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.113
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are we going to educate our young </v>

337
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:30.720
<v Speaker 3>people to distinguish what is right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are we to eh,</v>

338
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.040
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eh,</v>

339
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.113
<v Speaker 3>making information available to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>general public and probably be a </v>

340
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:36.834
<v Speaker 3>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to do a much better job to </v>

341
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:41.610
<v Speaker 3>distinguish facts from fiction and </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions.</v>

342
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Speaker 3>You cannot develop a smartphone based on</v>
<v Speaker 3>an opinion.</v>

343
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It's the phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean specifically on this,</v>

344
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.380
<v Speaker 1>the brexit vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

345
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.273
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experts and politicians seeing their </v>

346
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:58.670
<v Speaker 1>advice rejected that that caused you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great deal of angst.</v>

347
00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.833
<v Speaker 1>Y</v>

348
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.300
<v Speaker 8>it did.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If we were going to enter an era of hard</v>

349
00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:04.134
<v Speaker 8>brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then this is almost like a chemical </v>

350
00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:10.751
<v Speaker 8>reaction that is close to irreversible.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that saddens me.</v>

351
00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.040
<v Speaker 8>I was at the forefront,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I feel when I was in the UK,</v>

352
00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:15.874
<v Speaker 8>in Sheffield and latterly in Birmingham,</v>
<v Speaker 8>bringing in students from all over </v>

353
00:19:19.581 --> 00:19:23.270
<v Speaker 8>Europe and then all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When I left to go to United States,</v>

354
00:19:23.271 --> 00:19:28.271
<v Speaker 8>we were something and the excess of 15 </v>
<v Speaker 8>different nationalities in a group of 30</v>

355
00:19:29.151 --> 00:19:30.950
<v Speaker 8>to 40 people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This was sheer magic.</v>

356
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.420
<v Speaker 8>The switched on the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

357
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.740
<v Speaker 8>students,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

358
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.250
<v Speaker 8>from the British isles in a remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 8>way as well as,</v>

359
00:19:37.251 --> 00:19:38.440
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

360
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.320
<v Speaker 8>really raise the standard of our </v>
<v Speaker 8>research.</v>

361
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.720
<v Speaker 8>And so I'm saddened by the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

362
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.220
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

363
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.460
<v Speaker 8>people working,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

364
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.333
<v Speaker 8>in chemistry at the highest level in the</v>
<v Speaker 8>UK could be faced in the near time by </v>

365
00:19:53.451 --> 00:19:54.284
<v Speaker 8>having to go down to pooling on a </v>
<v Speaker 8>population of 65 million instead of 500 </v>

366
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.650
<v Speaker 8>million.</v>

367
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Can I send you that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We happy with what you heard?</v>

368
00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the answer to your own question?</v>

369
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

370
00:20:07.641 --> 00:20:08.474
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for me during my phd has been </v>

371
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 1>invaluable in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

372
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.670
<v Speaker 1>allowing me to consider how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific process happens,</v>

373
00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:20.270
<v Speaker 1>how to approach something as a skeptic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to look at the evidence.</v>

374
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:21.104
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's something that's </v>

375
00:20:21.771 --> 00:20:25.880
<v Speaker 1>missing perhaps in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the general public's mindset.</v>

376
00:20:25.881 --> 00:20:26.714
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

377
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.590
<v Speaker 1>tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

378
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.620
<v Speaker 1>take what the media gives them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingest that rather than perhaps being as</v>

379
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.160
<v Speaker 1>critical as it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

380
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

381
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:40.180
<v Speaker 1>so we'll go to your specific fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

382
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.153
<v Speaker 1>and now gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for which he won the prize and let us </v>

383
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.330
<v Speaker 1>start with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In economics.</v>

384
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Professor Horton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor homes strong,</v>

385
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 1>the Nobel Committee said you won the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prize for your separate work on contract</v>

386
00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:53.704
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The judges said your work late an </v>

387
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:56.074
<v Speaker 1>intellectual foundation for policies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas such as where the workers should </v>

388
00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:00.094
<v Speaker 1>receive a bonus incentive or ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>salary where the essential public </v>

389
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 1>services should be privatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said there was,</v>

390
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.690
<v Speaker 1>these were matters valuable to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of real life contracts and</v>

391
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:12.100
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

392
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:12.953
<v Speaker 1>Oliver Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see parallels between your work on </v>

393
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.493
<v Speaker 1>incomplete contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I could turn bad contracts and why </v>

394
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:22.114
<v Speaker 1>people in the UK voted brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does your work on contract theory </v>

395
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.720
<v Speaker 1>explain the Brexit vote?</v>

396
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say it's explains it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

397
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.090
<v Speaker 3>there are parallels because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

398
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:35.303
<v Speaker 3>in my work I've looked at contracts </v>
<v Speaker 3>between two commercial parties and I've </v>

399
00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:44.670
<v Speaker 3>argued that in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in situations where it's hard to write a</v>

400
00:21:44.671 --> 00:21:46.280
<v Speaker 3>good contract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

401
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:51.360
<v Speaker 3>what becomes very important is who gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>to decide on the things missing from the</v>

402
00:21:51.361 --> 00:21:53.940
<v Speaker 3>contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I call that residual control rights.</v>

403
00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.240
<v Speaker 3>And that sometimes goes together with </v>
<v Speaker 3>ownership of assets.</v>

404
00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.340
<v Speaker 3>Now in the political context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>

405
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.980
<v Speaker 3>if we take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think of the European Union,</v>

406
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.400
<v Speaker 3>the arrangement that the co all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries have in the European Union,</v>

407
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.110
<v Speaker 3>it's like a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

408
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.183
<v Speaker 3>and you could have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could imagine in a sort of ideal </v>

409
00:22:11.881 --> 00:22:13.350
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

410
00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:14.483
<v Speaker 3>that everything would be written down in</v>
<v Speaker 3>advance and then the whole European </v>

411
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Union would just have been about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiation of that initial contract.</v>

412
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course that's not,</v>

413
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.263
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead you set up these decision </v>

414
00:22:26.551 --> 00:22:31.551
<v Speaker 3>making bodies and I think that what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>British voters fault was,</v>

415
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.980
<v Speaker 3>they'd allocated a lot of that power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that residual or authority to the center</v>

416
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:45.000
<v Speaker 3>Brussels as call it a way from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual countries.</v>

417
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.600
<v Speaker 3>And I think people pass felt they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>done too much of that.</v>

418
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.810
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am was in favor of remain.</v>

419
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.520
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't thought it,</v>

420
00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:54.354
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

421
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Year brexit where you all opposed to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>including the two Europeans,</v>

422
00:22:58.591 --> 00:23:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Dutch and French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all opposed to brexit.</v>

423
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

424
00:23:03.691 --> 00:23:08.691
<v Speaker 1>All are Nobel laureates at the table for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few British to European say you're all</v>

425
00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:10.260
<v Speaker 1>opposed to brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

426
00:23:10.261 --> 00:23:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Banks home throw your research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at whether contract incentives,</v>

427
00:23:14.701 --> 00:23:19.701
<v Speaker 1>how contract incentives affect corporate</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and you know,</v>

428
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:20.933
<v Speaker 1>whether performance related pay works </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the difficulties in assessing say a </v>

429
00:23:25.831 --> 00:23:26.664
<v Speaker 1>teacher's performance as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as easy to is to measure as a </v>

430
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:31.583
<v Speaker 1>factory worker and how many goods or </v>
<v Speaker 1>handbags or whatever they may have </v>

431
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.460
<v Speaker 1>manufactured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of the workplace,</v>

432
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.240
<v Speaker 1>what does your research into contract </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory tell us?</v>

433
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I think the big insight in some in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>view is</v>

434
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.060
<v Speaker 6>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were very focused initially on,</v>

435
00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:49.894
<v Speaker 6>on thinking I incentives need to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>provided by financial instruments of </v>

436
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:58.571
<v Speaker 6>some kind of others or contract.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we have come to understand how big a</v>

437
00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:02.810
<v Speaker 6>part of incentives is actually something</v>
<v Speaker 6>entirely different than what most people</v>

438
00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 6>think as incentives like bonuses or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

439
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:06.730
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

440
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.670
<v Speaker 1>constantly throwing money at people </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't necessarily</v>

441
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.220
<v Speaker 6>just a matter of money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But yes,</v>

442
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.590
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the sort of stereotype view is,</v>

443
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.340
<v Speaker 6>is throwing money at people or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's an incentive problem,</v>

444
00:24:18.341 --> 00:24:23.020
<v Speaker 6>let's incentivize them be some money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Actually that is most definitely not the</v>

445
00:24:23.021 --> 00:24:26.230
<v Speaker 6>main,</v>
<v Speaker 6>main approach the world takes.</v>

446
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.153
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when we have all these debates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the UK about executive </v>

447
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:32.144
<v Speaker 1>pay and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>executives getting big bonuses and </v>

448
00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:38.480
<v Speaker 1>salaries because share prices have gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in their company or whatever.</v>

449
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:39.703
<v Speaker 1>What's your answer to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it not make economic sense to pay </v>

450
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:45.080
<v Speaker 1>these big checks?</v>

451
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:46.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

452
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.670
<v Speaker 6>It's not so much how big they are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

453
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:49.853
<v Speaker 6>I mean size matters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what worries me much more is how </v>

454
00:24:53.011 --> 00:24:53.844
<v Speaker 6>they get structured and especially what </v>
<v Speaker 6>these candles and other things have </v>

455
00:24:57.901 --> 00:25:02.100
<v Speaker 6>caught have led to in terms of how they </v>
<v Speaker 6>are designed.</v>

456
00:25:02.101 --> 00:25:02.934
<v Speaker 6>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we have gone from some arrows </v>

457
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.290
<v Speaker 6>that could have been correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a 20 years ago or so,</v>

458
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.503
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the designs into much worse designs </v>

459
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:15.803
<v Speaker 6>because of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the public being upset and the </v>

460
00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:20.940
<v Speaker 6>regulators being upset and they are </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to really solve the problem.</v>

461
00:25:20.941 --> 00:25:24.690
<v Speaker 6>We'll levels and not thinking so much </v>
<v Speaker 6>about the incentives.</v>

462
00:25:24.691 --> 00:25:25.524
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

463
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 6>I think we are gone from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from maybe a somewhat flawed system to a</v>

464
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.070
<v Speaker 6>much better system.</v>

465
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Also moving to another area of research </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are watered your price for with</v>

466
00:25:36.331 --> 00:25:39.750
<v Speaker 1>this question of whether for public </v>
<v Speaker 1>providers of services,</v>

467
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.180
<v Speaker 1>whether they could be privatized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

468
00:25:42.181 --> 00:25:45.690
<v Speaker 1>the Obama Administration to the prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>service which was privatized,</v>

469
00:25:45.691 --> 00:25:50.580
<v Speaker 1>should no longer be provided by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>private companies.</v>

470
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It was to see a live debate in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

471
00:25:52.861 --> 00:25:53.694
<v Speaker 1>about whether education should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly provided or provided by the </v>

472
00:25:57.121 --> 00:25:59.250
<v Speaker 1>private sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Professor Hart,</v>

473
00:25:59.251 --> 00:25:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

474
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.950
<v Speaker 1>what does economics tell us?</v>

475
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it can be helpful.</v>

476
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a paper with causes about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue and I think,</v>

477
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we say in the paper is,</v>

478
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:14.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

479
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 3>one extreme would you privatized nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons?</v>

480
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 3>We thought no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean put them in private hands.</v>

481
00:26:22.521 --> 00:26:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Didn't seem like I have a contract with </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who holds the nuclear weapons.</v>

482
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Probably not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

483
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.840
<v Speaker 3>would you prioritize the State </v>
<v Speaker 3>Department?</v>

484
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Would you have a contract with a private</v>
<v Speaker 3>company to run foreign policy?</v>

485
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno whether Donald Trump is thinking</v>

486
00:26:40.491 --> 00:26:42.140
<v Speaker 3>along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think,</v>

487
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that would be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

488
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:45.973
<v Speaker 3>he has appointed a businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so maybe he's moving in that </v>

489
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:50.130
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

490
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.050
<v Speaker 3>at the other extreme garbage collection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rubbish collection,</v>

491
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.220
<v Speaker 3>quite comfortable with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends how good a contract you can,</v>

492
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

493
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:01.403
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of things can go wrong and </v>

494
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:06.150
<v Speaker 3>therefore who should have the residual </v>
<v Speaker 3>control rights.</v>

495
00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.003
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's how to think about these </v>

496
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:08.941
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

497
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:09.774
<v Speaker 3>Schools or somewhere in between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in between when you have competition </v>

498
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.050
<v Speaker 3>that strengthens the case for </v>
<v Speaker 3>privatization.</v>

499
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.210
<v Speaker 3>So in the case of schools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

500
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a school does badly is shading on </v>

501
00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:25.200
<v Speaker 3>quality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people will eventually find out,</v>

502
00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:26.760
<v Speaker 3>it may take a bit of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

503
00:27:26.761 --> 00:27:28.920
<v Speaker 3>and they'll send their kids to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different school.</v>

504
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.143
<v Speaker 3>In the case of prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we probably don't think it would be a </v>

505
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:35.130
<v Speaker 3>great idea for the prisoners to be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to shop around.</v>

506
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.540
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

507
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:38.490
<v Speaker 3>their competition isn't going to work as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

508
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.580
<v Speaker 3>And that strengthens the case from </v>
<v Speaker 3>public provision.</v>

509
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

510
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.870
<v Speaker 1>and I just turn to a chemistry and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry,</v>

511
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laurie,</v>

512
00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.273
<v Speaker 1>it's the three of you were jointly </v>
<v Speaker 1>awarded the prize for fundamental </v>

513
00:27:51.111 --> 00:27:52.770
<v Speaker 1>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Nobel Committee said,</v>

514
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:56.510
<v Speaker 1>do you have mastered motion control at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the molecular scale,</v>

515
00:27:56.511 --> 00:27:57.344
<v Speaker 1>the design and synthesis of machines a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand times thinner than a strand of </v>

516
00:28:01.671 --> 00:28:06.671
<v Speaker 1>hair so small that tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them could actually fit on a pinhead.</v>

517
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.730
<v Speaker 1>So we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

518
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.150
<v Speaker 1>some questions I think from the students</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

519
00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:14.930
<v Speaker 1>If I could have the first one all off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yonson your question.</v>

520
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

521
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.243
<v Speaker 10>So what are the fundamental limits to </v>
<v Speaker 10>how small you could make these </v>

522
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.850
<v Speaker 10>artificial molecular machines?</v>

523
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.153
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

524
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.720
<v Speaker 1>If we could take the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilda Bucklin ah,</v>

525
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.070
<v Speaker 1>so I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

526
00:28:32.071 --> 00:28:35.160
<v Speaker 1>in 20 years time or do you think you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the biggest use?</v>

527
00:28:35.161 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Speaker 1>So molecular robots a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

528
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:42.050
<v Speaker 1>be in medicine or molecular electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you ben for anger.</v>

529
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.903
<v Speaker 1>Let me take the first one with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the fundamental limits to how </v>

530
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 1>small you can make an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular machine?</v>

531
00:28:48.121 --> 00:28:48.954
<v Speaker 1>Cause in 1999 you led the first research</v>
<v Speaker 1>to produce a molecular motor that </v>

532
00:28:53.491 --> 00:28:54.324
<v Speaker 1>continually spins in the same direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in 2011 year old group built a </v>

533
00:28:58.021 --> 00:29:01.020
<v Speaker 1>four wheel drive for Nano car.</v>

534
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.203
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's very difficult to say what the </v>

535
00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:07.440
<v Speaker 10>limits were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but we work with molecules and typically</v>

536
00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:10.500
<v Speaker 10>our molecular motor is half a nanometer </v>
<v Speaker 10>also.</v>

537
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:13.830
<v Speaker 10>So and one nanometers,</v>
<v Speaker 10>1000000000th of a meter,</v>

538
00:29:13.831 --> 00:29:14.664
<v Speaker 10>as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So the limits will be probably a dead </v>

539
00:29:16.951 --> 00:29:17.784
<v Speaker 10>size,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but you have to realize if you want to </v>

540
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:19.554
<v Speaker 10>build machines,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it's only the moving part is only part </v>

541
00:29:21.901 --> 00:29:24.000
<v Speaker 10>of the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So you have to integrate it.</v>

542
00:29:24.001 --> 00:29:24.834
<v Speaker 10>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you have to put it on the servers or </v>

543
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:27.720
<v Speaker 10>integrate in a device,</v>
<v Speaker 10>et cetera.</v>

544
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.153
<v Speaker 10>So that is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that all depends on the type of </v>

545
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:34.890
<v Speaker 10>molecules you are designing for a </v>
<v Speaker 10>specific purpose.</v>

546
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 10>If you look in your eye,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which has a beautiful switch,</v>

547
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 10>it is the tiny molecule in the NDI is </v>
<v Speaker 10>probably one and we do,</v>

548
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:44.974
<v Speaker 10>but it's part of a big protein complex </v>
<v Speaker 10>that makes it possible that the signal </v>

549
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.880
<v Speaker 10>of the light that comes to your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 10>triggers this.</v>

550
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:52.803
<v Speaker 10>In your eye and then changes and there's</v>
<v Speaker 10>a cascade of process that make it </v>

551
00:29:56.741 --> 00:29:58.690
<v Speaker 10>possible that you get the signal in your</v>
<v Speaker 10>brain.</v>

552
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.060
<v Speaker 10>The fact that I can see you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>when you can see me,</v>

553
00:30:01.061 --> 00:30:03.970
<v Speaker 10>the fact that all cells can define that </v>
<v Speaker 10>became move on muscles.</v>

554
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.930
<v Speaker 10>These are machines of a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>of a couple of nanometers at most.</v>

555
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.713
<v Speaker 1>Sean via survives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean you managed to meet one </v>

556
00:30:11.781 --> 00:30:13.250
<v Speaker 1>molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piro at,</v>

557
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.180
<v Speaker 1>around the other in a controlled manner </v>
<v Speaker 1>when energy was applied.</v>

558
00:30:17.181 --> 00:30:18.014
<v Speaker 1>So our question about where do you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest use of molecular robots in </v>

559
00:30:22.101 --> 00:30:22.934
<v Speaker 1>medicine or molecular electronics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question was what's your answer to </v>

560
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:29.840
<v Speaker 1>make it clear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no answer.</v>

561
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have comments.</v>

562
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.410
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

563
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.160
<v Speaker 11>before our contributions,</v>
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

564
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:43.250
<v Speaker 11>it was considered as extremely difficult</v>
<v Speaker 11>to set molecular systems in motion.</v>

565
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.353
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we knew everybody knew that there were </v>

566
00:30:47.221 --> 00:30:51.840
<v Speaker 11>plenty of such motors and machines in </v>
<v Speaker 11>the biological world,</v>

567
00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.800
<v Speaker 11>but using artificial systems,</v>
<v Speaker 11>molecules,</v>

568
00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:01.100
<v Speaker 11>which had been made in a laboratory that</v>
<v Speaker 11>was considered almost impossible.</v>

569
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.290
<v Speaker 11>And I think that was a big step in a way</v>
<v Speaker 11>that,</v>

570
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.170
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>the three of us and our coworkers,</v>

571
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.870
<v Speaker 1>just the question or I assume is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

572
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.570
<v Speaker 1>is thinking won't hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

573
00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.180
<v Speaker 1>But when she asked about medicine is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

574
00:31:14.181 --> 00:31:15.014
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think about the walking microscopic </v>

575
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.790
<v Speaker 1>robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could for instance,</v>

576
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:24.290
<v Speaker 1>slip inside the human body and deliver </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs in a targeted manner.</v>

577
00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps perhaps it's a phrase it,</v>

578
00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:32.474
<v Speaker 1>so the question we had about any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you foresee any negative social or </v>

579
00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.673
<v Speaker 1>environmental challenges with the misuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this technology that we should be </v>

580
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:41.171
<v Speaker 1>aware of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An,</v>

581
00:31:41.171 --> 00:31:42.004
<v Speaker 1>I should say that you made a key advance</v>
<v Speaker 1>by threading and molecular ring onto a </v>

582
00:31:45.681 --> 00:31:48.740
<v Speaker 1>rod like structure that acted as a dumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>bell.</v>

583
00:31:48.741 --> 00:31:52.550
<v Speaker 1>The kind of thing we use in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you added the two together,</v>

584
00:31:52.551 --> 00:31:53.384
<v Speaker 1>the ring jumped forwards and backwards </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tiny shuttle and later you've </v>

585
00:31:56.031 --> 00:31:59.660
<v Speaker 1>built numerous molecular machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm including a pump.</v>

586
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.330
<v Speaker 1>So that was your particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution.</v>

587
00:32:02.331 --> 00:32:06.080
<v Speaker 1>But what's your answer to the question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if I could tell you the latter part</v>

588
00:32:06.081 --> 00:32:06.914
<v Speaker 1>first and just make a comment about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement to ban for ringer has promoted </v>

589
00:32:12.921 --> 00:32:15.510
<v Speaker 1>the movement in a circular sensor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rotary [inaudible].</v>

590
00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:19.230
<v Speaker 1>So I think John Pierre and I with our </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

591
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.153
<v Speaker 1>taxing based systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a molecular shotwell based systems have </v>

592
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:29.350
<v Speaker 1>done the fundamental preliminary work to</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve movement in a linear direction.</v>

593
00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 1>But it's not just sufficient to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movement in a willy nilly takeaway.</v>

594
00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.150
<v Speaker 1>We have got to be able to direct that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

595
00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>The first step after you have</v>

596
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.790
<v Speaker 8>the Willy Nilly type of movement is to </v>
<v Speaker 8>go to a switch.</v>

597
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:49.030
<v Speaker 8>There's still a lot to be done in terms </v>
<v Speaker 8>of going from switches to machines,</v>

598
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.263
<v Speaker 8>machines have to do work and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this has been a progressive situation </v>

599
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:55.334
<v Speaker 8>from finding how to bring a bank this </v>
<v Speaker 8>motion in either a rotary or a linear </v>

600
00:33:00.171 --> 00:33:03.020
<v Speaker 8>rate direction to a switch to a machine.</v>

601
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Would you like to see opportunities in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

602
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.180
<v Speaker 1>either discoveries you've me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you like to see them develop,</v>

603
00:33:10.181 --> 00:33:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean Bedford and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see great opportunities</v>

604
00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.773
<v Speaker 10>since I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I definitely say great opposition is my </v>

605
00:33:15.421 --> 00:33:18.330
<v Speaker 10>colleagues already said it is very,</v>
<v Speaker 10>very early days.</v>

606
00:33:18.331 --> 00:33:19.164
<v Speaker 10>So this is fundamental research.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The breakthrough that you can induce </v>

607
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:23.663
<v Speaker 10>motion responsive functions in materials</v>
<v Speaker 10>opens up an entirely new field of </v>

608
00:33:28.891 --> 00:33:32.580
<v Speaker 10>material science and machines.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Ultimately maybe science fiction at this</v>

609
00:33:32.581 --> 00:33:34.230
<v Speaker 10>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but in 30,</v>

610
00:33:34.231 --> 00:33:35.790
<v Speaker 10>40,</v>
<v Speaker 10>50 years from now,</v>

611
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.250
<v Speaker 10>I see many opportunities during my whole</v>
<v Speaker 10>career.</v>

612
00:33:38.251 --> 00:33:42.330
<v Speaker 10>I work together with industry also on </v>
<v Speaker 10>potential applications.</v>

613
00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:43.580
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and,</v>

614
00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.110
<v Speaker 10>and so we have close contact then and </v>
<v Speaker 10>when we,</v>

615
00:33:46.111 --> 00:33:48.390
<v Speaker 10>and this counts for,</v>
<v Speaker 10>for the whole community,</v>

616
00:33:48.391 --> 00:33:51.420
<v Speaker 10>I think if we see opportunities for </v>
<v Speaker 10>cooperation,</v>

617
00:33:51.421 --> 00:33:55.560
<v Speaker 10>we will work together with industries.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But you have to realize to bring it to a</v>

618
00:33:55.561 --> 00:33:56.394
<v Speaker 10>product in the market.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My take along development or the </v>

619
00:33:58.601 --> 00:33:59.434
<v Speaker 10>directory,</v>
<v Speaker 10>develop a new medicine at this moment </v>

620
00:34:01.111 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 10>takes more than 12 years and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

621
00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:03.923
<v Speaker 10>lots of money.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So this is typically the timeframe we </v>

622
00:34:06.211 --> 00:34:07.044
<v Speaker 10>are working in.</v>

623
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:12.000
<v Speaker 8>It turns out in my laboratory in recent </v>
<v Speaker 8>times by working in this area,</v>

624
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:16.800
<v Speaker 8>we have serendipitously gone off in two </v>
<v Speaker 8>completely different directions.</v>

625
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.880
<v Speaker 8>One is to create very highly porous </v>
<v Speaker 8>materials that,</v>

626
00:34:20.881 --> 00:34:21.714
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as the basis for one startup company </v>

627
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.240
<v Speaker 8>starting about 15 months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that is looking at,</v>

628
00:34:27.241 --> 00:34:28.170
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>use of,</v>

629
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:31.530
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>these polars materials in home care,</v>

630
00:34:31.531 --> 00:34:33.600
<v Speaker 8>in personal care,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in food,</v>

631
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.130
<v Speaker 8>and ultimately in pharmaceuticals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And the other one is quite serendipitous</v>

632
00:34:38.131 --> 00:34:40.590
<v Speaker 8>discovery that I would never have even </v>
<v Speaker 8>predicted.</v>

633
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.753
<v Speaker 8>And that is that we are looking at a new</v>
<v Speaker 8>ways of isolating gold that get us away </v>

634
00:34:46.831 --> 00:34:51.831
<v Speaker 8>from the use of cyanide,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is 83% of the world's isolation.</v>

635
00:34:52.231 --> 00:34:56.700
<v Speaker 8>And the other 17% is mercury,</v>
<v Speaker 8>two very nasty chemicals.</v>

636
00:34:56.701 --> 00:34:57.534
<v Speaker 8>And all of this has come out to </v>
<v Speaker 8>fundamental research and most of these </v>

637
00:35:01.021 --> 00:35:05.160
<v Speaker 8>are seven deputies discoveries going on </v>
<v Speaker 8>while we're making molecular machines.</v>

638
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

639
00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:08.530
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chemists,</v>

640
00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Laurie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So turning to the laureates in physics,</v>

641
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan Hall Day,</v>

642
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:14.444
<v Speaker 1>Michael Costa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Litz and also David soulless or all of </v>

643
00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:19.330
<v Speaker 1>your British born and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David solders.</v>

644
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Professor Thalamus is not with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our congratulations go to him.</v>

645
00:35:23.441 --> 00:35:24.274
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were jointly awarded the prize for </v>

646
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:28.930
<v Speaker 1>discoveries for your pioneering work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange forms of matter.</v>

647
00:35:28.931 --> 00:35:30.640
<v Speaker 1>The Nobel Committee said your </v>
<v Speaker 1>discoveries,</v>

648
00:35:30.641 --> 00:35:34.390
<v Speaker 1>it opened the door on an unknown world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Mike hostile,</v>

649
00:35:34.391 --> 00:35:35.224
<v Speaker 1>it's along with David Thallus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You focused on that arise in flat forms </v>

650
00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:40.254
<v Speaker 1>of matter on surfaces inside extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>thin layers that can be considered two </v>

651
00:35:45.451 --> 00:35:48.500
<v Speaker 1>dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike the three dimensions that are,</v>

652
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we describe reality around us with and </v>

653
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:57.110
<v Speaker 1>the work involves a field of maths known</v>
<v Speaker 1>as topology topology basically I suppose</v>

654
00:35:58.451 --> 00:36:01.200
<v Speaker 1>analyzes the sheep of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

655
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.310
<v Speaker 1>tells us that a doe not in a wedding </v>
<v Speaker 1>ring topologically are the same thing.</v>

656
00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.970
<v Speaker 1>And do you Duncan of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danes studied one dimensional matters.</v>

657
00:36:09.971 --> 00:36:10.804
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind of preface to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question that we have from our physics </v>

658
00:36:15.371 --> 00:36:18.200
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A flora couldn't stop.</v>

659
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:20.503
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

660
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:21.643
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think there will be any </v>

661
00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:26.240
<v Speaker 1>technological advancements such as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

662
00:36:26.241 --> 00:36:27.074
<v Speaker 1>quantum computers coming from the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>insights in quantum mechanics separate </v>

663
00:36:30.081 --> 00:36:31.130
<v Speaker 1>provided by Ortiz?</v>

664
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.150
<v Speaker 12>Most probably,</v>
<v Speaker 12>yes.</v>

665
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:36.100
<v Speaker 12>I mean to what we really discovered was,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

666
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.333
<v Speaker 12>the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there were more interesting materials </v>

667
00:36:39.691 --> 00:36:41.840
<v Speaker 12>than we expected.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And um,</v>

668
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.043
<v Speaker 12>condensed matter physics is a fancy name</v>
<v Speaker 12>for understanding the properties of </v>

669
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:51.390
<v Speaker 12>materials and what this work is a really</v>
<v Speaker 12>led to,</v>

670
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.370
<v Speaker 12>it started off with one dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 12>things,</v>

671
00:36:53.371 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 12>but it's not just one dimensional or two</v>
<v Speaker 12>dimensional.</v>

672
00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:57.203
<v Speaker 12>There are a class of materials which we </v>
<v Speaker 12>didn't realize existed before that have </v>

673
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.750
<v Speaker 12>a very interesting properties,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

674
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:06.613
<v Speaker 12>in the quantum mechanical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And the quantum mechanics is a </v>

675
00:37:09.101 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 12>fundamental way to understand all </v>
<v Speaker 12>materials.</v>

676
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:13.463
<v Speaker 12>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the topology is a side issue in a sense </v>

677
00:37:16.531 --> 00:37:19.950
<v Speaker 12>that we discovered the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>some very beautiful,</v>

678
00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:20.784
<v Speaker 12>unexpected properties of quantum </v>
<v Speaker 12>mechanics and the mathematical tools of </v>

679
00:37:24.241 --> 00:37:25.930
<v Speaker 12>Topology,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

680
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.933
<v Speaker 12>turned out to be very useful for </v>
<v Speaker 12>analyzing the specific differences </v>

681
00:37:29.761 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 12>between these unexpected forms of matter</v>
<v Speaker 12>and conventional matter.</v>

682
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:35.843
<v Speaker 12>So this whole analog about Brett's </v>
<v Speaker 12>pretzels and bagels is just that the </v>

683
00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:40.704
<v Speaker 12>Bagel has a hole in it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's different from a football which </v>

684
00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:44.124
<v Speaker 12>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and this a new form of new kinds of </v>

685
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.660
<v Speaker 12>condensed matter.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>

686
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.680
<v Speaker 12>also different from the familiar types </v>
<v Speaker 12>as the Bagel is for the football.</v>

687
00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:55.914
<v Speaker 12>The,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the property of having the whole in the </v>

688
00:37:57.631 --> 00:38:00.000
<v Speaker 12>Bagel makes it slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You can,</v>

689
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.220
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>pick up the Beagle and it can get,</v>

690
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.203
<v Speaker 12>you can look through it,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you can poke your finger through it or </v>

691
00:38:04.621 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 12>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But it's just different.</v>

692
00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.300
<v Speaker 12>It's not good for playing football with,</v>
<v Speaker 12>no,</v>

693
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:11.400
<v Speaker 12>it's not good for playing football,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but it will change the game as I said.</v>

694
00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:12.423
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So professor Costa lists and we have </v>

695
00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:14.643
<v Speaker 1>heard that your work could result in </v>
<v Speaker 1>improved materials for electronics and </v>

696
00:38:19.691 --> 00:38:22.210
<v Speaker 1>that could lead to super fast computers.</v>

697
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.160
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So this is,</v>

698
00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:28.790
<v Speaker 12>it doesn't like the question.</v>
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>

699
00:38:28.791 --> 00:38:29.520
<v Speaker 12>no,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's not.</v>

700
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.271
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like it,</v>

701
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:34.500
<v Speaker 12>I just fumbling for an answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 12>because let me,</v>

702
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.310
<v Speaker 12>let me stress that when we,</v>
<v Speaker 12>when</v>

703
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.610
<v Speaker 9>we started this work,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it was,</v>

704
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.640
<v Speaker 9>we had no thoughts about applications or</v>
<v Speaker 9>anything like that.</v>

705
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.270
<v Speaker 9>It was nothing more than an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 9>theoretical problem.</v>

706
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:47.771
<v Speaker 9>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

707
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 9>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there was a theoretical question that we</v>

708
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:54.961
<v Speaker 9>wanted to try to answer and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 9>started it all.</v>

709
00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 9>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Could it,</v>

710
00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.280
<v Speaker 9>I mean in theory we can see all the </v>
<v Speaker 9>difficulties as well as some of the,</v>

711
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:06.423
<v Speaker 9>the possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the question was asking about the </v>

712
00:39:08.411 --> 00:39:10.580
<v Speaker 9>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Duncan,</v>

713
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 9>I can see many of the difficulties we </v>
<v Speaker 9>unanswered difficulties,</v>

714
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:15.603
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>So we simply don't know the answer to </v>

715
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:18.230
<v Speaker 9>the question.</v>

716
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave the physics there then.</v>

717
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Could we go to our next uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>question please end gala link off.</v>

718
00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

719
00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.700
<v Speaker 1>so we've all noticed that there are no </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

720
00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the received the Nobel prize this year.</v>

721
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my question is what can you ask noble</v>

722
00:39:36.921 --> 00:39:37.754
<v Speaker 1>laureates us as young scientists but </v>
<v Speaker 1>also general public do to encourage </v>

723
00:39:44.691 --> 00:39:47.570
<v Speaker 1>women to go into science and promote </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

724
00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

725
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:52.890
<v Speaker 9>well a volunteer to start that one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>My own view of this,</v>

726
00:39:52.891 --> 00:39:55.300
<v Speaker 9>this issue is initial,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no question about it,</v>

727
00:39:55.301 --> 00:39:58.930
<v Speaker 9>but my own view of this issue is a bit </v>
<v Speaker 9>heretical.</v>

728
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.333
<v Speaker 9>And you see to me the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the female of the species is actually v </v>

729
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.840
<v Speaker 9>too smart to go into physics simply </v>
<v Speaker 9>because physics is tough education,</v>

730
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.140
<v Speaker 9>no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And the,</v>

731
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:16.380
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>

732
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.600
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the resulting,</v>

733
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.483
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>job you going to get with this fancy </v>

734
00:40:19.701 --> 00:40:23.990
<v Speaker 9>education is not great.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't pave particularly well and it</v>

735
00:40:23.991 --> 00:40:28.991
<v Speaker 9>doesn't give you much free time.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So why on earth should somebody who's,</v>

736
00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.713
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>who,</v>

737
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:31.693
<v Speaker 9>who is sensible and intelligent go into </v>
<v Speaker 9>this difficult field when they can make </v>

738
00:40:36.231 --> 00:40:37.850
<v Speaker 9>a much better living in these your </v>
<v Speaker 9>fields.</v>

739
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So heretical that your fellow laureates </v>
<v Speaker 1>green shakes.</v>

740
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:47.270
<v Speaker 12>My view is heretical.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Fantastic job if you,</v>

741
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.810
<v Speaker 12>cause it gives you the opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

742
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.560
<v Speaker 12>discover things and to work on advancing</v>
<v Speaker 12>knowledge.</v>

743
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:57.630
<v Speaker 12>Now if you want to people,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's not badly paid.</v>

744
00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.520
<v Speaker 12>I disagree that it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's not,</v>

745
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.700
<v Speaker 12>I mean people that if you want to make a</v>
<v Speaker 12>huge amounts of money,</v>

746
00:41:03.701 --> 00:41:05.500
<v Speaker 12>of course you go to Wall Street or </v>
<v Speaker 12>whatever.</v>

747
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:06.334
<v Speaker 12>But,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

748
00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:07.523
<v Speaker 12>the issue with a women in physics,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean physics departments certainly in </v>

749
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.900
<v Speaker 12>that you states,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

750
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.060
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>vary tremendously focused on,</v>

751
00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:16.160
<v Speaker 12>I'm trying to do something about this.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>

752
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:17.830
<v Speaker 12>the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

753
00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:22.120
<v Speaker 12>we believe probably it's a question of </v>
<v Speaker 12>maybe it's role models to be able to see</v>

754
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:27.270
<v Speaker 12>a successful women scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And so people believe that they can have</v>

755
00:41:27.851 --> 00:41:28.684
<v Speaker 12>a career in it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>We really do wish women to come into </v>

756
00:41:30.731 --> 00:41:31.690
<v Speaker 12>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And,</v>

757
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's a problem of,</v>

758
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:35.023
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of women becoming discouraged and </v>

759
00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 6>dropping out at each stage of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>process.</v>

760
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 6>These are experiments that they have </v>
<v Speaker 6>done in,</v>

761
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:42.194
<v Speaker 6>in Addis and sob musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they have started toward this and </v>

762
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.790
<v Speaker 6>behind the curtain it changes </v>
<v Speaker 6>dramatically the motto and the number of</v>

763
00:41:49.791 --> 00:41:50.624
<v Speaker 6>women that they are accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it just shows the days a lot of </v>

764
00:41:53.871 --> 00:41:57.590
<v Speaker 6>discrimination and it's not a evil </v>
<v Speaker 6>disagreements a side.</v>

765
00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 6>I think it's just subconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We are a club,</v>

766
00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we men behave in a certain way.</v>

767
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:06.830
<v Speaker 6>We understand each other better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't understand why men very well,</v>

768
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.753
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

769
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.480
<v Speaker 1>So Fraser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your late wife was a scientist.</v>

770
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we all your two daughters.</v>

771
00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.670
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's your answer on this?</v>

772
00:42:15.671 --> 00:42:16.504
<v Speaker 6>Gender risky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why does it happen that we don't have </v>

773
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.770
<v Speaker 6>enough women?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what can you do about it?</v>

774
00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:22.383
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a changing environment and </v>

775
00:42:24.461 --> 00:42:25.294
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think we will see over the next 50 </v>

776
00:42:26.981 --> 00:42:27.814
<v Speaker 6>years a dramatic change.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I spec express it in terms of my own </v>

777
00:42:31.241 --> 00:42:33.820
<v Speaker 6>family,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think my two daughters who are sitting</v>

778
00:42:33.821 --> 00:42:37.480
<v Speaker 6>in this audience with phds in chemistry </v>
<v Speaker 6>are,</v>

779
00:42:37.481 --> 00:42:38.314
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>living in a much different social and </v>

780
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.133
<v Speaker 6>home background.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And even myself and my wife where they </v>

781
00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:44.944
<v Speaker 6>are supported by a husbands who are </v>
<v Speaker 6>playing a big role in running the </v>

782
00:42:49.181 --> 00:42:50.720
<v Speaker 6>family,</v>
<v Speaker 6>looking after the children.</v>

783
00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:51.554
<v Speaker 6>And so I think we've seen social changes</v>
<v Speaker 6>that will make it very much easier for </v>

784
00:42:55.001 --> 00:42:57.170
<v Speaker 6>women to participate in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

785
00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.380
<v Speaker 6>follow the rules of science.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

786
00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.233
<v Speaker 6>and so I'm very optimistic that it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to come about maybe one year in </v>

787
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.210
<v Speaker 6>the future there'll be seven women </v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting around this table,</v>

788
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.303
<v Speaker 1>optimistic comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we can end that particular </v>

789
00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.940
<v Speaker 1>area of Asher just want to end by saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

790
00:43:14.941 --> 00:43:15.774
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally we would hope to be joined at </v>

791
00:43:17.221 --> 00:43:20.130
<v Speaker 1>the table by the laureate for literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this air force.</v>

792
00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.410
<v Speaker 1>It was a Bob Dylan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should also say,</v>

793
00:43:22.411 --> 00:43:23.244
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we don't have with us </v>

794
00:43:23.851 --> 00:43:28.851
<v Speaker 1>Professor Yoshinori Ohsumi who is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel laureate in medicine or physiology</v>

795
00:43:29.161 --> 00:43:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>

796
00:43:30.361 --> 00:43:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Go to him too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of Bob Dylan,</v>

797
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:33.833
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been some comments saying </v>

798
00:43:35.971 --> 00:43:40.590
<v Speaker 1>that the songwriter perhaps shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been considered in this category of</v>

799
00:43:40.591 --> 00:43:43.570
<v Speaker 1>a literature prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

800
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you reacted this.</v>

801
00:43:44.991 --> 00:43:47.670
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think</v>

802
00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.500
<v Speaker 11>our law,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I like him as a senior.</v>

803
00:43:49.501 --> 00:43:50.334
<v Speaker 11>I liked the music,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I also have difficulties to believe </v>

804
00:43:54.091 --> 00:43:54.970
<v Speaker 11>that,</v>
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

805
00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.790
<v Speaker 11>there are no writers,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

806
00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.153
<v Speaker 11>very recalling,</v>
<v Speaker 11>recognized as writers who don't deserve </v>

807
00:44:01.741 --> 00:44:02.880
<v Speaker 11>the pies as well.</v>

808
00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very diplomatic answer.</v>

809
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps a thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

810
00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.300
<v Speaker 1>anybody else bumped into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

811
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.480
<v Speaker 10>I think it's fantastic that Bob Dylan </v>
<v Speaker 10>got this award.</v>

812
00:44:12.481 --> 00:44:13.230
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 10>he,</v>

813
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:14.063
<v Speaker 10>his poems,</v>
<v Speaker 10>his songs were so important and </v>

814
00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:19.230
<v Speaker 10>influential for whole generation.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>

815
00:44:19.231 --> 00:44:20.064
<v Speaker 10>when I was a student,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I had these records and I still know </v>

816
00:44:23.011 --> 00:44:25.020
<v Speaker 10>every one of it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's,</v>

817
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:25.913
<v Speaker 10>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And when it was announced in a typical </v>

818
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.490
<v Speaker 10>laboratory like mine,</v>
<v Speaker 10>every Laborde,</v>

819
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 10>he has his own music and</v>

820
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 3>within a minute they all switched to Bob</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dylan.</v>

821
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:36.103
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

822
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:41.420
<v Speaker 1>He said he was speechless when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>received being awarded.</v>

823
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:41.920
<v Speaker 1>The one</v>

824
00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.630
<v Speaker 9>that's it's influence is boards </v>
<v Speaker 9>influence people,</v>

825
00:44:44.631 --> 00:44:45.480
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what,</v>

826
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.430
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it seems to me that's later.</v>

827
00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.660
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Good Choice Professor Castilla it's,</v>

828
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:52.130
<v Speaker 9>I think you're a big fan of personal </v>
<v Speaker 9>point of view.</v>

829
00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:56.480
<v Speaker 9>When I heard that the literature prize </v>
<v Speaker 9>being awarded to bop little,</v>

830
00:44:56.481 --> 00:44:57.620
<v Speaker 9>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 9>wow,</v>

831
00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.380
<v Speaker 9>that's the greatest decision I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 9>heard of.</v>

832
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:07.990
<v Speaker 9>Why I love Dylan and his and his music </v>
<v Speaker 9>and songs.</v>

833
00:45:08.421 --> 00:45:11.960
<v Speaker 9>I really grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I essentially grew up with it.</v>

834
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:15.030
<v Speaker 9>Do you do Karaoke for Bob didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 9>Bob Dylan.</v>

835
00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.080
<v Speaker 9>I once I once tried it,</v>

836
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to give us a nice town.</v>

837
00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mac can't sing</v>

838
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.710
<v Speaker 3>heretical to say about Bob Dylan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

839
00:45:28.711 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 3>I think we've spent far too much time </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about Bob Dylan.</v>

840
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean here,</v>

841
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.351
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

842
00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:39.090
<v Speaker 3>just generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

843
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.120
<v Speaker 3>is he calming?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it you calming?</v>

844
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.410
<v Speaker 3>I actually don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

845
00:45:44.411 --> 00:45:47.190
<v Speaker 3>he didn't come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems to me I have,</v>

846
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.480
<v Speaker 3>it may have been a fine choice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

847
00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:50.733
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably if he had come he would have </v>

848
00:45:54.581 --> 00:45:57.790
<v Speaker 3>sucked all the oxygen out of the event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is partly,</v>

849
00:45:57.791 --> 00:45:59.650
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good thing he didn't.</v>

850
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I show 'em take up your recommendation </v>

851
00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.040
<v Speaker 1>and stop talking about any factions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie.</v>

852

<v Speaker 1>Thank you to all you laureates and </v>
