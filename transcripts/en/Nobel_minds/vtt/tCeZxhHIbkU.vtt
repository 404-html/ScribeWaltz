22
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.903
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having your perceptions about the wire </v>

23
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 2>per class and it was really amazing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see stables and so on.</v>

24
00:01:42.731 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

25

<v Speaker 2>I had to play you the extra seat next to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a point is a con printers.</v>

<v Speaker 2>discussions about whatever thing.</v>

28
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>So mixing with the royals or highlight </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

29
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>you don't do many often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.343
<v Speaker 1>the same with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lots of interesting </v>

31
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:09.130
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I really enjoyed last night.</v>

32
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like the bank quit so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been the highlight.</v>

33
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Was it for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Frances Arnold?</v>

34
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to admit the banquet was really </v>

35
00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 1>quite special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But coming from southern California,</v>

36
00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:25.471
<v Speaker 1>I have to say snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no the night of the ceremony and it</v>

37
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 1>was just beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Madison,</v>

38
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.440
<v Speaker 3>for me the most special was when after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Er king person at the metal I looked</v>

39
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:36.644
<v Speaker 3>out for my family was sitting in shop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife and son might be tears over </v>

40
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.893
<v Speaker 3>rice.</v>

41
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you go,</v>

42
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.841
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bounce,</v>

43
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I got all my bowels right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quiet,</v>

45
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 1>quiet a procedure yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Smith Miller.</v>

46
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.793
<v Speaker 1>I hate to be a party pooper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually frankly I think the </v>

47
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>highlight was the Nobel lecture is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that</v>

48
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 2>will last on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

49
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.620
<v Speaker 2>as the memories of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>this celebration beacon to fade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Professor Bill Nordhaus.</v>

51
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 2>The highlight for me was to bring my </v>
<v Speaker 2>grandchildren here,</v>

52
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 2>my grant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my granddaughters,</v>

53
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.663
<v Speaker 2>and to bring to the banquet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when they were interviewed by </v>

54
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:21.240
<v Speaker 2>the news that they were asked was it</v>

55
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.890
<v Speaker 1>too long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said no,</v>

56
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.020
<v Speaker 1>it was too short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

57
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.883
<v Speaker 1>Cause I quite young aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their mother was teaching them how </v>

58
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:28.111
<v Speaker 1>to sit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not that one around,</v>

60
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.070
<v Speaker 1>but all the adults were getting tired </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would just</v>

61
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 4>beginning to get ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul Romer,</v>

62
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.303
<v Speaker 4>all of these parts were wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked getting to know a few people </v>

63
00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:44.240
<v Speaker 4>here in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Alexander who took our pictures when</v>

64
00:03:44.241 --> 00:03:45.074
<v Speaker 4>we were doing the portraits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just fascinating to see how he </v>

65
00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:47.804
<v Speaker 4>did his job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I also loved getting to know my driver </v>

66
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.290
<v Speaker 4>who was a woman and also a body guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

67
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.390
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's pretty cool.</v>

68
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.253
<v Speaker 4>She's bad ass</v>

69
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.420
<v Speaker 1>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really are faced it and celebrated,</v>

70
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.283
<v Speaker 1>aren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So driven around in your own personal </v>

71
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:04.050
<v Speaker 1>limos and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it,</v>

73
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>let's start talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

74
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.200
<v Speaker 1>why you want some of these prizes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to start with the economists</v>

75
00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>and Bill Nordhaus and Paul Romer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's just have a quick look at what</v>

76
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:14.940
<v Speaker 1>you want to your price book</v>

77
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.853
<v Speaker 5>by studying how nature and knowledge are</v>
<v Speaker 5>affected by markets and economic </v>

78
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:22.144
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>William northouse and Paul Romer </v>

79
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.323
<v Speaker 5>designed economic models that address </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of today's most fundamental and </v>

80
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.794
<v Speaker 5>pressing issues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long term sustainable growth in the </v>

81
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 5>global economy and welfare of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world's population.</v>

82
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.523
<v Speaker 5>Professor northouse has developed tools </v>
<v Speaker 5>that project the economic impacts of </v>

83
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 5>climate change and provide approaches </v>
<v Speaker 5>for Sloan is progress.</v>

84
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.033
<v Speaker 5>Professor Roma has explained how </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowledge and ideas can surface engines </v>

85
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:57.391
<v Speaker 5>for long term economic growth and why </v>
<v Speaker 5>government policies play a critical role</v>

86
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 5>in fostering technological innovation.</v>

87
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.273
<v Speaker 1>Paul Romer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just explain a bit more to us about </v>

88
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:07.440
<v Speaker 1>the link between innovation and economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

89
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 4>When people look back on this time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are they going to remember?</v>

90
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like,</v>

91
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the discovery of electric light,</v>

92
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics,</v>

93
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the transistor,</v>

94
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 4>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe cancer immunotherapy that could be</v>

95
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 4>as big as antibiotics in the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those kinds of innovations just make all</v>

96
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:26.920
<v Speaker 4>the difference in the quality of life.</v>

97
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>But do they actually boost economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth?</v>

98
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.110
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

99
00:05:30.111 --> 00:05:31.550
<v Speaker 4>we get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get income,</v>

100
00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:35.240
<v Speaker 4>but we also get quality of life that </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't always measured in income.</v>

101
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.403
<v Speaker 4>The thing to remember is that we need as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a society to steer the direction of </v>

102
00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:40.574
<v Speaker 4>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some innovation that we don't </v>

103
00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:42.494
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody could find a way to get coal </v>

104
00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:49.130
<v Speaker 4>out of the ground at very low cost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want that kind of innovation.</v>

105
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.993
<v Speaker 4>What we want is more of a say innovation</v>
<v Speaker 4>that helps reduce the cost of low </v>

106
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:55.820
<v Speaker 4>carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>zero carbon energy.</v>

107
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>But you say it's got to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so markets</v>

108
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 4>are not enough to ensure that we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>that innovation.</v>

109
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way to think of the market,</v>

110
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 4>it's a market works for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the boss,</v>

111
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the word the boss,</v>

112
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 4>but don't forget the things that work </v>
<v Speaker 4>like cities work.</v>

113
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.593
<v Speaker 4>There's a technology for getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>millions of people in a pretty small </v>

114
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 4>area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So just copy the parts about cities,</v>

115
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.680
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property and all that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing and people putting up,</v>

116
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protectionism.</v>

117
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.753
<v Speaker 4>Think of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think of intellectual property is as we </v>

118
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:24.254
<v Speaker 4>always give these two handed answers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the one hand you could use </v>

119
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 4>intellectual property but on the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand you could use science,</v>

120
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 4>you subsidize the research and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you give the results away.</v>

121
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.823
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

122
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 4>President Truman said he wanted a one </v>
<v Speaker 4>armed economist cause he was so tired of</v>

123
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 4>on the one hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

124
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.323
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still important to remember </v>

125
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:42.044
<v Speaker 4>that that system of science that we all </v>
<v Speaker 4>participated in is a very good way to </v>

126
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 4>produce discoveries and get them out </v>
<v Speaker 4>into a wide circulation.</v>

127
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.973
<v Speaker 1>Bill Nordhaus I me your research looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>at how the causes and consequences of </v>

128
00:06:55.601 --> 00:06:56.434
<v Speaker 1>climate change and what can be done in </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics to try to tackle climate </v>

129
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:02.410
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

130
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:07.030
<v Speaker 1>what does your research tell us about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's doable that climate change is bad</v>

131
00:07:07.031 --> 00:07:10.300
<v Speaker 1>for the economy and that tackling it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for the economy?</v>

132
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.290
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

133
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.930
<v Speaker 6>I'll just start with Paul Romer left </v>
<v Speaker 6>off,</v>

134
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.580
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with innovation.</v>

135
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.820
<v Speaker 6>So we often think of innovations and </v>
<v Speaker 6>inventions.</v>

136
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.010
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in terms of the things my,</v>

137
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 6>my friends who have done,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but let's just say that this was,</v>

138
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this was in a,</v>

139
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.800
<v Speaker 6>this ballpoint pen was actually historic</v>
<v Speaker 6>innovation in about 50 years ago.</v>

140
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.120
<v Speaker 6>But these are often,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we think of these gadgets so to speak,</v>

141
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:34.954
<v Speaker 6>or more fundamental ones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But also there's a whole nother class </v>

142
00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:38.044
<v Speaker 6>which are called institutional </v>
<v Speaker 6>inventions where we invent new </v>

143
00:07:41.141 --> 00:07:43.750
<v Speaker 6>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in this field,</v>

144
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.853
<v Speaker 6>I think the most important invention </v>
<v Speaker 6>would be a fiscal system to steer the </v>

145
00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:49.864
<v Speaker 6>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's a tax or another way of </v>

146
00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:56.170
<v Speaker 6>raising the prices of carbon fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This will steer the economy.</v>

147
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.190
<v Speaker 6>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the,</v>

148
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:02.050
<v Speaker 6>actually we think it's obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but actually this was an invention of an</v>

149
00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:05.830
<v Speaker 6>institutional kind that has been made </v>
<v Speaker 6>over the last 60 or 70 years.</v>

150
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 1>So you're an advocate of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

151
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.713
<v Speaker 1>carbon tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just basically makes the use of </v>

152
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:16.301
<v Speaker 1>fossil fuels dirty fossil fuels more </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive and incentivizes producers and</v>

153
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>people through government policies or </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidies or whatever to try and turn to</v>

154
00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>renewable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feels,</v>

155
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:24.194
<v Speaker 1>but is that really doable in practice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What what you economists may determine </v>

156
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>is desirable is sometimes not </v>
<v Speaker 1>politically expedient,</v>

157
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>was it?</v>

158
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.653
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the thing I would emphasize is not the </v>

159
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:35.354
<v Speaker 6>carbon tax,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the carbon price that you need to </v>

160
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:43.331
<v Speaker 6>raise the price of co two emissions and </v>
<v Speaker 6>thereby raise the price of fuels and all</v>

161
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:47.180
<v Speaker 6>the products that the fuels are embodied</v>
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>

162
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.043
<v Speaker 6>So it isn't just burning the fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it will be buried in our </v>

163
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 6>electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in our air,</v>

164
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:54.970
<v Speaker 6>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in our ballpoint pen,</v>

165
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

166
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>in proportion to the amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't have to be attacks,</v>

167
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.953
<v Speaker 1>but does your research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Nordhaus actually show that it </v>

168
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 1>makes economic sense to tackle climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change?</v>

169
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 1>You can do it and have sustainable </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm growth.</v>

170
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.190
<v Speaker 1>So in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a broader framework,</v>

171
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 1>what we know is that the way we measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>our output,</v>

172
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:19.554
<v Speaker 1>which is the gross domestic product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miss measures it because it doesn't </v>

173
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:23.784
<v Speaker 1>incorporate the damages that are outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Margaret such as health health is </v>

174
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Speaker 1>not included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether we die earlier or die young,</v>

175
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.953
<v Speaker 1>whether we're sick or healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not included in our economic </v>

176
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:34.730
<v Speaker 1>measurements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

177
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.633
<v Speaker 1>when we include that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we see we would actually have </v>

178
00:09:37.951 --> 00:09:38.784
<v Speaker 1>higher incomes in this real inclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive sense if we include </v>

179
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.530
<v Speaker 1>measures that reduce the damages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just climate change,</v>

180
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:50.570
<v Speaker 1>it's also particulates from burning </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuels and Satya and poor Roma.</v>

181
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:51.404
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've worked as a chief </v>
<v Speaker 1>economist of the World Bank advising </v>

182
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:57.090
<v Speaker 1>governments and institutions and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from a political family.</v>

183
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Your father was a former Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>governor in the state,</v>

184
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 1>became a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politician's job is too hard.</v>

185
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask you,</v>

186
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

187
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 1>but you economists can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

188
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:08.304
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense to do this and to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to direct market forces and </v>

189
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 1>so on and so forth as you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

190
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's not easy for the politicians to</v>
<v Speaker 1>always do what you think is right.</v>

191
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like Churchill's quote about the</v>

192
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 1>United States is just applied to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

193
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 1>They always do what's right after </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausting all the alternatives.</v>

194
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So you just have to be a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>patient.</v>

195
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.450
<v Speaker 1>But just staying with this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.270
<v Speaker 1>what governments can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Professor Miller,</v>

197
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.133
<v Speaker 1>you live in Paris now and we've seen the</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] on the against President </v>

198
00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Macron is desire to have these green </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel taxes,</v>

199
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:47.100
<v Speaker 1>which he says are in part to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat global warming.</v>

200
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Look at the problem is he's hired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's abandoned the idea.</v>

201
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys,</v>

202
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:51.624
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's tying Haiti to do something </v>

203
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:54.220
<v Speaker 1>innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signed to Bush,</v>

204
00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:55.940
<v Speaker 1>a people headed to save.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

205
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 1>there's no way we are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.080
<v Speaker 1>to keep this vis a style of living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

207
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.890
<v Speaker 1>we have to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already have to do something and,</v>

209
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 1>and we have to introduce some incentive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

210
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think the taxes,</v>

211
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an economist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

212
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.243
<v Speaker 1>But I understand that maybe the tax on </v>
<v Speaker 1>any way to put some pressure on the </v>

213
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>people and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

214
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

215
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to reduce your consumption.</v>

216
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.780
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you recommend that we,</v>

217
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:31.703
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we avoid the Yellow Jersey movement in </v>

218
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 1>if we raise the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the price of,</v>

219
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:38.904
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a carbon is raised because it hurts </v>

220
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

221
00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:45.294
<v Speaker 1>I think the first thing is you make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive rather than focusing on </v>

222
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:50.160
<v Speaker 1>fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually the most politically</v>

223
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 1>insensitive tax in the world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a gasoline tax or</v>

224
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 6>a fuel tax.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You make it comprehensive.</v>

225
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.530
<v Speaker 6>If you make it comprehensive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's more like a value added tax.</v>

226
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:00.364
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it gets built into the chain of </v>

227
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 6>production.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the other thing is you start at</v>

228
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 6>a low level and you build it up </v>
<v Speaker 6>gradually.</v>

229
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 6>You need not to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>only to have the tax,</v>

230
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:10.360
<v Speaker 6>but do you need to have the </v>
<v Speaker 6>institutions,</v>

231
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.500
<v Speaker 6>you ha you have to have people who can </v>
<v Speaker 6>accept this and realize it's part of our</v>

232
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:17.560
<v Speaker 6>system is part of the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think just hitting people,</v>

233
00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:19.490
<v Speaker 6>trying to do it as a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

234
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 6>a kind of shock therapy is actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>politically the wrong way.</v>

235
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:25.690
<v Speaker 6>You need to start small,</v>
<v Speaker 6>start comprehensive,</v>

236
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 6>start universally across countries and </v>
<v Speaker 6>build up gradually from there.</v>

237
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.823
<v Speaker 6>If I can jump in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think partly starts small big </v>

238
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 6>government programs have an up almost </v>
<v Speaker 6>always start small and get bigger.</v>

239
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.900
<v Speaker 6>The other thing is we need to have the </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole machinery of carbon taxes ready.</v>

240
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:41.734
<v Speaker 6>We need to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then at some point there'll be some </v>

241
00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 6>huge hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some huge fire or something that becomes</v>

242
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:50.260
<v Speaker 6>a crisis and then all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 6>politicians are going to say,</v>

243
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 6>what are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if we've done all of our homework,</v>

244
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.310
<v Speaker 6>then they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

245
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.590
<v Speaker 6>well that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's do it here.</v>

246
00:12:55.591 --> 00:12:55.950
<v Speaker 6>You</v>

247
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.030
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] else want to come in on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

248
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>We'll do the raising the price of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuels and materials is critical I think.</v>

249
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.303
<v Speaker 1>But another way to come at the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to invent new technologies and lower </v>

250
00:13:12.451 --> 00:13:13.284
<v Speaker 1>the cost of the alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where scientists like us can </v>

251
00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:22.170
<v Speaker 1>contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can invent those and improve on those</v>

252
00:13:22.171 --> 00:13:23.004
<v Speaker 1>technologies and at the same time then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're joining forces with the </v>

253
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:26.754
<v Speaker 1>institutions and you create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will bring us into chemistry </v>

254
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.073
<v Speaker 1>because I'm Francis Arnold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You awarded half of the prize part for </v>

255
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.470
<v Speaker 1>finding green solutions to some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's problems,</v>

256
00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:38.304
<v Speaker 1>like climate change and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's just see what the chemistry </v>

257
00:13:41.491 --> 00:13:44.160
<v Speaker 1>laureates won their prize for and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll pick that up.</v>

258
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.720
<v Speaker 5>Inspired by the power of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Francis on audit develops new biological</v>

259
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:52.594
<v Speaker 5>material in the form of enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>catalysts that accelerate chemical </v>

260
00:13:56.831 --> 00:13:58.970
<v Speaker 5>reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How Barack is currently,</v>

261
00:13:58.971 --> 00:13:59.804
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being used in the environmentally </v>

262
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:01.674
<v Speaker 5>friendly manufacturing of </v>
<v Speaker 5>pharmaceuticals and the production of </v>

263
00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:09.420
<v Speaker 5>renewable fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>George Smith was studying the biology of</v>

264
00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:10.254
<v Speaker 5>viruses that infect bacteria known as </v>
<v Speaker 5>phages when he conceived a way of </v>

265
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:15.634
<v Speaker 5>evolving the viruses to generate new </v>
<v Speaker 5>molecules with desirable properties and </v>

266
00:14:20.051 --> 00:14:20.884
<v Speaker 5>essential part of all living organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Greg winter then harness this technique </v>

267
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:31.620
<v Speaker 5>to create new antibodies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>immune proteins that attack bacteria and</v>

268
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:35.570
<v Speaker 5>viruses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The work of George Smith and Greg winter</v>

269
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.523
<v Speaker 5>has successfully been used to combat or </v>
<v Speaker 5>to immune and inflammatory bowel </v>

270
00:14:40.131 --> 00:14:42.860
<v Speaker 5>diseases and metastatic cancer.</v>

271
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 1>So Frances Arnold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we saw just the,</v>

272
00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:49.160
<v Speaker 1>your work has led to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

273
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.123
<v Speaker 1>a multitude of potential users and or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is it being used to </v>

274
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 1>develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know?</v>

275
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry of the biological world is,</v>

276
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.793
<v Speaker 1>is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biology is the best chemist on the </v>

277
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:08.111
<v Speaker 1>planet because she knows how to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>abundant renewable resources and convert</v>

278
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:13.490
<v Speaker 1>them into an array of chemicals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials,</v>

279
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.100
<v Speaker 1>some of which we've used for hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

280
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:16.934
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if we could use biology to make </v>

281
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.433
<v Speaker 1>most of the things we need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including fuels or agents that can be </v>

282
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:29.300
<v Speaker 1>used for crop control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things are happening now.</v>

283
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.910
<v Speaker 1>You've made institutions that will make </v>
<v Speaker 1>that possible by having the,</v>

284
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 1>the price reflect the true cost of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these products,</v>

285
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 1>but we are inventing the technologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will make that possible.</v>

286
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.043
<v Speaker 1>I use evolution to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evolution has made everything in the </v>

287
00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:52.370
<v Speaker 1>biological world until today and it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>help us move forward.</v>

288
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 1>So I breed molecules like you breed cats</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dogs.</v>

289
00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.773
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us an idea of what your work could </v>

290
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.370
<v Speaker 1>really open off in terms of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

291
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Use it with a little work courses of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

292
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:09.860
<v Speaker 1>The do all this chemistry are called </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzymes.</v>

293
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.620
<v Speaker 1>You have them in your laundry </v>
<v Speaker 1>detergents,</v>

294
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:16.730
<v Speaker 1>you're consumer products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make your blue jeans look nice.</v>

295
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Many of the things that you use in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>daily lives are developed with enzymes.</v>

296
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I make them better than what nature did </v>
<v Speaker 1>for human purposes.</v>

297
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.410
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

298
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.483
<v Speaker 1>several students and I started a company</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 15 years ago that makes renewable </v>

299
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.670
<v Speaker 1>jet fuel for airplanes comes from plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials,</v>

300
00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:44.000
<v Speaker 1>agricultural waste products or trees for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

301
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that you can use then to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take those sugars and make jet fuel.</v>

302
00:16:48.551 --> 00:16:50.390
<v Speaker 1>So biofuels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biofuels.</v>

303
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.253
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are many other examples and </v>

304
00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:56.520
<v Speaker 1>also for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the production of pharmaceuticals.</v>

305
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.443
<v Speaker 1>You've also that that can be used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>detoxify the process sorts of </v>

306
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 1>applications.</v>

307
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.890
<v Speaker 1>You can replace toxic chemical processes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that use expensive metals,</v>

308
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:10.334
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are environmentally hugely </v>

309
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:13.934
<v Speaker 1>unfriendly to mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can replace all those with clean </v>

310
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:18.464
<v Speaker 1>biological processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to say you replace chemists with </v>

311
00:17:21.951 --> 00:17:25.910
<v Speaker 1>bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're actually a mechanical engineer on</v>

312
00:17:25.911 --> 00:17:26.744
<v Speaker 1>she by trained me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you always have a very clear vision </v>

313
00:17:28.791 --> 00:17:31.940
<v Speaker 1>of the kinds of path and what you wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve?</v>

314
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways,</v>

315
00:17:33.351 --> 00:17:34.184
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always interested in doing </v>

316
00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 1>something that would help humans and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

317
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.153
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a pretty nice planet that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we live on and I'd like to see much of </v>

318
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:47.770
<v Speaker 1>the natural world as possible be </v>
<v Speaker 1>conserved.</v>

319
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 1>We won't do that if we don't</v>

320
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.933
<v Speaker 7>learn how to make what we need in our </v>
<v Speaker 7>daily lives in a much more efficient </v>

321
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 7>way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How you did that,</v>

322
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.130
<v Speaker 7>I had to figure that out through a </v>
<v Speaker 7>meandering path,</v>

323
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 7>which eventually brought me to </v>
<v Speaker 7>evolution.</v>

324
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Speaker 7>But we know to describe to my students </v>
<v Speaker 7>what a wonderful world we live in.</v>

325
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.053
<v Speaker 7>I used to tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>think of the cow as the best chemical </v>

326
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:09.654
<v Speaker 7>refinery you could ever build and all </v>
<v Speaker 7>like it takes renewable resources that </v>

327
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:14.730
<v Speaker 7>makes milk,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it builds a new one when it wears out,</v>

328
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.360
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd like,</v>

329
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.950
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't get any better than that.</v>

330
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:17.813
<v Speaker 7>Well and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we can link but that we can make </v>

331
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:21.444
<v Speaker 7>something like a cow out of just adams.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean who'd a thunk or a yeast take </v>

332
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:27.030
<v Speaker 7>sugar and makes alcohol.</v>

333
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:28.783
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk can alcohol Georgeson it's just </v>

334
00:18:33.401 --> 00:18:34.151
<v Speaker 1>staying with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

335
00:18:34.151 --> 00:18:37.270
<v Speaker 1>with the chemistry prize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were studying the biology of viruses</v>

336
00:18:37.271 --> 00:18:42.271
<v Speaker 1>that infect bacteria and worked with </v>
<v Speaker 1>phages phage display.</v>

337
00:18:43.001 --> 00:18:45.910
<v Speaker 1>And so on as we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just explain a bit more to us.</v>

338
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.903
<v Speaker 2>It's a way of creating a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of structures and a way of an </v>

339
00:18:52.611 --> 00:18:57.611
<v Speaker 2>investigator choosing a goal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>selecting from that huge,</v>

340
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>array of structures,</v>

341
00:19:00.261 --> 00:19:03.980
<v Speaker 2>the few that can meet that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is evolution up and down.</v>

342
00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:06.230
<v Speaker 2>This is what evolution does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

343
00:19:06.231 --> 00:19:07.064
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

344
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.540
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have a goal in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we mimic it in laboratory,</v>

345
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:16.810
<v Speaker 2>we ourselves can have a goal in mind and</v>
<v Speaker 2>no a idea in detail how that goal can be</v>

346
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.310
<v Speaker 2>achieved.</v>

347
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.143
<v Speaker 1>Phage display your work on that which </v>
<v Speaker 1>really allows us to generate human </v>

348
00:19:24.721 --> 00:19:25.554
<v Speaker 1>antibodies was then built upon by Sir </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gregory winter who is not with us in </v>

349
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 1>this discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he used that and it went quite a way</v>

350
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:39.350
<v Speaker 1>to helping tackle rheumatoid arthritis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and metastatic cancer.</v>

351
00:19:39.351 --> 00:19:40.420
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

352
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something which has really been remarked</v>

353
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:45.120
<v Speaker 1>on greatly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

354
00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you could just mention that </v>
<v Speaker 1>link third,</v>

355
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.700
<v Speaker 2>Greg mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

356
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:54.610
<v Speaker 2>libraries of a hundred billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures selecting from among those,</v>

357
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.770
<v Speaker 2>the rare ones that will meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet a goal.</v>

358
00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Speaker 2>So the goal in that case was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>antibodies that would be fully human,</v>

359
00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.410
<v Speaker 2>could be used in therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

360
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.273
<v Speaker 2>without provoking an immune reaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the antibodies themselves </v>

361
00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.600
<v Speaker 2>because they come from a foreign source </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a mouse.</v>

362
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 2>So Greg set out to create a library of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human antibodies artificially,</v>

363
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.610
<v Speaker 2>a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge libraries and s and devise a way of</v>

364
00:20:24.611 --> 00:20:29.611
<v Speaker 2>selecting those that would have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>specificity for a desired target,</v>

365
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has therapeutic,</v>

366
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

367
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:36.763
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just draw the link to the literature </v>

368
00:20:37.631 --> 00:20:39.100
<v Speaker 2>prize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was an award this year.</v>

369
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.700
<v Speaker 7>Borhees has this famous story,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the Library of Babel.</v>

370
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.000
<v Speaker 7>The yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

371
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.983
<v Speaker 7>I mean what you're describing is really </v>
<v Speaker 7>just like what borhees describes the </v>

372
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.260
<v Speaker 7>walgreens</v>

373
00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.080
<v Speaker 1>that in my Nobel lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

374
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.920
<v Speaker 1>This is nearly infinite set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities and what the phage display</v>

375
00:20:57.341 --> 00:20:58.174
<v Speaker 1>does and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to lesser extent what enzyme </v>

376
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:01.654
<v Speaker 1>evolution does is give you a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>search through that library that bore </v>

377
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Hayes didn't have right that way to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

378
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:09.664
<v Speaker 1>But evolution can take us through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite set of possibilities to find </v>

379
00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are useful for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for us,</v>

380
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.043
<v Speaker 1>if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we keep looking for a vaccine for </v>

381
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:20.450
<v Speaker 1>malaria,</v>

382
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.283
<v Speaker 2>do you think we'll find it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause we've only explored a few very </v>

383
00:21:23.541 --> 00:21:26.120
<v Speaker 2>small part of the space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

384
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.630
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

385
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe you would fund my grant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do,</v>

386
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:32.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

387
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:37.090
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible] Smith</v>

388
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:39.400
<v Speaker 2>pure pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

389
00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:41.980
<v Speaker 2>You're on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

390
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:45.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm retired now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not searching for grants,</v>

391
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.590
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

392
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.821
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

393
00:21:47.821 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 2>so it's specifically the approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

394
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:56.011
<v Speaker 2>that I had suggested was a way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>finding many more vaccine candidates.</v>

395
00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.900
<v Speaker 2>We didn't depend on 10 or 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but perhaps on 200 candidates that would</v>

396
00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:08.671
<v Speaker 2>have a pretty good starting chance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting the goal of a vaccine.</v>

397
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 2>It seems that a vaccine should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

398
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 1>You've all harness the power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution in your work.</v>

399
00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:17.760
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

400
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.320
<v Speaker 1>W W we've talked about cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which remarkably,</v>

401
00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:25.321
<v Speaker 1>it's the first time that a Nobel prize </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been awarded for advancements in the</v>

402
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:26.434
<v Speaker 1>treatment of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The medicine or physiology laureates </v>

403
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.823
<v Speaker 1>will come to you in a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's just look at what you won the </v>

404
00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:33.274
<v Speaker 1>prize for.</v>

405
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.303
<v Speaker 5>James Anderson and Tesco Honjo </v>
<v Speaker 5>discovered how to unleash the body's </v>

406
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:40.804
<v Speaker 5>immune system to attack cancer cells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>James Alison identified a protein that </v>

407
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:51.070
<v Speaker 5>acts as a brake on the immune system and</v>
<v Speaker 5>realize that by reversing it,</v>

408
00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:56.020
<v Speaker 5>the system would be able to attack </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer cells independently.</v>

409
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.123
<v Speaker 5>Task you honcho discovered another </v>
<v Speaker 5>protein which also operates as a brake </v>

410
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 5>on the immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with a different mechanism.</v>

411
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.523
<v Speaker 5>It's the first time the development of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer treatment has been acknowledged </v>

412
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.270
<v Speaker 5>with a Nobel prize</v>

413
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.470
<v Speaker 1>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Alison.</v>

414
00:23:12.471 --> 00:23:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So did you set about trying to find a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cure for cancer?</v>

415
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:17.951
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

416
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:20.120
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

417
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.420
<v Speaker 3>the function of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of t cells,</v>

418
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:23.254
<v Speaker 3>which are a product of evolution and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then ultimately that ourselves that go </v>

419
00:23:26.631 --> 00:23:30.220
<v Speaker 3>out throughout your body looking for </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that out and to be there.</v>

420
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:31.054
<v Speaker 3>And we developed this system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>upsells or way of making receptors on </v>

421
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can recognize,</v>

422
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.203
<v Speaker 3>nobody knows how many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she sells her what type of white </v>

423
00:23:39.221 --> 00:23:40.054
<v Speaker 3>blood cells?</v>
<v Speaker 3>White blood cells that the PTAB antigen </v>

424
00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 3>receptors on their call the could </v>
<v Speaker 3>record.</v>

425
00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:44.464
<v Speaker 3>Does almost anything that nature throws </v>
<v Speaker 3>at you because they create in your body </v>

426
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:50.890
<v Speaker 3>or a library such as we've heard about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

427
00:23:50.891 --> 00:23:51.724
<v Speaker 3>It consists of probably you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as big as some of these </v>

428
00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:55.274
<v Speaker 3>libraries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've probably got somewhere between 70 </v>

429
00:23:57.011 --> 00:24:00.260
<v Speaker 3>to a hundred million different t cells </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your body that can recognize,</v>

430
00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most anything.</v>

431
00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:05.440
<v Speaker 1>So you set about trying to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the immune system better.</v>

432
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.020
<v Speaker 3>We found that there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a molecule called CTLA four anyway,</v>

433
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:14.021
<v Speaker 3>that was the brakes on that system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it what a large part of what it does.</v>

434
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:14.954
<v Speaker 3>It stop t cells from pluff rating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ideas that I had was for </v>

435
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:21.040
<v Speaker 3>some other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

436
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.913
<v Speaker 3>after we figured that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it maybe the reason that immune </v>

437
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:28.390
<v Speaker 3>system isn't so good at attacking </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancers because of that,</v>

438
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.210
<v Speaker 3>it stops the t cells before you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to kill all the tumor cells.</v>

439
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.180
<v Speaker 3>And so if we just disabled the brakes </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a time,</v>

440
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 3>we could let them keep going until they </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminated all the cancer cells.</v>

441
00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:40.214
<v Speaker 3>And so that was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty far fetched because at the </v>

442
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 3>time everybody thought that t cells </v>
<v Speaker 3>divide and they die.</v>

443
00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:50.240
<v Speaker 3>They stop that this is an active </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism whose job tells us he chose to</v>

444
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:51.074
<v Speaker 3>stop it.</v>

445
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.730
<v Speaker 1>So that was your work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about you professor Tesco,</v>

446
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:54.643
<v Speaker 1>Han Jo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were working independently </v>

447
00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.900
<v Speaker 1>and also discovered how to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>release the brake,</v>

448
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the immune system,</v>

449
00:25:01.671 --> 00:25:04.070
<v Speaker 1>which stops it from attacking cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>

450
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:04.904
<v Speaker 1>But did you set about trying to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how the immune system works </v>

451
00:25:07.971 --> 00:25:08.804
<v Speaker 1>better or did you think to yourself some</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment for cancer would be a really </v>

452
00:25:11.961 --> 00:25:12.860
<v Speaker 1>good ambition?</v>

453
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.753
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in a bottom my heart because I'm a </v>

454
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:19.643
<v Speaker 9>medical doctors or originary,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I wanted to have some hope to cure the </v>

455
00:25:26.551 --> 00:25:28.650
<v Speaker 9>cancer or any diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but the,</v>

456
00:25:28.651 --> 00:25:32.520
<v Speaker 9>when I started working in the pd one,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it was just molecule.</v>

457
00:25:32.521 --> 00:25:37.140
<v Speaker 9>We acts ten three identified sterling,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the a t cell,</v>

458
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.570
<v Speaker 9>a selection or regulation or that Tisa </v>
<v Speaker 9>oh gang.</v>

459
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.063
<v Speaker 9>But the one we found,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this is a different break than the Jim </v>

460
00:25:48.541 --> 00:25:51.000
<v Speaker 9>just mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And uh,</v>

461
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:51.983
<v Speaker 9>why immune system is working so well </v>
<v Speaker 9>against the cancer because cancer just </v>

462
00:25:55.681 --> 00:26:00.681
<v Speaker 9>accumulate mutations.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They become different from the hour 40.</v>

463
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.400
<v Speaker 9>So that's what reason why we can attack</v>

464
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.410
<v Speaker 1>professor hundred I mean there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of types of different cancers.</v>

465
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we talk about treating cancer or</v>

466
00:26:12.411 --> 00:26:13.244
<v Speaker 1>curing cancer can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we actually cure cancer and can we </v>

467
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.670
<v Speaker 1>queue all sorts of cancers or are we </v>
<v Speaker 1>just talking about some specific ones?</v>

468
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.980
<v Speaker 9>Well at this moment there are civil </v>
<v Speaker 9>counsel,</v>

469
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.400
<v Speaker 9>which we can cure a some which are very </v>
<v Speaker 9>difficult.</v>

470
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.380
<v Speaker 9>There are several reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

471
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:39.530
<v Speaker 9>one is the immune system cannot approach</v>
<v Speaker 9>to the site where the tumor is located.</v>

472
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.880
<v Speaker 9>Or some cancers do not express so many </v>
<v Speaker 9>different molecule with them.</v>

473
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 9>Normal cells mean the mutation rate is </v>
<v Speaker 9>low.</v>

474
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.483
<v Speaker 9>So at this stage we cannot say we </v>
<v Speaker 9>conquer the cancer to just beginning of </v>

475
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:03.480
<v Speaker 9>the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So we need the lots of research.</v>

476
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.713
<v Speaker 1>Professor Jim Allison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you personally have had a </v>

477
00:27:07.161 --> 00:27:11.210
<v Speaker 1>lot of experience with cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You yourself have had three types,</v>

478
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:14.900
<v Speaker 1>can't see you lost your mother at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>age of 10 to cancer at brother,</v>

479
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.510
<v Speaker 1>uncles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cousin.</v>

480
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.270
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that you,</v>

481
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have experienced firsthand.</v>

482
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.023
<v Speaker 1>But I want to bring in one of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients who were suffering from </v>

483
00:27:25.671 --> 00:27:26.990
<v Speaker 1>melanoma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharon Belvin,</v>

484
00:27:26.991 --> 00:27:27.824
<v Speaker 1>who's traveled all the way to Sweden to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be with you at the celebrations of the </v>

485
00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm Sharon Belvin.</v>

486
00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.373
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it give us your story cause you been </v>

487
00:27:38.391 --> 00:27:40.820
<v Speaker 1>suffering from or you had cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

488
00:27:40.821 --> 00:27:41.654
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

489
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.073
<v Speaker 10>So I was 22 just out of Grad school and </v>
<v Speaker 10>I found out that I had stage four </v>

490
00:27:46.561 --> 00:27:48.240
<v Speaker 10>melanoma.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So lungs,</v>

491
00:27:48.241 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 10>lymph nodes and brain.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Pretty much as a,</v>

492
00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:52.830
<v Speaker 10>I was a child.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I didn't even know what life was like at</v>

493
00:27:52.831 --> 00:27:54.010
<v Speaker 10>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

494
00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.610
<v Speaker 10>every single conventional therapy for </v>
<v Speaker 10>melanoma,</v>

495
00:27:56.611 --> 00:27:58.170
<v Speaker 10>like doctor Alison said,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

496
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.450
<v Speaker 10>not very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It was a death sentence at the time.</v>

497
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:02.310
<v Speaker 10>We tried it all,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

498
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:07.730
<v Speaker 10>until I was offered a clinical trial for</v>
<v Speaker 10>an immunotherapy and it worked.</v>

499
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.713
<v Speaker 10>Textbook,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I got one round of treatment and I had </v>

500
00:28:12.361 --> 00:28:13.194
<v Speaker 10>been in remission ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I was diagnosed in 2004 in remission </v>

501
00:28:16.651 --> 00:28:19.530
<v Speaker 10>since 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 10>2018</v>

502
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:25.370
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible]</v>

503
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.690
<v Speaker 1>that must be very important to you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

504
00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.940
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was weird at first.</v>

505
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.680
<v Speaker 9>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that happened in the,</v>

506
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:35.620
<v Speaker 9>told me that tumor free and I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I dunno,</v>

507
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.020
<v Speaker 9>I cried a lot along with her along with </v>
<v Speaker 9>her.</v>

508
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.943
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

509
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.470
<v Speaker 9>that was 14 years ago.</v>

510
00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's turn to the physics prize because </v>

511
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:46.893
<v Speaker 1>that's also had some medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>applications and a professor Don </v>

512
00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.813
<v Speaker 1>Strickland and Sherif and the WHO along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Arthur Ashkan who couldn't be with </v>

513
00:28:54.491 --> 00:28:57.520
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he is in fact the oldest Nobel prize</v>

514
00:28:57.521 --> 00:29:01.420
<v Speaker 1>recipient at 96 by some measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk in a moment,</v>

515
00:29:01.421 --> 00:29:02.390
<v Speaker 1>but let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

516
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.900
<v Speaker 1>look at what you won the prize for</v>

517
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.903
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] and Donna Strickland pave </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way for the highest intensity laser </v>

518
00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:12.684
<v Speaker 5>beams ever created.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their optical pulse technique is now </v>

519
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 5>used in millions of corrective eye </v>
<v Speaker 5>surgeries every year.</v>

520
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:20.663
<v Speaker 5>And in many of the industrial and </v>
<v Speaker 5>medical applications off the Ashkin </v>

521
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.153
<v Speaker 5>created optical tweezers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>precision tools that enables scientists </v>

522
00:29:29.821 --> 00:29:34.200
<v Speaker 5>to grab tiny living cells in laser beams</v>
<v Speaker 5>without harming them.</v>

523
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:35.483
<v Speaker 5>His work has transformed the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>researchers are able to study </v>

524
00:29:37.951 --> 00:29:39.330
<v Speaker 5>microscopic life.</v>

525
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.570
<v Speaker 10>So Donna's strickland along with your </v>
<v Speaker 10>supervisor,</v>

526
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.920
<v Speaker 10>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 10>nothing wrong.</v>

527
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.410
<v Speaker 10>She's telling the tables,</v>
<v Speaker 10>maybe,</v>

528
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:53.830
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>

529
00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.910
<v Speaker 10>you,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you one half of the price dot ostrich.</v>

530
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:56.803
<v Speaker 10>And you said you saw your first laser at</v>
<v Speaker 10>the age of 10 and it was love at first </v>

531
00:30:00.241 --> 00:30:04.890
<v Speaker 10>sight and there were many societal </v>
<v Speaker 10>applications for your work,</v>

532
00:30:04.891 --> 00:30:08.100
<v Speaker 10>but you're a great advocate of science </v>
<v Speaker 10>for science sake,</v>

533
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.993
<v Speaker 10>aren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 10>Why?</v>

534
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.103
<v Speaker 10>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean there are now applications of </v>

535
00:30:11.941 --> 00:30:12.774
<v Speaker 10>what Gerard and I did,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but at the time we were trying to do </v>

536
00:30:15.091 --> 00:30:17.370
<v Speaker 10>pretty basic atomic physics with our </v>
<v Speaker 10>laser.</v>

537
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.970
<v Speaker 10>And we also knew that when we changed </v>
<v Speaker 10>the laser,</v>

538
00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:25.620
<v Speaker 10>a intensity by orders of magnitude,</v>
<v Speaker 10>it would change how light interacts with</v>

539
00:30:25.621 --> 00:30:29.220
<v Speaker 10>matter and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>but we couldn't exactly tell how it will</v>

540
00:30:29.221 --> 00:30:30.054
<v Speaker 10>change.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But we knew that it had to change </v>

541
00:30:31.531 --> 00:30:34.200
<v Speaker 10>because we were going to be beating </v>
<v Speaker 10>those atoms to death.</v>

542
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.150
<v Speaker 10>So,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

543
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:38.700
<v Speaker 10>but,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and then down the road,</v>

544
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:39.563
<v Speaker 10>that leads to discovery and innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But my big thing is that we have to </v>

545
00:30:43.411 --> 00:30:44.244
<v Speaker 10>remember to always try to push for </v>
<v Speaker 10>fundamental science because without </v>

546
00:30:48.061 --> 00:30:49.530
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>
<v Speaker 10>20 years down the road,</v>

547
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.573
<v Speaker 10>there can't be more innovations if we </v>
<v Speaker 10>don't keep trying to understand the </v>

548
00:30:53.281 --> 00:30:54.114
<v Speaker 10>world up to a very small level.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Do you would agree with that or is the </v>

549
00:30:56.971 --> 00:30:59.430
<v Speaker 10>most useful science?</v>
<v Speaker 10>The best science.</v>

550
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.403
<v Speaker 3>I'll see if I can buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you said in my case it okay </v>

551
00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:04.643
<v Speaker 3>from basic science to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to understand how t cells </v>

552
00:31:06.601 --> 00:31:09.210
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if somebody had just said,</v>

553
00:31:09.211 --> 00:31:10.320
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to kill too much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

554
00:31:10.321 --> 00:31:12.540
<v Speaker 3>they would have found another way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing on him,</v>

555
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:14.580
<v Speaker 3>but they wouldn't have discovered that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a part,</v>

556
00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:17.190
<v Speaker 3>it's part of the take the brakes off and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they'll,</v>

557
00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.113
<v Speaker 3>they'll do their job.</v>

558
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.233
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take a slightly different view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like this notion of </v>

559
00:31:20.951 --> 00:31:21.784
<v Speaker 2>diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you need a lot of different </v>

560
00:31:22.961 --> 00:31:25.930
<v Speaker 2>kinds of activities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which are very problem focused,</v>

561
00:31:25.931 --> 00:31:30.520
<v Speaker 2>some of which are very basics basic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we say is that,</v>

562
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

563
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.950
<v Speaker 2>thermodynamics did I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

564
00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:34.813
<v Speaker 2>if a steam engine did more for </v>
<v Speaker 2>thermodynamics then thermo dynamics did </v>

565
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:40.024
<v Speaker 2>for the steam engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes it's not the basic science </v>

566
00:31:42.101 --> 00:31:42.934
<v Speaker 2>that comes first.</v>

567
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:44.203
<v Speaker 10>If you go to view on this science for </v>
<v Speaker 10>science sake or the best science is the </v>

568
00:31:46.131 --> 00:31:47.720
<v Speaker 10>most useful.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

569
00:31:47.721 --> 00:31:48.201
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>

570
00:31:48.201 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 10>I</v>

571
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.860
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that the best,</v>

572
00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.560
<v Speaker 2>the best science is the most useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

573
00:31:54.561 --> 00:31:55.394
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

574
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would analogize,</v>

575
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation,</v>

576
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the phages that I work with,</v>

577
00:32:02.211 --> 00:32:05.650
<v Speaker 2>which infect promiscuously and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

578
00:32:05.651 --> 00:32:07.430
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cells that they,</v>

579
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:08.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>

580
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.310
<v Speaker 2>that they effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

581
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can recombine with each other,</v>

582
00:32:12.921 --> 00:32:16.880
<v Speaker 2>make new versions that go on to infect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think ideas,</v>

583
00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

584
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.480
<v Speaker 2>intellectual progress is like that as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

585
00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.810
<v Speaker 10>The applied science steals from the </v>
<v Speaker 10>basic science.</v>

586
00:32:23.811 --> 00:32:24.644
<v Speaker 10>All the tools that we use in applied </v>
<v Speaker 10>science to solve a problem were </v>

587
00:32:28.731 --> 00:32:33.731
<v Speaker 10>developed by basic scientists so that </v>
<v Speaker 10>you cannot have one without the other.</v>

588
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.450
<v Speaker 10>And basic science goes backs and you use</v>
<v Speaker 10>the new tools that come along.</v>

589
00:32:38.451 --> 00:32:40.020
<v Speaker 10>So it's a back,</v>
<v Speaker 10>back,</v>

590
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.343
<v Speaker 7>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's not always the basic becomes </v>

591
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:43.321
<v Speaker 7>hers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

592
00:32:43.321 --> 00:32:44.154
<v Speaker 7>I remember the steam engine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I think I know said it goes back and </v>

593
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:50.090
<v Speaker 7>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but some donor said,</v>

594
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:50.953
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to create $100 million prize </v>
<v Speaker 7>to come up with a vaccine that's </v>

595
00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:55.460
<v Speaker 7>effective against malaria.</v>

596
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:56.813
<v Speaker 2>Would that be a bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you all talking about life </v>

597
00:32:59.491 --> 00:33:04.491
<v Speaker 2>science and this is where I think we </v>
<v Speaker 2>differ because for me,</v>

598
00:33:06.031 --> 00:33:10.230
<v Speaker 2>from a life life science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not very fundamental science</v>

599
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:16.830
<v Speaker 8>steam engine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We did $100 million</v>

600
00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.800
<v Speaker 7>to develop a vaccine for blurry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get a vaccine for malaria maybe,</v>

601
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.200
<v Speaker 7>but you won't learn anything about how </v>
<v Speaker 7>to treat cancer.</v>

602
00:33:26.201 --> 00:33:28.330
<v Speaker 7>You'll not true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not true.</v>

603
00:33:28.331 --> 00:33:29.164
<v Speaker 7>When pastor was trying to solve the </v>
<v Speaker 7>problem of just how do you carry food </v>

604
00:33:31.691 --> 00:33:35.410
<v Speaker 7>for the French army that doesn't spoil,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he invents microbiology.</v>

605
00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:41.110
<v Speaker 7>Evolution is a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No one knows how to design an enzyme,</v>

606
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:42.243
<v Speaker 7>but evolution finds the solutions and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then we reverse engineer the solutions </v>

607
00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:50.860
<v Speaker 7>that work in order to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 7>basic principles.</v>

608
00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.620
<v Speaker 7>So in that example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're exactly right.</v>

609
00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:58.890
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be a diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we are in a very primitive stage,</v>

610
00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:03.140
<v Speaker 2>so we don't know where the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bill goodies,</v>

611
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know which direction you go,</v>

612
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 2>you get something great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that happens,</v>

613
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.620
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at this stage I think all we have to</v>

614
00:34:15.621 --> 00:34:20.621
<v Speaker 2>do is dig many places and somebody get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the goals.</v>

615
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:25.100
<v Speaker 2>Somebody hit something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I have to think,</v>

616
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:30.240
<v Speaker 6>I just want to reemphasize this in these</v>
<v Speaker 6>points in terms of science policy,</v>

617
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:32.663
<v Speaker 6>cause often the other people who paid </v>
<v Speaker 6>ours as far as science ask us to do </v>

618
00:34:36.781 --> 00:34:39.630
<v Speaker 6>applied science.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They say what is the application?</v>

619
00:34:39.631 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 6>What is the use of this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you're doing something that isn't</v>

620
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:45.600
<v Speaker 6>obviously useful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then it's more difficult.</v>

621
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.463
<v Speaker 6>It's not just an individual project but </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't have in terms of this whole </v>

622
00:34:49.021 --> 00:34:51.990
<v Speaker 6>streams there we need streams and </v>
<v Speaker 6>different areas.</v>

623
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:53.243
<v Speaker 6>And there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this story that may or may not </v>

624
00:34:55.801 --> 00:34:58.740
<v Speaker 6>be true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when Queen Victoria visited fair day</v>

625
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:02.290
<v Speaker 6>in the laboratory and said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

626
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:06.720
<v Speaker 6>what is the use of electricity and which</v>
<v Speaker 6>is like a stunning,</v>

627
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.240
<v Speaker 6>stunning question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he said,</v>

628
00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.540
<v Speaker 6>madam,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someday you will tax it.</v>

629
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.170
<v Speaker 8>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which may or may not be true.</v>

630
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:22.430
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible] how difficult it is.</v>

631
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.710
<v Speaker 6>4:00</v>
<v Speaker 6>AM fundamentally difficult.</v>

632
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.320
<v Speaker 6>As all of you been saying to forecast </v>
<v Speaker 6>what direction the science,</v>

633
00:35:29.321 --> 00:35:30.980
<v Speaker 6>what we were talking there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Michael Faraday,</v>

634
00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:32.800
<v Speaker 6>the British scientist in the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 6>century.</v>

635
00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:33.813
<v Speaker 6>Donna,</v>

636
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 2>I think the point I was trying to is</v>

637
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.053
<v Speaker 10>that if somebody came to me and said </v>
<v Speaker 10>what we need is a better tool to cut an </v>

638
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:45.543
<v Speaker 10>eyeball back in 1985 until we understood</v>
<v Speaker 10>that the work that we did actually </v>

639
00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:54.330
<v Speaker 10>change how we understand that the Adam </v>
<v Speaker 10>and the light sees each other,</v>

640
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:55.523
<v Speaker 10>we would have always stayed a thermal </v>
<v Speaker 10>process cause it was the only way we </v>

641
00:35:57.661 --> 00:36:00.420
<v Speaker 10>understood it and now it's not a thermal</v>
<v Speaker 10>process.</v>

642
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.523
<v Speaker 10>And so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 10>you can ask for someone to have a </v>

643
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:07.710
<v Speaker 10>cutting tool but we couldn't have come </v>
<v Speaker 10>up with it from being asked to do it.</v>

644
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:08.820
<v Speaker 10>At least this would not have been the</v>

645
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:09.683
<v Speaker 1>where do you have one by accident and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe relate the story cause laser eye </v>

646
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:12.924
<v Speaker 1>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was cited in your prize has been </v>

647
00:36:16.021 --> 00:36:19.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the benefits along with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to tackle um,</v>

648
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.603
<v Speaker 1>space debris as well as nuclear waste </v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing its radioactive properties by </v>

649
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.750
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it came about my accident.</v>

650
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:31.110
<v Speaker 1>And that was in Gerard's love though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not mine.</v>

651
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.720
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we,</v>

652
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are talking about,</v>

653
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.013
<v Speaker 2>yes we will doing fundamental science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's trying to understand the </v>

654
00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:46.440
<v Speaker 2>interaction [inaudible] light if matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

655
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Which is very complicated things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

656
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.810
<v Speaker 2>and when my students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

657
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alignings are laser,</v>

658
00:36:53.481 --> 00:36:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I've got the laser in his is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we took it,</v>

659
00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

660
00:36:57.151 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the ophthalmologists,</v>

661
00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.590
<v Speaker 2>look at the look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

662
00:37:00.591 --> 00:37:02.050
<v Speaker 2>the students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

663
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.230
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just tonight.</v>

664
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.760
<v Speaker 2>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

665
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:11.150
<v Speaker 2>you got heat with the laser and did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what kind of lazy or do you have?</v>

666
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.100
<v Speaker 2>And the students said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

667
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:14.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are asking me these questions and </v>

668
00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:17.910
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

669
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:22.910
<v Speaker 2>because you damage is perfect and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have millions of people each year,</v>

670
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>

671
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fixed by the femtosecond laser.</v>

672
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.680
<v Speaker 1>So Don Strickland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>

673
00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 1>your approach to pure fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>science was actually very useful.</v>

674
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

675
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:37.640
<v Speaker 10>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But it took 10.</v>

676
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:39.580
<v Speaker 10>It's a 10 year gap there.</v>
<v Speaker 10>That's a,</v>

677
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.980
<v Speaker 10>that's what I'm saying is that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 10>necessarily hope first of an application</v>

678
00:37:42.981 --> 00:37:43.814
<v Speaker 10>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And I'm not saying that I don't agree </v>

679
00:37:45.951 --> 00:37:46.784
<v Speaker 10>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can come at it from all sides and </v>

680
00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:50.000
<v Speaker 10>you have to have everybody working on </v>
<v Speaker 10>all levels of it.</v>

681
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.073
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But sometimes I get a little frustrated </v>

682
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.163
<v Speaker 10>that the science that just doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 10>an absolute application seeing down the </v>

683
00:37:57.981 --> 00:37:58.814
<v Speaker 10>road does not ever get the million </v>
<v Speaker 10>dollar funding and baby or it'd be nice </v>

684
00:38:02.211 --> 00:38:06.320
<v Speaker 10>if people would just sometimes say,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I have $1 million for you to do whatever</v>

685
00:38:06.321 --> 00:38:07.670
<v Speaker 10>the heck you might want to do.</v>

686
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:14.080
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible]</v>

687
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:15.703
<v Speaker 1>don't a switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been much remarked upon that </v>

688
00:38:17.091 --> 00:38:17.924
<v Speaker 1>your the third one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third ever female physicist to win </v>

689
00:38:21.501 --> 00:38:25.220
<v Speaker 1>the Nobel Prize and the first in 55 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

690
00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:30.580
<v Speaker 1>And you have talked about an implicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias against female scientists,</v>

691
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:32.210
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were told,</v>

692
00:38:32.211 --> 00:38:34.170
<v Speaker 1>won't you when you were interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and math,</v>

693
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 1>these are boys subjects.</v>

694
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.023
<v Speaker 10>I was told by a high school teacher that</v>
<v Speaker 10>at some point and I was stunned and I </v>

695
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 10>thought that was such a ridiculous thing</v>
<v Speaker 10>to say that.</v>

696
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:44.884
<v Speaker 10>And I couldn't say that to a teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 10>So I turned to my friend who was a male </v>

697
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:49.050
<v Speaker 10>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 10>do you know you're into girls subjects?</v>

698
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Because he was so good at English</v>

699
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:54.043
<v Speaker 10>starting at,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think most institutions to understand </v>

700
00:38:56.451 --> 00:39:01.280
<v Speaker 10>and be taught about implicit bias and </v>
<v Speaker 10>the fact that you might not think you're</v>

701
00:39:01.281 --> 00:39:03.770
<v Speaker 10>prejudice scans one type of thing or </v>
<v Speaker 10>another,</v>

702
00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:04.873
<v Speaker 10>but that somehow your background ideas </v>
<v Speaker 10>coming into play and that you have to </v>

703
00:39:08.691 --> 00:39:11.060
<v Speaker 10>learn to get around that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And so I think with effort,</v>

704
00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:12.163
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>things keep changing and I'm sure it </v>

705
00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:14.860
<v Speaker 10>won't be another 55</v>

706
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.323
<v Speaker 1>pharmacists on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean wonder if you would want to </v>

707
00:39:17.751 --> 00:39:19.490
<v Speaker 1>comment on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is,</v>

708
00:39:19.491 --> 00:39:20.324
<v Speaker 1>if you just look at overall 95% of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobel prices since it was started in </v>

709
00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:29.300
<v Speaker 1>1901 have been won by men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that because,</v>

710
00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.590
<v Speaker 1>do you think the women are doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and not being recognized or they're</v>

711
00:39:33.591 --> 00:39:38.090
<v Speaker 1>just not being encouraged in sufficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers to go into sciences?</v>

712
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>

713
00:39:39.111 --> 00:39:42.020
<v Speaker 1>of course the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers were very low and that,</v>

714
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.100
<v Speaker 1>that is certainly reflected in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dearth of women.</v>

715
00:39:46.101 --> 00:39:46.934
<v Speaker 1>Women winning Nobel prizes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I agree with Donna that's going to </v>

716
00:39:50.061 --> 00:39:50.894
<v Speaker 1>change and it's going to change fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>because women are doing science at the </v>

717
00:39:53.901 --> 00:39:58.070
<v Speaker 1>highest levels and they make up 50% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most brilliant minds.</v>

718
00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing science now.</v>

719
00:40:00.771 --> 00:40:01.604
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to a much better </v>

720
00:40:03.441 --> 00:40:07.520
<v Speaker 1>future professor Mobley actually your </v>
<v Speaker 1>supervisor,</v>

721
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.880
<v Speaker 1>not only was your student a female then </v>
<v Speaker 1>shares the prize with you,</v>

722
00:40:10.881 --> 00:40:11.760
<v Speaker 1>but you a supervisor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

723
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.150
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

724
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.023
<v Speaker 2>At that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think anything wrong about it </v>

725
00:40:17.701 --> 00:40:18.534
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are the body because that may be </v>

726
00:40:20.641 --> 00:40:22.090
<v Speaker 2>because of French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

727
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:26.940
<v Speaker 2>I think we have historically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

728
00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:28.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always accepted woman.</v>

729
00:40:28.591 --> 00:40:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean you see Mary [inaudible] for </v>
<v Speaker 2>instance.</v>

730
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.390
<v Speaker 2>No ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

731
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.320
<v Speaker 2>And usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

732
00:40:34.321 --> 00:40:36.930
<v Speaker 2>when we were going to a meeting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>conference,</v>

733
00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.120
<v Speaker 2>you were saying you were seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist and often,</v>

734
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:43.680
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often you know,</v>

735
00:40:43.681 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a French,</v>

736
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you saw a woman first,</v>

737
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:51.150
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In our field they were French.</v>

738
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.110
<v Speaker 2>But it's changing fast and part because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the biological sciences,</v>

739
00:40:55.111 --> 00:40:58.240
<v Speaker 2>at least over half the students now are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are women.</v>

740
00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:00.410
<v Speaker 1>I think in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the magical horse field,</v>

741
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.303
<v Speaker 1>certainly doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Harvard or even more than worry </v>

742
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:10.030
<v Speaker 1>about why men don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

743
00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.073
<v Speaker 1>come to the end of this discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to ask you all and you've </v>

744
00:41:14.691 --> 00:41:15.524
<v Speaker 1>reached what some regard is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate accolade receiving a Nobel </v>

745
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:21.300
<v Speaker 1>prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

746
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.700
<v Speaker 1>what next</v>

747
00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.320
<v Speaker 2>George Smith?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

748
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:30.380
<v Speaker 2>well I'm retired so I bought long since </v>
<v Speaker 2>a thought of what next.</v>

749
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I took a couple of months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

750
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 2>retirement from my retirement just now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

751
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.553
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

752
00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:40.551
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

753
00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:43.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first one thing that's next is I have to</v>

754
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:45.913
<v Speaker 2>learn that I don't know everything the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way a Nobel prize laureates are </v>

755
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:54.520
<v Speaker 2>encouraged to think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

756
00:41:54.521 --> 00:41:56.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my future is,</v>

757
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really not specifically in science,</v>

758
00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:03.800
<v Speaker 2>but maybe in political activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

759
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:06.501
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

760
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:10.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anything is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change because,</v>

761
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:14.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I like is I science and so it's not</v>

762
00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:17.960
<v Speaker 2>because I get his Nobel prize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to change my habits.</v>

763
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.633
<v Speaker 2>I think on the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to do it better </v>

764
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:25.160
<v Speaker 2>because now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

765
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.270
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

766
00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone with another advisor speaks,</v>

767
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 2>people listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

769
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:33.403
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going try to do the same thing but </v>

770
00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:39.120
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know what else,</v>

771
00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:40.653
<v Speaker 2>what next?</v>

772
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:42.671
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'll,</v>

773
00:42:42.671 --> 00:42:45.740
<v Speaker 3>I'll continue to work on the things I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked on recently,</v>

774
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:46.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>

775
00:42:46.641 --> 00:42:48.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climate change.</v>

776
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.520
<v Speaker 3>But actually I began working in much the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same area.</v>

777
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.373
<v Speaker 3>Paul Romer did his work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was on technology and technology </v>

778
00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:56.900
<v Speaker 3>has brought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been miracles.</v>

779
00:42:56.901 --> 00:43:00.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're living here rather than in </v>
<v Speaker 3>caves because of technology,</v>

780
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.393
<v Speaker 3>but just as economic growth has side </v>
<v Speaker 3>effects that dark side effects like </v>

781
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.043
<v Speaker 3>climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also think technology has dark sides </v>

782
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:14.000
<v Speaker 3>and I particularly am concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 3>its dark side on our institutions,</v>

783
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:17.000
<v Speaker 3>on our democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm particularly concerned about the</v>

784
00:43:17.001 --> 00:43:19.850
<v Speaker 3>role of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like facebook on a,</v>

785
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:23.320
<v Speaker 3>on our institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

786
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:27.500
<v Speaker 3>I think we've shown now that we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>cure some patients with cancer.</v>

787
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Speaker 3>I have the goal of trying to get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

788
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 3>It's close to a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I possibly can.</v>

789
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:33.801
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

790
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:34.634
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as many different kinds of cancers </v>

791
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:36.590
<v Speaker 3>rehab.</v>

792
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:41.590
<v Speaker 3>And I'm hoping it to the prize again </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'll give me out a bit of a soapbox</v>

793
00:43:42.801 --> 00:43:44.660
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's shown that immunotherapy works,</v>

794
00:43:44.661 --> 00:43:45.494
<v Speaker 3>which everybody was skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're up at four and hopefully they'll </v>

795
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.840
<v Speaker 3>help bring more funding and help us get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the work done,</v>

796
00:43:50.841 --> 00:43:54.980
<v Speaker 3>but also to other things that may not be</v>
<v Speaker 3>so obvious when I missed to,</v>

797
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:58.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let patients have hope that they're,</v>

798
00:43:58.731 --> 00:43:59.564
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>death through the diagnosis of cancer </v>

799
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 3>isn't necessarily a death sentence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

800
00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:05.240
<v Speaker 3>they could actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some at least can be,</v>

801
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.610
<v Speaker 3>can be cured and the sec and the final </v>
<v Speaker 3>one is did I think,</v>

802
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:09.523
<v Speaker 3>I hope that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pros will inspire more patients to </v>

803
00:44:14.211 --> 00:44:18.110
<v Speaker 3>participate in clinical trials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which will help us progress faster.</v>

804
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Professor task you Andrea.</v>

805
00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

806
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:27.410
<v Speaker 2>so I know actually to doings one is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the Nobel prize,</v>

807
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 2>but the other one is the age shoot</v>

808
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:37.220
<v Speaker 1>in my golf game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

809
00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well after this week,</v>

810
00:44:40.001 --> 00:44:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I have to say my immediate goal is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some sleep.</v>

811
00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:45.993
<v Speaker 1>But I'm very excited about the future of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution and how I have one good idea </v>

812
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:54.820
<v Speaker 1>in the 1980s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've worked at ever since.</v>

813
00:44:54.821 --> 00:44:59.650
<v Speaker 1>But there is such amazing things that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can use to move into the future.</v>

814
00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:00.723
<v Speaker 1>And the combination with machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning and artificial intelligence is </v>

815
00:45:04.121 --> 00:45:08.020
<v Speaker 1>a frontier that I'm going to ride to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next level.</v>

816
00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't have strickland.</v>

817
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:10.280
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

818
00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.113
<v Speaker 10>I have to say that my life has been </v>
<v Speaker 10>turned upside down because of a Nobel </v>

819
00:45:13.371 --> 00:45:17.030
<v Speaker 10>prize and everybody wants to hear from a</v>
<v Speaker 10>Nobel price.</v>

820
00:45:17.031 --> 00:45:19.400
<v Speaker 10>So I'm already booking into 2020 at this</v>
<v Speaker 10>point.</v>

821
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:23.060
<v Speaker 10>But I agree with George that some,</v>
<v Speaker 10>some of the people that actually want to</v>

822
00:45:23.061 --> 00:45:25.340
<v Speaker 10>hear from you all of a sudden are the </v>
<v Speaker 10>politicians.</v>

823
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.910
<v Speaker 10>And I do have some public policy work </v>
<v Speaker 10>that is not about my own research,</v>

824
00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:31.850
<v Speaker 10>but about photonix in general and how </v>
<v Speaker 10>important it is.</v>

825
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:34.880
<v Speaker 10>And A,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I'm getting that opportunity to speak to</v>

826
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:36.640
<v Speaker 10>government leaders and,</v>
<v Speaker 10>and uh,</v>

827
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:38.960
<v Speaker 10>try to explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>And in particular,</v>

828
00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.053
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we think photonix has a huge role to </v>

829
00:45:41.481 --> 00:45:44.450
<v Speaker 10>play in environmental measurement and </v>
<v Speaker 10>monitoring.</v>

830
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.570
<v Speaker 10>So we can try to do all these things for</v>
<v Speaker 10>clever control,</v>

831
00:45:47.571 --> 00:45:48.950
<v Speaker 10>but we have to know that we've done </v>
<v Speaker 10>them.</v>

832
00:45:48.951 --> 00:45:51.350
<v Speaker 10>And so we think photonix has a huge role</v>
<v Speaker 10>for that.</v>

833
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.513
<v Speaker 10>And so that's one of the things that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 10>out there pushing in public policy and </v>

834
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:56.743
<v Speaker 10>poor Roman,</v>

835
00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.280
<v Speaker 4>we get to bring 14 people to the events </v>
<v Speaker 4>here at the Nobel,</v>

836
00:46:00.281 --> 00:46:01.114
<v Speaker 4>the ceremony and I brought along </v>
<v Speaker 4>Professor Caroline Webber and her </v>

<v Speaker 4>phones,</v>

840
00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:21.480
