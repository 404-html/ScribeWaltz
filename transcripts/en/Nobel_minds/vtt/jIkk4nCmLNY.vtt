<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Zina Berdahl.</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.903
<v Speaker 1>We welcome to the concert hall here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stockholm where this year's Nobel </v>

3
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>laureates received their awards from His</v>
<v Speaker 1>Majesty,</v>

4
00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:14.020
<v Speaker 1>the King of Sweden for the outstanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributions to literature,</v>

5
00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and science.</v>

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.593
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time that they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been brought together in discussion on </v>

7
00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:23.080
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're also joined in the audience by</v>

8
00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>some of their family and friends who've </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveled here to be with them as well as</v>

9
00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>students from Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to this year's Nobel mines,</v>

10
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Nobel laureates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to you all and congratulations.</v>

11
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.700
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

12
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you will one your Nobel prizes because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>you are these very rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical beings or you have great clarity</v>

14
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>of thought in your novels and in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic work and so on.</v>

15
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:20.624
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.573
<v Speaker 1>do you really act very rationally with </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight logic in your personal lives of </v>

17
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 1>John when you're nodding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has handwritten?</v>

18
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you obviously do.</v>

19
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

20
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I 100% rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>

21
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>very occasionally we have to step </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside that circle.</v>

22
00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:40.384
<v Speaker 1>So the one little memory I have is a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of equipment that was being </v>

23
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only had access to it before atm.</v>

24
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I come in very early to try and use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get it to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried everything,</v>

26
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.410
<v Speaker 1>unplugged this sampling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So eventually I said,</v>

27
00:01:56.411 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll just have to go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I drive one final thing,</v>

28
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>give it a kick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kicked it,</v>

29
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>it sprang into life.</v>

30
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>And there was a loose wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was my,</v>

31
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let us see you.</v>

32
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get around the tube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:02:08.081 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>and just get a quick quip from all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

34
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Think you're lagging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank.</v>

35
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

36
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an earthquake in Pasadena in 1970.</v>

37
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened at six o'clock.</v>

38
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:18.094
<v Speaker 1>I was asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went at immediate jump out of the bed </v>

39
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.143
<v Speaker 1>and went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the toilet and flush the toilet </v>

40
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>immediately as it kind of reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a reflex.</v>

41
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>We won't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

42
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I can do both Shay and the third of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemistry lab,</v>

43
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:37.304
<v Speaker 1>we'll know the word falsification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation of the rationality of a </v>

44
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 1>scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a good idea,</v>

45
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.933
<v Speaker 1>you have to prove that it is wrong until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have tried everything and then you </v>

46
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 1>have proven the idea that I'm very </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational.</v>

47
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I tried to show that my id is right and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes push a bit too far.</v>

48
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thorn,</v>

49
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the physics laureates,</v>

50
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.680
<v Speaker 3>my greatest insights come in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the night and I'm sound asleep.</v>

51
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.690
<v Speaker 3>It's not rational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it happens,</v>

52
00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:16.230
<v Speaker 3>but my mind somehow irrationally throws </v>
<v Speaker 3>things together.</v>

53
00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:17.064
<v Speaker 3>I go write down notes in the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make up the next morning and believe it </v>

54
00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:24.870
<v Speaker 3>or not a third of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

55
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.270
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea where it came from.</v>

56
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>That sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

57
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>So serendipity I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.931
<v Speaker 1>Ray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice,</v>

59
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>you ever done anything completely crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational things?</v>

60
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I think the most important one was I </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell in love at night</v>

61
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 3>teen when chasing a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Chicago,</v>

62
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.153
<v Speaker 3>and it was the end of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I flunked out and then I eventually got </v>

63
00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:49.220
<v Speaker 3>back into that gallery it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

64
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:50.054
<v Speaker 3>Back then might I flunked out of mit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>back after that I came to and I got a </v>

65
00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:55.970
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that job made my career.</v>

66
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.370
<v Speaker 3>The education wasn't worth a damn.</v>

67
00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.723
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we'll come back onto that kind of </v>

68
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>theme later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barry Barish,</v>

69
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.623
<v Speaker 1>another of the physics lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became a physicist and shuttle the </v>

70
00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:07.500
<v Speaker 1>irrational way it was to decide not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a chemist,</v>

71
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.720
<v Speaker 1>not to be an engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not to be a writer.</v>

72
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.450
<v Speaker 1>In the last bluff was my freshman </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics class.</v>

73
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.083
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to jump out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave you out just for a moment because </v>

74
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:17.034
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna come to you because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about your economic </v>

75
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:18.671
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

76
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medicine laureates might young.</v>

77
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so choosing to be a scientist is,</v>

78
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't say it's irrational,</v>

79
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.903
<v Speaker 4>but it does come with a lot of risk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got lots of advice from people </v>

80
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 4>that were close to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When am I going to get a job?</v>

81
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

82
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 4>when are you going to choose something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

83
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's understandable,</v>

84
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the outside word world that has,</v>

85
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:44.044
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a simple track forward that you can be </v>

86
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 4>sure to support yourself and such and </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a way.</v>

87
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 4>So there's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a very important component.</v>

88
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:53.734
<v Speaker 4>There's an emotional component.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And choosing to take risks and become a </v>

89
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 4>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Ross Fash so,</v>

90
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:01.160
<v Speaker 4>so I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

91
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in order,</v>

92
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a,</v>

93
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.733
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a self destructive temper as a young </v>

94
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not very rational.</v>

95
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a sports fan,</v>

96
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not very rational.</v>

97
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

98
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the concept of risk taking is,</v>

99
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 4>is actually has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has a deep biological basis.</v>

100
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.370
<v Speaker 4>But of course people like taking risks </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a,</v>

101
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 4>that has an upside of course is as Mike </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentioned,</v>

102
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 4>but it's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it also can be destructive.</v>

103
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.700
<v Speaker 1>You seem very benign now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've lost the temper.</v>

104
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Have you the self destructive 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

105
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.191
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm most of the time under control </v>
<v Speaker 1>check,</v>

107
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.540
<v Speaker 1>progress work in regards their work in </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

108
00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:48.170
<v Speaker 1>What about pants and fellow to my right </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I worked together.</v>

109
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.400
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name escapes me.</v>

110
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.830
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

111
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up</v>

112
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 4>a number of times with</v>

113
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 5>labored pieces of poor royale public </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior.</v>

114
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.543
<v Speaker 5>We thought our strengths were hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure that everybody else in our </v>

115
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:12.180
<v Speaker 5>midst did do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we couldn't help her.</v>

116
00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:12.741
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

117
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:13.311
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

118
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:14.144
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can I see the sugar out literature </v>

119
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:16.664
<v Speaker 5>laureate?</v>

120
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.783
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever done anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm completely crazy that you look </v>

121
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.620
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess my wife and I,</v>

122
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.483
<v Speaker 1>we have a dodge connection is soft toys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we pretend still belong to our </v>

123
00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:27.474
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The daughter is 25 now I would have </v>

124
00:06:31.111 --> 00:06:31.944
<v Speaker 1>voices for the mode and they have whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of personal histories and the </v>

125
00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:39.210
<v Speaker 1>relationships between them have </v>
<v Speaker 1>histories.</v>

126
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's verging on the irrational</v>

127
00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:44.400
<v Speaker 1>perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's perfectly reasonable.</v>

128
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

129
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.833
<v Speaker 1>And when I brought out this odyssey fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational versus machinal behavior </v>

130
00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:51.294
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Thaler won the Nobel prize for </v>

131
00:06:54.001 --> 00:06:58.290
<v Speaker 1>your work in behavioral economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm really,</v>

132
00:06:58.291 --> 00:06:59.130
<v Speaker 1>it says that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:06:59.131 --> 00:07:01.010
<v Speaker 1>mainstream economics didn't get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

134
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.910
<v Speaker 1>that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

135
00:07:02.911 --> 00:07:03.744
<v Speaker 1>households don't act in a rational way </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to taking economic </v>

136
00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:09.630
<v Speaker 1>decisions or indeed any other kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

137
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.613
<v Speaker 1>So just explain to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us an overview of what behavioral </v>

138
00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:15.180
<v Speaker 1>economics actually is.</v>

139
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.613
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he really cannot mix is just doing </v>

140
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:24.180
<v Speaker 6>economics that would accommodate all of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the stories that we've</v>

141
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.530
<v Speaker 1>just heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was triggered by a dinner party where</v>

142
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 1>an abode of cashew nuts.</v>

143
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.051
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

144
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I removed a bowl of cashew nuts that it,</v>

145
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was addicting a dinner party.</v>

146
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.060
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

147
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.663
<v Speaker 6>after I came back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone thanked me for removing this </v>

148
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.043
<v Speaker 6>bowl of cashew nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then since it was a group of </v>

149
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:48.074
<v Speaker 6>economists B,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we began to wonder how it was that we </v>

150
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:51.824
<v Speaker 6>could be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Since an axiom of economics is more </v>

151
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 6>choices are always better than less.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

152
00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

153
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 6>that was my apple.</v>

154
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.463
<v Speaker 1>Why did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did they thank you for removing the </v>

155
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:05.820
<v Speaker 1>bowl of cashew?</v>

156
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.310
<v Speaker 6>Because they didn't want to eat anymore</v>

157
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and they had plenty more color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the ball were there,</v>

158
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:14.730
<v Speaker 1>they would have continued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Richard.</v>

159
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people focused on just </v>
<v Speaker 1>one component of your work could,</v>

160
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 1>which is this concept of notch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you wrote a book of course with Cass</v>

161
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.883
<v Speaker 1>Sunstein called nudge and it's about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can be nudged into making better </v>

162
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And David Cameron,</v>

163
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>former British prime minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up a nudge unit and indeed many,</v>

164
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:36.140
<v Speaker 1>many other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

165
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:37.123
<v Speaker 1>followed suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just gives us an idea how does </v>

166
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 1>nudge actually work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it try to set out to do?</v>

167
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

168
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:44.803
<v Speaker 6>a nudge takes into consideration what </v>
<v Speaker 6>our biases are and then tries to </v>

169
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:56.290
<v Speaker 6>introduce small features of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>environment that will adjust them.</v>

170
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.610
<v Speaker 6>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm supposed to,</v>

171
00:09:00.611 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 6>we're worried that this show mike run </v>
<v Speaker 6>over.</v>

172
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then,</v>

173
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.983
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fortunately I set in my phone for the </v>

174
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.753
<v Speaker 6>amount of time we're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when it starts beeping will note to </v>

175
00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 6>end and we won't worry about the risk of</v>
<v Speaker 6>running over.</v>

176
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people I get the message,</v>

177
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.910
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to be,</v>

178
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a little nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can keep going.</v>

179
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:33.860
<v Speaker 1>It'll be beeping to nudge him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've advised governments on nudging,</v>

180
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get policies that,</v>

181
00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:38.780
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get young people like the students</v>

182
00:09:38.781 --> 00:09:39.614
<v Speaker 1>we've got here in the audience to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>up for the old age pensions and to try </v>

183
00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:45.134
<v Speaker 1>to get people to take decisions which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the self interest based on the </v>

184
00:09:48.981 --> 00:09:52.130
<v Speaker 1>fact that people don't always do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

185
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.143
<v Speaker 1>but can we really leave it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians and policy makers and their </v>

186
00:09:56.361 --> 00:10:00.950
<v Speaker 1>advisors such as yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really nudge a person into,</v>

187
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.980
<v Speaker 1>into doing something like that mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it manipulation in some ways?</v>

188
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

189
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.623
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the real point is that we have no </v>

190
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:12.210
<v Speaker 6>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's no alternative to nudging.</v>

191
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.750
<v Speaker 6>The only alternative is bad nudging</v>

192
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.730
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentleman.</v>

193
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.563
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about behavioral </v>

194
00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:20.710
<v Speaker 1>economics and in particular this aspect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

195
00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.533
<v Speaker 1>the concept of nudge with some of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have liked to been nudged or have been </v>

197
00:10:26.081 --> 00:10:30.340
<v Speaker 1>nudged into doing something that avoided</v>
<v Speaker 1>reckless behavior.</v>

198
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:31.923
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to nudge the society into </v>

199
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:36.010
<v Speaker 7>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wonder how you think about this.</v>

200
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.503
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we teach the wrong kind of math to our </v>

201
00:10:39.641 --> 00:10:42.460
<v Speaker 7>kids or you agree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

202
00:10:42.461 --> 00:10:43.930
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

203
00:10:43.931 --> 00:10:47.710
<v Speaker 7>if you want to nudge me into a certain </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing,</v>

204
00:10:47.711 --> 00:10:50.830
<v Speaker 7>I'd like to know the art.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

205
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:54.040
<v Speaker 7>And we don't know how to make art in </v>
<v Speaker 7>high school or grade school.</v>

206
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.820
<v Speaker 7>I would teach it by having them gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

207
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.450
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So that what people know deadly serious.</v>

208
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Well you want a nation of gamblers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

209
00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:04.861
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

210
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:05.940
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

211
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.170
<v Speaker 1>Dahlia jumped too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do the first day.</v>

213
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.260
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

214
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.093
<v Speaker 1>The idea was to use as a mechanism to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn the mathematics and the thinking </v>

215
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:17.350
<v Speaker 1>that goes with probabilistic reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

216
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.773
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are one of the three laureates for </v>

217
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.290
<v Speaker 1>the price in medicine or physiology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

218
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:26.124
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.160
<v Speaker 1>the psychological aspects of economics </v>
<v Speaker 1>in behavioral economics and how the mind</v>

220
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Speaker 1>works and the impact it might have on </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics.</v>

221
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:38.040
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won your prize for,</v>

222
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes the body tick?</v>

223
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our body clock.</v>

224
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>

225
00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:48.981
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just perhaps spell out for</v>
<v Speaker 1>us what we mean by our body clock.</v>

226
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 1>There are many kinds of revealed daily</v>

227
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.280
<v Speaker 5>rhythms that can be observed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>measured rhythms,</v>

228
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.173
<v Speaker 5>but there's longstanding information </v>
<v Speaker 5>from studying a whole variety of </v>

229
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:06.424
<v Speaker 5>different kinds of organisms that these </v>
<v Speaker 5>revealed rhythms are underpinned by </v>

230
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 5>biological clocks.</v>

231
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 8>Michael Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Masha and Mike Young.</v>

232
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.970
<v Speaker 8>It's doing your research on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>on fruit flies.</v>

233
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 8>We discovered that we have these body </v>
<v Speaker 8>clocks.</v>

234
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.133
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're humans as well as all other </v>

235
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:27.310
<v Speaker 8>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And you discover that by isolating genes</v>

236
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 8>in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in fruit flies.</v>

237
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:29.134
<v Speaker 8>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think the fruit fly is featured in so </v>

238
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 8>many Nobel prize experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It deserves its own.</v>

239
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 8>It's a little Nobel prize,</v>
<v Speaker 8>wouldn't you say?</v>

240
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.830
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A little teeny little thing.</v>

241
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Mike Young,</v>

242
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 8>once you discover the components of </v>
<v Speaker 8>these clocks,</v>

243
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:47.140
<v Speaker 8>you can look for them all over the </v>
<v Speaker 8>organism.</v>

244
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.240
<v Speaker 8>And as Jeff and his colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

245
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Speaker 8>showed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

246
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.640
<v Speaker 8>Andrew Sophala,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you find different parts of the work and</v>

247
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.550
<v Speaker 8>the fruit fly,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a fruit fly.</v>

248
00:12:57.551 --> 00:12:58.270
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You've got,</v>

249
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.103
<v Speaker 8>you've got many different body parts </v>
<v Speaker 8>that display these rhythms using these </v>

250
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:05.770
<v Speaker 8>clocks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it's not just behavior,</v>

251
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:08.330
<v Speaker 8>it's many aspects of physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The,</v>

252
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.340
<v Speaker 8>the other thing that became clear was </v>
<v Speaker 8>that you could start with the genes that</v>

253
00:13:13.451 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 8>we found in the fruit fly.</v>

254
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.353
<v Speaker 8>And Lo and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have relatives in all the other </v>

255
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 8>members of the animal kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 8>including us.</v>

256
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.730
<v Speaker 8>So can we ask questions that would help </v>
<v Speaker 8>shift workers?</v>

257
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.573
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people who work in the emergency </v>

258
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:33.451
<v Speaker 8>services deal better with the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>work that they have to do at night.</v>

259
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.743
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>can it help us understand why babies </v>

260
00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Speaker 8>don't sleep during the night?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

261
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 8>I always find that expression at all.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I sleep so well.</v>

262
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:42.574
<v Speaker 8>Just like a baby must've been said by </v>
<v Speaker 8>somebody who was never looked after a </v>

263
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:48.610
<v Speaker 8>baby because we know they don't sleep at</v>
<v Speaker 8>night.</v>

264
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I mean,</v>

265
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:50.891
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>does,</v>

266
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 8>does your work help us understand these </v>
<v Speaker 8>common experiences?</v>

267
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.890
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in many cases what it reveals is there's</v>

268
00:13:56.891 --> 00:14:00.600
<v Speaker 8>much more complexity to what's wrong or,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or,</v>

269
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.240
<v Speaker 8>or what we think we're observing when a </v>
<v Speaker 8>baby's not sleeping,</v>

270
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:06.270
<v Speaker 8>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or take jet lag.</v>

271
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.203
<v Speaker 8>When,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

272
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.030
<v Speaker 8>we go from New York or Boston to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

273
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.433
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>to Stockholm,</v>

274
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.570
<v Speaker 8>what's really going on?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Most of us think,</v>

275
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.460
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in a few days,</v>

276
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.980
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my one body clock,</v>

277
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Speaker 8>we'll get the stock home and until then </v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to be in a state of malaise.</v>

278
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:24.843
<v Speaker 8>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what happens is that since you have </v>

279
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.083
<v Speaker 8>clocks all over your body,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there is disagreement that starts </v>

280
00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:31.744
<v Speaker 8>occurring between the cells in different</v>
<v Speaker 8>parts of your body about what time of </v>

281
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Speaker 8>day is it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so in fact,</v>

282
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:42.190
<v Speaker 8>at the end of a flight from New York to </v>
<v Speaker 8>Stockholm for the next few days,</v>

283
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:43.024
<v Speaker 8>you're really occupying,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your body is occupying multiple time </v>

284
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 8>zones simultaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 8>depending on which clock you look at.</v>

285
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.393
<v Speaker 8>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

286
00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.050
<v Speaker 8>I believe</v>

287
00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 4>your research says that there's good and</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad times during the day where,</v>

288
00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.540
<v Speaker 4>where are we right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it depends.</v>

289
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.960
<v Speaker 4>It depends on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's there's times which,</v>

290
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:12.320
<v Speaker 4>which are more favorable for some things</v>
<v Speaker 4>than others.</v>

291
00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.253
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think what you're alluding to </v>

292
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:15.074
<v Speaker 4>perhaps is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a very successful nap time for </v>

293
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:18.770
<v Speaker 4>exam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example.</v>

294
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.633
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially for gentlemen or ladies our </v>

295
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 4>age around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>around this table where in fact,</v>

296
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 4>who were up late last night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were up very late last night was when</v>

297
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Speaker 4>you received your awards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do it all the festivities and,</v>

298
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.890
<v Speaker 4>and to an astronaut that has no </v>
<v Speaker 4>resetting mechanism,</v>

299
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so aren't the cabins.</v>

300
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.790
<v Speaker 4>And My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my impression was that the,</v>

301
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.840
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cabins have very intense light,</v>

302
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.170
<v Speaker 4>artificial light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark cycles to mimic,</v>

303
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.010
<v Speaker 4>to mimic the external environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty primitive suicide.</v>

304
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.480
<v Speaker 4>Even if they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

305
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 4>Even if they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they weren't constant darkness,</v>

306
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.030
<v Speaker 4>they would show these rhythms and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's fine.</v>

307
00:15:58.031 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how they were originally revealed</v>

308
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 4>in these models.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see if we do often have,</v>

309
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:03.584
<v Speaker 4>the reality is that if you put an </v>
<v Speaker 4>organism into cycles that are different </v>

310
00:16:08.301 --> 00:16:10.220
<v Speaker 4>from a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like seven hours,</v>

311
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:11.054
<v Speaker 4>seven hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

312
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.840
<v Speaker 4>That certain organisms depending on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>organism can synchronize.</v>

313
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the old cult cycles.</v>

314
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.653
<v Speaker 4>But at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're so far away from 24 when you do </v>

315
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:21.730
<v Speaker 4>these tests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they snap.</v>

316
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.763
<v Speaker 1>We know here in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a lot of people do say they </v>

317
00:16:25.001 --> 00:16:27.670
<v Speaker 1>have these lights that lumps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mimic daylight,</v>

318
00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:30.760
<v Speaker 1>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they have such a dark days.</v>

319
00:16:30.761 --> 00:16:31.594
<v Speaker 1>But this time with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of your colleagues working on </v>

320
00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:34.804
<v Speaker 1>the body clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've benefited from the work of our </v>

321
00:16:36.401 --> 00:16:37.720
<v Speaker 1>chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

322
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.643
<v Speaker 1>laureates because of course some </v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman you won your award for </v>

323
00:16:41.021 --> 00:16:44.560
<v Speaker 1>developing a technique called Cryo em,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

324
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:50.010
<v Speaker 1>which for the first time captured images</v>
<v Speaker 1>of molecules that were not visible using</v>

325
00:16:51.101 --> 00:16:52.600
<v Speaker 1>standard techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

326
00:16:52.601 --> 00:16:57.250
<v Speaker 1>we know that the world of molecules is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the core of what we call life.</v>

327
00:16:57.251 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 1>So Richard Anderson in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is Cryo em?</v>

328
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:03.663
<v Speaker 1>I think our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our area of interest and expertise is </v>

329
00:17:06.101 --> 00:17:08.320
<v Speaker 1>the easiest to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this group.</v>

330
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.190
<v Speaker 1>We basically freeze a thin film of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules of life.</v>

331
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Take a picture of it and then you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the picture with your eyes.</v>

332
00:17:15.281 --> 00:17:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It's magnified and you can see all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules.</v>

333
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.400
<v Speaker 1>The computer helps you to interpret what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

334
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.503
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the methodologies are the tools that </v>

335
00:17:25.001 --> 00:17:26.140
<v Speaker 1>were invented by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

336
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.060
<v Speaker 1>the others particularly shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duboce [inaudible].</v>

337
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.580
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we'll go to shank dubois show then.</v>

338
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:36.590
<v Speaker 1>So this tool that enables you to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>these molecules,</v>

339
00:17:36.911 --> 00:17:37.744
<v Speaker 1>I mean its potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its possibilities of how it can help </v>

340
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.210
<v Speaker 1>human endeavor cure illnesses.</v>

341
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 4>We are physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we worked in</v>

342
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:55.730
<v Speaker 9>biology and we get the Nobel prize in </v>
<v Speaker 9>chemistry that confused people please.</v>

343
00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:01.251
<v Speaker 9>He goes because we see atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

344
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.800
<v Speaker 9>with the help of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And when we see atoms we do chemistry.</v>

345
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.060
<v Speaker 9>And chemistry is a very powerful science</v>
<v Speaker 9>because if you have a biological object,</v>

346
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.690
<v Speaker 9>you see how the items are interacting,</v>
<v Speaker 9>one with the other.</v>

347
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.810
<v Speaker 9>You see how Alzheimer filaments are </v>
<v Speaker 9>attach to each other.</v>

348
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.670
<v Speaker 9>Perhaps you see a drug which will </v>
<v Speaker 9>separate the mall,</v>

349
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.820
<v Speaker 9>will prevent them to associate.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You will see anything with,</v>

350
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.350
<v Speaker 9>with,</v>
<v Speaker 9>with uh,</v>

351
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 9>Kevin History.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's an extraordinary power for method.</v>

352
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:42.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

353
00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:43.730
<v Speaker 1>in the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

354
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want your price for?</v>

355
00:18:45.051 --> 00:18:45.884
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the case of the sea can fire is Cryo </v>

356
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.710
<v Speaker 1>e m was used to generate three d images </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the virus,</v>

357
00:18:51.711 --> 00:18:54.080
<v Speaker 1>which meant researchers could try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work out,</v>

358
00:18:54.081 --> 00:18:54.914
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of drugs would help to resist </v>

359
00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.670
<v Speaker 1>the virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance.</v>

360
00:18:58.671 --> 00:19:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you want to pick that up</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joachim Front.</v>

361
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

362
00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Zika is,</v>

363
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.130
<v Speaker 9>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>is a perfect illustration for,</v>

364
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.383
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>did this combine a technology that is </v>

365
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:09.564
<v Speaker 9>now available.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So when we do know the structure of it </v>

366
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:16.170
<v Speaker 9>now,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it doesn't mean that we immediately find</v>

367
00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:19.190
<v Speaker 9>a way of combating sees,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but,</v>

368
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.080
<v Speaker 9>but it makes it possible.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So the potential,</v>

369
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:22.800
<v Speaker 9>Richard Thaler.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

370
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.633
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just going to say that this links </v>

371
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:28.080
<v Speaker 6>up to the conversation we were having a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bit earlier,</v>

372
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.510
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

373
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.520
<v Speaker 6>w whether choice architecture or nudging</v>
<v Speaker 6>is a good or bad,</v>

374
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:36.354
<v Speaker 6>it just depends on who's using it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So all the scientists here have created </v>

375
00:19:41.011 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 6>knowledge that can be used for good or </v>
<v Speaker 6>evil.</v>

376
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.773
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the s the same is true for a behavioral </v>

377
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:51.900
<v Speaker 6>science or behavioral economics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

378
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.230
<v Speaker 6>and many companies nudge for evil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

379
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.250
<v Speaker 6>last last night I toast was to nudge for</v>
<v Speaker 6>good and,</v>

380
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.410
<v Speaker 6>but that's a hope.</v>

381
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.180
<v Speaker 1>What you trying to send.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of you have worked,</v>

382
00:20:05.181 --> 00:20:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many,</v>

383
00:20:06.051 --> 00:20:10.190
<v Speaker 1>many years on your endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was one chemist who said,</v>

384
00:20:10.191 --> 00:20:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miracles sometimes the,</v>

385
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but you have to work terribly hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

386
00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:18.440
<v Speaker 1>is part and parcel of everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

387
00:20:18.441 --> 00:20:19.274
<v Speaker 1>Failure is part and parcel of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll carry out lots and lots of </v>

388
00:20:22.101 --> 00:20:25.670
<v Speaker 1>experiments and expect many of them not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to succeed.</v>

389
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we are aiming to find out </v>

390
00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:29.384
<v Speaker 1>completely you things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if when you're thinking of an </v>

391
00:20:31.821 --> 00:20:33.500
<v Speaker 1>experiment in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any area,</v>

392
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.210
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

393
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.080
<v Speaker 1>the choice that you make is close to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that you have already,</v>

394
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:41.240
<v Speaker 1>then you're likely to have a successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

395
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.470
<v Speaker 1>But you want to have learned very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you make a bigger jump,</v>

396
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.730
<v Speaker 1>take a bigger risk and then most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time the experience when a feel,</v>

397
00:20:49.731 --> 00:20:52.390
<v Speaker 1>but when it succeeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a bigger jump forward.</v>

398
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:54.300
<v Speaker 1>So I learned from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

399
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Fred Sanger who had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

400
00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.483
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

401
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.330
<v Speaker 1>had two Nobel prizes for his work in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequencing protein and DNA.</v>

402
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:02.700
<v Speaker 1>He used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

403
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.990
<v Speaker 1>that you should aim for a very high </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure rate.</v>

404
00:21:04.991 --> 00:21:09.991
<v Speaker 1>My interpretation was 99% failure rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the 1% that succeed takes you with a</v>

405
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:11.254
<v Speaker 1>very big step forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is worth all the effort you've </v>

406
00:21:13.511 --> 00:21:15.930
<v Speaker 1>spent or the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that</v>

407
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 4>leaves out one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one important component,</v>

408
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 4>especially for young people who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who like science.</v>

409
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:24.370
<v Speaker 4>And that is the discussion of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of uh,</v>

410
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 4>high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high failure or very lofty goals,</v>

411
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 4>leaves out an element of craftsmanship </v>
<v Speaker 4>to our profession.</v>

412
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:34.240
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

413
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:34.990
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

414
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.441
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

415
00:21:35.441 --> 00:21:37.480
<v Speaker 4>the Chin with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chance of,</v>

416
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:42.530
<v Speaker 4>of having tremendous success is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is very small for anyone to individuals.</v>

417
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:43.873
<v Speaker 4>We are the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're the progeny that w we are the </v>

418
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:48.274
<v Speaker 4>beneficiaries of also a lot of luck as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well as hard work and perhaps a tiny </v>

419
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:52.714
<v Speaker 4>little bit of talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the fact is that most of us here </v>

420
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:56.854
<v Speaker 4>love what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that carries you through </v>

421
00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:00.050
<v Speaker 4>failures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

422
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.660
<v Speaker 4>And you have to really like to do it.</v>

423
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 1>But an interesting Michael all smash </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you were young,</v>

424
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.590
<v Speaker 1>you were marked out as a potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure at school.</v>

425
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.890
<v Speaker 1>You were very unruly by your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>admission.</v>

426
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've known each other,</v>

427
00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:18.460
<v Speaker 1>I know for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years,</v>

428
00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:20.340
<v Speaker 1>for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also shocking to go,</v>

429
00:22:20.341 --> 00:22:20.951
<v Speaker 1>I'll show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

430
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:24.330
<v Speaker 1>you say that you were dyslexic at school</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Richard [inaudible],</v>

431
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:25.960
<v Speaker 1>you are mildly dyslexic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

432
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:26.794
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting that your paths</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this success now worrying about the </v>

433
00:22:29.711 --> 00:22:30.910
<v Speaker 1>wrong thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been,</v>

434
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.160
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just inspiring to people,</v>

435
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:33.680
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

436
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Speaker 7>The list to Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said something very profound and that</v>

437
00:22:40.101 --> 00:22:40.934
<v Speaker 7>is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people like to work on things that are </v>

438
00:22:42.291 --> 00:22:45.440
<v Speaker 7>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that are a pleasure to work on.</v>

439
00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.580
<v Speaker 7>That's absolutely fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 7>None of us,</v>

440
00:22:49.581 --> 00:22:51.700
<v Speaker 7>at least I certainly in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't think I'm good.</v>

441
00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:52.940
<v Speaker 7>My win,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the Nobel prize.</v>

442
00:22:52.941 --> 00:22:55.790
<v Speaker 7>It was never in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was not,</v>

443
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:58.850
<v Speaker 7>my life was not dedicated to winning a </v>
<v Speaker 7>prize.</v>

444
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.540
<v Speaker 7>My life was dedicated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I enjoyed this thing I was working on.</v>

445
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:03.583
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was fun.</v>

446
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.820
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my buddies with me,</v>

447
00:23:04.821 --> 00:23:07.460
<v Speaker 7>we had a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The whole project,</v>

448
00:23:07.461 --> 00:23:10.710
<v Speaker 7>the Lego project isn't based on the fact</v>
<v Speaker 7>that they all look,</v>

449
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.490
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we fail.</v>

450
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.830
<v Speaker 7>We fail.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

451
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.030
<v Speaker 7>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just listen to me.</v>

452
00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.123
<v Speaker 7>I got to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is important because that just </v>

453
00:23:17.811 --> 00:23:20.450
<v Speaker 7>stuck in that the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you said it right and asking,</v>

454
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:21.920
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh God.</v>

455
00:23:21.921 --> 00:23:22.701
<v Speaker 7>Failure,</v>
<v Speaker 7>failure,</v>

456
00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:24.440
<v Speaker 7>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not the way you think.</v>

457
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.380
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So the consequence is that you do things</v>

458
00:23:27.381 --> 00:23:28.214
<v Speaker 7>which you get a kick out of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And Luckily sometimes they turn out to </v>

459
00:23:31.311 --> 00:23:32.144
<v Speaker 7>be important.</v>

460
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you are they not done.</v>

461
00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Brings</v>

462
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:40.663
<v Speaker 1>me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

463
00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Kazuo Ishiguro universally known as ish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

464
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.523
<v Speaker 1>who won the Nobel Prize for literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that in your writing career </v>

465
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:50.114
<v Speaker 1>you've had some false starts and works </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've discarded and started all </v>

466
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:55.610
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

467
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.503
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are now amongst the giants of the </v>

468
00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:03.260
<v Speaker 1>world of literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've written eight novels.</v>

469
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:04.094
<v Speaker 1>And so when I see a lot of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your novel seem on the surface to be </v>

470
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:09.410
<v Speaker 1>quite different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

471
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:10.244
<v Speaker 1>set in different countries and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there does seem to be a common </v>

472
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:16.190
<v Speaker 1>theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the present and</v>

473
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:17.180
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you say?</v>

474
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.410
<v Speaker 10>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the surface of my novel.</v>

475
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:25.370
<v Speaker 10>So kind of to set people think I keep </v>
<v Speaker 10>moving on.</v>

476
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.703
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>truth is I keep writing the same thing </v>

477
00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:28.544
<v Speaker 10>over and over again and people don't </v>
<v Speaker 10>realize it because they have very </v>

478
00:24:31.641 --> 00:24:32.474
<v Speaker 10>different settings.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But I think perhaps there is a parallel </v>

479
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:36.164
<v Speaker 10>between the kind of way I make progress </v>
<v Speaker 10>in the kind of way that the guys around </v>

480
00:24:40.941 --> 00:24:42.310
<v Speaker 10>this table have done.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

481
00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:43.623
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I dig around some sort of piece of </v>

482
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:51.140
<v Speaker 10>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Sometimes somebody comes up with an idea</v>

483
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:51.974
<v Speaker 10>or a topic that somewhere out there and </v>
<v Speaker 10>I think what that be great for somebody </v>

484
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:57.540
<v Speaker 10>else but it's not on this little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Um,</v>

485
00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.470
<v Speaker 10>I'm closing in on a,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

486
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.573
<v Speaker 10>I'm digging away in the dead of night </v>
<v Speaker 10>looking expecting to sort of uncover </v>

487
00:25:04.311 --> 00:25:06.800
<v Speaker 10>something strange down there.</v>

488
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.120
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned the scientists around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>

489
00:25:09.121 --> 00:25:09.954
<v Speaker 1>but you are interested in a discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>about science and one of your most </v>

490
00:25:15.991 --> 00:25:18.540
<v Speaker 1>famous books never let me go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

491
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.050
<v Speaker 1>looks at um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific advances,</v>

492
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a world that's kind of gone mad,</v>

493
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.850
<v Speaker 1>perhaps sat in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

494
00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:26.684
<v Speaker 1>in the future where society expects that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all illnesses can be fixed and they </v>

495
00:25:30.661 --> 00:25:32.580
<v Speaker 1>don't want to turn the clock back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

496
00:25:32.581 --> 00:25:33.414
<v Speaker 1>people dying of cancer and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is that something that really </v>

497
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.470
<v Speaker 1>concerns you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The misuse of science.</v>

498
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.270
<v Speaker 10>These are very important things I think </v>
<v Speaker 10>for books,</v>

499
00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:45.870
<v Speaker 10>films,</v>
<v Speaker 10>plays to address,</v>

500
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.640
<v Speaker 10>but that isn't essentially what </v>
<v Speaker 10>literature is for.</v>

501
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.670
<v Speaker 10>It doesn't have to directly address </v>
<v Speaker 10>these questions.</v>

502
00:25:55.180 --> 00:26:00.180
<v Speaker 10>I think what literature does is allow us</v>
<v Speaker 10>to understand each other across cultural</v>

503
00:26:00.791 --> 00:26:02.710
<v Speaker 10>barriers,</v>
<v Speaker 10>linguistic barriers,</v>

504
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.570
<v Speaker 10>so that when we come to have the debates</v>
<v Speaker 10>about how we order our society,</v>

505
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.433
<v Speaker 10>what is important,</v>
<v Speaker 10>we understand how other people not </v>

506
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:16.410
<v Speaker 10>obviously like us feel most discoveries.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I think a two edged blades,</v>

507
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.450
<v Speaker 10>and this is at the heart of the Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 10>metaphase.</v>

508
00:26:19.451 --> 00:26:20.284
<v Speaker 10>You like a man who invents dynamite,</v>
<v Speaker 10>which can do great things and very </v>

509
00:26:25.301 --> 00:26:28.900
<v Speaker 10>destructive things.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We have to have a debate in society.</v>

510
00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:29.734
<v Speaker 10>We have to think about what we do with </v>
<v Speaker 10>the great breakthroughs in the site of </v>

511
00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.473
<v Speaker 10>guys around the table.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The other way to make sure that what we </v>

512
00:26:37.541 --> 00:26:42.541
<v Speaker 10>do is understood enough by the public.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It doesn't have to be exactly what we,</v>

513
00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.383
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>this</v>

514
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.770
<v Speaker 7>famous problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was this,</v>

515
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.613
<v Speaker 7>a CP snow made such a fuss over and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>think he had did a lot of damage with </v>

516
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:54.861
<v Speaker 7>that is the this cross fertilization of </v>
<v Speaker 7>people do science people who do music,</v>

517
00:26:56.101 --> 00:27:00.210
<v Speaker 7>people who do arts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's got TIPCO and it isn't that,</v>

518
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd like to have,</v>

519
00:27:01.321 --> 00:27:02.154
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if in our country right now I'd like to </v>

520
00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 7>have the arts be able to know a little </v>
<v Speaker 7>more science,</v>

521
00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:09.973
<v Speaker 1>very bearish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're a great fan of Kazuo </v>

522
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:12.763
<v Speaker 1>Ishiguro rose work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this </v>

523
00:27:14.121 --> 00:27:17.990
<v Speaker 1>conversation between science and art?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want it to be a novelist,</v>

524
00:27:17.991 --> 00:27:18.824
<v Speaker 1>didn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

525
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

526
00:27:21.861 --> 00:27:24.650
<v Speaker 1>I eliminated several professions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up in physics.</v>

527
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.100
<v Speaker 1>The earliest one was being a writer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I read all the time when I was a</v>

528
00:27:28.101 --> 00:27:28.934
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you write a novel and it's read by </v>

529
00:27:30.171 --> 00:27:31.220
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>readers,</v>

530
00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:33.440
<v Speaker 1>you're really writing 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>novels.</v>

531
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.700
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's book clubs because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that anybody,</v>

532
00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:41.330
<v Speaker 1>the guy next to you doesn't read well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the how that novel,</v>

533
00:27:41.331 --> 00:27:45.380
<v Speaker 1>this interpreted by them is different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than how you interpret the novel.</v>

534
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:50.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fantastic thing that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>write something that actually is 100,000</v>

535
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:51.284
<v Speaker 1>stories I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why the movies never as good as the </v>

536
00:27:53.931 --> 00:27:54.764
<v Speaker 1>book because the movie does too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't really have the same </v>

537
00:27:57.621 --> 00:27:59.690
<v Speaker 1>partnership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my view.</v>

538
00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you like the movie of your book?</v>

539
00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:03.614
<v Speaker 1>Never let me go.</v>

540
00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:04.563
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I loved the movie of the remains of </v>

541
00:28:06.281 --> 00:28:09.460
<v Speaker 7>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't myself make a huge,</v>

542
00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.040
<v Speaker 7>I don't disagree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

543
00:28:12.041 --> 00:28:12.720
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

544
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.131
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

545
00:28:13.131 --> 00:28:16.450
<v Speaker 7>I think all the art forms have their </v>
<v Speaker 7>special powers.</v>

546
00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:16.980
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sure.</v>

547
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.490
<v Speaker 7>There are things that I can't do that </v>
<v Speaker 7>the filmmakers can do very,</v>

548
00:28:21.491 --> 00:28:22.840
<v Speaker 7>very well and vice versa.</v>

549
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I just go to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can frank,</v>

550
00:28:24.181 --> 00:28:25.014
<v Speaker 1>because I know that you are a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've written short stories which have </v>

551
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:29.214
<v Speaker 1>been published and you have a novel </v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been unpublished about and </v>

552
00:28:32.931 --> 00:28:35.930
<v Speaker 1>astro physicist at a university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

553
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.180
<v Speaker 1>that it might get published now that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are an Obama,</v>

554
00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any publishers listening unless you've </v>

555
00:28:42.261 --> 00:28:42.620
<v Speaker 1>known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

556
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.790
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Thanks for the plug.</v>

557
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:44.683
<v Speaker 7>A,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

558
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.450
<v Speaker 7>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

559
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.290
<v Speaker 7>the English language,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

560
00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 7>became a medium of re inventing by </v>
<v Speaker 7>itself.</v>

561
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:54.020
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>three,</v>

562
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.540
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean it was a very challenging thing.</v>

563
00:28:56.541 --> 00:28:59.810
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and when I discovered that I could write</v>

564
00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.840
<v Speaker 7>dialogue and cut something across a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was an incredible experience to me.</v>

565
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:08.503
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm saying it's sort of daunted by the </v>

566
00:29:10.821 --> 00:29:15.350
<v Speaker 7>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sitting next to it in the literature</v>

567
00:29:15.351 --> 00:29:18.440
<v Speaker 7>and talking about my little little </v>
<v Speaker 7>production.</v>

568
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.570
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well why don't,</v>

569
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.850
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

570
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:23.683
<v Speaker 6>one small point about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Certainly in the interest of young </v>

571
00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:29.670
<v Speaker 6>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>

572
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:30.563
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of young scientists don't </v>

573
00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:36.720
<v Speaker 6>pay any attention to the writing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean writing a novel.</v>

574
00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.690
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you do research,</v>

575
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 6>the end product is something written</v>

576
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 3>and until you've written it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you haven't done anything.</v>

577
00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.551
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>that,</v>

578
00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 10>that kind of says to me as well very </v>
<v Speaker 10>much,</v>

579
00:29:48.491 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 10>but you just sick as somebody from the </v>
<v Speaker 10>world of the arts,</v>

580
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 10>there seems to be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 10>disconnect with,</v>

581
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.590
<v Speaker 10>with your great discoveries and your </v>
<v Speaker 10>breakthroughs and,</v>

582
00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.890
<v Speaker 10>and then what the rest of society gets </v>
<v Speaker 10>preoccupied about.</v>

583
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.170
<v Speaker 10>And in popular culture and popular </v>
<v Speaker 10>debate,</v>

584
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.890
<v Speaker 10>it seems to me we're the world,</v>
<v Speaker 10>the Western world anyway,</v>

585
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.400
<v Speaker 10>very well prepared for a Zombie attack </v>
<v Speaker 10>on our major cities.</v>

586
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 10>But we don't seem to be addressing,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

587
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:16.623
<v Speaker 10>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>how we reorganize our society as a </v>

588
00:30:18.941 --> 00:30:19.774
<v Speaker 10>result of some of the staggering </v>
<v Speaker 10>breakthrough started being made in </v>

589
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:22.670
<v Speaker 10>science and technology.</v>

590
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.780
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

591
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.633
<v Speaker 1>one to take two aspect of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really has captured the public </v>

592
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:35.380
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Popular Imagination of course,</v>

593
00:30:35.381 --> 00:30:38.080
<v Speaker 1>is the world of science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

594
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.183
<v Speaker 1>I'll come to the physics lawyers because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won your prize for the observation </v>

595
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.253
<v Speaker 1>of gravitational waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time that a passing </v>

596
00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:50.650
<v Speaker 1>gravitational wave has been observed </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly on earth that you know,</v>

597
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:53.650
<v Speaker 1>huge scientific sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

598
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kip Thorne,</v>

599
00:30:54.971 --> 00:30:59.410
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just encapsulate for us </v>
<v Speaker 1>what this was all about?</v>

600
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.790
<v Speaker 3>So the black hole is something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>every child knows from comic books,</v>

601
00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.360
<v Speaker 3>but a black hole is a spherical hole in </v>
<v Speaker 3>space that has such intense gravity that</v>

602
00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:16.811
<v Speaker 3>nothing can get out and not even light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we discovered was that 1.3</v>

603
00:31:17.991 --> 00:31:22.250
<v Speaker 3>billion years ago in a galaxy far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far away,</v>

604
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.960
<v Speaker 3>two black holes circled around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>around each other,</v>

605
00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.213
<v Speaker 3>spiraling together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As they emitted these gravitational </v>

606
00:31:30.591 --> 00:31:32.780
<v Speaker 3>waves losing energy to the gravitational</v>
<v Speaker 3>waves,</v>

607
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.680
<v Speaker 3>the holes came crashing together at half</v>
<v Speaker 3>the speed of light,</v>

608
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:41.030
<v Speaker 3>and they created a veritable storm in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shape of space.</v>

609
00:31:41.031 --> 00:31:41.864
<v Speaker 3>And time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>time slow down and sped up oscillated </v>

610
00:31:44.661 --> 00:31:46.700
<v Speaker 3>wildly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can imagine time,</v>

611
00:31:46.701 --> 00:31:47.534
<v Speaker 3>they're speeding up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And slowing down relative to how time </v>

612
00:31:49.761 --> 00:31:54.761
<v Speaker 3>flows here and that process produced </v>
<v Speaker 3>these waves and which space is stretched</v>

613
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:59.540
<v Speaker 3>and squeeze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stretched and squeezed.</v>

614
00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:00.763
<v Speaker 3>The traveled across interstellar space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intergalactic space to the earth and </v>

615
00:32:05.871 --> 00:32:06.704
<v Speaker 3>were captured by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or monitored by the instruments were </v>

616
00:32:11.841 --> 00:32:14.540
<v Speaker 3>built by the experimental team that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with.</v>

617
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.220
<v Speaker 3>This is a whole new way to study the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university study aspects of the universe</v>

618
00:32:19.221 --> 00:32:20.054
<v Speaker 3>that we've never seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a way by which we will in due </v>

619
00:32:23.961 --> 00:32:24.794
<v Speaker 3>course watch the birth of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>and for the first time really come to </v>

620
00:32:28.551 --> 00:32:31.340
<v Speaker 3>understand through recombination of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the theory,</v>

621
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:33.020
<v Speaker 3>the birth of the universe,</v>

622
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.240
<v Speaker 1>ray and Barry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

623
00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:38.370
<v Speaker 1>what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a window on the world on,</v>

624
00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.253
<v Speaker 1>on our universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kinds of things might we discover </v>

625
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 1>about our universe that we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

626
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:45.373
<v Speaker 1>Barry,</v>

627
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:49.470
<v Speaker 8>we've worked for decades developing an </v>
<v Speaker 8>instrument,</v>

628
00:32:49.471 --> 00:32:52.290
<v Speaker 8>much likelihood the chemists talk about </v>
<v Speaker 8>this.</v>

629
00:32:52.291 --> 00:32:53.610
<v Speaker 8>Just astounding.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

630
00:32:53.611 --> 00:32:58.350
<v Speaker 8>I can't imagine that we could do what we</v>
<v Speaker 8>could do except that we learn very early</v>

631
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.480
<v Speaker 8>that you couldn't prove that we couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 8>do it.</v>

632
00:33:00.481 --> 00:33:05.220
<v Speaker 8>So we kept making steps and as I think </v>
<v Speaker 8>ray said earlier,</v>

633
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:06.623
<v Speaker 8>people keep asking us,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how could we stay at this so long </v>

634
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.740
<v Speaker 8>persistence.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

635
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:15.510
<v Speaker 8>it was really a lot of fun because we've</v>
<v Speaker 8>broken new ground all the time,</v>

636
00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.320
<v Speaker 8>much as you have without maybe making it</v>
<v Speaker 8>a discovery,</v>

637
00:33:19.321 --> 00:33:24.321
<v Speaker 8>but just to experimentally go further </v>
<v Speaker 8>than people have before.</v>

638
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:25.543
<v Speaker 1>Black coal was the cause and really are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very much the stuff of science fiction </v>

639
00:33:28.071 --> 00:33:28.940
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kip Thorne,</v>

640
00:33:28.941 --> 00:33:33.380
<v Speaker 1>you a scientific advisor and executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>producer of one such film,</v>

641
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 1>interstellar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how important is it for you?</v>

642
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that science fiction should</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be pays based on fact?</v>

643
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:43.243
<v Speaker 3>There's no necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are different genres of science </v>

644
00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:49.580
<v Speaker 3>fiction and my partner in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lynda obst,</v>

645
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.300
<v Speaker 3>who together with me wrote the treatment</v>
<v Speaker 3>from which interstellar sprang.</v>

646
00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:02.110
<v Speaker 3>She calls this science faction icon </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] science fantasy.</v>

647
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.470
<v Speaker 3>Harry Potter is science fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interstellar science faction.</v>

648
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.963
<v Speaker 3>But the beauty of this for me is that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>film like this where the science is </v>

649
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.400
<v Speaker 3>embedded in right from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

650
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 3>it's capable of inspiring people about </v>
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>

651
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:25.810
<v Speaker 3>How else could I as a professor succeed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in providing some inspiration?</v>

652
00:34:27.591 --> 00:34:30.950
<v Speaker 3>For 100 million people except for road </v>
<v Speaker 3>blockbuster film.</v>

653
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:31.630
<v Speaker 3>Like this</v>

654
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.280
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One particular thing that you know a lot</v>

655
00:34:33.281 --> 00:34:34.114
<v Speaker 1>of people sort of you like to know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>in science fiction so on is are there </v>

656
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:40.760
<v Speaker 1>other universes out there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parallel universes?</v>

657
00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:41.594
<v Speaker 1>I mean it could your work in any way </v>
<v Speaker 1>help us discover whether there are </v>

658
00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:47.510
<v Speaker 1>indeed other universities,</v>

659
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.110
<v Speaker 8>barry?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well it,</v>

660
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.640
<v Speaker 8>it might,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's different ways.</v>

661
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.843
<v Speaker 8>If we had an easy and straight forward </v>
<v Speaker 8>test to see if there was this idea was </v>

662
00:34:56.461 --> 00:34:58.590
<v Speaker 8>right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we'd probably be going after it.</v>

663
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.640
<v Speaker 8>There's various ways that we might get </v>
<v Speaker 8>clues,</v>

664
00:35:02.641 --> 00:35:06.060
<v Speaker 8>whether it's right and some of them are </v>
<v Speaker 8>through the kind of work we're doing.</v>

665
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:07.583
<v Speaker 8>It's not very direct.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's one of the ideas that kind of </v>

666
00:35:09.661 --> 00:35:12.480
<v Speaker 8>springs from what we don't know about </v>
<v Speaker 8>the early universe.</v>

667
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.583
<v Speaker 1>So discussing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the success of films like </v>

668
00:35:15.601 --> 00:35:20.601
<v Speaker 1>interstellar and science fiction to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions there you might say,</v>

669
00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean how important it sort of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about this,</v>

670
00:35:24.031 --> 00:35:24.864
<v Speaker 1>this unit in general terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that evidence based </v>

671
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.273
<v Speaker 1>discourse is in our societies today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me get a view from all of you on </v>

672
00:35:34.501 --> 00:35:35.281
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly as you,</v>

673
00:35:35.281 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you first jeff or people don't</v>

674
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:43.250
<v Speaker 5>know much about science and technology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the electricity,</v>

675
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.360
<v Speaker 5>a miracle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

676
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 5>day to day things that never existed </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dick centuries ago.</v>

677
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:53.934
<v Speaker 5>And now we're taking for granted the </v>
<v Speaker 5>proper American in the United States is </v>

678
00:35:57.661 --> 00:36:02.661
<v Speaker 5>not only ignorant but is actively </v>
<v Speaker 5>belligerently pugnacious Lee ignorance.</v>

679
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.540
<v Speaker 5>I refuse</v>

680
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.653
<v Speaker 8>go away or I'm secular humanist before </v>
<v Speaker 8>who thinks that they're all of these </v>

681
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.513
<v Speaker 8>irrational influences and that you will </v>
<v Speaker 8>seek the triumph of reason in the face </v>

682
00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:20.520
<v Speaker 8>of all this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

683
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.653
<v Speaker 8>Michael Ross Bash.</v>

684
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.030
<v Speaker 4>A lot of this has to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with educational landscape because we,</v>

685
00:36:26.031 --> 00:36:28.530
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've seen circumstances,</v>

686
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.970
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most starkly in the u s but,</v>

687
00:36:31.971 --> 00:36:34.800
<v Speaker 4>but in western Europe as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where politicians,</v>

688
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.820
<v Speaker 4>ambitious people take advantage of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

689
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:39.683
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the situation to exploit for their own </v>

690
00:36:41.611 --> 00:36:43.690
<v Speaker 4>benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for power gaining power.</v>

691
00:36:43.691 --> 00:36:45.720
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not something that's unprecedented,</v>

692
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.233
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened in the 20th century to </v>

693
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:50.760
<v Speaker 4>disastrous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to disastrous ends.</v>

694
00:36:50.761 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 4>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

695
00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.620
<v Speaker 4>it's a very worrisome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very worrisome concept.</v>

696
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:56.913
<v Speaker 5>Mike Hill,</v>

697
00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.110
<v Speaker 8>you can have an attitude that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 8>interested in science and you don't,</v>

698
00:37:02.111 --> 00:37:04.900
<v Speaker 8>can't benefit from science.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

699
00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:05.763
<v Speaker 8>these wouldn't exist if there hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>been discoveries 50 years ago that </v>

700
00:37:08.621 --> 00:37:11.290
<v Speaker 8>invented the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

701
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.153
<v Speaker 8>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

702
00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.053
<v Speaker 8>just about every minute of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>everyone depends on some form of </v>

703
00:37:18.431 --> 00:37:23.431
<v Speaker 8>technology so that the notion that it's </v>
<v Speaker 8>over or we have enough or uh,</v>

704
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.820
<v Speaker 8>it never happened or it never happened,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

705
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:32.710
<v Speaker 8>that this is brand new and created from </v>
<v Speaker 8>whole cloth is,</v>

706
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.620
<v Speaker 8>is such an incredible mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Which a sailor,</v>

707
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.300
<v Speaker 4>we have a fact free administration in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States.</v>

708
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>worrying about science.</v>

709
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.120
<v Speaker 4>It would be nice if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

710
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.013
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were scientists and the </v>

711
00:37:50.641 --> 00:37:52.710
<v Speaker 4>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>

712
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.723
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>subtle for some people who are </v>

713
00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:56.340
<v Speaker 4>collecting facts.</v>

714
00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.660
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But Barry is interesting.</v>

715
00:37:58.661 --> 00:37:59.140
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

716
00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.390
<v Speaker 8>talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We've heard anti-science bias from,</v>

717
00:38:01.391 --> 00:38:04.120
<v Speaker 8>from Jeff Wall for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but your lego project,</v>

718
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.393
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for the observation of these </v>

719
00:38:06.161 --> 00:38:07.450
<v Speaker 8>gravitational waves,</v>
<v Speaker 8>did,</v>

720
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:12.190
<v Speaker 8>do you think that kind of support would </v>
<v Speaker 8>happen today for something like we did?</v>

721
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:12.521
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

722
00:38:12.521 --> 00:38:14.020
<v Speaker 8>I'm worried not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not,</v>

723
00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.230
<v Speaker 8>you can't do science and move forward </v>
<v Speaker 8>without taking risks yet.</v>

724
00:38:17.231 --> 00:38:20.110
<v Speaker 8>We have a system this become more and </v>
<v Speaker 8>more conservative.</v>

725
00:38:20.111 --> 00:38:23.770
<v Speaker 8>I personally knowing the funding </v>
<v Speaker 8>situation pretty well.</v>

726
00:38:23.771 --> 00:38:27.790
<v Speaker 8>And the u s through the National Science</v>
<v Speaker 8>Foundation don't believe that right now.</v>

727
00:38:27.791 --> 00:38:29.560
<v Speaker 8>You could fund something that was </v>
<v Speaker 8>equivalent.</v>

728
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:32.740
<v Speaker 8>We as scientists have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not just that we,</v>

729
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 8>we have a job to make what we do more </v>
<v Speaker 8>intelligible</v>

730
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 9>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that that's why,</v>

731
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.620
<v Speaker 9>I mean kipps movie is an important </v>
<v Speaker 9>thing.</v>

732
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 9>I think you also have to go and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 9>people who are not at college levels.</v>

733
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 9>You have to talk to high school kids and</v>
<v Speaker 9>grade school kids.</v>

734
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree completely with,</v>

735
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.083
<v Speaker 3>with ray on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the one key aspect I'd like </v>

736
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:58.550
<v Speaker 3>to emphasize is the importance that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>general public,</v>

737
00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.100
<v Speaker 3>that the majority of the populace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

738
00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.240
<v Speaker 3>in a democracy particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

739
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 3>understands how science works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understands its powers,</v>

740
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:11.480
<v Speaker 3>its limitations,</v>

741
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.000
<v Speaker 9>Jack to bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

742
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.090
<v Speaker 9>the red mark by Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Ashley.</v>

743
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.983
<v Speaker 9>She go home that it would be easy to </v>
<v Speaker 9>develop and make great a story about </v>

744
00:39:22.941 --> 00:39:27.830
<v Speaker 9>zombies coming on us and destroy him.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Everything easy.</v>

745
00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.693
<v Speaker 9>But why is it so difficult?</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why does it work to make a terrible </v>

746
00:39:32.391 --> 00:39:33.224
<v Speaker 9>story about our climate going astray,</v>
<v Speaker 9>going about as bad as the Zombie beyond </v>

747
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.450
<v Speaker 9>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Why can't we make a story of that?</v>

748
00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

749
00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.150
<v Speaker 9>I can frank or we talked before about,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

750
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 9>the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the difficulty of,</v>

751
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.813
<v Speaker 9>of,</v>
<v Speaker 9>of getting science even across to the </v>

752
00:39:55.341 --> 00:40:00.080
<v Speaker 9>public and it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>that they are no existing forums and,</v>

753
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:01.160
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

754
00:40:01.161 --> 00:40:04.210
<v Speaker 9>the problem is we have all these forums,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

755
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:06.770
<v Speaker 9>the media and the media,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

756
00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:09.000
<v Speaker 9>chop everything into pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 9>Eh,</v>

757
00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:14.090
<v Speaker 9>and,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and people are completely incapable of,</v>

758
00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:17.060
<v Speaker 9>of getting some kind of a coherent story</v>
<v Speaker 9>out of this.</v>

759
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.263
<v Speaker 1>Richard Henderson do think that the role</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the scientist is to explain their </v>

760
00:40:21.001 --> 00:40:21.834
<v Speaker 1>science to society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also beyond that to actually say we </v>

761
00:40:25.411 --> 00:40:26.244
<v Speaker 1>want to raise the level of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>based comments and debates and </v>

762
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.360
<v Speaker 1>completely with you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

763
00:40:33.361 --> 00:40:34.194
<v Speaker 1>I think scientists are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am an optimist about this whole </v>

764
00:40:37.621 --> 00:40:38.610
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

765
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.310
<v Speaker 1>I think scientists particularly have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be optimists.</v>

766
00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.370
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't have worked for 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

767
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.363
<v Speaker 1>to look for gravitational waves without </v>
<v Speaker 1>being an optimist to differentiate </v>

768
00:40:47.131 --> 00:40:50.850
<v Speaker 1>between a rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrational fact and fiction.</v>

769
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Better education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is the answer actually.</v>

770
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.660
<v Speaker 1>And lots of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

771
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.080
<v Speaker 1>want better education for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

772
00:40:58.081 --> 00:40:58.914
<v Speaker 1>Some of them take their children out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>school to give them a better education </v>

773
00:41:01.351 --> 00:41:02.184
<v Speaker 1>of home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people take them out of school to </v>

774
00:41:04.051 --> 00:41:05.280
<v Speaker 1>avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

775
00:41:05.281 --> 00:41:08.290
<v Speaker 1>So we need to improve the general when </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor nate.</v>

776
00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was nice.</v>

777
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Better education is the bottom line </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

778
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.240
<v Speaker 1>You have in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

779
00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're just thinking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

780
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.240
<v Speaker 1>people to deal with facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to make a plea for also</v>

781
00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.313
<v Speaker 1>fiction has a place in society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we liked reading works of </v>

782
00:41:32.701 --> 00:41:33.140
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>

783
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.400
<v Speaker 10>fiction culture.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I mean I think one of the issues is that</v>

784
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:37.263
<v Speaker 10>the business model behind the media and </v>
<v Speaker 10>journalism reporting is currently </v>

785
00:41:42.071 --> 00:41:45.340
<v Speaker 10>broken.</v>
<v Speaker 10>The traditional ways in which newspapers</v>

786
00:41:45.341 --> 00:41:50.341
<v Speaker 10>and periodicals use to spread knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 10>and debate and they were rewarded for by</v>

787
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.250
<v Speaker 10>and large for accuracy is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

788
00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:59.690
<v Speaker 10>w what is important at the moment is </v>
<v Speaker 10>that it's eyeballs in it,</v>

789
00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.350
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>on websites clips.</v>

790
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.290
<v Speaker 10>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 10>there isn't a good economic,</v>

791
00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.530
<v Speaker 10>economically viable business model,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

792
00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.420
<v Speaker 10>by which,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

793
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:13.120
<v Speaker 10>we can have these debates,</v>
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

794
00:42:13.121 --> 00:42:14.080
<v Speaker 10>because,</v>
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

795
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:17.160
<v Speaker 10>people are driven by,</v>
<v Speaker 10>by the fact that you,</v>

796
00:42:17.161 --> 00:42:17.994
<v Speaker 10>you have to get,</v>
<v Speaker 10>maximize the number of clips on the </v>

797
00:42:19.661 --> 00:42:20.440
<v Speaker 10>website.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

798
00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.730
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 10>I hope you have fun.</v>

799
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:29.783
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

800
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I hope you'll make an honorable </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception of this program at least,</v>

801
00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.173
<v Speaker 1>and that you have had the chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with these great minds as well </v>

802
00:42:38.161 --> 00:42:41.940
<v Speaker 1>as adding your great mind to our debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and our discussion.</v>

803
00:42:41.941 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody has found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

804
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.313
<v Speaker 1>in the audience and beyond everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've said really absolutely </v>

805
00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:50.280
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've certainly enjoyed talking to all of</v>

806
00:42:50.281 --> 00:42:53.420
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you to all our Nobel laureates 'em</v>

807
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:56.550
<v Speaker 1>to our audience here in Stockholm at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concert hall from me,</v>

808
00:42:56.551 --> 00:43:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Xenapp Badawi in all of this on the no </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb minds team.</v>

809
00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much indeed for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goodbye.</v>
