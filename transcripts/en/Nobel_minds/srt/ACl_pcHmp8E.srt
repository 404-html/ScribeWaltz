00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,583
Hello and welcome to the concert hall in
Stockholm where this year's Nobel 

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:05,634
laureates received their awards from the
king of Sweden for their outstanding 

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:14,361
contributions to science and economics.
And they join us small and elite group.

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,630
And this is the first time that there'll
be a pairing together on TV.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,763
And we've also invited the family and 
friends to our audience as well as some 

6
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:26,940
of the best and brightest students from 
across Stockholm.

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,750
And they will be putting their questions
and comments to our laureates.

8
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,173
Well,
this year we have discoveries in the 

9
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:57,364
development of small machines,
a thousand times thinner than a strand 

10
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:02,980
of hair.
Can you believe that?

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,233
We also delve into strange forms of 
matter that could lead to super false 

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,820
computing and does it make economic 
sense to pay bosses,

13
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,130
big checks,
salaries,

14
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:17,740
bonuses,
that kind of thing while they're amongst

15
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:20,650
the topics that we'd be discussing.
But this year's Nobel laureates,

16
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:21,484
gentlemen,
welcome to your and renewed 

17
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,940
congratulations to all of you.

18
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,090
No,

19
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,123
I hope you don't mind starting off by 
saying that the average age of this 

20
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:42,170
year's lawyers is 72 you're all 65 or 
over.

21
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,453
And you know,
the trend is to award the Nobel prizes 

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,133
later in life.
Do you think it's a good thing that you 

23
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:53,120
should wait longer to be recognized for 
your work?

24
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,850
Um,
I'll ask you first,

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oliver Hart because your father died at 
the age of 106 and he published his most

26
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:04,460
significant scientific paper when he was
71.

27
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,280
It's true.
Yes.

28
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,950
I think he was going a little too slowly
actually.

29
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:13,450
But um,
to answer your question,

30
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:18,451
I think certainly in economics they tend
to want to be sure that the contribution

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,193
that I'm recognizing is,
is one that's going to survive the test 

32
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:26,674
of time.
But then I can understand that because 

33
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:29,440
things happen,
you know,

34
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,440
people get very excited about things.
Um,

35
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,710
so some sort of hot topic and then it 
turns out,

36
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:36,550
you know,
five,

37
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:39,130
10 years later,
it doesn't seem so important.

38
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:39,910
So I think,
you know,

39
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,760
they often wait 30 years and that's 
okay.

40
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,653
And that's going to lead to the kind of 
ages you're talking about it which 

41
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:47,320
people win prizes.

42
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,790
I mean,
could one of the reasons be that there's

43
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,010
so much theory now?
I mean,

44
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,010
apparently a hundred years ago there 
were a thousand physicists and now there

45
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:00,410
were apparently a million.
What do the physicists think?

46
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,303
Did you think it takes longer for real 
talent to shine through because there's 

47
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,700
just so much information you've got to 
assimilate?

48
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,100
I don't think it takes longer.
It's just as you say,

49
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:11,934
it's a matter of quantitative.
Miss so many smart physicists around 

50
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:15,994
that.
How do you tell which piece of work is 

51
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:22,300
going to be significant?
It's impossible.

52
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,440
Ben,
for anger as a chemist.

53
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:25,570
Do you think that,
um,

54
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,530
the prize acknowledges the kind of 
benefits of incrementalism,

55
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,383
you know,
standing on the shoulders of giants as 

56
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:35,740
it were,
and it kind of goes against the,

57
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,430
in Eureka moment in the bath that we 
often associate with science,

58
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,860
of course we stand on the shoulders of 
giants.

59
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,693
I mean,
we work with the knowledge that was 

60
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:45,010
made,
uh,

61
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,203
experienced and developed before us.
But there are these certain moments 

62
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:50,914
that,
uh,

63
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,150
in in time that my colleagues and myself
and others in the field experience where

64
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:55,984
you suddenly realize that you have made 
a breakthrough and that opens up a new 

65
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:00,784
field.
It might take several years before it's 

66
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:05,770
recognized that a new field has been 
opened.

67
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,530
But John Pierre has survived.
I mean,

68
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,570
you're a chemist,
but I could ask you this.

69
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:13,960
When we're thinking about drugs and 
vaccines and that kind of thing.

70
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,510
I mean,
we do need fast science.

71
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:20,670
Do we to fix urgent problems?
I mean like the Zika virus or,

72
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,523
or whatever because you know,
you can't hang around for ages waiting 

73
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:26,570
for vaccines.
Yeah,

74
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:28,840
you're absolutely right.
But,

75
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,950
um,
you know,

76
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:30,784
we are,
I think probably all of us around this 

77
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:35,800
table,
basic scientists,

78
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,920
we are mostly interested in basic 
science and um,

79
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,070
of course,
I mean the research we do,

80
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,080
I could lead to new drugs,
new vaccines and all that.

81
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,333
Um,
but in our everyday research who are 

82
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:55,210
quite far away from that,
let me just see what the students in our

83
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,500
audience thinks.
Students,

84
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,334
just a couple,
a few comments from some of you about 

85
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,720
sort of life in the fast lane,
the slow lane.

86
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:02,554
Because I mean,
the world that you inhabit today is 

87
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:07,690
quite different from when these Nobel 
laureate started studying.

88
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,740
I mean you've got,
you know,

89
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,430
instantly knowledge and information.
People talk about information overload,

90
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:15,310
the distractions,
the constant digital stimulation.

91
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,270
Um,
you know,

92
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,103
confusing inflammation with knowledge.
Who feels that perhaps we should have 

93
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,300
more emphasis on longterm effort and 
experience?

94
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,723
Oh,
uh,

95
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,570
I think that um,
it may be in reason chair technology may

96
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,320
have,
uh,

97
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,350
affected,
uh,

98
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,300
student,
the young,

99
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,340
young generation negatively in that 
sense.

100
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:38,040
Maybe they have gotten less patients 
perhaps,

101
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,990
uh,
when conducting research.

102
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,040
I don't know.
But uh,

103
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,043
see your attention span might not be as 
good as it might be because of the 

104
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,340
constant bombardment.
Exactly.

105
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,330
Okay.
Thank you.

106
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,150
Any more comments?
Well,

107
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,130
I think when these gentlemen probably 
started out,

108
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:52,964
they had only a couple of journals 
hardcopy whereas we have basically the 

109
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,034
entire Internet.
So I think you just have to have a 

110
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,790
better filter,
but still great,

111
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,470
great breakthrough with,
as you mentioned,

112
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:07,250
don't come around like every other week.
That doesn't happen.

113
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,230
I think nowadays year have often the 
impression that you have so many options

114
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:16,760
and alternatives that might be a bit 
hard to focus on one specific goal.

115
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,270
I do think that one of the most 
important challenges for the educational

116
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,104
system nowadays is to teach students how
to select information that they can 

117
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,620
found find on the internet,
and in that sense it's very important to

118
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,920
be able to use the media as an 
opportunity rather than a threat.

119
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,853
What's the phrase that does seem to be a
bit of a kind of generational divide I 

120
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:44,664
think,
or how people approach their work today 

121
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:50,030
and how you ordered?
Yes.

122
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,450
I don't think it's as dramatic as being 
described because we,

123
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:55,284
we're not faced with two journals,
but benny journals and we were faced 

124
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:02,910
with having to read these journals 
rather than to access them quickly.

125
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,744
We had to go to library,
so it was much more time consuming than 

126
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:07,884
it is today.
You can get information much more 

127
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:10,560
quickly today,
which is good.

128
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:11,394
Then you think that you just got his 
time going to the library and that kind 

129
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:15,750
of thing.
Bengt Holmstrom as an economist,

130
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:16,570
what's your here?

131
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,290
I don't think we think very much about 
Nobel prizes when we do our research.

132
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,890
So I think the key is who is the nature 
of research and how it's evolving.

133
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,480
So it gets to the issue about has it 
sped up or something like that.

134
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,250
And uh,
in economics at least,

135
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:32,080
uh,
despite all the journals,

136
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,890
it turns out that it's harder and takes 
longer to get publications.

137
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:39,280
But maybe the whole functional 
publications has changed.

138
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,140
The Internet started with physicist 
circulating their papers at cern.

139
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
So the,
um,

140
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,510
now there's a huge overload of papers 
coming in there with the branch,

141
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,540
geophysics.
Uh,

142
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,230
everything is put on the archive for 
most immediately.

143
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,843
And of course it's,
it used to be easy to read what was put 

144
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:05,310
out every day or every month,
but now there's so much coming in.

145
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,280
Again,
you get down to this filtering problem.

146
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,360
It facilitates our work,
no doubt.

147
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,333
But I missed something,
which is to read an article by accident 

148
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,040
40 years ago.
I used to his,

149
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,410
you know,
and to take a journal,

150
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,190
just walls and all of a sudden,
you know,

151
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:29,780
you find a nice drawing.
Uh,

152
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,663
you read the paper,
you read it more in detail and this is 

153
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:37,690
totally accidental and it's a good 
accident nowadays.

154
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,553
You read what you are prepared to read,
you go to a journal on the Internet and 

155
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,090
just look at what you want to look at.
There are no accidents anymore.

156
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,200
Senate serendipity,
serendipity and always that.

157
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,880
Thank you.
Well,

158
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,060
some interesting thoughts there,
but let's,

159
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,913
um,
now take some of our first questions 

160
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,350
from the audience and Rebecca Loudin 
your question please.

161
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,650
So I remember when I was supposed to 
choose a degree for university,

162
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:07,484
that basic signs was not a very popular 
field to go into among the students in 

163
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:11,354
my class.
So how do you think we could encourage 

164
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:14,024
more young people to be interested in 
and wanting to pursue a career in basic 

165
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:20,510
science and uh,
put silver,

166
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,533
uh,
recent studies and surveys to show that 

167
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,550
uh,
nowadays,

168
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,320
young scientists are under extreme,
uh,

169
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,223
extremely high pressure to publish,
to secure funding and a tenure track 

170
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,993
positions.
And this often leaves serve very little 

171
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:43,160
energy and time to,
um,

172
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,790
to do high quality research and to 
pursue interest in ideas.

173
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,560
So what is your perspective on this?
And you end pen.

174
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:51,700
Okay.

175
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,910
My question is,
um,

176
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:53,744
what is your opinion towards a global 
trend of reducing funding for 

177
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,630
fundamental fundamental science 
research?

178
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,510
Thank you very much.
Let's take that last question first from

179
00:10:02,511 --> 00:10:03,344
UN pan about the global trend.
He says reduced funding for fundamental 

180
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:12,210
scientific research.
So Fraser,

181
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,940
I mean,
do you see a difference in,

182
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:18,260
in the research were fundamental and 
applied scientific research?

183
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,530
Yeah,

184
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,363
no I don't.
I think there is no difference between 

185
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,840
fundamental research and applied 
research.

186
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:25,674
I think there's only good research and I
think the two marriage into each other 

187
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:29,574
very nicely.
I spent time in industry and did some 

188
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:35,010
very fundamental work when I was with 
imperial chemical industries,

189
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,850
corporate laboratory.
And that is where most of the ideas that

190
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:39,750
led to my,
uh,

191
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,450
discoveries in the early nineties came 
from.

192
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:43,140
So,
uh,

193
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,280
I've never seen,
uh,

194
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,133
this,
uh,

195
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,133
the mnr situation.
I've just seen good research and maybe 

196
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,500
not so good research.

197
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,063
Judge my,
you'd like to pick up some of those 

198
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,384
points that we heard.
Yeah.

199
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,810
Um,
people talk a lot about,

200
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,690
um,
the pressure to get tenure.

201
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,460
I mean that you have to do a lot to get 
tenure and that makes people write a lot

202
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:05,210
and all that.
But actually I,

203
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,190
when I look around and see my colleagues
who've got tenure,

204
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,050
many of them also seem to continue to 
produce many papers.

205
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,650
And I think the reason they do it so 
they don't read it,

206
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,640
they're not under the prior the garden 
anymore,

207
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:21,640
but they still do it.
It's not just to get grants,

208
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:22,474
it's because I think to some extent they
like to feel busy and they like to be 

209
00:11:26,891 --> 00:11:27,724
able to tell people what they're doing.
And actually it's quite difficult to be 

210
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,300
engaged in a longterm project because 
then you know,

211
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,350
where you meet someone,
they say,

212
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:36,580
what are you up to?
Well,

213
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,803
not much.
You know,

214
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,823
nothing

215
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,120
in places it doesn't set in.
Once they got the 10 year put their feet

216
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,954
up.

217
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,860
No,
no.

218
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,780
Um,
but the,

219
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:47,280
the thing is I'm not,
I think that you,

220
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,620
you would hope they would then say,
oh,

221
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,220
I'm now free to do a 10 year project.
But I think it's

222
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,050
mentally difficult to do that.

223
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,980
I always give my students that want to 
go into an academic career,

224
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:04,840
the following at fry's walk on two feet,
one going align of research,

225
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:09,040
but at least you get some decent paper 
so that you can ride a grant application

226
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,874
or people recognize that you do some 
decent work and then work also on some 

227
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:18,520
fairly challenging question on where you
might not have a paper in the next three

228
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,354
or four or five years,
but where you will make a name in the 

229
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,400
world for yourself.
Of course that's risky.

230
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,090
The debt will stay said the states maybe
for your next career.

231
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,780
So yeah,
you cannot deny that there is a pressure

232
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:34,180
to publish some papers because we had 
our papers.

233
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:35,014
You might not have the possibility to 
get a grant or the next step or 10 year 

234
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:39,454
or so,
but you should focus on what are 

235
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:45,810
important questions because we forget 
that sometimes they're,

236
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,270
the main purpose of science is to ask 
the right questions.

237
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,560
So about all this information and 
knowledge is,

238
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,613
it's great to know a lot,
but it's better to ask the right 

239
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,194
questions.

240
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,590
Professor Castilla it's one question was
how do we encourage more young people to

241
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,460
go into science?
It's,

242
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,603
I think that's a very difficult thing to
do because if you think about it from 

243
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:14,200
an,
most people are going to science,

244
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,630
okay they go in very enthusiastic study 
harder,

245
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:17,590
et Cetera,
et cetera.

246
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,483
But the chances of being very successful
are actually law and so you'll never 

247
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:25,834
going to get rich for example of Eh 
maybe chemistry medicine and so it's 

248
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:30,634
different.
But certainly in physics you'll never 

249
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:32,674
get rich doing it.
So why do you know you've bought your 

250
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:38,644
prize now that your well actually 
reached the very top and then a little 

251
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:43,751
bit anxious.
Yeah,

252
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:47,590
it's wonderful to have this price.
But if you think about is monetary value

253
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,540
is monthly values,
not much.

254
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:54,130
Not after the tax man as as had this cup
has had is cut.

255
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,820
So the money's not the thing.
It's more the satisfaction of doing,

256
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,783
of producing something in physics.
But how do you know which piece of 

257
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:10,321
information is is significant and which 
is not something 99.9%

258
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:13,540
of the stuff out there is not so 
significant.

259
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:18,541
This is noise and the one and the 0.1%
that is significant out there.

260
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,680
You've got to know it significant.
How do you know what significant,

261
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,110
you have to be familiar with the 
subject.

262
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:27,520
So it's,
it's,

263
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,230
it's a very difficult problem.

264
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,770
You obviously have identified that north
0.1%.

265
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,233
I think one of the things that's 
overlooked in this conversation is that 

266
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:39,650
mentoring is very important.
It's a,

267
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,420
and when you ask,
you know,

268
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,393
how can we improve the on the system?
I think if we maintain a good mentoring 

269
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:47,504
system that is critical and I don't 
think these other things that much it 

270
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,220
came through from your comment about,
uh,

271
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,240
about,
you know,

272
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,880
giving advice to students.
So I have been,

273
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,030
I would say I've been very lucky to have
wonderful mentors,

274
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:06,020
one of which sits in the audience here,
having good colleagues and so on.

275
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,730
And I think looking at it as a monetary 
issue or,

276
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,750
or,
or Korea concern is,

277
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,900
is just far too narrow and is your 
mental health.

278
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,630
But Wilson is sitting in the corner.
They,

279
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,493
all right.
Put your hand up top is not just my 

280
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:23,540
mentor.
He's a mentor of many,

281
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,510
many find students and a two Nobel prize
winners.

282
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,450
He looks really young to be a mentor.
But anyway,

283
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,610
thank you.
Our next question please.

284
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,670
From Kerstin

285
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,110
blend,
uh,

286
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,053
recently it seems as though governments 
and the general public are rejecting 

287
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,603
experts and ignoring their advice.
Where in the past it was held in much 

288
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:49,710
higher esteem.
Uh,

289
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,690
what do you think is driving this trend?

290
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,910
Bengt Holmstrom you worried about 
experts,

291
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:55,744
advice being rejected by public opinion.
I'm worried about the public rejecting 

292
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,050
the,
not just the experts,

293
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:05,884
but it's what our representatives and 
have the ability or should have the 

294
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:11,524
ability to process complex information.
And today's situation seems to be 

295
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:17,704
characterized by people thinking that 
they can go directly to the source and 

296
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:26,230
not have anybody interpret it and 
therefore they are very subject,

297
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,070
very much subject to misunderstanding 
what is going on.

298
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,450
And uh,
and so yes,

299
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:32,284
I'm very rarely it is though the complex
this use this be understood by the 

300
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:39,910
experts in ordinary people in they're 
capable of working it out themselves.

301
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,103
Here's where the lead is,
doesn't mean in this context that it 

302
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:46,180
needs to be bad.
So this is,

303
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,333
this is really part of our democratic 
system that there are some people who 

304
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:53,620
know more than the others and not 
before,

305
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,380
not necessarily because they're smarter 
or anything like that,

306
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:57,214
but they have just been handed the task 
to process the information on a broader 

307
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,770
basis.
And what seems to be happening now is as

308
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,370
total total almost ejection two four for
this principle.

309
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,210
You know,
I think some of the,

310
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,910
I don't want to call it distrust of 
experts,

311
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:16,760
but sort of working around them isn't so
bad.

312
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:17,780
I mean,
for example,

313
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,010
you know,
once upon a time,

314
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,113
if there was anything wrong with you,
went to the doctor and you assume that 

315
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:24,320
what the doctor was telling you is the 
truth.

316
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,260
Now you can go on the Internet and find 
out,

317
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,900
get a lot of information about what 
might be wrong with you.

318
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:31,940
And I think that can be actually 
productive.

319
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:35,990
Sometimes you can end up knowing more 
than the doctor about a particular thing

320
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:36,824
or,
but at least being able to bring to 

321
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,610
their attention something.
Um,

322
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,300
I think there's a difference between 
that and um,

323
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,311
you know,
if,

324
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:48,860
if you go on the web and you look at 
things carefully and you might even read

325
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:53,160
some articles so you don't want to 
exaggerate your competence to understand

326
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:54,510
them,
but you can get a sense of it.

327
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,140
Um,
I mean that's a good thing.

328
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,003
And,
and figure if you did that say with 

329
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:00,744
global warming,
you would undoubtedly end up with the 

330
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,090
conclusion that the science says this is
a really serious problem.

331
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,230
What's worrying is when people find 
somebody who says it's not a problem and

332
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,980
focuses,
you know,

333
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,080
they then focus on that.
Yeah.

334
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:21,000
There's a whole tsunami of information.
The real point that we are all facing is

335
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:23,250
of course,
quality of information.

336
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,113
What does it mean?
How are we going to educate our young 

337
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:30,720
people to distinguish what is right?
How are we to eh,

338
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,040
Eh,
eh,

339
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,113
making information available to the 
general public and probably be a 

340
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:36,834
scientist.
I have to do a much better job to 

341
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,610
distinguish facts from fiction and 
opinions.

342
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,320
You cannot develop a smartphone based on
an opinion.

343
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,490
It's the phrase,
I mean specifically on this,

344
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,380
the brexit vote.
Um,

345
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,273
and you know,
experts and politicians seeing their 

346
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,670
advice rejected that that caused you a 
great deal of angst.

347
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,833
Y

348
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,300
it did.
If we were going to enter an era of hard

349
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:04,134
brexit,
then this is almost like a chemical 

350
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:10,751
reaction that is close to irreversible.
And that saddens me.

351
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,040
I was at the forefront,
I feel when I was in the UK,

352
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:15,874
in Sheffield and latterly in Birmingham,
bringing in students from all over 

353
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:23,270
Europe and then all around the world.
When I left to go to United States,

354
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:28,271
we were something and the excess of 15 
different nationalities in a group of 30

355
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,950
to 40 people.
This was sheer magic.

356
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,420
The switched on the,
uh,

357
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,740
students,
uh,

358
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,250
from the British isles in a remarkable 
way as well as,

359
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:38,440
uh,
you know,

360
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,320
really raise the standard of our 
research.

361
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,720
And so I'm saddened by the fact that,
uh,

362
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,220
the,
uh,

363
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,460
people working,
uh,

364
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,333
in chemistry at the highest level in the
UK could be faced in the near time by 

365
00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:54,284
having to go down to pooling on a 
population of 65 million instead of 500 

366
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,650
million.

367
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,320
Can I send you that?
We happy with what you heard?

368
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:05,810
I mean,
what's the answer to your own question?

369
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,640
Oh,
I suppose,

370
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:08,474
um,
I mean for me during my phd has been 

371
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,990
invaluable in,
um,

372
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,670
allowing me to consider how the 
scientific process happens,

373
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:20,270
how to approach something as a skeptic 
and to look at the evidence.

374
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,104
And I think,
I feel like that's something that's 

375
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:25,880
missing perhaps in,
in the general public's mindset.

376
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:26,714
They,
uh,

377
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,590
tend to,
uh,

378
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,620
take what the media gives them and 
ingest that rather than perhaps being as

379
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,160
critical as it should be.
Yep.

380
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,790
Thank you very much indeed.
Okay,

381
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,180
so we'll go to your specific fields.
Um,

382
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,153
and now gentlemen,
for which he won the prize and let us 

383
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,330
start with them.
In economics.

384
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,730
Professor Horton,
professor homes strong,

385
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,870
the Nobel Committee said you won the 
prize for your separate work on contract

386
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:53,704
theory.
The judges said your work late an 

387
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:56,074
intellectual foundation for policies in 
areas such as where the workers should 

388
00:20:59,261 --> 00:21:00,094
receive a bonus incentive or ordinary 
salary where the essential public 

389
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,550
services should be privatized.
And they said there was,

390
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,690
these were matters valuable to the 
understanding of real life contracts and

391
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,100
institutions.
Um,

392
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,953
Oliver Hart,
you see parallels between your work on 

393
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,493
incomplete contracts,
what I could turn bad contracts and why 

394
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,114
people in the UK voted brexit.
How does your work on contract theory 

395
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,720
explain the Brexit vote?

396
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,450
I don't want to say it's explains it,
but I,

397
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,090
there are parallels because,
um,

398
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,303
in my work I've looked at contracts 
between two commercial parties and I've 

399
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:44,670
argued that in,
in situations where it's hard to write a

400
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,280
good contract,
um,

401
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,360
what becomes very important is who gets 
to decide on the things missing from the

402
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,940
contract.
I call that residual control rights.

403
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,240
And that sometimes goes together with 
ownership of assets.

404
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,340
Now in the political context,
if we,

405
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,980
if we take,
you can think of the European Union,

406
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,400
the arrangement that the co all the 
countries have in the European Union,

407
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,110
it's like a contract.
Uh,

408
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,183
and you could have,
you could imagine in a sort of ideal 

409
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:13,350
world,
um,

410
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,483
that everything would be written down in
advance and then the whole European 

411
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,170
Union would just have been about the 
negotiation of that initial contract.

412
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,400
Well,
of course that's not,

413
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,263
you can't do that.
So instead you set up these decision 

414
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:31,551
making bodies and I think that what the 
British voters fault was,

415
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,980
they'd allocated a lot of that power,
that residual or authority to the center

416
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,000
Brussels as call it a way from the 
individual countries.

417
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,600
And I think people pass felt they had 
done too much of that.

418
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,810
By the way.
I am was in favor of remain.

419
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,520
I didn't want,
I didn't thought it,

420
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:54,354
sorry.

421
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,590
Year brexit where you all opposed to it 
including the two Europeans,

422
00:22:58,591 --> 00:23:00,990
Dutch and French.
We all opposed to brexit.

423
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,690
Yes.
Interesting.

424
00:23:03,691 --> 00:23:08,691
All are Nobel laureates at the table for
a few British to European say you're all

425
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:10,260
opposed to brexit.
Okay.

426
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:14,700
Banks home throw your research,
looks at whether contract incentives,

427
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:19,701
how contract incentives affect corporate
behavior and you know,

428
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,933
whether performance related pay works 
and the difficulties in assessing say a 

429
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:26,664
teacher's performance as you said,
it's not as easy to is to measure as a 

430
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,583
factory worker and how many goods or 
handbags or whatever they may have 

431
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,460
manufactured.
So in terms of the workplace,

432
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,240
what does your research into contract 
theory tell us?

433
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,250
I think the big insight in some in my 
view is

434
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,060
that uh,
we were very focused initially on,

435
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:49,894
on thinking I incentives need to be 
provided by financial instruments of 

436
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:58,571
some kind of others or contract.
And we have come to understand how big a

437
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:02,810
part of incentives is actually something
entirely different than what most people

438
00:24:02,811 --> 00:24:05,870
think as incentives like bonuses or 
something like that.

439
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:06,730
So

440
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,670
constantly throwing money at people 
doesn't necessarily

441
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,220
just a matter of money.
But yes,

442
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,590
the,
the sort of stereotype view is,

443
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,340
is throwing money at people or you know,
there's an incentive problem,

444
00:24:18,341 --> 00:24:23,020
let's incentivize them be some money.
Actually that is most definitely not the

445
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:26,230
main,
main approach the world takes.

446
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,153
Maybe when we have all these debates,
particularly in the UK about executive 

447
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:32,144
pay and um,
executives getting big bonuses and 

448
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:38,480
salaries because share prices have gone 
up in their company or whatever.

449
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,703
What's your answer to that?
Does it not make economic sense to pay 

450
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:45,080
these big checks?

451
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,350
Okay.

452
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,670
It's not so much how big they are.
Uh,

453
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,853
I mean size matters,
but what worries me much more is how 

454
00:24:53,011 --> 00:24:53,844
they get structured and especially what 
these candles and other things have 

455
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:02,100
caught have led to in terms of how they 
are designed.

456
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:02,934
So I think,
I think we have gone from some arrows 

457
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,290
that could have been correct.
It's a 20 years ago or so,

458
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:11,503
uh,
in the designs into much worse designs 

459
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,803
because of uh,
the public being upset and the 

460
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:20,940
regulators being upset and they are 
trying to really solve the problem.

461
00:25:20,941 --> 00:25:24,690
We'll levels and not thinking so much 
about the incentives.

462
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:25,524
So,
uh,

463
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,920
I think we are gone from,
from maybe a somewhat flawed system to a

464
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,070
much better system.

465
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,330
Also moving to another area of research 
that you are watered your price for with

466
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:39,750
this question of whether for public 
providers of services,

467
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,180
whether they could be privatized.
For instance,

468
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:45,690
the Obama Administration to the prison 
service which was privatized,

469
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:50,580
should no longer be provided by a 
private companies.

470
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,860
It was to see a live debate in Africa 
for instance,

471
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:53,694
about whether education should be 
publicly provided or provided by the 

472
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:59,250
private sector.
So Professor Hart,

473
00:25:59,251 --> 00:25:59,810
I mean,
what,

474
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,950
what does economics tell us?

475
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,470
Well,
I think it can be helpful.

476
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,030
I wrote a paper with causes about this 
issue and I think,

477
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,370
you know,
what we say in the paper is,

478
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,680
um,
you know,

479
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,650
one extreme would you privatized nuclear
weapons?

480
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,520
We thought no.
I mean put them in private hands.

481
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:27,380
Didn't seem like I have a contract with 
someone who holds the nuclear weapons.

482
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,630
Probably not a good idea.
Um,

483
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,840
would you prioritize the State 
Department?

484
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:37,010
Would you have a contract with a private
company to run foreign policy?

485
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,490
Um,
I dunno whether Donald Trump is thinking

486
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:42,140
along those lines,
but I don't think,

487
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,970
I don't think that would be a good idea.
Ah,

488
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,973
he has appointed a businessman,
I think so maybe he's moving in that 

489
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,130
direction.
But um,

490
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,050
at the other extreme garbage collection,
rubbish collection,

491
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,220
quite comfortable with that.
It depends how good a contract you can,

492
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:00,540
right?
And,

493
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,403
but you know,
what kind of things can go wrong and 

494
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:06,150
therefore who should have the residual 
control rights.

495
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,003
That's it.
But that's how to think about these 

496
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:08,941
things.
Right?

497
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:09,774
Schools or somewhere in between,
in between when you have competition 

498
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,050
that strengthens the case for 
privatization.

499
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,210
So in the case of schools,
um,

500
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,073
you know,
if a school does badly is shading on 

501
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:25,200
quality,
then people will eventually find out,

502
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:26,760
it may take a bit of time,
but you know,

503
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:28,920
and they'll send their kids to a 
different school.

504
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,143
In the case of prisoners,
we probably don't think it would be a 

505
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,130
great idea for the prisoners to be able 
to shop around.

506
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,540
And so,
you know,

507
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,490
their competition isn't going to work as
well.

508
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,580
And that strengthens the case from 
public provision.

509
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,860
Thank you very much.
So,

510
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,870
and I just turn to a chemistry and the 
chemistry,

511
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,440
uh,
Laurie,

512
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,273
it's the three of you were jointly 
awarded the prize for fundamental 

513
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:52,770
chemistry.
The Nobel Committee said,

514
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:56,510
do you have mastered motion control at 
the molecular scale,

515
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:57,344
the design and synthesis of machines a 
thousand times thinner than a strand of 

516
00:28:01,671 --> 00:28:06,671
hair so small that tens of thousands of 
them could actually fit on a pinhead.

517
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,730
So we've got,
um,

518
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,150
some questions I think from the students
here.

519
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:14,930
If I could have the first one all off.
Yonson your question.

520
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,693
Yeah.

521
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,243
So what are the fundamental limits to 
how small you could make these 

522
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,850
artificial molecular machines?

523
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,153
Okay,
great.

524
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,720
If we could take the next one,
Hilda Bucklin ah,

525
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,070
so I wonder,
uh,

526
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:35,160
in 20 years time or do you think you'll 
see the biggest use?

527
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:37,770
So molecular robots a word,
for example,

528
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:42,050
be in medicine or molecular electronics.
Thank you ben for anger.

529
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,903
Let me take the first one with you.
What are the fundamental limits to how 

530
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,120
small you can make an artificial 
molecular machine?

531
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:48,954
Cause in 1999 you led the first research
to produce a molecular motor that 

532
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:54,324
continually spins in the same direction.
And then in 2011 year old group built a 

533
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:01,020
four wheel drive for Nano car.

534
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,203
Yeah,
it's very difficult to say what the 

535
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:07,440
limits were doing,
but we work with molecules and typically

536
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:10,500
our molecular motor is half a nanometer 
also.

537
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:13,830
So and one nanometers,
1000000000th of a meter,

538
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:14,664
as you know.
So the limits will be probably a dead 

539
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:17,784
size,
but you have to realize if you want to 

540
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:19,554
build machines,
it's only the moving part is only part 

541
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:24,000
of the machine.
So you have to integrate it.

542
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:24,834
For instance,
you have to put it on the servers or 

543
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,720
integrate in a device,
et cetera.

544
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,153
So that is,
that all depends on the type of 

545
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,890
molecules you are designing for a 
specific purpose.

546
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,940
If you look in your eye,
which has a beautiful switch,

547
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,140
it is the tiny molecule in the NDI is 
probably one and we do,

548
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:44,974
but it's part of a big protein complex 
that makes it possible that the signal 

549
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,880
of the light that comes to your eyes 
triggers this.

550
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:52,803
In your eye and then changes and there's
a cascade of process that make it 

551
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:58,690
possible that you get the signal in your
brain.

552
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,060
The fact that I can see you,
when you can see me,

553
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:03,970
the fact that all cells can define that 
became move on muscles.

554
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,930
These are machines of a,
of a couple of nanometers at most.

555
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,713
Sean via survives.
You mean you managed to meet one 

556
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:13,250
molecule,
Piro at,

557
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,180
around the other in a controlled manner 
when energy was applied.

558
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:18,014
So our question about where do you see 
the biggest use of molecular robots in 

559
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:22,934
medicine or molecular electronics?
The question was what's your answer to 

560
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,840
make it clear?
I have no answer.

561
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,290
I have,
I have comments.

562
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,410
Um,
uh,

563
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,160
before our contributions,
um,

564
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,250
it was considered as extremely difficult
to set molecular systems in motion.

565
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,353
I mean,
we knew everybody knew that there were 

566
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:51,840
plenty of such motors and machines in 
the biological world,

567
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,800
but using artificial systems,
molecules,

568
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,100
which had been made in a laboratory that
was considered almost impossible.

569
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,290
And I think that was a big step in a way
that,

570
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,170
uh,
the three of us and our coworkers,

571
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,870
just the question or I assume is,
is,

572
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,570
is thinking won't hit.
Yeah.

573
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,180
But when she asked about medicine is 
that,

574
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:15,014
you know,
we think about the walking microscopic 

575
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,790
robots,
which could for instance,

576
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,290
slip inside the human body and deliver 
drugs in a targeted manner.

577
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,640
Yeah.
Perhaps perhaps it's a phrase it,

578
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,474
so the question we had about any,
do you foresee any negative social or 

579
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,673
environmental challenges with the misuse
of this technology that we should be 

580
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,171
aware of?
An,

581
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:42,004
I should say that you made a key advance
by threading and molecular ring onto a 

582
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:48,740
rod like structure that acted as a dumb 
bell.

583
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:52,550
The kind of thing we use in the gym.
When you added the two together,

584
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:53,384
the ring jumped forwards and backwards 
like a tiny shuttle and later you've 

585
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:59,660
built numerous molecular machines.
I'm including a pump.

586
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,330
So that was your particular 
contribution.

587
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:06,080
But what's your answer to the question?
Well if I could tell you the latter part

588
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:06,914
first and just make a comment about the 
movement to ban for ringer has promoted 

589
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:15,510
the movement in a circular sensor,
rotary [inaudible].

590
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,230
So I think John Pierre and I with our 
um,

591
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,153
taxing based systems,
a molecular shotwell based systems have 

592
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:29,350
done the fundamental preliminary work to
achieve movement in a linear direction.

593
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:35,140
But it's not just sufficient to have 
that movement in a willy nilly takeaway.

594
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,150
We have got to be able to direct that 
movement.

595
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,040
The first step after you have

596
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,790
the Willy Nilly type of movement is to 
go to a switch.

597
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,030
There's still a lot to be done in terms 
of going from switches to machines,

598
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,263
machines have to do work and uh,
this has been a progressive situation 

599
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:55,334
from finding how to bring a bank this 
motion in either a rotary or a linear 

600
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:03,020
rate direction to a switch to a machine.

601
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:07,360
Would you like to see opportunities in,
in your,

602
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,180
either discoveries you've me,
would you like to see them develop,

603
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:12,880
I mean Bedford and go,
do you see great opportunities

604
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,773
since I,
I definitely say great opposition is my 

605
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:18,330
colleagues already said it is very,
very early days.

606
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:19,164
So this is fundamental research.
The breakthrough that you can induce 

607
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,663
motion responsive functions in materials
opens up an entirely new field of 

608
00:33:28,891 --> 00:33:32,580
material science and machines.
Ultimately maybe science fiction at this

609
00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:34,230
moment,
but in 30,

610
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:35,790
40,
50 years from now,

611
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,250
I see many opportunities during my whole
career.

612
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:42,330
I work together with industry also on 
potential applications.

613
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,580
Uh,
and,

614
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,110
and so we have close contact then and 
when we,

615
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,390
and this counts for,
for the whole community,

616
00:33:48,391 --> 00:33:51,420
I think if we see opportunities for 
cooperation,

617
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:55,560
we will work together with industries.
But you have to realize to bring it to a

618
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:56,394
product in the market.
My take along development or the 

619
00:33:58,601 --> 00:33:59,434
directory,
develop a new medicine at this moment 

620
00:34:01,111 --> 00:34:02,690
takes more than 12 years and,
uh,

621
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:03,923
lots of money.
So this is typically the timeframe we 

622
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,044
are working in.

623
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,000
It turns out in my laboratory in recent 
times by working in this area,

624
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,800
we have serendipitously gone off in two 
completely different directions.

625
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,880
One is to create very highly porous 
materials that,

626
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:21,714
uh,
as the basis for one startup company 

627
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,240
starting about 15 months ago,
that is looking at,

628
00:34:27,241 --> 00:34:28,170
uh,
use of,

629
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,530
uh,
these polars materials in home care,

630
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:33,600
in personal care,
in food,

631
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,130
and ultimately in pharmaceuticals.
And the other one is quite serendipitous

632
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:40,590
discovery that I would never have even 
predicted.

633
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,753
And that is that we are looking at a new
ways of isolating gold that get us away 

634
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:51,831
from the use of cyanide,
which is 83% of the world's isolation.

635
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:56,700
And the other 17% is mercury,
two very nasty chemicals.

636
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:57,534
And all of this has come out to 
fundamental research and most of these 

637
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:05,160
are seven deputies discoveries going on 
while we're making molecular machines.

638
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,000
Thank you.
All right,

639
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:08,530
thank you very much indeed.
Chemists,

640
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:12,280
Laurie.
So turning to the laureates in physics,

641
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,610
um,
Duncan Hall Day,

642
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,444
Michael Costa,
Litz and also David soulless or all of 

643
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,330
your British born and uh,
David solders.

644
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,440
Professor Thalamus is not with us,
but our congratulations go to him.

645
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,274
Also,
you were jointly awarded the prize for 

646
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,930
discoveries for your pioneering work on 
strange forms of matter.

647
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:30,640
The Nobel Committee said your 
discoveries,

648
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:34,390
it opened the door on an unknown world.
Now Mike hostile,

649
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:35,224
it's along with David Thallus.
You focused on that arise in flat forms 

650
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:40,254
of matter on surfaces inside extremely 
thin layers that can be considered two 

651
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:48,500
dimensional,
unlike the three dimensions that are,

652
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,343
you know,
we describe reality around us with and 

653
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:57,110
the work involves a field of maths known
as topology topology basically I suppose

654
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:01,200
analyzes the sheep of things.
It's a,

655
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,310
tells us that a doe not in a wedding 
ring topologically are the same thing.

656
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,970
And do you Duncan of all,
Danes studied one dimensional matters.

657
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:10,804
So that's the kind of preface to the 
question that we have from our physics 

658
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:18,200
student.
A flora couldn't stop.

659
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,503
Yes.

660
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,643
Um,
do you think there will be any 

661
00:36:22,941 --> 00:36:26,240
technological advancements such as,
for instance,

662
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:27,074
quantum computers coming from the new 
insights in quantum mechanics separate 

663
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:31,130
provided by Ortiz?

664
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,150
Most probably,
yes.

665
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,100
I mean to what we really discovered was,
uh,

666
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,333
the,
there were more interesting materials 

667
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:41,840
than we expected.
And um,

668
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,043
condensed matter physics is a fancy name
for understanding the properties of 

669
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:51,390
materials and what this work is a really
led to,

670
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,370
it started off with one dimensional 
things,

671
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:55,620
but it's not just one dimensional or two
dimensional.

672
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,203
There are a class of materials which we 
didn't realize existed before that have 

673
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,750
a very interesting properties,
uh,

674
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,613
in the quantum mechanical structure.
And the quantum mechanics is a 

675
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,760
fundamental way to understand all 
materials.

676
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,463
And a,
the topology is a side issue in a sense 

677
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:19,950
that we discovered the,
some very beautiful,

678
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:20,784
unexpected properties of quantum 
mechanics and the mathematical tools of 

679
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:25,930
Topology,
uh,

680
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,933
turned out to be very useful for 
analyzing the specific differences 

681
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:34,470
between these unexpected forms of matter
and conventional matter.

682
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,843
So this whole analog about Brett's 
pretzels and bagels is just that the 

683
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:40,704
Bagel has a hole in it.
It's different from a football which 

684
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,124
doesn't,
and this a new form of new kinds of 

685
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,660
condensed matter.
Uh,

686
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,680
also different from the familiar types 
as the Bagel is for the football.

687
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:55,914
The,
the property of having the whole in the 

688
00:37:57,631 --> 00:38:00,000
Bagel makes it slightly different.
You can,

689
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,220
you know,
pick up the Beagle and it can get,

690
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,203
you can look through it,
you can poke your finger through it or 

691
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:06,750
whatever.
But it's just different.

692
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,300
It's not good for playing football with,
no,

693
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,400
it's not good for playing football,
but it will change the game as I said.

694
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,423
Right.
So professor Costa lists and we have 

695
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,643
heard that your work could result in 
improved materials for electronics and 

696
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:22,210
that could lead to super fast computers.

697
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,160
Okay.
So this is,

698
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,790
it doesn't like the question.
No,

699
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:29,520
no,
it's not.

700
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,271
No,
like it,

701
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:34,500
I just fumbling for an answer to that 
because let me,

702
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,310
let me stress that when we,
when

703
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,610
we started this work,
it was,

704
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,640
we had no thoughts about applications or
anything like that.

705
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,270
It was nothing more than an interesting 
theoretical problem.

706
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:47,771
There was a,
you know,

707
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:49,960
there was,
there was a theoretical question that we

708
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:54,961
wanted to try to answer and that's what 
started it all.

709
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,190
Sure.
Could it,

710
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,280
I mean in theory we can see all the 
difficulties as well as some of the,

711
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,423
the possibilities.
And the question was asking about the 

712
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:10,580
possibilities.
Duncan,

713
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,740
I can see many of the difficulties we 
unanswered difficulties,

714
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,603
right?
So we simply don't know the answer to 

715
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:18,230
the question.

716
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,300
Well,
leave the physics there then.

717
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:25,610
Could we go to our next uh,
question please end gala link off.

718
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,030
Hi.
Um,

719
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,700
so we've all noticed that there are no 
women,

720
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,830
um,
the received the Nobel prize this year.

721
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,920
Uh,
so my question is what can you ask noble

722
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:37,754
laureates us as young scientists but 
also general public do to encourage 

723
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:47,570
women to go into science and promote 
them.

724
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,550
Okay,

725
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,890
well a volunteer to start that one.
My own view of this,

726
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,300
this issue is initial,
no question about it,

727
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:58,930
but my own view of this issue is a bit 
heretical.

728
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,333
And you see to me the,
the female of the species is actually v 

729
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,840
too smart to go into physics simply 
because physics is tough education,

730
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,140
no question about it.
And the,

731
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,380
the,
the,

732
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,600
the,
the resulting,

733
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,483
uh,
job you going to get with this fancy 

734
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:23,990
education is not great.
It doesn't pave particularly well and it

735
00:40:23,991 --> 00:40:28,991
doesn't give you much free time.
So why on earth should somebody who's,

736
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,713
uh,
who,

737
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,693
who is sensible and intelligent go into 
this difficult field when they can make 

738
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:37,850
a much better living in these your 
fields.

739
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,820
So heretical that your fellow laureates 
green shakes.

740
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:47,270
My view is heretical.
Fantastic job if you,

741
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,810
cause it gives you the opportunity to,
uh,

742
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,560
discover things and to work on advancing
knowledge.

743
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,630
Now if you want to people,
it's not badly paid.

744
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,520
I disagree that it's bad.
It's not,

745
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,700
I mean people that if you want to make a
huge amounts of money,

746
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:05,500
of course you go to Wall Street or 
whatever.

747
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,334
But,
uh,

748
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,523
the issue with a women in physics,
I mean physics departments certainly in 

749
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,900
that you states,
uh,

750
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,060
uh,
vary tremendously focused on,

751
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,160
I'm trying to do something about this.
Uh,

752
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,830
the,
uh,

753
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,120
we believe probably it's a question of 
maybe it's role models to be able to see

754
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,270
a successful women scientists.
And so people believe that they can have

755
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:28,684
a career in it.
We really do wish women to come into 

756
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:31,690
physics.
And,

757
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:34,160
uh,
there's a problem of,

758
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,023
of,
of women becoming discouraged and 

759
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:38,690
dropping out at each stage of the 
process.

760
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,360
These are experiments that they have 
done in,

761
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,194
in Addis and sob musicians.
And they have started toward this and 

762
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,790
behind the curtain it changes 
dramatically the motto and the number of

763
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:50,624
women that they are accepted.
So it just shows the days a lot of 

764
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:57,590
discrimination and it's not a evil 
disagreements a side.

765
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,590
I think it's just subconscious.
We are a club,

766
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,480
you know,
we men behave in a certain way.

767
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:06,830
We understand each other better.
We don't understand why men very well,

768
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,753
you know.

769
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,480
So Fraser,
your late wife was a scientist.

770
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,430
Yes.
As we all your two daughters.

771
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,670
Yes.
What's your answer on this?

772
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:16,504
Gender risky.
Why does it happen that we don't have 

773
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,770
enough women?
And what can you do about it?

774
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,383
Well,
I think it's a changing environment and 

775
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:25,294
um,
I think we will see over the next 50 

776
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:27,814
years a dramatic change.
If I spec express it in terms of my own 

777
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:33,820
family,
I think my two daughters who are sitting

778
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:37,480
in this audience with phds in chemistry 
are,

779
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:38,314
um,
living in a much different social and 

780
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,133
home background.
And even myself and my wife where they 

781
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:44,944
are supported by a husbands who are 
playing a big role in running the 

782
00:42:49,181 --> 00:42:50,720
family,
looking after the children.

783
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:51,554
And so I think we've seen social changes
that will make it very much easier for 

784
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:57,170
women to participate in the,
uh,

785
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,380
follow the rules of science.
Um,

786
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,233
and so I'm very optimistic that it's 
going to come about maybe one year in 

787
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,210
the future there'll be seven women 
sitting around this table,

788
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,303
optimistic comments.
And I think we can end that particular 

789
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,940
area of Asher just want to end by saying
of course.

790
00:43:14,941 --> 00:43:15,774
Um,
normally we would hope to be joined at 

791
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:20,130
the table by the laureate for literature
and this air force.

792
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,410
It was a Bob Dylan.
I should also say,

793
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:23,244
actually,
of course we don't have with us 

794
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:28,851
Professor Yoshinori Ohsumi who is the 
Nobel laureate in medicine or physiology

795
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:30,360
and dark.
Congratulations.

796
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:32,970
Go to him too.
But in terms of Bob Dylan,

797
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,833
um,
there have been some comments saying 

798
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:40,590
that the songwriter perhaps shouldn't 
have been considered in this category of

799
00:43:40,591 --> 00:43:43,570
a literature prize.
John,

800
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,990
Pierre,
you reacted this.

801
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:47,670
So what do you think

802
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,500
our law,
I like him as a senior.

803
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,334
I liked the music,
but I also have difficulties to believe 

804
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:54,970
that,
uh,

805
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,790
there are no writers,
you know,

806
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,153
very recalling,
recognized as writers who don't deserve 

807
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:02,880
the pies as well.

808
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,330
All right.
Very diplomatic answer.

809
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:08,000
Perhaps a thing that,
uh,

810
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,300
anybody else bumped into.
Yeah,

811
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,480
I think it's fantastic that Bob Dylan 
got this award.

812
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:13,230
I mean,
he,

813
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,063
his poems,
his songs were so important and 

814
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,230
influential for whole generation.
You know,

815
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:20,064
when I was a student,
I had these records and I still know 

816
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:25,020
every one of it.
It's,

817
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,913
it's great.
And when it was announced in a typical 

818
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,490
laboratory like mine,
every Laborde,

819
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,130
he has his own music and

820
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,650
within a minute they all switched to Bob
Dylan.

821
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,103
Oh,
really?

822
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,420
He said he was speechless when he 
received being awarded.

823
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:41,920
The one

824
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,630
that's it's influence is boards 
influence people,

825
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:45,480
you know,
what,

826
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,430
you know,
it seems to me that's later.

827
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,660
Okay.
Good Choice Professor Castilla it's,

828
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:52,130
I think you're a big fan of personal 
point of view.

829
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:56,480
When I heard that the literature prize 
being awarded to bop little,

830
00:44:56,481 --> 00:44:57,620
I thought,
wow,

831
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,380
that's the greatest decision I've ever 
heard of.

832
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:07,990
Why I love Dylan and his and his music 
and songs.

833
00:45:08,421 --> 00:45:11,960
I really grew up,
I essentially grew up with it.

834
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:15,030
Do you do Karaoke for Bob didn't have 
Bob Dylan.

835
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,080
I once I once tried it,

836
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,520
I mean I can't see,
you don't want to give us a nice town.

837
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,670
Absolutely not.
Mac can't sing

838
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,710
heretical to say about Bob Dylan,
which is,

839
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:32,700
I think we've spent far too much time 
talking about Bob Dylan.

840
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,480
Well,
I don't mean here,

841
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,351
right?
I mean,

842
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:39,090
just generally,
you know,

843
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,120
is he calming?
Isn't it you calming?

844
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,410
I actually don't care.
I mean,

845
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:47,190
he didn't come.
I mean it seems to me I have,

846
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,480
it may have been a fine choice,
but uh,

847
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,733
um,
probably if he had come he would have 

848
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:57,790
sucked all the oxygen out of the event.
So this is partly,

849
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,650
I think,
good thing he didn't.

850
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,893
Well,
I show 'em take up your recommendation 

851
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,040
and stop talking about any factions,
a movie.

852
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:07,883
We'll stop talking about anything.
Thank you to all you laureates and 

853
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:13,704
renewed congratulations.
Thank you to our audience here of the 

854
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:18,240
concert hall in Stockholm,
and thank you to you.

855
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,373
Of course.
Um,

856
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,800
wherever you are in the world watching 
this program for me,

857
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:24,180
Zane Abu Dhabi and the rest of the team 
or Nobel Mines,

858
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,413
goodbye.
