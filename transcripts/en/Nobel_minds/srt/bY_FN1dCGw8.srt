00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,500
Hello,
I'm Zainab.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,963
Welcome Susie,
magnificent concert hall here in 

3
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:13,134
Stockholm where this year's Nobel prize 
winners received their awards from the 

4
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:17,814
king of Sweden.
This is the first time that they have 

5
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:21,264
come together on television and they're 
joined him in the audience by their 

6
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,380
family and friends as well as students 
from all over Sweden.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,210
We'll be asking them if the best kinds 
of science is useful.

8
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:34,044
Science.
Welcome to Nobel minds and this year we 

9
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:00,884
have discoveries that help with our 
everyday lives that bring light to 

10
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:05,774
poorer communities and reduce energy 
costs that tell us how we know where we 

11
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:11,624
are and where we're going.
The chemistry prize is about seeing now 

12
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:20,291
for the first time we have microscopes 
that can see molecules and the economics

13
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,184
prize helps tell us how we can better 
structure markets to benefit the 

14
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:26,264
consumer and society.
So that's the work of our Nobel 

15
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:32,390
laureates here.
Congratulations and welcome to you all.

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Thank you.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,090
So before we talk about your various 
activities and so on,

18
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:44,924
I want to know how you all found out 
that you had become this year's Nobel 

19
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,960
prize winners and it is wonderful to 
have a rare species with us today,

20
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,980
a female scientists who has won the 
Nobel prize.

21
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:01,400
You want to medicine or physiology my 
bridge from Norway.

22
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:03,310
So just tell us how did you

23
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,763
find out?
It was a bit for Monday morning and we 

24
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:14,331
had a discussion presentation of some 
data and uh,

25
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,193
I was so excited by these data and then 
I got this annoying phone call and it 

26
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:22,494
was a,
a number that I didn't recognize and I 

27
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:25,754
just know I normally don't answer the 
phone stuff that I don't know the 

28
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,174
number.
And then I suddenly got this female 

29
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,350
intuition behave.
I'm sort of formed.

30
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,590
Your reaction went viral when that,
when you realize why you'd won.

31
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,730
You don't sing,
didn't you?

32
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,980
My Brett,
can you show us

33
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,290
one time?

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,873
No,
we have the Nobel prize laureates here 

35
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,380
who danced for joy when she heard she 
got it.

36
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,603
EADWEARD.
Muybridge is your wife a couple of both 

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,310
them.
And also your,

38
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:14,980
your colleague,
Professor John O'keefe,

39
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,843
who is not with us,
you were given the prize in medicine or 

40
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,350
physiology,
but you were on an airplane.

41
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,010
I understand.
Okay.

42
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,843
Right.
So I actually got to know it after 

43
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:26,560
everyone else.
I landed at Munich airport.

44
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,394
I was going to institute and then uh,
I was met by a woman and a 

45
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,373
representative from the airports that 
picked me up and I asked why does you 

46
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:39,490
come to the gate of the plane?
And she told me that,

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,380
uh,
I won the price,

48
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,813
I didn't take it.
And then she said it was a plank for a 

49
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,890
price for the,
from the Max Planck Society.

50
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,724
So she mixed it up.
And then finally I started checking my 

51
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:56,880
phone and then hundreds of messages.
And then one from urine.

52
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,723
Hanson,
he.

53
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,860
No,
no,

54
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,000
no,
she was not there yet.

55
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,790
And he said that it's important.
Call me back and then I.

56
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,590
So that's how you found out.
Okay.

57
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,550
And I'm Stefan.
Hell,

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,190
so you were,
um,

59
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,510
I think you were accessible,
weren't you?

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,030
Yes,
actually I had a project discussion with

61
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:17,864
the postdoc because we have seen 
something new and exciting with our 

62
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:23,610
sharp light microscope.
You will want as a chemist Laurie,

63
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:24,370
as I say.
Yeah,

64
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,203
right.
And actually I wanted to know whether 

65
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,670
this has been seen somewhere else and,
and put down the paper where I felt that

66
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,563
it could be perhaps mentioned there or 
not and I want to start at the paper to 

67
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:38,510
see what it was known on,
if that is totally new,

68
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,540
what we've seen.
And it turned out to be new.

69
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,070
So.
And the phone rang,

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,953
the phone rang and I was surprised of 
what's going on in towns chemists 

71
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,260
laureates here,
Eric Betzig.

72
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,103
Um,
I think you will also see conference in 

73
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:57,530
Germany.

74
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,050
I was find out.
Well,

75
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,893
I think there's somebody here who can 
speak to that question better than I 

76
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,520
really?
Yes.

77
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,520
Will be my son.
Ravi is 15 years old.

78
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,300
So where's Ruthie?
You've got to it.

79
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,960
So.
Hello everybody,

80
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,600
this is Ravi.
I'm bad sex.

81
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:15,260
So what happened?
So,

82
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:16,720
uh,
keep in mind that unlike the others,

83
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,740
my father and I live in the states.
So the announcement is very,

84
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,050
very early in the morning,
our time,

85
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:21,884
5:30
AM night woken up early to do some work 

86
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:24,734
and the phone rings.
I'm thinking who on earth is calling 

87
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:26,864
this early in the morning,
but I pick it up and they say it's a 

88
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:32,270
secretary and I say hello.
And she says yes as Dr [inaudible] and I

89
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,740
say yes ma'am.
I'm Dr Betsy.

90
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,440
She's a little bit skeptical,
but um,

91
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,290
she transfers the line to our in oldest 
running man.

92
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,280
He says,
sorry,

93
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,163
Dr Betsy.
Congratulations on winning the Nobel 

94
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,480
prize in Chemistry along with your 
colleague Stefan Helen Wu Warner.

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,170
And I said Sir sir.
Yes,

96
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,150
I'm,
I'm actually not Dr Ben.

97
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,610
Dr Ben is my father currently on 
business and Germany.

98
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:00,250
And here's his mobile number if you want
to comment

99
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,020
question for you.
What were you doing?

100
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,010
Wake up 5:30
in the morning school.

101
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,770
What I wanted to finish.
Right.

102
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,020
Okay.
That explains it.

103
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,850
Well,
thank you very much.

104
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,580
So that's how you found out then they 
called you on your mobile phone,

105
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,250
but,
but you can see I have a prize.

106
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,680
It's much more valuable than a.
no,

107
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,410
absolutely,
absolutely.

108
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,440
One of your four children I think.
Is that right?

109
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,910
Yeah.
And I'm professor Wu wwii murder.

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,160
So what were you up to?

111
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,310
I was in Brazil.
I had a conference conferences,

112
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,144
scientific conference,
getting dressed ready to go to the 

113
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:38,384
meeting.
And the first thing that happened was a 

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,930
text from my wife.
It says,

115
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,883
turn on your phone.
Of course my phone didn't really work 

116
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:48,980
there.
So anyway,

117
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:52,640
she had gotten contacted first by the 
Associated Press and called me.

118
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,180
So you knew it wasn't a prank call.
Okay.

119
00:06:55,181 --> 00:07:00,181
So two of the three Nobel Prize winners 
in physics because your,

120
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,091
your colleague,
professor,

121
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:04,360
Achan Psyche again is not with us 
professor Nakamura.

122
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,203
So I think you live in California 
because you're at University of Santa 

123
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,253
Barbara,
so it must have been an earthly our for 

124
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:11,104
you when you were told.

125
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,460
Yeah.
So basically I,

126
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,970
you know,
I got the phone call out CPM,

127
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,030
so it's.
So it's him as I was sleeping and also I

128
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:25,090
am the but the sub one day before I know
my is totally to me and know you have to

129
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:29,160
put the cell phone.
Maybe dad possibility.

130
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,330
No.
Yeah,

131
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,860
I left my cell phone next to my bed and 
the answer to this,

132
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,330
what kind of for war and so it wasn't a 
huge surprise for you.

133
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,470
What about your colleagues here?
Professor Ammonia?

134
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:41,600
Yeah.

135
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,480
Yeah.
It might get worse in praying from.

136
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,860
Not Weird in Japan to try and get on the
ice.

137
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:54,300
So many,
many email title.

138
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,270
The congratulations from graduation 
going to.

139
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,930
I didn't understand why to the 
conversation.

140
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,910
So I moved to the final destination to 
Leon and found many journalists came the

141
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,850
exit of the whole farm.
Find that our funding.

142
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,320
So you actually Leon in France where you
found out.

143
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:19,360
So that's it.
And professors on zero.

144
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,253
You are the um,
so winner of the Nobel Prize in 

145
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:22,894
economics this year.
Now I think you'd miss the initial 

146
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:26,260
coordinate because your phone was on 
vibrate.

147
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:28,420
Were you working on some great new 
theory?

148
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,773
Did Not.
I was,

149
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,870
I was working on the European Research 
Council grant or is it kind of already.

150
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,950
We also have to get money.
Every scientist and like my vibrator,

151
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:43,610
I didn't want to be bothered so I put my
phone on vibrate.

152
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,663
So they kept calling and calling and 
calling and then I have funny or the 

153
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:51,500
phone vibrating and I looked at it at a 
45,

154
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,680
six,
46,

155
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,040
46.
Is Sweden what's going on?

156
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,140
So I took it and you're getting then you
wonder,

157
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,160
is that a joke?
And you know,

158
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,003
it was not a joke because you're here 
now let's carry on with you professor 

159
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,210
too,
because um,

160
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,263
you would given the Nobel prize 
basically for various theories that all 

161
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:16,380
come under one umbrella as it were,
of how to structure markets,

162
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,020
regulate,
regulate big business and so on,

163
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,280
to better benefit the consumer.
And I know that um,

164
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,370
when you were giving your ceremony,
I was listening to the citation,

165
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:29,040
they sort of compared your theories to a
baker,

166
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,113
how I'm a baker,
a selling bad bread and has no 

167
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,430
competition is going to carry on selling
the bad bread rather extensively.

168
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,530
And your theory helps set us how we can 
tackle that kind of market abuse.

169
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,150
Oh,
that's why it's free.

170
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,463
There's always dance shows at firms with
child noncompetitive can raise price or 

171
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,120
offer low quality.

172
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,570
So you have to work through it in two 
different ways.

173
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:55,404
One is onto trust or competition policy.
You intervene to avoid abuses of domain 

174
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:03,480
and position on that nurtures which will
raise the price and lower quantity.

175
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,843
Oh,
you're kind of regulate directly today 

176
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:08,750
comes and the electricity in banks and 
the likes.

177
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:11,490
So our work has been to,
uh,

178
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,300
apply Game Theory and information 
economics to that kind of situation,

179
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:16,134
so as to provide series and unpack all 
the work that could lpars those 

180
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:23,040
authorities to deal with big firms.
Can you see now,

181
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,033
um,
areas where we have monopolies or only 

182
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,203
got police where they are kind of 
crowding out competition and they 

183
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:31,674
themselves perhaps or a bit inefficient 
and give expensive products for the 

184
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:36,564
consumer.
Could you think that's quite a common 

185
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,230
problem in the world now?
It's a common probably.

186
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,460
It has always been.
I mean we're still,

187
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,210
today comes connectricity on railroads 
are what we call essential facilities or

188
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,730
bottlenecks which are extremely costly 
to reproduce.

189
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,030
So you have not shown monopolies and 
you,

190
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,290
you have to give access to create 
competition.

191
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,124
So part of our work was to think about 
how to create the access to those 

192
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:58,430
bottlenecks,
but you also have,

193
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,180
um,
you know,

194
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,013
an old high tech industries you like,
you have like Google and Microsoft and 

195
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,290
are large fixed costs,
for example,

196
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,124
building a search engine that allows 
network side is because there are lots 

197
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:12,114
of apps and people want to inter operate
and so in the end you tend to have 

198
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:16,914
monopolies at some point of time,
but the important thing is that a new 

199
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:24,060
firms which are more efficient can enter
to replace those monopolies if needed.

200
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,170
I want to go to the audience here 
because we've got a couple of questions.

201
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,720
Economic students.
Um,

202
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,343
we have one here.
Just say your name briefly and then put 

203
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:33,190
your question please.
Maria.

204
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,020
Um,
when did you ask what do you think it is

205
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:36,854
more effective to regulate large 
entities like Spain or the United 

206
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,500
Kingdom or maybe smaller ones like 
Catalonia and Scotland.

207
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,090
Okay.
Before you answer that,

208
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:48,470
let's just see if there's any other 
question.

209
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,360
Yup.
Young lady behind you.

210
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,820
Just give us your name.
My name is.

211
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,713
You authored that you work.
Doesn't have to be influenced by your 

212
00:11:58,961 --> 00:11:59,794
political ideas,
but as economics and politics are 

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,200
quietly related,
what are your recommendations for future

214
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:12,430
economies to remain as much as possible?
Politically neutral.

215
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,720
Okay.
Do you want to answer that first of all,

216
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:15,554
is it easier?
Is Regulation easier when it's for 

217
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,050
cause?
I mean that's it,

218
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,883
you know,
you can't just regulate parts of the 

219
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,084
financial institutions.
Globalization means you need a global 

220
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:25,414
regular.

221
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,110
Yes.
Question is a very important one for one

222
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:31,430
thing.
Lots of those firms now like bang socks,

223
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,273
she multinationals.
So we have to regulate at a broader 

224
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,550
level.
So in Europe for example,

225
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,463
the banking union which tries to 
actually regulate at the ECB level of 

226
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:43,234
the European Central Bank level and the 
antitrust authorities also tried to 

227
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:47,614
cooperate more,
more and more with each other because 

228
00:12:49,181 --> 00:12:49,750
it's hard,
you know,

229
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,880
Google is a worldwide enterprise of 
course.

230
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,900
Um,
so that's uh,

231
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:54,734
that's a,
that's only point in saying and you 

232
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,773
know,
climate change also ease of use thing 

233
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:59,494
that you have to regulate that the,
at the world level regulated at the 

234
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,674
country level is not going to lie 
because then the pollution is going to 

235
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:09,730
migrate somewhere else.
So you need a world agreement for that.

236
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,050
Again,
in your citation they said that um,

237
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,953
you don't shy away from the politics and
I know that you've been quoted in the 

238
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,800
press gave me advice to the French 
government about its massive deficit and

239
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,650
telling them that they have to reform or
die and so on.

240
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:26,070
So you don't shirk the political area,
do you?

241
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,633
Well,
I tried to be neutral in the sand that 

242
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,590
I'm never comment on 40 titian and 
politics or you know,

243
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,660
support a candidate or anything like 
that.

244
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:35,494
I think it's very important because 
otherwise you are linked to a party or 

245
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:39,244
to some ideas and,
and basically discredited because they 

246
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,274
will say you,
you are saying that not because of your 

247
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:46,900
science because it has those particular 
leaning.

248
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,770
So actually when I got to price also 
John,

249
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:54,370
I wanted to know whether for Walmart,
40th and nobody was able to say and also

250
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,213
they wanted to know whether I was a 
provocateur and the Thai market person 

251
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,553
and they weren't able to send.
And the reason is that I just say what 

252
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:06,190
my son says and you know,
was I like it or not,

253
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:11,140
I just go for it and you know,
and then Jonah is didn't extrapolate.

254
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:11,621
Of course,
you know,

255
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:12,161
they're,
they're saying,

256
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:12,994
you know,
they try to decide soon in support of 

257
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:18,700
this color of this person or this part 
in and that I disliked political

258
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,020
kind of unbiased and you stick to your 
science,

259
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:23,030
but you do have very strong political 
opinions.

260
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:23,864
For instance,
you've been quoted as saying that you 

261
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:25,484
think the euro is a flawed currency and 
do you believe in what could loosely be 

262
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:33,260
described as a EU?
EU superstate your big federalist?

263
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,660
I'm a big fit out is.
Yes,

264
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,810
that's right.
I mean do you always on institutions how

265
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,220
little bit weak.
So it's a currency union,

266
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:41,054
but at the same time you don't have the 
institution which goes through is a 

267
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,383
currency union like the US for example,
or us as a currency union but also as a 

268
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:48,284
common budget has common lowe's and we 
don't have that in Europe and I would 

269
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:55,100
like to have that in Europe as well.
Now it's a bit difficult to do right now

270
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:55,934
because there's such a difference 
between a northern Europe and south 

271
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,443
Europe.
That's,

272
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,160
we should have done that earlier of 
course.

273
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,630
But hopefully that will.

274
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,080
But you say you're a big federal.
It is,

275
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,040
but I mean,
you know,

276
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,790
you look around European countries at 
the moment and you know,

277
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,653
you in the phone nasional in France did 
very well with the parliamentary 

278
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:17,130
elections.
We have the UK Independence Party in the

279
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:17,520
United Kingdom.
Uh,

280
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,353
your,
your opinions perhaps a slightly going 

281
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,390
against the tide of public opinion in 
Europe,

282
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,451
right?
I'm afraid.

283
00:15:22,451 --> 00:15:24,700
So I mean,
it's true that Jemena in Sweden,

284
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:25,534
you see what's happening and it's 
happening almost in every country in 

285
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:28,894
Europe where you rehab the casino for 
big countries and the parties and it's 

286
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,590
very hard to understand them and we 
should,

287
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:35,424
it,
we should understand the word story is 

288
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:41,250
leading you a is leading us and people 
just don't fly on.

289
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,930
And also that very bad economics and all
of those parties,

290
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,360
those extremist parties,
I've terrible economics,

291
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:47,770
but people don't realize that.

292
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,700
Edward,
let's turn to what you did.

293
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,290
You did.
It was divided into two,

294
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,920
the price between your work and 
professor o'keeffe's.

295
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,790
And um,
since he's not here,

296
00:15:55,791 --> 00:16:00,791
just to sort of paraphrase that he 
identified what are known as place cells

297
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,023
working with rats,
which kind of tells us about the 

298
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:04,994
workings of the inner gps in our brains 
that tell us how we know where we are 

299
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,803
and where we're going and how we store 
that information so we can use it for 

300
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:17,510
the next time.
Yeah.

301
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,080
So tell us,
tell us more about why his discovery was

302
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,420
so significant.
You muybridge,

303
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,790
you listen to the small electrical 
pulses in the brain and the brain says,

304
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:32,290
because they talk about sending 
electrical pulses and one such a pulse,

305
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,260
you can magnify a soda,
it's a 10,000,

306
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,094
20,000
a more in amplitude and then you can 

307
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,470
listen to it and then a place that would
be silence,

308
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:45,410
silence,
silence,

309
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,493
pop,
pop,

310
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,673
pop,
pop,

311
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,693
pop,

312
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,120
and whenever the rat is coming back to 
certain place in the environment,

313
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,163
you had the same popcaan sound like a 
popcorn bag in the microwave oven and 

314
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,103
it's such a beautiful sound for us and 
we've got about half a million to a 

315
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:09,020
million place cells in our brains in the
hippocampus at least,

316
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,270
which is somewhere near the temples.
Is that right?

317
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:13,104
Yeah.
Just somewhere that you identified a 

318
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:20,481
separate set of nerve cells involved in 
navigation which are activated when Irak

319
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,500
passes certain locations.
Hence the grid cells.

320
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,210
So just you tell us about those.

321
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,253
Yeah,
so the difference is that the place of 

322
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,910
subtle Keith discovered they are usually
active at one location.

323
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,890
The sales,
what we discovered,

324
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:39,000
we call them grid cells because they are
active at many locations.

325
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:42,660
And those many locations form agreed 
very,

326
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,494
very periodic map or the environment.
So it's almost like a coordinate system 

327
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,010
a while you have points that

328
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,450
are at regular distances.

329
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,393
Sure.
And since we're talking about useful 

330
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:54,950
science,
this discovery,

331
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:56,930
helping us understand how the brain 
works,

332
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:59,780
but do we know illnesses like brain 
diseases like Alzheimer's,

333
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:03,020
that sense of space and where you're 
going is one of the first things to go.

334
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:06,830
So what kind of application might your 
discovery health,

335
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:08,770
Alzheimer's and other mental.

336
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,713
Yeah,
I would like to see two things about 

337
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:11,514
that.
First of all,

338
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,383
a dot area that contains those cells,
that's usually the first one to be 

339
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,374
affected in Alzheimer's disease and you 
get a problems with a navigation and so 

340
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,853
on.
But so it's very important for 

341
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:23,964
Alzheimer,
but it also say that it's perhaps even 

342
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:27,504
more important because it allows us to 
understand the basic principles of how 

343
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:34,320
the brain works.
So these cells are so easy to measure.

344
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,130
It's actually provided a window into the
working principles of the brain.

345
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,353
And I think this is basic research.
We understand how the brain works and 

346
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:43,404
then in the future I can go and t will 
also understand other diseases because 

347
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:50,190
we get to the fundamental principles of 
the brain,

348
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,800
like what are the diseases,
schizophrenia,

349
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,320
depression,
anxiety disorders,

350
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,320
the whole spectrum because they all 
depend on,

351
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,680
on some,
uh,

352
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,350
a rather small number of the working 
principles that is used by the brain.

353
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,050
Wonderful.
Let's say that sauce.

354
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,770
Yes.

355
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,221
And,
and,

356
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:09,054
and the interesting thing is,
well then resend to hear that if you 

357
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,260
have a window and you can put the 
window,

358
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,430
just remove part of the skull and put 
the window and use these guys.

359
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,550
Microscopes,
I'm just,

360
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,033
we'll come to these guys microscopes and
go to the audience who's got a question 

361
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:27,290
for the most,
is this dynamic duo.

362
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,030
Obviously the two of you working 
together and was very successful,

363
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,060
but maybe you can tell us a little bit 
more.

364
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:35,894
How is it if your partner,
your colleague at work is at the same 

365
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:40,604
time,
your wife or husband infused seed or 

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,910
each other?
All the time?

367
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,243
I can tell you one thing at least I 
don't have to sit home and then get the 

368
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,250
critics.
Why isn't a dinner

369
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,780
finished my bread?
You are,

370
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,623
as I said,
a rare species because there are very 

371
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:03,761
few women at this table sign with 
scientists.

372
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:14,100
I will use more exact scientific,
precise language.

373
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,520
You are the only female amongst these 
Nobel laureates.

374
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,970
That's true and I often sit around this 
table when I've done this program in the

375
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,180
false and they're a new female science 
laureate,

376
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,520
so I have to ask you,
why is it that you know,

377
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,720
particularly at the top of the pyramid 
in the scientific community and academic

378
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,670
institutions,
there are very few.

379
00:20:32,671 --> 00:20:35,370
My brother even in your own country,
Norway.

380
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,523
No,
that's not part of my background in 

381
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:41,484
science,
so I have to just pick it up and of 

382
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,530
course when,
when when you need to.

383
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,843
When when you get such a price,
you are sort of top of a pyramid and in 

384
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:53,764
order to come to that pyramid you need a
pool and the pool you need is a lot of 

385
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:04,201
women here and then it's become sharper 
and sharper up to the top.

386
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:10,050
So it's just about we need to get more 
women interested and also more women who

387
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,250
can trust themselves so that I think I'm
good enough to win the Nobel prize.

388
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,210
Why not?
But uh,

389
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,940
to,
to be in science,

390
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:22,774
you have to work a lot,
you have to travel a lot and especially 

391
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:30,610
a mom and here is unlike their bias,
but especially a mom who doesn't want to

392
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:35,611
leave the chamber conferences when and 
girls were very small and,

393
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,410
and leaving a baby while you are 
breastfeeding.

394
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:39,460
You don't do that.
It's,

395
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
it's,
it's painful.

396
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:44,070
I've tried it once and never ever again.
Any other comments from here,

397
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,973
Eric,
but thick.

398
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,380
My wife and I,
uh,

399
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,080
met at Janelia.
She's a neuroscientist.

400
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:49,914
And same thing is,
is that it's a two heads or even though 

401
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,090
she's in a different field than I am,
you know,

402
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:57,924
two heads are better than one.
There's sort of common principles that 

403
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:01,314
we can help each other out at work and 
we can help with the child rearing and 

404
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,040
tag team take off,
you know,

405
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:07,883
time is necessary for the kids.
But one thing we don't do is no pillow 

406
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,930
talk about science.

407
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,553
Once we get home,
sciences will tell us where the rubbish 

408
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:22,480
out and that kind of conversation.
We want a stress free environment.

409
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,730
And Professor Mona your views on this.

410
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,863
Well,
what I see happening is some 

411
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,663
improvements in these numbers over time.
I bet if you looked at those numbers 10 

412
00:22:31,371 --> 00:22:32,204
years ago,
you see that there are better now 

413
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,333
because some of these new policies that 
are being put in place to help with 

414
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:40,880
child rearing that or help with sort of 
alternative ways of,

415
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,030
of helping across this barrier.
So we're working hard on it.

416
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:44,983
We're,
we're working very hard to get more 

417
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:50,090
women in at high levels of the professor
at,

418
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,320
at,
in the United States.

419
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,763
I think.

420
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,990
Cool.
Definitely in Germany,

421
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:54,824
I think the number of female students in
physics and chemistry has gone up 

422
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,980
substantially.
So when I started out of 100 students,

423
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:04,220
we have maybe two or three little women.
Now it's 20.

424
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,790
Your Chancellor Angela Merkel is a 
scientist?

425
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:07,680
Yes.
Excellent.

426
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,240
Is wonderful module there.
Yes.

427
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,740
And she works.
She's a scientist too,

428
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:13,030
didn't she?
She didn't just study it.

429
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:14,110
Yes.
That's great.

430
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,400
What about the experience in Japan,
women scientists in Japan,

431
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,563
how do they do

432
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,760
in terms of the statistics?
Well,

433
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,800
we are doing.
The development are only 80 percent.

434
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:32,090
Eight percent of the women in my 
university.

435
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,360
He know where you're immersed.
You are per se so.

436
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,720
Well one of the top level university,
but still

437
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,820
eight percent women.
Natural Universe where you will.

438
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,213
Yeah.
Thank.

439
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,040
So let's

440
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,873
turn to the chemist laureate.
So you basically working independently 

441
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,040
came up with a solution to make 
microscopes work much better so that now

442
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:02,780
for the first time we can look inside 
cells to see molecules,

443
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,973
but how did you do that?
Because I mean microscopes had been 

444
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:06,464
around for ages.
The prize recognizes super resolution 

445
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,173
fluorescence microscopy and some people 
might not know what this fluorescents 

446
00:24:14,391 --> 00:24:18,500
business areas so I can illustrate it a 
little bit and give you a few of the key

447
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,060
ideas here.
Here's a liquid.

448
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,610
There are a lot of molecules in this 
vial,

449
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,600
maybe 10 to the 24th.
That's one with 24 Zeros after it,

450
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,033
but inside this we also have some 
fluorescent molecules that and we want 

451
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:35,480
to be able to see these molecules.
So let me just illustrate the idea.

452
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:39,170
I have a green laser here,
a green laser pointer that's a green,

453
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:40,004
very green,
but when I shine it through this 

454
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:42,794
solution,
the fluorescent molecules inside give 

455
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:46,304
you a more of a yellowish color and you 
can see that I can just like a light 

456
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,150
saber only where the beam is going.

457
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,570
It's hitting the molecules and the 
molecules are sending light back.

458
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,220
That's what we mean by fluorescents.
And so what we are doing,

459
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:06,221
and these microscopes is using lasers 
and this property I just showed that the

460
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,110
molecules themselves,
he meant like bags,

461
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,003
like little tiny light sources and it's 
because 25 years ago one of the ways to 

462
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,490
achieve super resolution relies on being
able to see single molecules.

463
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,330
That's what I worked on.
And you can actually now with your eyes,

464
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,630
look into a microscope and see the light
coming from individual molecules.

465
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,580
So Eric,
I mean the,

466
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:29,414
the,
the chemistry prize was awarded because 

467
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
it's about seeing.
But what is this seeing actually do.

468
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:37,963
What kind of diseases might it help is I
always feel uncomfortable when media 

469
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:47,681
tries to project us into technologies.
It will have applications,

470
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:52,160
but it's very difficult to predict.
That's one of the things with technology

471
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:52,994
in general is it's very difficult to 
predict what the ultimate ultimate 

472
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:56,954
benefits will be.
And you're willing to predict he's 

473
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:01,684
winning.

474
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,003
Question to ask.
I mean we have used the high resolution 

475
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,150
in order to find out key processes going
on.

476
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:15,200
For example,
in HIV.

477
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,620
So biology,
I'm quite quite confident,

478
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:22,640
will be strongly impacted by the 
microscopes that we have invented,

479
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,043
professor managing feel queasy about 
answering what kind of future 

480
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,290
applications.
Well,

481
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,483
the real point is you see in much 
greater detail than what you saw before 

482
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,983
and you see surprises,
you see things that weren't necessarily 

483
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:36,014
expected and all of these super 
resolution methods or something like 

484
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,063
recognizing that the cell is something 
like a little city where there are many 

485
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,280
molecules,
proteins that are moving around a little

486
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:51,360
motors and DNA and RNA and so forth.
But if you only look at it very,

487
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,880
very high up in the sky where it's only 
fuzzy,

488
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,923
you don't see what's going on,
super resolution lets you see far more 

489
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:01,920
clearly that is a factor five,
10 or more better already.

490
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,233
And the point is then you see surprises.
Things that we didn't understand about 

491
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:09,870
the cell biology.
You've benefited from these guys.

492
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,813
Discovery something

493
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,460
general.
Yes.

494
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,463
The advances in microscopy and 
especially the advances that allow 

495
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,430
microscopes,
fluorescence microscopes to be used in,

496
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,090
uh,
in living animals.

497
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,110
Uh,
so,

498
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,943
uh,
the resolution that the three lawyers 

499
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,733
have worked on today,
it's even beyond what we can use at the 

500
00:27:29,741 --> 00:27:31,480
moment,
but I think this will come.

501
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,010
Professors,
Mr.

502
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:36,800
No.
And I'm professor of Nakamura along with

503
00:27:36,801 --> 00:27:37,634
professor I Kosaki you were awarded the 
Nobel Prize in Physics for your blue 

504
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:43,034
light emitting diode,
which made possible a highly efficient 

505
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,133
light source that's now replacing the 
incandescent light bulb that Thomas 

506
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,420
Edison gave us.
So we've had red,

507
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,820
green emitting diodes.
For what?

508
00:27:55,821 --> 00:28:00,200
About 50 years in your blue?
One has been around for about 20 years.

509
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,363
You combine the blue with the red and 
the green and perhaps you can show us 

510
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,500
what happens professor knocking.
Laura.

511
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,530
Yeah,
a biscuit.

512
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,190
We thought a brewer,
you cannot make quite big.

513
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,490
The is of the led lighting.
Is that a point to point?

514
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:15,324
Right source.
So we can't use dance to make any kind 

515
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:21,370
of shape of light.
For example,

516
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,120
this is a site coordinator,
but he puts some kind of feed into it to

517
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,030
be from.
They found gonna ship.

518
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,370
This is the best,
a right to enforce the act art,

519
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,320
you know,

520
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,770
so this kind of lights is amazing 
because it's brought a,

521
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,793
the potential of a cheap source of 
energy for communities all over the 

522
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:43,274
world that don't have access tonight.
And it's also bringing down energy 

523
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:48,340
bills.
Yes.

524
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,140
Because it's a more efficient use of

525
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,313
yes,
at this is can't be opened by buttery 

526
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,470
mobile cell phone,
ipad or kind of mobile device.

527
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:01,260
Have to use this thing to make these 
sprays.

528
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,410
And also most important.
Is that a southern country?

529
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,610
So the country?
Yeah.

530
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,800
No electricity,
only energy source.

531
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,743
Like a Sunday night,
just sort of say and sort of our charge 

532
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,080
the battery,
daytime and nighttime edited it.

533
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,173
So you have solar power,
this kind of device and a battery with 

534
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:23,204
the blue led giving the,
the white light and it's how much would 

535
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,310
that cost as a device?

536
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,183
I see now

537
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,920
$10.
Yeah.

538
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,490
So a person could use that $10 with the 
source of solar power.

539
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:39,160
And how long would that last for three 
years.

540
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,210
Three years?
Yes.

541
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,910
Yeah.

542
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,920
Especially in Japan.
Electricity generation.

543
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,190
Maybe you remember that day in 2011,
they had the big earthquake in Japan,

544
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:06,350
so the above the old nuclear power print
stuff now,

545
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,840
so the new group or a presence,
a bride,

546
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:13,364
the 30 percent of director issue,
but now it all stopped so we have to 

547
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:19,464
adapt another way.
So the led is very important to reduce 

548
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,220
energy consumption.

549
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,460
The they enable price.
It is that electricity lighting accounts

550
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:36,461
for about 20 percent of global energy 
use through the use of your white led in

551
00:30:37,161 --> 00:30:39,470
time.
That could come down to five percent.

552
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,090
Not only do these light bulbs last 100 
times as long as the incandescent bulb,

553
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:44,924
they also contain no mercury and one 
application also is the ultra violet 

554
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,190
light can be used to clean polluted 
water.

555
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,143
Yes,
a buyer a day to use folk are basically 

556
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,043
to kill bacteria,
are able to bias a bias by that virus 

557
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,373
and also to a pure water.
And the Po Po buyers are basically you 

558
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,170
can't you,
you read it back bucket you.

559
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,950
It's amazing.
It killed bacteria.

560
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,160
Purify light on,
but professor like a Marie,

561
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:17,994
you had a very publicized fight with the
corporation that was funding your 

562
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:24,510
research.
You felt that your,

563
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,673
you weren't properly remunerated for the
research that you did to develop the 

564
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,930
blue led,
you would give them what?

565
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,813
A bonus of $180 and they went to and you
could potentially make millions and 

566
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,870
millions out of this invention.

567
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,470
Yes.
This guy,

568
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,100
he's says,
I moved to the United States and my full

569
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:45,934
comm company started the lawsuit against
using got infringement over 30 to 

570
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,540
secret.
So I became so angry about,

571
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,080
to my,
uh,

572
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,650
to my former company.
So as a counter lawsuit I started that.

573
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,553
A lawsuit I guess in my former company 
using the Japanese pop into roll out 

574
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,600
through South Dakota is even if I could 
do embed for company as an employee,

575
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,710
potential rights belong to me.

576
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,620
So the patient rights in Japan belonged 
to the inventor,

577
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,550
the company that employs the inventor.
That was lucky for you

578
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,380
if I have any.
I really meant it all.

579
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:30,410
So it measures so but the but quote and 
I quote,

580
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,310
the judge says,
you know,

581
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,413
how the incidents to be drawn to the 
company if the agreement over the 

582
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,110
document but the judge also same damn 
fool

583
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,180
with me.
You have a right to get that.

584
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,120
These are not brutal compensation fee.

585
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,420
I wouldn't say what it is,
but he was very reasonable.

586
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,830
Wasn't happy with it.
Yeah.

587
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,153
It made you a millionaire.
I'm not talking about $8 million 

588
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,420
dollars.
Not Bad at all.

589
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,433
I mean,
how do you feel around the table here 

590
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:02,590
that in terms of,
you know,

591
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,493
intellectual property and patent rights 
and whether your inventions all used in 

592
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:11,140
the future in a way which is basically a
money spinner.

593
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,590
Do you feel that you should.
We have a number of paths for our stuff?

594
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:15,424
Uh,
most of them are infringed on left and 

595
00:33:17,381 --> 00:33:19,210
right.
And frankly we don't care.

596
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,103
You know,
I mean,

597
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,430
you can either spend your time talking 
to lawyers all the time and be miserable

598
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:27,320
or you can get back in the lab and 
invent something else that you looked to

599
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:28,840
your fault tool company.
I mean,

600
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,600
would he not have appreciated it if you 
invented?

601
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,353
Well,
I didn't invent things for his company 

602
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:39,510
that just sold poor stuff on my kids.

603
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,000
Very unusual.
I started out in my scientific career is

604
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:43,834
writing a patent in 1990 before I had a 
postdoctoral job and this turned out to 

605
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:51,400
be extremely helpful because at the 
latest stage in my career,

606
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,770
um,
I run out of support,

607
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:54,663
institutional support and so I use this 
patent and basically licensed it to a 

608
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,110
small company in Finland that gave me 
money,

609
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,023
hundred thousand dollars in return and 
they use this money in a very critical 

610
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:06,364
period to do my research.
And that nine months of research that 

611
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:12,310
was funded by,
by $100,000

612
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,730
really got me that.

613
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,670
Glad to hear that.
That was very forced.

614
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,130
So your patient patients can be 
absolutely lifesaving.

615
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,860
Yes.
What about,

616
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,030
what about here where you can't really 
patient?

617
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:29,050
Yours is just the knowledge isn't 
anybody trust?

618
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,510
What about youtube?
I think for us,

619
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,483
simple to say that neuroscience is a big
family and we share a lot of both ids 

620
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,860
and a data.
So from our lab,

621
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:44,694
we put data on the Internet so that 
other people can analyze it and the two 

622
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:49,194
reasons.
One is that we give very good data and 

623
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:52,824
the second thing is then we don't need 
that money anonymous since when did the 

624
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:58,530
animal research?

625
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,970
So we've got a question from the 
audience.

626
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,490
My question relates to research in 
Africa.

627
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:05,860
We know that huge successes have been 
made in the West and uh,

628
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:10,910
in my opinion is a lack of collaboration
with researchers in Africa.

629
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:14,550
We just resorted to the outbreak of 
Ebola for example.

630
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,150
How could this be explained and what was
this push to?

631
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,013
Global health.

632
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,121
Okay,
thank you.

633
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:21,830
We'll take another question from the 
floor

634
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,090
and my question was a little bit related
to question is,

635
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:31,110
are experimental science because high is
our main tool.

636
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:32,843
How do you identify that's power kill 
that will turn into a fire because so 

637
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:38,040
many time lens on

638
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,670
something and then because they don't 
have enough elements to pack it up,

639
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,060
sometime that tends to just it on the 
side,

640
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:45,894
but how do you,
what does it get to get the level of 

641
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:49,230
price?
How do we identify it?

642
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,090
Oh,
well,

643
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,420
all right,
Eric Betzig a few points there.

644
00:35:53,421 --> 00:35:54,210
Um,
you know,

645
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,620
because I have opinions on all of them 
but I don't want to just touch on it.

646
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:02,070
But you're a very interesting story 
because here you are a Nobel laureate in

647
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:05,190
chemistry.
But I think in your own words you said I

648
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:07,530
was lousy at chemistry.
I sucked at chemistry.

649
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:12,531
That was my exact.
And in fact none of you is a chemist and

650
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,060
yeah,
well yeah,

651
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:14,780
you all,
you all,

652
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,613
sorry.
Famous your department physical 

653
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:22,450
chemistry but your physicist and do your
more like physicists.

654
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,560
But anyway,
with that,

655
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:25,720
uh,
but uh,

656
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,780
the committee cited to specific papers 
for me to get the prize and both of them

657
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:33,180
happy while I was unemployed.
So,

658
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:34,620
um,
but,

659
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:36,990
but the,
in terms of the spark thing,

660
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,303
I think what,
what you want to do is you want to 

661
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:44,820
immerse yourself in problems and try to 
not sweep problems under the rug,

662
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,683
but focus on problems and outstanding 
problems and try to put pieces of a 

663
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,090
puzzle together to solve these.

664
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,923
And if a good scientist I think gets 
this monomaniacal focus on the problem 

665
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,640
and you may not have all of the 
problems,

666
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,474
but at least in my case,
the solutions have come when I'm not 

667
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:07,620
directly looking at the problem,
but through the subconscious mind,

668
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:12,621
either I was pushing my daughter around 
in a stroller or so poincare talks about

669
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:13,524
this in his book about how you have to 
just starve your mind of everything 

670
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,060
except the problem.
So the subconscious is forced to work on

671
00:37:21,061 --> 00:37:23,160
it.
And then he was taking a vacation,

672
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,150
stepping on a bus and then all of a 
sudden he had this flash of insight.

673
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,460
It's,
it's kind of for me,

674
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:32,190
I have great confidence in my 
subconscious mind.

675
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,910
I've described you as a counter reaction
to chemist and how you,

676
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:35,744
you're not good at chemistry at school,
but you also had a bit of a kind of 

677
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:39,384
disdain for academia and you know,
life in the ivory tower and if fact you 

678
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:47,940
quit academia research and went to work 
for your family's tool business.

679
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,500
Right?
So,

680
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,363
so I,
I still don't think I would ever be 

681
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:55,410
comfortable in a standard academic 
environment in some ways.

682
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,423
Um,
I've always just wanted to work at the 

683
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:58,884
bench and in some ways the standard 
model seems to me an incredibly 

684
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:02,184
inefficient way to do research because 
you train somebody to excel at bench 

685
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:07,464
science through their postdoc and then 
you make an assistant professor out of 

686
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,454
them and rip that all away from them and
stick them in an office and make an 

687
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:14,664
administrator out of them.
I've been fortunate both at Bell Labs 

688
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:20,460
and then where I work now,
they believe in,

689
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:25,010
in allowing scientists be scientists and
not administrators and,

690
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:25,903
and people begging for grants and so I 
can be in the lab and be more 

691
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:30,780
productive.
Stefan.

692
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,790
Yeah.
We also had a question about,

693
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,920
um,
you know,

694
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,310
for instance,
other viruses

695
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,000
and so on and we're told all the time 
now the antibiotics and not as effective

696
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:43,700
as they used to be.
Does your work in any way relate?

697
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,150
How would you answer that question?
The context of your work?

698
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:48,670
Because before you can cure something,
you have to understand.

699
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,630
Exactly,
exactly.

700
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,473
And I think microscopes allow us better 
to understand what's going on including 

701
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:58,600
the disease cell and of course,
I think to some extent below to allow to

702
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,050
send much better how drugs work.
And um,

703
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,100
um,
I can imagine that,

704
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,993
uh,
seeing things now at a cellular level 

705
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,920
will affect treating diseases 
substantially.

706
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,370
So in conclusion,
Olivia,

707
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,283
do you think that the best science is 
useful science and all these putting 

708
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:19,974
Nobel laureates we have around.
What is your final word of advice to 

709
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,690
anyone?
I want to get back

710
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,220
to the question or basic science.
I really think it's so important that we

711
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:32,054
also spend efforts around understanding 
things where we don't know what it will 

712
00:39:36,351 --> 00:39:41,000
be useful for because the,
in this specialty perhaps we'll see that

713
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:42,220
in neuroscience.
I mean,

714
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,380
you understand,
you don't understand the brain enough to

715
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:47,210
know actually what is useful.
But,

716
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,063
uh,
I think as we get more knowledge about 

717
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:53,540
how the brain works,
I know that it will be important for,

718
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,410
for the whole range of psychiatry,
neurology and so on

719
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,420
and for us professional.
But there's,

720
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,700
there's many ways in which these two 
ideas are intermingled.

721
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,170
A.
Absolutely.

722
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:08,210
I agree that basic science is very 
important,

723
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,283
but sometimes basic science can be 
driven by some technological need and 

724
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:17,510
there's many examples of where the 
technology has an has something new that

725
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:20,090
needs to be invented and that sort of 
gets people's mind thinking,

726
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,183
uh,
I can come up with an idea that might 

727
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,293
make that work and then new science 
comes out of the ability of that new 

728
00:40:26,181 --> 00:40:27,014
method to see new things,
the original single molecule where it 

729
00:40:29,491 --> 00:40:30,324
came from,
work at IBM on exploring an optical 

730
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:36,560
storage scheme and the fundamental 
limits of a completely different optical

731
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,560
storage game completely out in left 
field and,

732
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:40,394
and we,
we saw a single molecules as a result 

733
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:44,590
and then that blossomed into 
applications.

734
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,433
In biology.
It's,

735
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,603
you just have to have both,
but you have to have some interplay 

736
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:52,460
between them and stable,
continued funding for the basic science.

737
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,780
What about your advice to budding Nobel 
scientists and economists because you're

738
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,440
a real superstar now in France.
Wherever you go,

739
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:01,274
you're stopped,
you know,

740
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,090
photographs and resident and we know the
Prime Minister Manuel Val said that this

741
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:07,630
was a poke in the eye.
All these people who were being emptied,

742
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,540
French gallic passionate and so are you 
happy being a French area?

743
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,300
It's trey nice to.
I mean,

744
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:16,610
there's a lot of pride in my country 
about this,

745
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:17,600
uh,
you know,

746
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,483
the concert in my honor,
if I turned on so qwiff and then there 

747
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:25,610
was a big banner on the Cto of my city,
12 meter by 15.

748
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,613
Wow.
The CTO for two weeks and I got stopped 

749
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,560
me in the street,
but in the end,

750
00:41:30,561 --> 00:41:31,460
you know,
it's flattering,

751
00:41:31,461 --> 00:41:34,040
but this guy wants to do is to go back

752
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,873
to my lab and the Japanese and the 
Japanese media have been really huge in 

753
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:43,274
that.
Presidents don't comb with three 

754
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,004
Japanese Nobel laureates.
I mean your superstars on the Uw 

755
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,030
Professor Nakamura,
I mean you said you know,

756
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:54,770
your battle with the Japanese 
corporation.

757
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:55,604
You'd left in disgust and went to the 
United States because you felt that you 

758
00:41:58,581 --> 00:41:59,414
could develop your work better there.
But how'd you feel holding two 

759
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,560
directions?
Japan is claiming you was that great.

760
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,760
One of the great stars.

761
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,613
Yeah.
He,

762
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,580
I don't know,
but I'd be getting bored in Japan.

763
00:42:12,581 --> 00:42:13,414
So that's that.
As I moved to the United States to 

764
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,800
challenge a new scenes waterways as a 
scientist,

765
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,590
I have to do new things,
new talent,

766
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,521
so that,
that is.

767
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,710
I moved to the United States and about 
the,

768
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:24,960
the um,
but that,

769
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:27,160
um,
that now I'm a US citizen.

770
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,113
I have my us citizenship stuff.
They'll find definitely people find 

771
00:42:30,401 --> 00:42:32,860
their might use this or they become 
angry.

772
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,780
Noble Nordic for United States.
Japan.

773
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,280
What'd you think about what your just 
said that the United States,

774
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,010
they're right by law.
I have a rate of a different opinion.

775
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,033
You might get it.
It's like an engineering science and 

776
00:42:58,081 --> 00:42:58,914
know for instance,
you might find the most important thing 

777
00:43:02,071 --> 00:43:06,460
is to imagine the future system or 
imagined the future for,

778
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:09,660
for example,
the Microsoft Bill Gates.

779
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,840
Like,
so what would the itch like an inpatient

780
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:13,674
oriented.
Of course I understand that a 

781
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:18,950
fundamental basic study,
the very important,

782
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,933
but for us the most important thing,
so basic studies to freaking direction 

783
00:43:24,241 --> 00:43:26,840
should we go.
So stuff on him.

784
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,433
I think it's best to concentrate on 
problems that seem to be very difficult 

785
00:43:31,891 --> 00:43:33,430
to solve.
Um,

786
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,600
I think those problems are the most 
interesting problems,

787
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:38,460
the most rewarding problems,
but there's,

788
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,450
of course there's risk in taking a,
tackling such problems.

789
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,020
So therefore I think we have to embrace 
not only taking risks,

790
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,770
but also we have to embrace the 
failures,

791
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,160
especially also to honor those people 
who try heart,

792
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,720
do their best but fail,

793
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:57,080
but don't start with this is a problem 
in the world.

794
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:58,070
I want to fix it.

795
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,380
Um,
that may be like that,

796
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:05,460
but sometimes you get an idea of what 
you want to do and that comes out of the

797
00:44:05,461 --> 00:44:09,570
blue.
And I'm with intuition of course.

798
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,130
And usually if you,
if you do it out of intuition,

799
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:13,983
intuition is passion.
And yet you have to be passionate about 

800
00:44:15,661 --> 00:44:16,494
what you do.

801
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,200
No,
it is about passion.

802
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,550
And you need a vision so you,
you,

803
00:44:21,551 --> 00:44:26,460
you want to have a burning question.
And if you have a burning question,

804
00:44:26,461 --> 00:44:31,461
whatever it's microscopes are leds or 
economy or neuroscience,

805
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,030
then that is to start at,
is leading you forward.

806
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,103
And then you don't care about methods or
if you have a salary or whatever you 

807
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:41,724
have because it's so burning.
You can't stop a passion or an 

808
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:45,690
obsession.
Obsession.

809
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,900
Also,
your psychologist,

810
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:51,240
you should know all about sessions and 
so on.

811
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:52,970
Eric Betzig,
what would your advice

812
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,300
to the potential?
No,

813
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,540
we're just been said passion.
Um,

814
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,560
but a lot of times I see kids in high 
school or college who are in science who

815
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,630
are in some ways pushed in a science 
and,

816
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:11,600
and sometimes their motivations are to 
please their parents or something else.

817
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,493
And if you would rather be a rap star or
rather be a painter or rather be 

818
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:19,694
something else,
just follow your passion because in the 

819
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,533
end the purpose of the passion is get 
you past the failures and to get you so 

820
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:33,020
that you work hard.
Because every field of endeavor it comes

821
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:33,854
down in the end to hard work and hard 
work is kind of like compound interest 

822
00:45:37,941 --> 00:45:38,774
in a bank.
If you work 10 percent harder than the 

823
00:45:40,611 --> 00:45:41,444
other guy,
it actually multiplies year-by-year 

824
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,830
until all of a sudden your experiences 
twice or triple the other guy.

825
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,490
And then you can excel in your field and
then you win a Nobel prize.

826
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,430
Well,
who cares about that?

827
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,800
So thank you.

828
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,560
You heard it here,
folks.

829
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,390
Passion.
I'm all for passion.

830
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,560
That's the end of this exclusive program
with this year's Nobel laureates.

831
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:14,300
We've looked into the minds of some of 
the greatest brains working currently in

832
00:46:14,301 --> 00:46:17,660
their fields.
That's all from the concert hall here in

833
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:19,670
Stockholm.
Thank you to our audience here,

834
00:46:19,671 --> 00:46:20,504
family and friends of the laureates,
as well as students from all over 

835
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:23,234
Sweden.
Thank you to you wherever you are 

836
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:27,260
watching this for me.
Zainab Badawi.

837
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,393
Goodbye.
