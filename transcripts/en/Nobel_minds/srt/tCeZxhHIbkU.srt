1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,940
Hello,
I'm Zina Bodnar.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,783
We welcome to the concert hall in 
Stockholm where this year's Nobel prize 

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,030
winners receive their rewards from the 
king of Sweden.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,100
This is in recognition of their 
outstanding contributions to science and

5
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:15,934
economics,
which have brought great benefits to 

6
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:21,880
humankind.
And this is the first time that they are

7
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:26,881
repairing together in discussion on TV 
here or Nobel minds and the joint in the

8
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:28,324
audience by some of their family and 
friends as well as students from across 

9
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:37,351
Sweden.
Well,

10
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,830
Nobel laureates ringing applause and 
richly deserved.

11
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,650
It's been quite a hectic week I think 
for all of you.

12
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,680
Just give me some of your highlights.
Professor Donna Street.

13
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,523
Well,
I'm the one who had the privilege of 

14
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:15,940
sitting beside his majesty,
the King of Sweden for the banquet.

15
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:16,774
And uh,
it was thrilling for me and he was just 

16
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:22,360
so much fun and we had a great time 
having a conversation.

17
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,450
And you talked about girls just want to 
have fun in your speech.

18
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:28,600
So in seems to be the watch word that's 
just fun.

19
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,693
Professor moment

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,910
highlights,
you know,

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,850
last night.
Do you know when we were,

22
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,903
uh,
having your perceptions about the wire 

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,730
per class and it was really amazing to 
see stables and so on.

24
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:43,750
And uh,
I was,

25
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:49,040
I had to play you the extra seat next to
a point is a con printers.

26
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,940
That's what big Toya.
Yeah.

27
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,790
And where are the Greek quite 
discussions about whatever thing.

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,030
So mixing with the royals or highlight 
for you,

29
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,950
you don't do many often.
Well,

30
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,343
the same with me.
I had a lots of interesting 

31
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:09,130
conversation,
so I really enjoyed last night.

32
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,550
So it sounds like the bank quit so far 
has been the highlight.

33
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,200
Was it for you,
Professor Frances Arnold?

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,753
Well,
I have to admit the banquet was really 

35
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:20,470
quite special.
But coming from southern California,

36
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:25,471
I have to say snow.
It's no the night of the ceremony and it

37
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:30,010
was just beautiful.
Jim Madison,

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,440
for me the most special was when after 
the Er king person at the metal I looked

39
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:36,644
out for my family was sitting in shop.
My wife and son might be tears over 

40
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,893
rice.

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,060
Oh,
and you go,

42
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,841
oh,
your bounce,

43
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:45,710
right?
Yeah.

44
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,210
I got all my bowels right.
Quiet,

45
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:50,740
quiet a procedure yet.
George Smith Miller.

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,793
I hate to be a party pooper,
but actually frankly I think the 

47
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:58,940
highlight was the Nobel lecture is the 
thing that

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,900
will last on,
uh,

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,620
as the memories of,
uh,

50
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,100
this celebration beacon to fade.
Professor Bill Nordhaus.

51
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,820
The highlight for me was to bring my 
grandchildren here,

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,710
my grant,
my granddaughters,

53
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,663
and to bring to the banquet.
And then when they were interviewed by 

54
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:21,240
the news that they were asked was it

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,890
too long?
And they said no,

56
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,020
it was too short.
Oh Wow.

57
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,883
Cause I quite young aren't they?
And their mother was teaching them how 

58
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,111
to sit up,
right?

59
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:29,270
Yes.
But not that one around,

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,070
but all the adults were getting tired 
and they would just

61
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,570
beginning to get ribs.
Paul Romer,

62
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,303
all of these parts were wonderful.
I liked getting to know a few people 

63
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:44,240
here in Sweden,
the Alexander who took our pictures when

64
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,074
we were doing the portraits.
It was just fascinating to see how he 

65
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:47,804
did his job.
I also loved getting to know my driver 

66
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,290
who was a woman and also a body guard.
And uh,

67
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,390
she's,
she's pretty cool.

68
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,253
She's bad ass

69
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,420
because I mean,
you really are faced it and celebrated,

70
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,283
aren't you?
So driven around in your own personal 

71
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:04,050
limos and so on.
Yeah.

72
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,250
Well anyway,
wouldn't it,

73
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:06,760
let's start talking about,
um,

74
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,200
why you want some of these prizes and 
we're going to start with the economists

75
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:13,860
and Bill Nordhaus and Paul Romer.
But let's just have a quick look at what

76
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:14,940
you want to your price book

77
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,853
by studying how nature and knowledge are
affected by markets and economic 

78
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:22,144
behavior.
William northouse and Paul Romer 

79
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,323
designed economic models that address 
some of today's most fundamental and 

80
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,794
pressing issues,
long term sustainable growth in the 

81
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,580
global economy and welfare of the 
world's population.

82
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,523
Professor northouse has developed tools 
that project the economic impacts of 

83
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:46,360
climate change and provide approaches 
for Sloan is progress.

84
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,033
Professor Roma has explained how 
knowledge and ideas can surface engines 

85
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:57,391
for long term economic growth and why 
government policies play a critical role

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,430
in fostering technological innovation.

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,273
Paul Romer.
So just explain a bit more to us about 

88
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:07,440
the link between innovation and economic
growth.

89
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,450
When people look back on this time,
what are they going to remember?

90
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,830
Uh,
things like,

91
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,900
uh,
the discovery of electric light,

92
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,700
uh,
antibiotics,

93
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,870
uh,
the transistor,

94
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,480
maybe,
maybe cancer immunotherapy that could be

95
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:24,430
as big as antibiotics in the long run.
Those kinds of innovations just make all

96
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,920
the difference in the quality of life.

97
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,840
But do they actually boost economic 
growth?

98
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,110
They do.
And you know,

99
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:31,550
we get,
we get income,

100
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:35,240
but we also get quality of life that 
isn't always measured in income.

101
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,403
The thing to remember is that we need as
a society to steer the direction of 

102
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:40,574
innovation.
There's some innovation that we don't 

103
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:42,494
want.
Somebody could find a way to get coal 

104
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:49,130
out of the ground at very low cost.
We don't want that kind of innovation.

105
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,993
What we want is more of a say innovation
that helps reduce the cost of low 

106
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,820
carbon,
zero carbon energy.

107
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,370
But you say it's got to be,
so markets

108
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,850
are not enough to ensure that we have 
that innovation.

109
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,320
Nope.
The way to think of the market,

110
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,080
it's a market works for us.
It's not the boss,

111
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,220
the,
the word the boss,

112
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,490
but don't forget the things that work 
like cities work.

113
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,593
There's a technology for getting 
millions of people in a pretty small 

114
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:16,730
area.
So just copy the parts about cities,

115
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,680
intellectual property and all that kind 
of thing and people putting up,

116
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,700
you know,
protectionism.

117
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,753
Think of,
think of intellectual property is as we 

118
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:24,254
always give these two handed answers.
On the one hand you could use 

119
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:29,540
intellectual property but on the other 
hand you could use science,

120
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,780
you subsidize the research and you,
you give the results away.

121
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,823
You know.
Perfect.

122
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,460
President Truman said he wanted a one 
armed economist cause he was so tired of

123
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:39,440
on the one hand.
But,

124
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,323
but,
but it's still important to remember 

125
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,044
that that system of science that we all 
participated in is a very good way to 

126
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,340
produce discoveries and get them out 
into a wide circulation.

127
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,973
Bill Nordhaus I me your research looks 
at how the causes and consequences of 

128
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:56,434
climate change and what can be done in 
economics to try to tackle climate 

129
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:02,410
change.
I mean,

130
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:07,030
what does your research tell us about 
what's doable that climate change is bad

131
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:10,300
for the economy and that tackling it is 
good for the economy?

132
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,290
Well,
I,

133
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,930
I'll just start with Paul Romer left 
off,

134
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,580
uh,
with innovation.

135
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,820
So we often think of innovations and 
inventions.

136
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,010
Uh,
in terms of the things my,

137
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,190
my friends who have done,
but let's just say that this was,

138
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:24,980
uh,
this was in a,

139
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,800
this ballpoint pen was actually historic
innovation in about 50 years ago.

140
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,120
But these are often,
we think of these gadgets so to speak,

141
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:34,954
or more fundamental ones.
But also there's a whole nother class 

142
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:38,044
which are called institutional 
inventions where we invent new 

143
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,750
institutions.
And in this field,

144
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,853
I think the most important invention 
would be a fiscal system to steer the 

145
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:49,864
economy,
whether it's a tax or another way of 

146
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:56,170
raising the prices of carbon fuels.
This will steer the economy.

147
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,190
But this,
this is the,

148
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:02,050
actually we think it's obvious,
but actually this was an invention of an

149
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:05,830
institutional kind that has been made 
over the last 60 or 70 years.

150
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,760
So you're an advocate of,
um,

151
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,713
carbon tax,
which just basically makes the use of 

152
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:16,301
fossil fuels dirty fossil fuels more 
expensive and incentivizes producers and

153
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:21,650
people through government policies or 
subsidies or whatever to try and turn to

154
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:23,360
renewable.
Feels,

155
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,194
but is that really doable in practice?
What what you economists may determine 

156
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:31,130
is desirable is sometimes not 
politically expedient,

157
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:31,820
was it?

158
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,653
Well,
the thing I would emphasize is not the 

159
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,354
carbon tax,
but the carbon price that you need to 

160
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:43,331
raise the price of co two emissions and 
thereby raise the price of fuels and all

161
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,180
the products that the fuels are embodied
in.

162
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,043
So it isn't just burning the fuels,
but it will be buried in our 

163
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:52,460
electricity,
in our air,

164
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:54,970
travel,
in our ballpoint pen,

165
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,130
in,
in,

166
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,970
in proportion to the amount,
and it doesn't have to be attacks,

167
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,953
but does your research,
Bill Nordhaus actually show that it 

168
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,770
makes economic sense to tackle climate 
change?

169
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,120
You can do it and have sustainable 
longterm growth.

170
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,190
So in a,
in a broader framework,

171
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,720
what we know is that the way we measure 
our output,

172
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:19,554
which is the gross domestic product,
miss measures it because it doesn't 

173
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:23,784
incorporate the damages that are outside
the Margaret such as health health is 

174
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,940
not included.
Whether we die earlier or die young,

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,953
whether we're sick or healthy,
that is not included in our economic 

176
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,730
measurements.
So we,

177
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,633
when we include that,
then we see we would actually have 

178
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:38,784
higher incomes in this real inclusive,
comprehensive sense if we include 

179
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,530
measures that reduce the damages.
It's not just climate change,

180
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:50,570
it's also particulates from burning 
fuels and Satya and poor Roma.

181
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:51,404
I mean you've worked as a chief 
economist of the World Bank advising 

182
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:57,090
governments and institutions and you 
come from a political family.

183
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,350
Your father was a former Democratic 
governor in the state,

184
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,600
became a scientist.
Politician's job is too hard.

185
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,830
I did this,
I was going to ask you,

186
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:05,770
I mean,
yeah,

187
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,470
but you economists can say,
look,

188
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:08,304
it makes sense to do this and to do that
and we need to direct market forces and 

189
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:11,880
so on and so forth as you've been 
saying,

190
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,680
but it's not easy for the politicians to
always do what you think is right.

191
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,950
Oh,
I kinda like Churchill's quote about the

192
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:22,170
United States is just applied to all 
humans.

193
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,580
They always do what's right after 
exhausting all the alternatives.

194
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,950
So you just have to be a little bit 
patient.

195
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,450
But just staying with this idea of,
you know,

196
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,270
what governments can do.
Professor Miller,

197
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,133
you live in Paris now and we've seen the
[inaudible] on the against President 

198
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:44,040
Macron is desire to have these green 
fuel taxes,

199
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,100
which he says are in part to try to 
combat global warming.

200
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,380
Look at the problem is he's hired,
he's abandoned the idea.

201
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,790
Absolutely.
These guys,

202
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,624
you know,
he's tying Haiti to do something 

203
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:54,220
innovative,
signed to Bush,

204
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,940
a people headed to save.
I mean,

205
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,370
there's no way we are going to,
uh,

206
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,080
to keep this vis a style of living.
You know,

207
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,780
I stand up,
uh,

208
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,890
we have to do something.
We already have to do something and,

209
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,450
and we have to introduce some incentive 
to do it.

210
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,730
Uh,
so I think the taxes,

211
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,270
I'm not an economist.
Okay.

212
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,243
But I understand that maybe the tax on 
any way to put some pressure on the 

213
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:23,610
people and say,
hey,

214
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,570
you know,
you,

215
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,420
uh,
you have to reduce your consumption.

216
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,780
So how,
how would you recommend that we,

217
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,703
uh,
we avoid the Yellow Jersey movement in 

218
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,070
if we raise the,
if the price of,

219
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:38,904
uh,
of a carbon is raised because it hurts 

220
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,460
people?
Well,

221
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:45,294
I think the first thing is you make it 
comprehensive rather than focusing on 

222
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,160
fuel.
And that's actually the most politically

223
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:53,980
insensitive tax in the world is,
is a gasoline tax or

224
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,440
a fuel tax.
You make it comprehensive.

225
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,530
If you make it comprehensive,
it's more like a value added tax.

226
00:11:59,531 --> 00:12:00,364
It,
it gets built into the chain of 

227
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:04,360
production.
And then the other thing is you start at

228
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:06,550
a low level and you build it up 
gradually.

229
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,680
You need not to have the,
only to have the tax,

230
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,360
but do you need to have the 
institutions,

231
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,500
you ha you have to have people who can 
accept this and realize it's part of our

232
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,560
system is part of the solution.
So I think just hitting people,

233
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:19,490
trying to do it as a kind of,
um,

234
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,500
a kind of shock therapy is actually 
politically the wrong way.

235
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,690
You need to start small,
start comprehensive,

236
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,620
start universally across countries and 
build up gradually from there.

237
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,823
If I can jump in,
I think partly starts small big 

238
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:35,980
government programs have an up almost 
always start small and get bigger.

239
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,900
The other thing is we need to have the 
whole machinery of carbon taxes ready.

240
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:41,734
We need to talk about it,
but then at some point there'll be some 

241
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:47,440
huge hurricane,
some huge fire or something that becomes

242
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:50,260
a crisis and then all of a sudden 
politicians are going to say,

243
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:53,110
what are we going to do?
And if we've done all of our homework,

244
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,310
then they'll say,
okay,

245
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,590
well that's it.
Let's do it here.

246
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:55,950
You

247
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,030
[inaudible] else want to come in on 
this?

248
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,610
We'll do the raising the price of these 
fuels and materials is critical I think.

249
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,303
But another way to come at the problem 
is to invent new technologies and lower 

250
00:13:12,451 --> 00:13:13,284
the cost of the alternatives.
So that's where scientists like us can 

251
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:22,170
contribute.
We can invent those and improve on those

252
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:23,004
technologies and at the same time then 
we're joining forces with the 

253
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:26,754
institutions and you create,
that will bring us into chemistry 

254
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,073
because I'm Francis Arnold.
You awarded half of the prize part for 

255
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,470
finding green solutions to some of the 
world's problems,

256
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:38,304
like climate change and so on.
So let's just see what the chemistry 

257
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:44,160
laureates won their prize for and then 
we'll pick that up.

258
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Inspired by the power of evolution,
Francis on audit develops new biological

259
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:52,594
material in the form of enzymes,
catalysts that accelerate chemical 

260
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:58,970
reactions.
How Barack is currently,

261
00:13:58,971 --> 00:13:59,804
yeah,
being used in the environmentally 

262
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:01,674
friendly manufacturing of 
pharmaceuticals and the production of 

263
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:09,420
renewable fuels.
George Smith was studying the biology of

264
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,254
viruses that infect bacteria known as 
phages when he conceived a way of 

265
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:15,634
evolving the viruses to generate new 
molecules with desirable properties and 

266
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:20,884
essential part of all living organisms.
Greg winter then harness this technique 

267
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,620
to create new antibodies,
immune proteins that attack bacteria and

268
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:35,570
viruses.
The work of George Smith and Greg winter

269
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,523
has successfully been used to combat or 
to immune and inflammatory bowel 

270
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:42,860
diseases and metastatic cancer.

271
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,810
So Frances Arnold,
as we saw just the,

272
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,160
your work has led to,
um,

273
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,123
a multitude of potential users and or 
what exactly is it being used to 

274
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,070
develop,
do you know?

275
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,420
Well,
chemistry of the biological world is,

276
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,793
is amazing.
The biology is the best chemist on the 

277
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:08,111
planet because she knows how to take 
abundant renewable resources and convert

278
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:13,490
them into an array of chemicals and 
materials,

279
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,100
some of which we've used for hundreds of
years,

280
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:16,934
thousands of years.
Imagine if we could use biology to make 

281
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,433
most of the things we need,
including fuels or agents that can be 

282
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:29,300
used for crop control.
These things are happening now.

283
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,910
You've made institutions that will make 
that possible by having the,

284
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,900
the price reflect the true cost of many 
of these products,

285
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,250
but we are inventing the technologies 
that will make that possible.

286
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,043
I use evolution to do it.
Evolution has made everything in the 

287
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:52,370
biological world until today and it can 
help us move forward.

288
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,700
So I breed molecules like you breed cats
and dogs.

289
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,773
I mean,
give us an idea of what your work could 

290
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,370
really open off in terms of its 
potential.

291
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:07,310
Use it with a little work courses of 
life.

292
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:09,860
The do all this chemistry are called 
enzymes.

293
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,620
You have them in your laundry 
detergents,

294
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:16,730
you're consumer products.
They make your blue jeans look nice.

295
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,970
Many of the things that you use in your 
daily lives are developed with enzymes.

296
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,410
I make them better than what nature did 
for human purposes.

297
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,410
So for example,
we,

298
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,483
several students and I started a company
about 15 years ago that makes renewable 

299
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,670
jet fuel for airplanes comes from plant 
materials,

300
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:44,000
agricultural waste products or trees for
example,

301
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,550
that you can use then to uh,
take those sugars and make jet fuel.

302
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:50,390
So biofuels,
biofuels.

303
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,253
That's one of the examples.
And there are many other examples and 

304
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,520
also for example,
the production of pharmaceuticals.

305
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,443
You've also that that can be used to 
detoxify the process sorts of 

306
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,650
applications.

307
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,890
You can replace toxic chemical processes
that use expensive metals,

308
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:10,334
for example,
that are environmentally hugely 

309
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:13,934
unfriendly to mine.
You can replace all those with clean 

310
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:18,464
biological processes.
I like to say you replace chemists with 

311
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:25,910
bacteria.
You're actually a mechanical engineer on

312
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:26,744
she by trained me.
Did you always have a very clear vision 

313
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,940
of the kinds of path and what you wanted
to achieve?

314
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,350
Well,
in some ways,

315
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:34,184
yes,
I was always interested in doing 

316
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:39,080
something that would help humans and the
planet.

317
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,153
I think it's a pretty nice planet that 
we live on and I'd like to see much of 

318
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:47,770
the natural world as possible be 
conserved.

319
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,100
We won't do that if we don't

320
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,933
learn how to make what we need in our 
daily lives in a much more efficient 

321
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,950
way.
How you did that,

322
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,130
I had to figure that out through a 
meandering path,

323
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,320
which eventually brought me to 
evolution.

324
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,190
But we know to describe to my students 
what a wonderful world we live in.

325
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,053
I used to tell them,
think of the cow as the best chemical 

326
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:09,654
refinery you could ever build and all 
like it takes renewable resources that 

327
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,730
makes milk,
it builds a new one when it wears out,

328
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,360
you know,
I'd like,

329
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,950
I don't know,
it doesn't get any better than that.

330
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,813
Well and we can,
we can link but that we can make 

331
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:21,444
something like a cow out of just adams.
I mean who'd a thunk or a yeast take 

332
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:27,030
sugar and makes alcohol.

333
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,783
Oh,
milk can alcohol Georgeson it's just 

334
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,151
staying with,
with,

335
00:18:34,151 --> 00:18:37,270
with the chemistry prize,
you were studying the biology of viruses

336
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:42,271
that infect bacteria and worked with 
phages phage display.

337
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:45,910
And so on as we thought.
So just explain a bit more to us.

338
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,903
It's a way of creating a huge amount of 
variety of structures and a way of an 

339
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:57,611
investigator choosing a goal and 
selecting from that huge,

340
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,260
um,
array of structures,

341
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:03,980
the few that can meet that goal.
This is evolution up and down.

342
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:06,230
This is what evolution does.
Uh,

343
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:07,064
it,
uh,

344
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,540
it doesn't have a goal in mind,
but if we mimic it in laboratory,

345
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,810
we ourselves can have a goal in mind and
no a idea in detail how that goal can be

346
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,310
achieved.

347
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,143
Phage display your work on that which 
really allows us to generate human 

348
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:25,554
antibodies was then built upon by Sir 
Gregory winter who is not with us in 

349
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:34,740
this discussion.
But he used that and it went quite a way

350
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:39,350
to helping tackle rheumatoid arthritis 
and metastatic cancer.

351
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:40,420
So,
uh,

352
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:43,200
you know,
something which has really been remarked

353
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,120
on greatly.
Um,

354
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,760
I wonder if you could just mention that 
link third,

355
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,700
Greg mentioned,
um,

356
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,610
libraries of a hundred billion 
structures selecting from among those,

357
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,770
the rare ones that will meet,
meet a goal.

358
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,160
So the goal in that case was a 
antibodies that would be fully human,

359
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,410
could be used in therapy,
um,

360
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,273
without provoking an immune reaction 
against the antibodies themselves 

361
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,600
because they come from a foreign source 
like a mouse.

362
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,140
So Greg set out to create a library of 
human antibodies artificially,

363
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,610
a huge,
huge libraries and s and devise a way of

364
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:29,611
selecting those that would have a 
specificity for a desired target,

365
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,510
uh,
that has therapeutic,

366
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,890
um,
important.

367
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,763
Okay.
Just draw the link to the literature 

368
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:39,100
prize,
which was an award this year.

369
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,700
Borhees has this famous story,
the Library of Babel.

370
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,000
The yes.
Yeah.

371
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,983
I mean what you're describing is really 
just like what borhees describes the 

372
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,260
walgreens

373
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,080
that in my Nobel lecture,
yes.

374
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,920
This is nearly infinite set of 
possibilities and what the phage display

375
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,174
does and,
and to lesser extent what enzyme 

376
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:01,654
evolution does is give you a way to 
search through that library that bore 

377
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:08,830
Hayes didn't have right that way to do 
it.

378
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,664
But evolution can take us through that 
infinite set of possibilities to find 

379
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:16,840
the ones that are useful for life.
And for us,

380
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,043
if you think,
if we keep looking for a vaccine for 

381
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:20,450
malaria,

382
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,283
do you think we'll find it?
Cause we've only explored a few very 

383
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,120
small part of the space.
Uh,

384
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,630
well,
um,

385
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,100
maybe you would fund my grant.
You can do,

386
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,090
yeah.

387
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,090
[inaudible] Smith

388
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,400
pure pitch.
Why not?

389
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,980
You're on television.
Well,

390
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:45,340
I'm retired now,
so I'm not searching for grants,

391
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,590
but,
um,

392
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,821
uh,
yeah,

393
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:51,010
so it's specifically the approach,
uh,

394
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:56,011
that I had suggested was a way of 
finding many more vaccine candidates.

395
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,900
We didn't depend on 10 or 12,
but perhaps on 200 candidates that would

396
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:08,671
have a pretty good starting chance of 
meeting the goal of a vaccine.

397
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,000
It seems that a vaccine should be 
possible.

398
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,930
You've all harness the power of 
evolution in your work.

399
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:17,760
And,
um,

400
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,320
W W we've talked about cancer,
which remarkably,

401
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:25,321
it's the first time that a Nobel prize 
has been awarded for advancements in the

402
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:26,434
treatment of cancer.
The medicine or physiology laureates 

403
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,823
will come to you in a moment.
But let's just look at what you won the 

404
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:33,274
prize for.

405
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,303
James Anderson and Tesco Honjo 
discovered how to unleash the body's 

406
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:40,804
immune system to attack cancer cells.
James Alison identified a protein that 

407
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:51,070
acts as a brake on the immune system and
realize that by reversing it,

408
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:56,020
the system would be able to attack 
cancer cells independently.

409
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,123
Task you honcho discovered another 
protein which also operates as a brake 

410
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,970
on the immune system,
but with a different mechanism.

411
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,523
It's the first time the development of a
cancer treatment has been acknowledged 

412
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,270
with a Nobel prize

413
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,470
professor,
Jim Alison.

414
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:16,610
So did you set about trying to find a 
cure for cancer?

415
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,951
No,
not really.

416
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:20,120
I was trying to understand,
um,

417
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,420
the function of,
of t cells,

418
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:23,254
which are a product of evolution and 
then ultimately that ourselves that go 

419
00:23:26,631 --> 00:23:30,220
out throughout your body looking for 
things that out and to be there.

420
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:31,054
And we developed this system,
upsells or way of making receptors on 

421
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:35,950
them.
They can recognize,

422
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,203
nobody knows how many different things.
So she sells her what type of white 

423
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:40,054
blood cells?
White blood cells that the PTAB antigen 

424
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,630
receptors on their call the could 
record.

425
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,464
Does almost anything that nature throws 
at you because they create in your body 

426
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:50,890
or a library such as we've heard about 
it.

427
00:23:50,891 --> 00:23:51,724
It consists of probably you have a,
I'm not as big as some of these 

428
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:55,274
libraries.
We've probably got somewhere between 70 

429
00:23:57,011 --> 00:24:00,260
to a hundred million different t cells 
in your body that can recognize,

430
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,850
you know,
most anything.

431
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,440
So you set about trying to understand 
the immune system better.

432
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,020
We found that there was a,
a molecule called CTLA four anyway,

433
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:14,021
that was the brakes on that system and 
it what a large part of what it does.

434
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:14,954
It stop t cells from pluff rating.
And one of the ideas that I had was for 

435
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:21,040
some other,
I just,

436
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,913
after we figured that out,
was it maybe the reason that immune 

437
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:28,390
system isn't so good at attacking 
cancers because of that,

438
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,210
it stops the t cells before you have 
enough to kill all the tumor cells.

439
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,180
And so if we just disabled the brakes 
for a time,

440
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,380
we could let them keep going until they 
eliminated all the cancer cells.

441
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:40,214
And so that was the idea.
I'm pretty far fetched because at the 

442
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:45,590
time everybody thought that t cells 
divide and they die.

443
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,240
They stop that this is an active 
mechanism whose job tells us he chose to

444
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,074
stop it.

445
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,730
So that was your work,
but what about you professor Tesco,

446
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,643
Han Jo,
I mean you were working independently 

447
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,900
and also discovered how to kind of 
release the brake,

448
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,670
um,
in the immune system,

449
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:04,070
which stops it from attacking cancer 
cells.

450
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:04,904
But did you set about trying to just 
understand how the immune system works 

451
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:08,804
better or did you think to yourself some
treatment for cancer would be a really 

452
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:12,860
good ambition?

453
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,753
Well,
in a bottom my heart because I'm a 

454
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,643
medical doctors or originary,
I wanted to have some hope to cure the 

455
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:28,650
cancer or any diseases,
but the,

456
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:32,520
when I started working in the pd one,
it was just molecule.

457
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:37,140
We acts ten three identified sterling,
the a t cell,

458
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,570
a selection or regulation or that Tisa 
oh gang.

459
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,063
But the one we found,
this is a different break than the Jim 

460
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:51,000
just mentioned.
And uh,

461
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,983
why immune system is working so well 
against the cancer because cancer just 

462
00:25:55,681 --> 00:26:00,681
accumulate mutations.
They become different from the hour 40.

463
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,400
So that's what reason why we can attack

464
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,410
professor hundred I mean there are 
hundreds of types of different cancers.

465
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,410
Yes.
So when we talk about treating cancer or

466
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:13,244
curing cancer can,
can we actually cure cancer and can we 

467
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,670
queue all sorts of cancers or are we 
just talking about some specific ones?

468
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,980
Well at this moment there are civil 
counsel,

469
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,400
which we can cure a some which are very 
difficult.

470
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,380
There are several reasons.
Uh,

471
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,530
one is the immune system cannot approach
to the site where the tumor is located.

472
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,880
Or some cancers do not express so many 
different molecule with them.

473
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,140
Normal cells mean the mutation rate is 
low.

474
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,483
So at this stage we cannot say we 
conquer the cancer to just beginning of 

475
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:03,480
the whole story.
So we need the lots of research.

476
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,713
Professor Jim Allison,
I know that you personally have had a 

477
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:11,210
lot of experience with cancer.
You yourself have had three types,

478
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,900
can't see you lost your mother at the 
age of 10 to cancer at brother,

479
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,510
uncles,
cousin.

480
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,270
And so it's,
it's something that you,

481
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,160
you know,
have experienced firsthand.

482
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,023
But I want to bring in one of your 
patients who were suffering from 

483
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:26,990
melanoma.
Sharon Belvin,

484
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:27,824
who's traveled all the way to Sweden to 
be with you at the celebrations of the 

485
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:35,300
Nobel prize.
And I'm Sharon Belvin.

486
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,373
I want to eat.
So it give us your story cause you been 

487
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:40,820
suffering from or you had cancer.
What,

488
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:41,654
what happened?

489
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,073
So I was 22 just out of Grad school and 
I found out that I had stage four 

490
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,240
melanoma.
So lungs,

491
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,670
lymph nodes and brain.
Pretty much as a,

492
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,830
I was a child.
I didn't even know what life was like at

493
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:54,010
that time.
Um,

494
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,610
every single conventional therapy for 
melanoma,

495
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:58,170
like doctor Alison said,
I mean,

496
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,450
not very effective.
It was a death sentence at the time.

497
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:02,310
We tried it all,
um,

498
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,730
until I was offered a clinical trial for
an immunotherapy and it worked.

499
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,713
Textbook,
I got one round of treatment and I had 

500
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:13,194
been in remission ever since.
I was diagnosed in 2004 in remission 

501
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:19,530
since 2006,
2018

502
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:25,370
[inaudible]

503
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,690
that must be very important to you that 
yeah.

504
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,940
Yeah.
It was weird at first.

505
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,680
Um,
that happened in the,

506
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,620
told me that tumor free and I,
I dunno,

507
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,020
I cried a lot along with her along with 
her.

508
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,943
And,
uh,

509
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,470
that was 14 years ago.

510
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,493
Well,
let's turn to the physics prize because 

511
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,893
that's also had some medical 
applications and a professor Don 

512
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,813
Strickland and Sherif and the WHO along 
with Arthur Ashkan who couldn't be with 

513
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:57,520
us.
And he is in fact the oldest Nobel prize

514
00:28:57,521 --> 00:29:01,420
recipient at 96 by some measure.
We'll talk in a moment,

515
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:02,390
but let's just,
um,

516
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,900
look at what you won the prize for

517
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,903
[inaudible] and Donna Strickland pave 
the way for the highest intensity laser 

518
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:12,684
beams ever created.
Their optical pulse technique is now 

519
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,470
used in millions of corrective eye 
surgeries every year.

520
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,663
And in many of the industrial and 
medical applications off the Ashkin 

521
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,153
created optical tweezers,
precision tools that enables scientists 

522
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:34,200
to grab tiny living cells in laser beams
without harming them.

523
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,483
His work has transformed the way 
researchers are able to study 

524
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:39,330
microscopic life.

525
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,570
So Donna's strickland along with your 
supervisor,

526
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,920
Shit,
nothing wrong.

527
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,410
She's telling the tables,
maybe,

528
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,830
um,
you,

529
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,910
you,
you one half of the price dot ostrich.

530
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:56,803
And you said you saw your first laser at
the age of 10 and it was love at first 

531
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:04,890
sight and there were many societal 
applications for your work,

532
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:08,100
but you're a great advocate of science 
for science sake,

533
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:08,993
aren't you?
Why?

534
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,103
That's right.
I mean there are now applications of 

535
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:12,774
what Gerard and I did,
but at the time we were trying to do 

536
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:17,370
pretty basic atomic physics with our 
laser.

537
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,970
And we also knew that when we changed 
the laser,

538
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,620
a intensity by orders of magnitude,
it would change how light interacts with

539
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:29,220
matter and,
but we couldn't exactly tell how it will

540
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:30,054
change.
But we knew that it had to change 

541
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:34,200
because we were going to be beating 
those atoms to death.

542
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,150
So,
um,

543
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,700
but,
and then down the road,

544
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:39,563
that leads to discovery and innovation.
But my big thing is that we have to 

545
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:44,244
remember to always try to push for 
fundamental science because without 

546
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:49,530
that,
20 years down the road,

547
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,573
there can't be more innovations if we 
don't keep trying to understand the 

548
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:54,114
world up to a very small level.
Do you would agree with that or is the 

549
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:59,430
most useful science?
The best science.

550
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,403
I'll see if I can buddy.
And I think you said in my case it okay 

551
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,643
from basic science to,
I'm trying to understand how t cells 

552
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:09,210
work.
I think if somebody had just said,

553
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:10,320
how are we going to kill too much?
There's,

554
00:31:10,321 --> 00:31:12,540
they would have found another way of 
pushing on him,

555
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,580
but they wouldn't have discovered that 
there's a part,

556
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,190
it's part of the take the brakes off and
then they'll,

557
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,113
they'll do their job.

558
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,233
I didn't take a slightly different view.
It's kind of like this notion of 

559
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:21,784
diversity.
I think you need a lot of different 

560
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,930
kinds of activities,
some of which are very problem focused,

561
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:30,520
some of which are very basics basic.
One of the things we say is that,

562
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,080
uh,
uh,

563
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,950
thermodynamics did I,
sorry,

564
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,813
if a steam engine did more for 
thermodynamics then thermo dynamics did 

565
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,024
for the steam engine.
So sometimes it's not the basic science 

566
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:42,934
that comes first.

567
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,203
If you go to view on this science for 
science sake or the best science is the 

568
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:47,720
most useful.
Uh,

569
00:31:47,721 --> 00:31:48,201
no,
I,

570
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:49,120
I

571
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,860
absolutely not,
I don't believe that the best,

572
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:54,560
the best science is the most useful.
I mean,

573
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:55,394
I,
I,

574
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,380
uh,
I would analogize,

575
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,330
um,
innovation,

576
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,210
uh,
to the phages that I work with,

577
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,650
which infect promiscuously and the,
the,

578
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:07,430
the,
the cells that they,

579
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,710
um,
that they,

580
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,310
that they effect,
in fact,

581
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,920
uh,
they can recombine with each other,

582
00:32:12,921 --> 00:32:16,880
make new versions that go on to infect.
And I think ideas,

583
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,990
uh,
uh,

584
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,480
intellectual progress is like that as 
well.

585
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,810
The applied science steals from the 
basic science.

586
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:24,644
All the tools that we use in applied 
science to solve a problem were 

587
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:33,731
developed by basic scientists so that 
you cannot have one without the other.

588
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,450
And basic science goes backs and you use
the new tools that come along.

589
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:40,020
So it's a back,
back,

590
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,343
back and forth.
And it's not always the basic becomes 

591
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,321
hers.
I mean,

592
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:44,154
I remember the steam engine,
so I think I know said it goes back and 

593
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:50,090
forth,
but some donor said,

594
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,953
I'm going to create $100 million prize 
to come up with a vaccine that's 

595
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:55,460
effective against malaria.

596
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,813
Would that be a bad thing?
I mean you all talking about life 

597
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:04,491
science and this is where I think we 
differ because for me,

598
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:10,230
from a life life science,
he's not very fundamental science

599
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,830
steam engine.
We did $100 million

600
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,800
to develop a vaccine for blurry.
You get a vaccine for malaria maybe,

601
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,200
but you won't learn anything about how 
to treat cancer.

602
00:33:26,201 --> 00:33:28,330
You'll not true.
That's not true.

603
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:29,164
When pastor was trying to solve the 
problem of just how do you carry food 

604
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:35,410
for the French army that doesn't spoil,
he invents microbiology.

605
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,110
Evolution is a great example.
No one knows how to design an enzyme,

606
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,243
but evolution finds the solutions and 
then we reverse engineer the solutions 

607
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,860
that work in order to understand the 
basic principles.

608
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,620
So in that example,
you're exactly right.

609
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,890
It's going to be a diverse,
we are in a very primitive stage,

610
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,140
so we don't know where the uh,
bill goodies,

611
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,550
you know,
if you know which direction you go,

612
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,630
you get something great.
If that happens,

613
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,620
it's great.
But at this stage I think all we have to

614
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:20,621
do is dig many places and somebody get 
the goals.

615
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,100
Somebody hit something.
And then I have to think,

616
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,240
I just want to reemphasize this in these
points in terms of science policy,

617
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:32,663
cause often the other people who paid 
ours as far as science ask us to do 

618
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:39,630
applied science.
They say what is the application?

619
00:34:39,631 --> 00:34:42,410
What is the use of this?
And if you're doing something that isn't

620
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,600
obviously useful,
then it's more difficult.

621
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,463
It's not just an individual project but 
don't have in terms of this whole 

622
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,990
streams there we need streams and 
different areas.

623
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:53,243
And there's this,
there's this story that may or may not 

624
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:58,740
be true,
but when Queen Victoria visited fair day

625
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,290
in the laboratory and said to him,
uh,

626
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,720
what is the use of electricity and which
is like a stunning,

627
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,240
stunning question.
And he said,

628
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,540
madam,
someday you will tax it.

629
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,170
Which,
which may or may not be true.

630
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:22,430
[inaudible] how difficult it is.

631
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,710
4:00
AM fundamentally difficult.

632
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,320
As all of you been saying to forecast 
what direction the science,

633
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:30,980
what we were talking there,
Michael Faraday,

634
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:32,800
the British scientist in the 19th 
century.

635
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,813
Donna,

636
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,220
I think the point I was trying to is

637
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,053
that if somebody came to me and said 
what we need is a better tool to cut an 

638
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,543
eyeball back in 1985 until we understood
that the work that we did actually 

639
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:54,330
change how we understand that the Adam 
and the light sees each other,

640
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,523
we would have always stayed a thermal 
process cause it was the only way we 

641
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:00,420
understood it and now it's not a thermal
process.

642
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,523
And so this is,
you can ask for someone to have a 

643
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:07,710
cutting tool but we couldn't have come 
up with it from being asked to do it.

644
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,820
At least this would not have been the

645
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,683
where do you have one by accident and 
maybe relate the story cause laser eye 

646
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:12,924
surgery,
which was cited in your prize has been 

647
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:19,430
one of the benefits along with them.
How to tackle um,

648
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,603
space debris as well as nuclear waste 
reducing its radioactive properties by 

649
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,750
hundreds of thousands of years.
But it came about my accident.

650
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,110
And that was in Gerard's love though,
was not mine.

651
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,720
Exactly what we,
what we,

652
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,970
uh,
we are talking about,

653
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,013
yes we will doing fundamental science,
but he's trying to understand the 

654
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:46,440
interaction [inaudible] light if matter.
Okay.

655
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,390
Which is very complicated things.
And,

656
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,810
and when my students,
you know,

657
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,480
uh,
alignings are laser,

658
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:56,280
I've got the laser in his is,
we took it,

659
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,150
you know,
to the,

660
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:58,770
uh,
to the ophthalmologists,

661
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,590
look at the look at,
uh,

662
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:02,050
the students,
uh,

663
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,230
and the,
I was just tonight.

664
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,760
And then you say,
wow,

665
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:11,150
you got heat with the laser and did,
but what kind of lazy or do you have?

666
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,100
And the students said,
you know,

667
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,993
uh,
why are asking me these questions and 

668
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:17,910
say,
well,

669
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,910
because you damage is perfect and now 
you have millions of people each year,

670
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,100
you know,
getting,

671
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,760
uh,
I fixed by the femtosecond laser.

672
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,680
So Don Strickland,
in the end,

673
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:36,330
your approach to pure fundamental 
science was actually very useful.

674
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:36,710
Yeah.

675
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,640
Yes.
But it took 10.

676
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,580
It's a 10 year gap there.
That's a,

677
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,980
that's what I'm saying is that you can't
necessarily hope first of an application

678
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:43,814
right away.
And I'm not saying that I don't agree 

679
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:46,784
with you.
You can come at it from all sides and 

680
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:50,000
you have to have everybody working on 
all levels of it.

681
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,073
Yeah.
But sometimes I get a little frustrated 

682
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,163
that the science that just doesn't have 
an absolute application seeing down the 

683
00:37:57,981 --> 00:37:58,814
road does not ever get the million 
dollar funding and baby or it'd be nice 

684
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:06,320
if people would just sometimes say,
I have $1 million for you to do whatever

685
00:38:06,321 --> 00:38:07,670
the heck you might want to do.

686
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,080
[inaudible]

687
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,703
don't a switch.
And it's been much remarked upon that 

688
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:17,924
your the third one,
the third ever female physicist to win 

689
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:25,220
the Nobel Prize and the first in 55 
years.

690
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:30,580
And you have talked about an implicit 
bias against female scientists,

691
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,210
scientists,
you were told,

692
00:38:32,211 --> 00:38:34,170
won't you when you were interested in 
science and math,

693
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,130
these are boys subjects.

694
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,023
I was told by a high school teacher that
at some point and I was stunned and I 

695
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,050
thought that was such a ridiculous thing
to say that.

696
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:44,884
And I couldn't say that to a teacher.
So I turned to my friend who was a male 

697
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,050
and said,
do you know you're into girls subjects?

698
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,020
Because he was so good at English

699
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,043
starting at,
I think most institutions to understand 

700
00:38:56,451 --> 00:39:01,280
and be taught about implicit bias and 
the fact that you might not think you're

701
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:03,770
prejudice scans one type of thing or 
another,

702
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,873
but that somehow your background ideas 
coming into play and that you have to 

703
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:11,060
learn to get around that.
And so I think with effort,

704
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,163
uh,
things keep changing and I'm sure it 

705
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,860
won't be another 55

706
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,323
pharmacists on,
I mean wonder if you would want to 

707
00:39:17,751 --> 00:39:19,490
comment on this.
The fact is,

708
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:20,324
if you just look at overall 95% of all 
Nobel prices since it was started in 

709
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:29,300
1901 have been won by men.
Is that because,

710
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,590
do you think the women are doing the 
work and not being recognized or they're

711
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:38,090
just not being encouraged in sufficient 
numbers to go into sciences?

712
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,111
Well,
in the past,

713
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:42,020
of course the,
the numbers were very low and that,

714
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,100
that is certainly reflected in the 
dearth of women.

715
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:46,934
Women winning Nobel prizes.
But I agree with Donna that's going to 

716
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:50,894
change and it's going to change fast 
because women are doing science at the 

717
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:58,070
highest levels and they make up 50% of 
the most brilliant minds.

718
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,770
So,
and they're doing science now.

719
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:01,604
So I'm,
I'm looking forward to a much better 

720
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:07,520
future professor Mobley actually your 
supervisor,

721
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,880
not only was your student a female then 
shares the prize with you,

722
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:11,760
but you a supervisor.
It was,

723
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,150
yes,
I did.

724
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,023
At that time.
I didn't think anything wrong about it 

725
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:18,534
though.
We are the body because that may be 

726
00:40:20,641 --> 00:40:22,090
because of French.
Uh,

727
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,940
I think we have historically,
uh,

728
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,590
you know,
always accepted woman.

729
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:30,180
I mean you see Mary [inaudible] for 
instance.

730
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,390
No ice.
Exactly.

731
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,320
And usually,
you know,

732
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:36,930
when we were going to a meeting to 
conference,

733
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,120
you were saying you were seeing 
scientist and often,

734
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,680
often,
often you know,

735
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:45,760
it was,
she was a French,

736
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,660
you know,
if you saw a woman first,

737
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:51,150
yes.
In our field they were French.

738
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,110
But it's changing fast and part because 
of the biological sciences,

739
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:58,240
at least over half the students now are,
are women.

740
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,410
I think in the,
in the magical horse field,

741
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,303
certainly doctors,
it's Harvard or even more than worry 

742
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:10,030
about why men don't do it.
Well,

743
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,073
come to the end of this discussion,
just want to ask you all and you've 

744
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:15,524
reached what some regard is,
the ultimate accolade receiving a Nobel 

745
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,300
prize.
Um,

746
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,700
what next

747
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,320
George Smith?
Uh,

748
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,380
well I'm retired so I bought long since 
a thought of what next.

749
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,860
I took a couple of months,
um,

750
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,690
retirement from my retirement just now.
Um,

751
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,553
but,
um,

752
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,551
uh,
I guess,

753
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:43,970
uh,
first one thing that's next is I have to

754
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,913
learn that I don't know everything the 
way a Nobel prize laureates are 

755
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:54,520
encouraged to think of,
but,

756
00:41:54,521 --> 00:41:56,720
um,
my future is,

757
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,900
uh,
really not specifically in science,

758
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:03,800
but maybe in political activity.
I said,

759
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,501
well,
for me,

760
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:10,340
I don't think anything is going to 
change because,

761
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:14,630
uh,
what I like is I science and so it's not

762
00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:17,960
because I get his Nobel prize,
but I'm going to change my habits.

763
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,633
I think on the contrary,
I think I'm going to do it better 

764
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,160
because now of course,
you know,

765
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,270
when,
when,

766
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,550
uh,
someone with another advisor speaks,

767
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,250
people listen,
you know,

768
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,210
and,
uh,

769
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,403
so I'm,
I'm going try to do the same thing but 

770
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,120
better.
Don't know what else,

771
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,653
what next?

772
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,671
Uh,
well I'll,

773
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:45,740
I'll continue to work on the things I've
worked on recently,

774
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:46,640
um,
which are,

775
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:48,110
um,
climate change.

776
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,520
But actually I began working in much the
same area.

777
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,373
Paul Romer did his work,
which was on technology and technology 

778
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:56,900
has brought,
has been miracles.

779
00:42:56,901 --> 00:43:00,020
I mean we're living here rather than in 
caves because of technology,

780
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,393
but just as economic growth has side 
effects that dark side effects like 

781
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,043
climate change.
I also think technology has dark sides 

782
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:14,000
and I particularly am concerned about 
its dark side on our institutions,

783
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:17,000
on our democracies.
And I'm particularly concerned about the

784
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:19,850
role of social media,
like facebook on a,

785
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:23,320
on our institutions.
Well,

786
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,500
I think we've shown now that we could 
cure some patients with cancer.

787
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:30,020
I have the goal of trying to get that 
right.

788
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,290
It's close to a hundred percent.
I possibly can.

789
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:33,801
And,
and,

790
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:34,634
um,
as many different kinds of cancers 

791
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:36,590
rehab.

792
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:41,590
And I'm hoping it to the prize again 
when I'll give me out a bit of a soapbox

793
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:44,660
first.
It's shown that immunotherapy works,

794
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:45,494
which everybody was skeptical.
We're up at four and hopefully they'll 

795
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,840
help bring more funding and help us get 
the work done,

796
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:54,980
but also to other things that may not be
so obvious when I missed to,

797
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:58,730
uh,
let patients have hope that they're,

798
00:43:58,731 --> 00:43:59,564
you know,
death through the diagnosis of cancer 

799
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:03,440
isn't necessarily a death sentence and 
you know,

800
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:05,240
they could actually,
some at least can be,

801
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,610
can be cured and the sec and the final 
one is did I think,

802
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:09,523
I hope that uh,
the pros will inspire more patients to 

803
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:18,110
participate in clinical trials,
which will help us progress faster.

804
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,330
Professor task you Andrea.

805
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,130
Yeah.
Uh,

806
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,410
so I know actually to doings one is to 
get the Nobel prize,

807
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:32,130
but the other one is the age shoot

808
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,220
in my golf game.
Beautiful.

809
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,000
Oh,
well after this week,

810
00:44:40,001 --> 00:44:43,150
I have to say my immediate goal is to 
get some sleep.

811
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,993
But I'm very excited about the future of
evolution and how I have one good idea 

812
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,820
in the 1980s.
And I've worked at ever since.

813
00:44:54,821 --> 00:44:59,650
But there is such amazing things that we
can use to move into the future.

814
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,723
And the combination with machine 
learning and artificial intelligence is 

815
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:08,020
a frontier that I'm going to ride to the
next level.

816
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,100
Don't have strickland.

817
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,280
Well,
I mean,

818
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,113
I have to say that my life has been 
turned upside down because of a Nobel 

819
00:45:13,371 --> 00:45:17,030
prize and everybody wants to hear from a
Nobel price.

820
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:19,400
So I'm already booking into 2020 at this
point.

821
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,060
But I agree with George that some,
some of the people that actually want to

822
00:45:23,061 --> 00:45:25,340
hear from you all of a sudden are the 
politicians.

823
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:28,910
And I do have some public policy work 
that is not about my own research,

824
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:31,850
but about photonix in general and how 
important it is.

825
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,880
And A,
I'm getting that opportunity to speak to

826
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,640
government leaders and,
and uh,

827
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,960
try to explain that.
And in particular,

828
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,053
uh,
we think photonix has a huge role to 

829
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:44,450
play in environmental measurement and 
monitoring.

830
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,570
So we can try to do all these things for
clever control,

831
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:48,950
but we have to know that we've done 
them.

832
00:45:48,951 --> 00:45:51,350
And so we think photonix has a huge role
for that.

833
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,513
And so that's one of the things that I'm
out there pushing in public policy and 

834
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:56,743
poor Roman,

835
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,280
we get to bring 14 people to the events 
here at the Nobel,

836
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:01,114
the ceremony and I brought along 
Professor Caroline Webber and her 

837
00:46:04,391 --> 00:46:08,930
parents and my family and we got married
this week while we were here in install.

838
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,720
Looking forward,
I'm looking forward,

839
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,050
do a honeymoon where we can turn off the
phones,

840
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:21,480
turn off the devices.
Just just read

841
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,600
on that joyous note.
Double congratulations to you,

842
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,453
Paul Romer renewed.
Congratulations to all of you that saw 

843
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:31,584
from this year's Nobel mine's.
Thank you very much indeed to all the 

844
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,270
Nobel laureates,
to our audience.

845
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:37,104
And of course to you wherever you're 
watching in the wild for me is Dana 

846
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:40,923
[inaudible] and the rest of the Nobel 
and mind steam from the concert hall 

847
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,720
here in Stockholm,
Sweden.

848
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,823
Goodbye.
