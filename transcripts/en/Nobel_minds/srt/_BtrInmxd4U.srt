00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,280
Hello,
I'm Zina Berdahl.

2
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:14,281
We welcome to the magnificent concert 
hall here in Stockholm where this year's

3
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:18,560
Nobel prize winners received their 
awards from the king of Sweden.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,083
The Nobel prizes are amongst the most 
prestigious accolades anywhere in the 

5
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:24,614
world.
And this is the first time that this 

6
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:30,260
year's Nobel laureates or repairing 
together on television.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,363
They're joined by their friends and 
family who are taking part in the 

8
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:34,634
celebrations.
And we also have an invited audience of 

9
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:42,140
students from here in Sweden.
We'll be hearing and whether these Nobel

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,973
Prize winners believe that scientists 
should be playing more of a role in 

11
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:50,651
tackling the big problems of the day.
So here we are gentlemen,

12
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,880
and you are of course all gentlemen 
because sadly,

13
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:13,714
Alice Munro,
the Nobel laureate for literature this 

14
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,880
year couldn't join us,
but congratulations to all of you.

15
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,973
Um,
what were y'all doing briefly when you 

16
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,110
heard the news?
Professor Randy Schekman.

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,480
Wow.

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,313
I was deep asleep,
but my wife heard the phone and she 

19
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:28,220
blurted out,
this is it.

20
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:32,000
This is it.
I picked up the phone and I heard a soft

21
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:34,820
Swedish voice.
And although I'm not a religious person,

22
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:36,080
I blurted out,
oh my God.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,720
And you knew that.
That really was it.

24
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,743
Um,
I think you were making your famous 

25
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:44,210
banana toast for your grandchildren.

26
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,340
I see that the banana toast all had 
these seven things,

27
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,203
which is,
and they know it's good to have to pay 

28
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,340
to get the recipe.
Yeah.

29
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,183
Yeah.
I go up to a lot of letters asking me 

30
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:59,490
for the recipe for the banana toe,
the prominent ones that I was there with

31
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,324
my three daughters.
The events of course could happen this 

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,650
year,
but you know,

33
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:07,280
the clock went down home,
uh,

34
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,223
November 20 one.com.
He's doubled number close to zero and a 

35
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,243
whoa.
There no phone calls or he or my 

36
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:27,790
daughters were there.
And a day Ted dropped off.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,530
Nasty thing about the Nobel Committee.
You know,

38
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,663
you will forever be remembered for the 
banana toast when then you go down in 

39
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:40,050
his role.
We do do,

40
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,010
do the banana

41
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,030
fellow laureates in physics,
Professor Peter Higgs.

42
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,200
Um,
you famous,

43
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,430
you don't have a mobile phone.

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,820
I do.
In fact put,

45
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:49,170
only my family knew the number.

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,350
Ah,
that's it.

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,870
So the Nobel Committee didn't.
So how did you find out?

48
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,443
Well,
I found out when I was walking back 

49
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:57,174
home,
I'd left home late morning because 

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,090
although I wasn't intending to avoid 
hearing the announcement,

51
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:07,510
I was intending to avoid these 
subsequent to me dear attention.

52
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,590
So I made sure that I was somewhere else
for lunch.

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,813
And I went to an Arctic submission 
afterwards and we walked home about 

54
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:18,760
three o'clock.
As I was walking home,

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,840
a former neighbor stopped her car across
the street,

56
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,320
came across to me and said,
congratulations,

57
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,870
but my,
my daughter's just phone from London and

58
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:31,270
told me the news about the award.
And I said,

59
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,340
what award?
And she told me,

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,020
so just a woman pastor by gave you the 
good news and call my neighbor.

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,050
Oh,
I say former neighbor.

62
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,060
There you are.
A professor area.

63
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,571
Well,
so you,

64
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,390
you are one of the prize winners for 
chemistry.

65
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,950
Um,
what were you doing?

66
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,420
Okay,
I took a half ambien to prevent,

67
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,000
to Elton flow,
the opposite news.

68
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,210
So it was snipping very deeply.
And then my wife woke me up again,

69
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,900
like landed when I held the Swedish 
accent.

70
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,160
And few people in the background.
Did you get back to sleep afterwards?

71
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,180
No,
the newest people already camps.

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,250
Okay.
I'm Jim Raffman.

73
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,150
Well,
uh,

74
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,910
I was sleeping,
the phone rang.

75
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,413
I picked it up and I immediately dropped
it and it was dark and there were two 

76
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,240
buttons to push,
you know,

77
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,800
the green one and the red one.
And when you get a call at that hour,

78
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:35,150
you kind of know what it's likely to be.
So which one was it?

79
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,340
And you know,
if you push the right one,

80
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,590
maybe you've got a Nobel prize.
He pushed the wrong one.

81
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,320
Okay.
Did they call back?

82
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,680
I pushed wine and I was very lucky.
The right,

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,160
it's a lot of luck to get a Nobel prize.
Absolutely.

84
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,590
Well,
a lot of hard work too.

85
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,600
We'll talk about that in a moment.
In medicine and physiology prize you,

86
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:54,411
I,
one of the winners,

87
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:56,540
Thomas suit up.
I think we were driving somewhere.

88
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,540
I have,

89
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,350
it's flown from San Francisco to Spain 
the night before.

90
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,720
I had arrived early morning and my blood
went to the car,

91
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,570
was trying to find a somewhat obscure 
little city,

92
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,630
Beautiful City called Pacer.
Wasn't happy because I couldn't find the

93
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:20,061
place phone rings thought it was my 
colleague widely assumed I was lost.

94
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,473
Uh,
I wasn't actually even the Swedish 

95
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:27,144
accent because they never reached me.
It was Adam Smith who is the British 

96
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:31,494
accent the British hasn't put and who 
works for Nova Media and who thought I 

97
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,020
knew,
which I didn't.

98
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,040
And as a result,
my leaf call that phone call,

99
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,280
uh,
sort of

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,130
documents.
Yeah.

101
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,073
Documents.
My next you got the news in deepest 

102
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:51,070
Spain and I'm a professor,
Robert Shiller,

103
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,150
one of the economics.
Um,

104
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,370
don't want to sound too intimate,
but you're in the bathroom.

105
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,143
Yeah,
I was,

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,820
you're catering to leave for a 
conference in Phoenix,

107
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:05,870
Arizona.
And I was stepping out of the shower and

108
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:06,704
the phone rang and I thought maybe I'll 
just let it ring because it's too 

109
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:13,920
difficult to get to the phone that I 
thought about the,

110
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,010
actually thought about the Nobel prize 
and I thought,

111
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:19,700
well that is a chance.
So I went and answered it.

112
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,990
Um,
and I was pleasantly surprised.

113
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,340
Can I spell it?
Very happy moment.

114
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,580
And your fellow laureate for economics,
Eugene Farmer,

115
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,703
you're famous in early riser and the 
students here will be very impressed to 

116
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:33,290
hear that you were doing what?

117
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,770
I was listening to Don Pasquale and do 
my back exercises,

118
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,680
but then I was had to prepare my class 
after that,

119
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:41,514
so thank you.

120
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,320
And um,
I didn't come to you Michael it,

121
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,154
um,
but do you tell the son what you were 

122
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,780
doing?
Were you also in bed

123
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,540
chemistry?
It's of course in California it was a to

124
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,690
16.
I had gone to sleep an hour before,

125
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:58,240
so that was pretty much asleep.
Um,

126
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,330
what was interesting about the core,
it's not just the Swedish accent,

127
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,610
there's a lot of,
uh,

128
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,653
I guess a trick call people call you on 
that day at that time and say you've 

129
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:10,000
just won the Nobel prize.
And last year,

130
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:12,010
apparently this had happened to somebody
the night before.

131
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,010
So this time we actually ask you a 
question.

132
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,940
They tell you things that only they 
could know.

133
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,720
Like we got drunk in Italy because as 
soon as I had the news,

134
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:20,554
I ran.
And before I even updated my facebook 

135
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:24,070
entry,
I called my mother

136
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,830
who your mother and I have to mention 
actually,

137
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,360
I hope she won't mind.
So my saying Gertrude levied at 98,

138
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,230
you have traveled here to Sweden to join
a celebrations with your son.

139
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:36,110
Professor.
Love it.

140
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,850
Can we,
uh,

141
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,570
I think she just

142
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,570
[inaudible] is wonderful.

143
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,910
Now I want to ask you some questions.
Let's start with the economics.

144
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:52,380
Are Lawyers,
uh,

145
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,273
professor [inaudible] and professor 
format for those of us trying to 

146
00:07:55,801 --> 00:08:00,130
understand how that last financial 
crisis happened and uh,

147
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,060
worried about the next one.
Just give us an overview.

148
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:05,700
How far does your research help us do 
that?

149
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:06,563
Professor shooter?

150
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,620
Well,
you're coming into a big disagreement.

151
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,100
Lost lawyers agree on most things.
You,

152
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
you've honed right in.
And then where gene and I disagree.

153
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,410
Now I actually predicted the crisis in a
second addition to my book.

154
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,353
I believe that smart people can 
partially predict the market and why 

155
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,140
shouldn't they?
I think it's,

156
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,393
it takes like anything else,
but you have to remember that you're 

157
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:35,864
predicting human behavior.
It involves a kind of broad judgment of 

158
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,850
bubbles,
speculative behavior and people.

159
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,330
Okay.
I should say I'm professor farm.

160
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:46,164
I mean I should just remind people 
broadly speaking along with the lost 

161
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:49,684
Peter Hansen who side,
they could not be with us because he's 

162
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:52,254
not well you were awarded the prize 
jointly for launching hundred in 

163
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,364
thinking to show that prices are very 
hard to predict in the short term and 

164
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:02,580
even harder in the long term.
So professor Fama,

165
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:07,581
what's your answer to the questions?
Can economists help us predict and avoid

166
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,723
financial?

167
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,180
That's true about me.
Use the right words.

168
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,014
I believe that's the state of it,
but I've looked at the records 

169
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,273
systematically and tried to test for it.
You cannot find it in the traces of the 

170
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,900
data.
Um,

171
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,580
so that's where we

172
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,360
great.
Okay.

173
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,330
So what were you way on evidence about 
statistical evidence about predictive?

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,870
There's a difference in perspective.
Now I'm married to a psychologist.

175
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,290
Maybe that's part of the reason he 
always blames his way,

176
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,603
I believe in the unity of knowledge.
And I think there are so many things 

177
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,720
outside of economics that people have to
wait.

178
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,480
Psychology,
sociology,

179
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,850
anthropology,
political science,

180
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,610
and now we're getting new thing.
Neuropsychology.

181
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,310
Well,
well,

182
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,290
yeah,
these,

183
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,350
the what separates us is it 
interpretation of human nature and about

184
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:06,270
the importance of the individual and the
state things that are,

185
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,193
and that's why,
although I think we are both scientists 

186
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,903
and agree on some facts,
it's the interpretation that different 

187
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,880
gene Fama is one of the most successful 
stock market predictors in the world.

188
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,030
He misinterprets,
he says I'm his,

189
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,670
he has dimensional fund advisors,
which is,

190
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,510
can I say this?
Managing $350 billion.

191
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,613
Huge Fun.
Why is he so why did these people come 

192
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,140
to him?
Because he can predict the market,

193
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,003
not perfectly,
but well enough yet to outperform many 

194
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:40,884
other f Eric and he's [inaudible] to me 
is a science who knows how to predict 

195
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:48,810
the murder.
He just won't admit it.

196
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,260
Well now you've brought up the subject 
of money.

197
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,840
So let me,
let me,

198
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:54,963
let me explain.
I've made a fortune out of predicting 

199
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:02,070
what will my students crisis and they've
been kind enough to come with me.

200
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,920
Handsome wafer professor should have 
that.

201
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:05,850
His theories,
right,

202
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,510
but it's not psychology.
He can hate me.

203
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:10,344
I explain it.

204
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,630
Oh,
what this company does is it,

205
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,800
it,
it uh,

206
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,634
forms portfolios.
They concentrate on particular kinds of 

207
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:19,574
risks.
So it's well understood that stocks are 

208
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:24,530
riskier than bonds.
So if I phone or portfolio of stocks,

209
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,700
I can predict it in the long term that 
will out likely outperform bonds.

210
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,710
In that sense,
the market is predictable.

211
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,300
That's what he's saying.
Okay.

212
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,140
But I don't think you can,
you can predict whether the stock market

213
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,360
is going to do something,
but that's a different story.

214
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,303
I mean,
there's a lot of debate here about 

215
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:41,920
economic students,
particularly in the UK.

216
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:45,700
We've got this debate wanting to be 
engaged in policy debates.

217
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,773
We have one,
a professor of economics at London 

218
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,360
University who said,
you know,

219
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:52,900
my students are flipping the pages of 
best sellers in economics.

220
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,300
They want to get involved in policy 
debates.

221
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:56,134
They're not happy with what they're 
getting in class because they feel they 

222
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,390
know better equipped to interpret what's
going on.

223
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,520
Then students of archeology for 
instance.

224
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,623
Do you believe it is your role as 
professors of economics to teach your 

225
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,424
undergraduates in your postgraduates how
to better understand the world of 

226
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:14,800
finance?
Well I absolutely,

227
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:15,634
yeah.
I think Jane and I are actually similar 

228
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:21,400
in that weird real world oriented and 
Jean,

229
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,380
although his,
you wouldn't know it.

230
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,243
Listening to him,
he's had a huge impact on the way 

231
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:29,770
finances practice and it's very helpful.
He's done a lot.

232
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:31,920
Very generous isn't to your fellow nor 
yet.

233
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,623
I didn't use often that you get to at 
Psu who'd been awarded the prize but a 

234
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:45,130
different interpretation and yet one is 
still very generous like that in a,

235
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,330
in his comments.
Students,

236
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,550
I want to ask you,
I know you want students of signs,

237
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:49,384
but does any of this resonate with you 
in terms of the kinds of lessons that 

238
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:54,484
your getting from your professors?
Do you feel that it equips you to 

239
00:12:57,881 --> 00:13:01,690
understand what's going on in the wild,
in your own particular disciplines?

240
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:02,471
Any comments,
fees?

241
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:03,670
In the students?
Yes.

242
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:04,720
I think there's a comment here.

243
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,280
As a physicist,
a undergraduate student,

244
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:11,360
we are taught to analyze data in a real 
world environment,

245
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,390
uh,
famous experiments and around the world,

246
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:16,400
like the large Hadron collider in 
Geneva.

247
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,640
So I definitely think that,
uh,

248
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,450
our,
uh,

249
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,660
our schooling and education applies to 
larger big world pictures for sure.

250
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,520
Okay.
Other comments on this point?

251
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,630
I think there's a lady here.
I,

252
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:31,880
I'm not a economics in economics either.
I'm a neuroscientist,

253
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:36,350
but we're taught to problem solve and 
think critically and that should help in

254
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:38,870
solving many problems that we're faced 
with.

255
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,900
Thank you.
I think there's one more just,

256
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:42,980
yeah,
yeah.

257
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,963
I'm also a science student and I really 
think I've learned in the last year on 

258
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:48,554
my master or eh,
the caters real tries us to think 

259
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:57,080
critically and understand the world,
but you also understand after five years

260
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:59,510
that is really complex.
Okay,

261
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,320
thank you.
Well,

262
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,153
um,
I think that kind of sets the scene a 

263
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,880
little bit forwards to move into the,
um,

264
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,340
into the scientists and,
um,

265
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,200
there's an underlying theme here.
Do you,

266
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:13,190
should you as scientists teach the kinds
of signs that will help us address,

267
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,220
you know,
the big problems of the day,

268
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,130
Jim Raffman,
by equipping students with the skills of

269
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:21,830
rigorous analytical thinking,
of taking a problem,

270
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,950
breaking it down to component parts,
asking which parts are are,

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,370
are solvable,
which ones can't be solved today,

272
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,380
and then directing you referred 
appropriately.

273
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,513
That way of thinking can be,
it is the basis for solving problems of 

274
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:35,474
any kind,
whether they're of immediate import or 

275
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,310
whether they're problems we don't even 
know about today.

276
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,670
That's what an education is.
That what you're saying is,

277
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,370
as you said in your speech when you 
received the Nobel prize,

278
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:47,204
it's a curiosity driven research.
It's not research that's driven solving 

279
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,270
a specific problem.
It's [inaudible]

280
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,010
basically can never predict,
and I think we all agree on this,

281
00:14:56,011 --> 00:15:00,730
they could almost never predict where 
something will lead in all of our work.

282
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,900
There are examples of basic science that
we've achieved in our laboratory,

283
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:05,734
in our theoretical work that have 
applications that one couldn't have 

284
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:10,380
imagined in my own work.
Uh,

285
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,263
what I did was a very basic problem in 
how proteins are transported in yeast 

286
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:15,844
cells,
which turns out having application and 

287
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,990
liver cancer and ways that I couldn't 
have imagined.

288
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,111
Yeah.
But I mean,

289
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:21,944
your research or medicine or physiology 
helps us with the knowledge of a huge 

290
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:27,980
range of illnesses,
diabetes,

291
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:30,770
brain disorders.
But I should also say botox.

292
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,680
I mean,
Botox obviously it has a magical purpose

293
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:34,650
because it helps people with that.

294
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,320
As I said in my remarks last night,
my colleagues,

295
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,363
Rothman and sit half figured out how 
nerve cells communicate with one 

296
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:44,980
another.
It turns out that,

297
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,260
uh,
botulism the disease,

298
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,170
uh,
works by producing a toxin that,

299
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,053
uh,
inactivates protein molecules that they 

300
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:54,440
worked on.
And then that,

301
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,620
that has applications in a lot of 
things.

302
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,490
Cosmetic word,
uh,

303
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,020
or neuromuscular disease.
No,

304
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,660
I have not used it myself,
but I don't think I need it just yet.

305
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,790
Yeah.

306
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,913
Okay.

307
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,370
Next to Terry,
professor check,

308
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,333
like,
I think we want to go to one of our 

309
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:17,020
students here.
A question about physics.

310
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,083
Yes,
I am from the Royal Institute of 

311
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,543
Technology.
And that was wondering what do you 

312
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,170
think?
Yeah.

313
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,010
Or what kinds of technological 
applications do you think will come from

314
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:27,570
the discovery of the Higgs Boson?

315
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,990
It,
let's go to prosser.

316
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,430
Professor Peter Higgs.
Yes.

317
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:31,990
Okay.

318
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,550
I don't know of any applications.
You're,

319
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,393
you're asking about how you would make 
you to have something which has been 

320
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,200
discovered,
which,

321
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,400
uh,
you,

322
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,323
you have to put,
you have to go to a lot of energy into 

323
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:51,740
the making obit and then it lasts for an
extremely short time.

324
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,540
Uh,
how,

325
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,150
how can you do,
do anything useful with,

326
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,620
with that?
It's true.

327
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,410
Uh,
it,

328
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,570
it's true that,
uh,

329
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,450
politicals which have been discovered 
previously,

330
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,200
some of them have applications in 
medicine for example,

331
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:15,590
but they're relatively long lived 
particles by our person's standards.

332
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,753
Uh,
things which even when they were 

333
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,710
addressed,
maybe lost about a micro second.

334
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:26,090
And if you,
if you make the move fast and relatively

335
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:26,924
t tells you that they'll last longer and
you can make beams and you can use them 

336
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,853
in,
in a cancer therapy and that sort of 

337
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:34,494
thing.
Well that's okay for that kind of 

338
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:38,850
political,
but,

339
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,683
but when you exploring this extremely 
high energy range where the things you 

340
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:50,151
produce just don't last very long,
it's hard to how you could

341
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,080
actually control them and hears them.

342
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,600
Okay.
Professor on glow,

343
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,560
you shared the prize with,
with Professor Higgs for the physics,

344
00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:58,394
for the theory that explains why the 
tiny particles that make up atoms have 

345
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,550
mass.
I want to be frank with you.

346
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,020
I want to ask you,
the student,

347
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:09,350
they're mentioned the fact that it's 
called the higgs based on theory.

348
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,450
Everybody says including Professor 
Higgs,

349
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:14,840
that it should more accurately be known 
as the b e h particle.

350
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:15,674
The Robert Route who is unfortunately 
was not able to receive the prize 

351
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:19,964
because he died,
but it should be known as the Brown on 

352
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:23,750
glare.
Higgs particle.

353
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,520
Does it annoy you that it's known as the
Higgs Particle?

354
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,453
No.

355
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,770
You did what?
You did my miles.

356
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:35,660
Can you this question?

357
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,610
Okay.
Put the wrinkles,

358
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,700
but I am not.
The way you want to solve this.

359
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,570
Um,
I've got was,

360
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,580
it annoys me just because it's not the 
public of the whole,

361
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,140
the so called his mom was on the chairs 
first not being introduced by age.

362
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,723
That's one thing.
Although I have a complete admiration 

363
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:04,460
for his work,
uh,

364
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,080
what should put things right,
but the media have a role in calling it,

365
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,133
well particular the Anglo Saxon fuse is 
sometime physics was kind of Taco game 

366
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,710
know due to poor mode for even sun.
That's how also money things in bulk,

367
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,703
right.
The,

368
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,140
the contribution of English is 
important.

369
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,040
Sorry.
But,

370
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,550
and they have another teams,
right?

371
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,710
They detect the particular.
Okay.

372
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,450
And uh,
so,

373
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,293
uh,
I guess one sentence since on their 

374
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,370
detection and they're quite tight and 
they need money for that.

375
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,113
When I professor [inaudible] haven't 
paid because I didn't answer your 

376
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:08,034
question.

377
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,010
I thought you were on,

378
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,810
no,
no.

379
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,950
Okay.
I think they have been many b,

380
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,133
which are played the whole before the 
theory was remade and people who have 

381
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:24,280
made things after the theory is made and
as usual,

382
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,580
this is complete nonsense to give the 
name of a person,

383
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,190
any person in a group setting,
if it's not the right one,

384
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,010
it's it.
But,

385
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:38,844
uh,
I think it's reasonable to give all the 

386
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,530
particle a letter and personally.
Okay.

387
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,733
All right.
But

388
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,250
I would propose that letter the age.

389
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,413
Ah,

390
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,420
what do you think?
And then that final suggestion,

391
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:03,800
take your name off Higgs Boson and just 
call it the letter h h theory.

392
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,000
Anyway,
your response.

393
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,943
I would be very happy with that solution
because the person's situation 

394
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:10,420
embarrasses me.
Uh,

395
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,390
I think,
yeah.

396
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,560
Why does it embarrass you?

397
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,340
Well,
because it's,

398
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,980
it's,
it's come about so accidentally.

399
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,470
It's not a,
not a recognition of,

400
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,980
of,
uh,

401
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,070
but I,
I,

402
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,690
I,
I was any sort of special,

403
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,120
uh,
personal in this is story though.

404
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,060
There were many people involved as far 
as wise as I said.

405
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,570
And it's,
it's,

406
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,463
it's,
it's so happened that my name has been 

407
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:40,840
attached to it for a number of 
accidental reasons.

408
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,270
Uh,
and uh,

409
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,710
that's unfair to the other people 
involved.

410
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,813
I'd like to make a distinction between 
the particle and what is called the 

411
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:50,380
mechanism,
which is how to,

412
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,080
how would you get mass rather particles.
Uh,

413
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,250
I'm,
I'm happy with the solution which is now

414
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:02,430
becoming common in particle physics 
world to call it the b h mechanism.

415
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,450
And that's to me the,
the,

416
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,730
the really the important part of the 
Siri,

417
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,973
uh,
the,

418
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,853
the particle,
it's soul should not carry anybody's 

419
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:16,321
name and the solution of giving it the 
letter h because in the past my name has

420
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,630
been attached or it is,
is a good one.

421
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,640
But the,

422
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,640
okay,
well we'll leave,

423
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:26,350
we'll leave that particular exchange 
there and um,

424
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,390
the student,
next time you ask your question,

425
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,720
be careful what you call it was very,
that's what I'm saying.

426
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,400
It will be professor Thomas Uhthoff.
You,

427
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,740
you have one of the joint winners of the
medicine physiology prize.

428
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,070
I just want to ask you what you think 
about the application of your particular

429
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:45,754
theories.
Does it matter to you that your 

430
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:52,000
discoveries for your work on um,
vesicles and I won't go into too much,

431
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:54,670
but they kind of are an act as the 
cells,

432
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:56,250
internal shipping,
um,

433
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,243
service or postman,
they can send materials around the 

434
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,930
settle can even fuse with its outer 
surface.

435
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,063
But how important was it for you when 
you were doing your research that this 

436
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,470
would actually help perhaps save lives?

437
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,913
Uh,
I was afraid you were going to ask me 

438
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:13,594
about the Hicks puzzle.
I think in a common theme in science is 

439
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,043
we do science best we made on have an 
application in mind because of the 

440
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:26,440
limits,
our imagination and creativity.

441
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,340
But in the end we feel mostly watered 
when what we discover out of a quest for

442
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,000
knowledge leads actually to an 
application.

443
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:38,643
And so what I do,
and I think what my fellow laureates 

444
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:43,264
too,
I think it's extremely important for us 

445
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:48,320
to find that,
I wouldn't call it an accident,

446
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:52,820
but serendipity,
what we do actually is useful.

447
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,910
Is it,
is it a motivating factor for all of you

448
00:23:57,911 --> 00:24:00,370
in your research or do you just see it 
as a bonus

449
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,800
professor level?
What I would say is that,

450
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:03,634
uh,
and to use an economic inc similarly 

451
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,913
here,
this is that a research that is longer 

452
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:13,660
term is much,
much larger pay off.

453
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,190
And in some senses I think that this 
sort of fits into what,

454
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,093
uh,
when you were saying you don't want to 

455
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:23,500
think about solving tomorrow's problems 
today,

456
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:24,334
you want to solve about problems that 
haven't even been designed yet and then 

457
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:28,324
you'll have a massive impact.
And I think this is a very critical 

458
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:33,610
thing because we are increasingly 
wanting to solve short term problems.

459
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,013
And I think it is perhaps high energy 
physics doesn't have a very direct 

460
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,683
practical application,
but it's really hard to imagine the 

461
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:44,740
applications that are going to come up.

462
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,370
Yeah.
The long views and I mean the,

463
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,060
these gentle recognize decades later 
from the work they actually did.

464
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,163
I mean James Rothman just picking up 
this point about research and the long 

465
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:55,380
view and so on.
I mean,

466
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,453
would you be happy if you are a young 
scientist starting out today trying to 

467
00:24:58,951 --> 00:25:01,030
embark on some research which needed 
funding?

468
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,423
Well,
I'd be very happy if I was a young 

469
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:05,370
scientist.
I wouldn't be an old science,

470
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,670
but,
uh,

471
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,660
you know,
uh,

472
00:25:09,661 --> 00:25:10,461
I think it,
we're,

473
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:11,294
we're in a very challenging era before 
for the very reasons that we heard a 

474
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,200
moment ago from,
from Michael.

475
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,610
There's an increasingly,
uh,

476
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:19,703
increasing effort on the short term 
short term success and it causes young 

477
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:29,310
scientists to take less in the way of 
risk and to do more research.

478
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,830
That's more incremental small step here,
a small step,

479
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,800
they're more likely to reap a short term
reward.

480
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,270
But,
uh,

481
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,500
those of us around the table today,
I think each in our own way,

482
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,633
we're taking on problems that were very 
challenging in our time quite some time 

483
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,130
ago.

484
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:46,963
We all feel an enormous increase in 
pressure from public institutions or 

485
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:54,890
rather from politicians and the public 
foundations,

486
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,840
patient advocates,
whatever,

487
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:02,530
to do science that will lead to tangible
results tomorrow.

488
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,943
Sure.
This cure that now and in my view that 

489
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,993
never works because you can't cure 
something you don't understand and our 

490
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:14,360
case physiology on dre or medicine 
Professor Rochelle,

491
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,563
Samuel first try to solve problems which
are really difficult like how enzyme 

492
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:20,724
work Indo case,
what is the mass in the universe and 

493
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,080
eventually some of the solutions has 
application in lily to your question,

494
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:34,680
what is missing in all of this is 
teaching politicians in the university,

495
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,270
people who will become politician to 
understand some concepts in science.

496
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,080
So in the future they will be able to do
better.

497
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,453
Making

498
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,383
this is this is something important that
we all should be better educated in 

499
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:51,630
science by examination.

500
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,943
It seems to me that I don't know if this
is necessary because I can go require a 

501
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:02,510
very narrow minded politician to say 
that size hadn't had a massive effect on

502
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,120
everything we do over the last hundred 
years.

503
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:08,490
It seems to me that the general,
you know,

504
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,170
maybe none targeted investment in 
science that we've had at say,

505
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:14,840
let's just say since the Second World 
War has paid off,

506
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,220
unbelievably the living standard,
you know,

507
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,800
maybe that's where we have so many 
people on earth,

508
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,600
but it's all part of the success of 
science.

509
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,570
So it seems to me that we don't have to 
justify every little

510
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,680
12 point that Professor Walsh and made 
about,

511
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:27,514
um,
might suppose you're basically saying 

512
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:31,000
scientific illiteracy,
but people need to be better educated,

513
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:32,530
public politicians.
I mean,

514
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:33,364
it's scientific illiteracy,
more acceptable than other forms of 

515
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:36,150
relief.

516
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,950
I have thought about that a lot.
If I said,

517
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:39,330
uh,
oh Shakespeare,

518
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:41,220
who cares about him?
You don't think my God.

519
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,230
But if somebody says a billion,
a million,

520
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:44,730
what difference does it make?
You know,

521
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:45,920
that's a pretty big error.

522
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,180
People need to learn much more 
statistically.

523
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:51,210
I know,
I think there is a check when,

524
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,053
and then she has a tremendous ignorance 
of science in the u s which 

525
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:58,930
unfortunately is fostered by the 
political process right now.

526
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,900
We have,
uh,

527
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,990
uh,
a great deal of disbelief.

528
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,690
It basic scientific principles in the 
United States that drives the,

529
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,000
uh,
politics.

530
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:11,590
There's a dismissal of evolution.
There's a disbelief in climate change,

531
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:16,150
in spite of the overwhelming evidence.
So w w we have to do a better job.

532
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,280
It used to be that the government,
you know,

533
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,114
I've been the beneficiary of this,
we have all been the beneficiary of an 

534
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:23,220
investment in science starting with,
uh,

535
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,160
the end of World War II with the sputnik
era in the United States.

536
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,970
It was enormous investment.
It's science,

537
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,360
science education that's diminished 
particularly in the public.

538
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,513
So it's not happening now.
You don't think science is getting 

539
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,990
funding sufficient,

540
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,441
not enough.
And,

541
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:37,261
and,
and then what,

542
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:40,970
what is funded is being managed more,
much more so than it used to be.

543
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,030
I said Shit.
Huh?

544
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,863
As an economist,
I would like to point out that 

545
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,060
scientific research provides a public 
good that benefits the entire world.

546
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,610
So one country,
let's take Sweden.

547
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,930
Politicians here would rationally think,
why should we pay for it?

548
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,973
The rest of the world will do it anyway.
If we pay 1 million kroner for some 

549
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:03,714
research project,
only a tiny part of that will benefit 

550
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,950
Sweden.
It'll go all over the world.

551
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,963
So part of the defense of scientific 
research has to be a cosmopolitan 

552
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,463
publix,

553
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,483
what professor said have said,
which is that you scientists have to 

554
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:19,284
communicate better with the public and 
politicians about what it is you are 

555
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:24,624
doing.
But we have a question I think from one 

556
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:29,460
of the students here about this subject.
Yup.

557
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,710
Ricard the Gui,
the Karolinska Institute.

558
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:32,843
So I wonder if you think that,
do scientists communicate bad leaders 

559
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:38,550
science?
How do we avoid the misunderstanding and

560
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:43,551
gain a better presence on public debates
on this point of communication?

561
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,853
Uh,
professor farmer economists obviously 

562
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:47,590
is,
is not a pure science,

563
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:51,100
your social scientists,
but you are asked to comment every hour,

564
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:54,340
every day of the week because of the 
financial crisis and so on.

565
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:56,500
Do you think you make a good job of 
communicating with the public?

566
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:57,803
I don't think we make it clear and 
distinguishing between the things we 

567
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:04,284
know based on research that had been 
done and opinions that we have based on 

568
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:10,830
our own interpretation of things.
I don't think we do a good job on that.

569
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,053
I think too many economists are willing 
to talk too much about things that they 

570
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:17,490
really don't know a lot about.
Um,

571
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,640
I try to avoid that immature mentality 
successful.

572
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,560
Uh,

573
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,480
and they do lots of media interviews 
yourself,

574
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:25,550
asked to predict what is going on.
And so we're actually,

575
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:29,030
before he got the Nobel prize and nobody
was much interested in me,

576
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,790
then afterward they became interested 
in,

577
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:34,130
I said I didn't change.
I'm still a dumb guy.

578
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:36,680
You thought I was two months ago.
Professor Sheila,

579
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:37,514
you do interact a lot with apartment.
You've written books which are supposed 

580
00:30:41,961 --> 00:30:44,870
to be accessing if a student as it's on 
that you write books,

581
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:45,704
which is supposed to be accessible to 
even people who haven't started 

582
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:48,554
economics.
What's your view on how economists 

583
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:50,894
communicate with the public?
But I think that economists have been 

584
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,190
too much in the science model of 
writing.

585
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,360
Concise,
Short.

586
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,250
I mean there's some of that is good 
concise,

587
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:06,251
short journal articles that make a very 
narrow but frontier contribution that we

588
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:11,930
model ourselves after a physics 
particularly I think.

589
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,573
But I think there's an older,
a different tradition that's also 

590
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:16,634
valuable and that is writing books that 
draw together theory and practice and 

591
00:31:25,321 --> 00:31:27,590
the,
and the profession tends to,

592
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,090
if you say,
I've written a book that is rare,

593
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,230
they think,
oh that's a,

594
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,263
they call it a popular realization,
but I don't think that some of these 

595
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:37,860
books that are,
why are they red,

596
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:38,694
are popular realizations at all there.
Their synthesis that can operate at a 

597
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,540
level of an ordinary intelligence.
She's online as well.

598
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:48,950
You provide lectures.
Yeah,

599
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,510
you can take my car,
but you also provide lectures online.

600
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,290
I think that,
uh,

601
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,553
in the last say 50 years,
communication has undergone an 

602
00:31:59,661 --> 00:32:02,030
incredible revolution.
And at the time when,

603
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,183
you know,
facebook has been phased out for 

604
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:05,810
twitter,
which has been phased out for a snapshot

605
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:06,644
or whatever,
it seems to me that the only way we can 

606
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:13,730
communicate thing is not to communicate 
with people in their forties,

607
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,893
even if the way is the community.
It was people in their teens and early 

608
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,033
twenties.
And it seems to me that everyone here 

609
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,520
should be on facebook

610
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,860
freely accessible to non students as 
students ever won a science.

611
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,500
Let's just,
um,

612
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,550
get some feedback here.
Who thinks that scientists do a good job

613
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,550
of communicating with the public and I 
see people their hands up who thinks,

614
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:43,190
does scientists do a good job of 
communicating with the public?

615
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,250
Do you think scientists do a bad job of 
communicating with the public

616
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,013
mine

617
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,583
who thinks that these Nobel laureates 
have been doing a good job of 

618
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:58,691
communicating it?
So know you've got a good,

619
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,043
you got a good response to that.
I just asked you whether you feel that 

620
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:03,434
sometimes scientists are running ahead 
of what society both understands and 

621
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:12,170
thinks is acceptable and without going 
into various examples here,

622
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,213
it's really a question about the 
potential misuse of your discoveries or 

623
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,470
a potential lack of understanding of 
what your discoveries may bring about.

624
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:22,670
I mean,
there are so many examples.

625
00:33:22,671 --> 00:33:25,110
I'm thinking of the Belgian geneticist 
who,

626
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,120
who brought about gm who says that 
Professor Montague,

627
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:29,954
Mark Van Montague,
who says that society fears science 

628
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:36,530
because it upsets the traditional way of
living.

629
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,543
Do any of you worry at night about how 
your various discoveries may be misused 

630
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:41,654
in the future?

631
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,993
Sure.

632
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,320
To turn the question just a bit,
I think there is an overselling our part

633
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:54,710
sometimes of what science can do and 
just use an example,

634
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:59,711
the war on cancer in the 1970s under 
President Nixon real,

635
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,810
it really wasn't,
it wasn't an enormous investment.

636
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:05,270
A lot of science was done,
but cancer was not cured.

637
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:07,700
We shouldn't over promise what we can 
deliver.

638
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,940
Is there overhype professor said hop on 
the part of scientists.

639
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,833
Absolutely.
I think that communicating with the 

640
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:15,384
public,
that's probably one of the biggest 

641
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:17,994
mistakes we are scientists have made 
because we haven't communicated the 

642
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:22,314
magnitude of the challenge.
We haven't communicate how difficult it 

643
00:34:25,321 --> 00:34:26,011
is.
For example,

644
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:26,844
don't understand a cancer cell or to 
understand the brain and people expect 

645
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:34,410
us to solve this and to have solutions 
tomorrow and that's our fault.

646
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,273
Why do you think that happens?
Because we claim to make discoveries as 

647
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:41,400
a community that aren't there.

648
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,583
And do you think you're asked the wrong 
questions sometimes or pushed into 

649
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:47,390
saying things you shouldn't say by the 
media?

650
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,650
There's no doubt about that.
It's blaming the media again.

651
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,350
Absolutely.
No question.

652
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,030
Yeah.
I think one of the DP guilty,

653
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,560
the communication of tides is the basic 
education to begin with.

654
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,463
Do you see either sense?
Maybe you can try to give a vague idea 

655
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,620
to,
uh,

656
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,870
to people about how they can be cured 
about some cancer.

657
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:20,240
Then they may understand something,
right?

658
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,950
But if you try to explain something 
which is deeper,

659
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:31,250
I don't want to make a deeper,
I mean basic far right,

660
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,173
which is the,
then they don't have any mathematical 

661
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,573
basis to understand this.
And the difficulty comes already from 

662
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:43,950
the first year.

663
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,793
No,
I said at the start that you are all 

664
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:48,524
gentlemen.
Obviously Alice Munro won the prize for 

665
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:53,280
literature and one of the chemistry 
laureates,

666
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,750
Martin Karplus can't be with us,
but obviously another man.

667
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,130
What is it about science and women check
when Michael Levitt?

668
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,280
I think the problem is with the age 
group of the gentleman here.

669
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:05,910
Uh,
we,

670
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,280
we all did our work.
I mean,

671
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,810
the work that I was credited for,
I did as an assistant professor.

672
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,820
That was back at a time when there were 
few women.

673
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,530
In fact,
there were no women in my department.

674
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,390
There are many more women that we hire 
now.

675
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:15,961
So,
uh,

676
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:16,794
I look forward to in 30 years,
you'll still be just as young 

677
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:21,010
interviewing,
uh,

678
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,110
uh,
a number of women.

679
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,860
I like you and still no botox,
Professor Higgs,

680
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,250
lack of women.
Well

681
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,783
and my kind of physics,
there are interesting differences 

682
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:34,250
between different countries,
at least at least within Europe.

683
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:38,450
Um,
until I went to Italy,

684
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,800
I think my prejudice would have been 
that the,

685
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,731
uh,
the,

686
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:44,564
the southern Catholic countries,
we're less likely to have women 

687
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:49,814
scientists in the northern mostly 
Protestant countries because of the 

688
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:59,470
attitudes of the Catholic Church to what
women ought to be doing.

689
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,660
It isn't.
So it's the other way round.

690
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,890
Uh,
it's,

691
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,723
it's Italy which has the largest 
proportion of women in physics and the 

692
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,270
northern countries do rather badly by 
comparison.

693
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,363
That's a very interesting point you 
raise there professor higgs because 

694
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:17,824
Sweden,
which is famous for its very efficient 

695
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:20,614
and effective childcare system actually 
has a very low number of professors 

696
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:26,020
right across the board.
Not only in science,

697
00:37:26,021 --> 00:37:29,260
it's only about 21%.
Since we have some students from here,

698
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:30,094
universities in Sweden.
What do you think about this gender is 

699
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:33,000
to,
uh,

700
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,933
I would like to comment on what 
Professor Haig said that religion has 

701
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:42,310
some impact on this.
And I think in earlier generation,

702
00:37:42,311 --> 00:37:43,144
the head nowadays,
we can look at this room is full of 

703
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:48,370
women.
We are gaining power and we are starting

704
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:52,360
to do science,
but we still have to take a lot of risks

705
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,420
and to do a lot of difficult choices.
For example,

706
00:37:55,421 --> 00:38:00,421
I had to move from my country because 
the maternity's and s and those problems

707
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:03,160
in my country,
there's still problematic.

708
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,370
That's why I moved to northern country.
Which country?

709
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:07,330
You are from?
Portugal.

710
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,460
Portuguese.
Okay.

711
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,250
Another person,
another science student.

712
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,203
I'm in a social sciences which is full 
of women and in the social worker who 

713
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,324
was this even more women and still in 
Sweden we have men that are on the top 

714
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,243
of the Eh,
the top positions in both society and 

715
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:31,030
science,
so that must reflect something.

716
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,720
Even when there is basically all the 
women in the field,

717
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,703
usually what you do,
you have kids as a male and the female 

718
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,123
and accepts the pregnancy,
which usually people are only way maybe 

719
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:45,634
for a few weeks.
The kids is something you get together 

720
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:50,410
and say if it's a female problem,
you should also be a main problem.

721
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,650
Right?

722
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,430
Student?
Yes.

723
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,110
I see somebody there.
Yes.

724
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:00,944
Thank you.

725
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,093
Phd Student and molecular biology.
There are a lot of women in science now 

726
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:06,414
as someone else's plan it out.
And I don't think that there are less 

727
00:39:09,031 --> 00:39:09,864
opportunities for women in science.
I think that if you want to have a 

728
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:13,980
family and a career,
that's your choice.

729
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:17,540
And I think that there are many examples
of successful women's science.

730
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,050
Science has to,
I've made it happen.

731
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,080
Maybe not sitting at the table today,
but maybe they'll be sat at the table in

732
00:39:22,081 --> 00:39:22,914
the future.
And I,

733
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,350
I think that the future have,
will reflect that.

734
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,030
But I think that the opportunities are 
there,

735
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,073
but that's around you shut your not only
concerned about encouraging women to 

736
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:32,734
study science,
you want to ensure that everyone from 

737
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:38,170
all walks of life can have access to a 
university.

738
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,033
I'm very,
I'm very concerned about public higher 

739
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:41,284
education.
That may not be as much an issue in 

740
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:45,430
Sweden,
but in the United States,

741
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,060
the individual states have decreased 
their support,

742
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:51,130
supportive public,
higher education,

743
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:52,300
particularly.
Uh,

744
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,263
there's virtually an inverse 
relationship between the funding of 

745
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:59,950
prisons in the United States and the 
funding of public higher education.

746
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:00,963
And I think this has been much to the 
detriment of the middle class who 

747
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:06,280
wouldn't necessarily have that in large 
numbers,

748
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:10,270
have access to the elite institutions 
that are represented around this table.

749
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,550
You disappointed,
very disappointed.

750
00:40:12,551 --> 00:40:14,890
And I,
I came from a middle class family.

751
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:18,310
I could work a summer job and pay for 
the whole year,

752
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,233
uh,
room board books that that is no longer 

753
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:23,170
possible.
That's,

754
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,020
I think that is,
uh,

755
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,350
that is,
has damaged access to,

756
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,910
uh,
to the,

757
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,760
the highest reaches of science at least 
in the United States.

758
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,180
Anybody else on this issue of access in 
the UK?

759
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,820
Professor next,
we have a similar debate about it.

760
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,290
Similar situation where,
where,

761
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,533
I mean my generation,
a lot of public funding going to 

762
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,580
universities and,
and there's a generation of,

763
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,043
of academics,
not just in science but other fields 

764
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,100
who,
who,

765
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,670
who came from all kinds of social 
backgrounds.

766
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:04,810
But now it's been made much more 
difficult by the present policies,

767
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,703
policies of introducing fees and uh,
people from poor backgrounds or simply 

768
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:13,300
deterred from trying.

769
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,583
Are you worried that actually this 
crisis in funding some countries is 

770
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:19,624
going to jeopardize their future as 
being centers of excellence where you 

771
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:24,304
can get the kind of people like q who 
come up with the discoveries and just 

772
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:28,684
think about the fact that as far as I 
understand sociological studies suggest 

773
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,340
that social mobility

774
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,480
in the United States is now lower than 
Europe and that sort of puts it on.

775
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,360
So we always used to be that social 
mobility look at me and man,

776
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,863
uh,
in the United States was better than a 

777
00:41:45,361 --> 00:41:47,000
New York and now it's the opposite

778
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,633
center of excellence is going to move 
back to move back to Europe as well as 

779
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,280
that's possible.
But I hope that we'll move to Asia.

780
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,860
Asia you're already is.
Yeah.

781
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,350
Moving away from the United States,
not black and white,

782
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,213
you know,
but integrated way where it comes back 

783
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,690
to research support,
it comes down to public education.

784
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:12,490
It comes down to a v a value system of,
of uh,

785
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,620
immediacy versus a longer term view.
And a and I think it going to,

786
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,040
well I think in part it's a lot,
a lot of it has gone already to Europe.

787
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:25,460
Europe had a tremendous task of 
rebuilding after World War II.

788
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,940
Uh,
that's largely done in the sciences,

789
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:31,880
especially China.
China is it,

790
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,743
you know in Asia are very hungry to be 
major players but they tend to be still 

791
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:41,330
quite short term focus.
The China thinks in five year plans,

792
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,510
it's a 50 year plan.
If it's a plant,

793
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:45,590
any kind of a plan at all,
it's more like an intent.

794
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,833
And do you think there are certain 
cultures that better encourage free 

795
00:42:49,211 --> 00:42:50,044
thinking,
the blue skies thinking that brings 

796
00:42:51,371 --> 00:42:52,630
about the great discoveries.

797
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:59,310
I was thinking that the United States 
had a more public spirit after World War

798
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,023
II then it does now.
The Marshall Plan is an example of 

799
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:07,300
something that happened to then that was
an aid program to Europe.

800
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,180
It wouldn't happen now.
And that the,

801
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:11,014
the,
the climbing support for education is 

802
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,563
another example of that.
I wanted to remind us that we are here 

803
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:17,703
at the legacy of Alfred Nobel who had a 
tremendous public spirit and that's one 

804
00:43:22,061 --> 00:43:26,050
reason why the Nobel prize is a renewed 
inspiration.

805
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,263
Talking about access,
you now have access to the air of the 

806
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:36,650
powerful in the world.
Are you going to be using this new found

807
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,733
recognition that you have to put forward
the case that you'd be making about 

808
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:45,360
greater access or any other issue?
I'll come to you,

809
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:46,110
professor love it

810
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,610
for,
I think it's really important to have an

811
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:48,444
issue after getting the Nobel prize.
You have to do something with the rest 

812
00:43:50,221 --> 00:43:52,740
of your life and besides science with 
it,

813
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:54,960
I'll continue to do.
I think an issue for me that is really,

814
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:59,961
really worrying is that the the youth to
be people who have positions between the

815
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:04,320
ages of 20 and 40 and that whole 
generation is slowly disappearing.

816
00:44:04,321 --> 00:44:07,890
It's becoming very hard to become an 
independent scientist.

817
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,690
If you're younger than 40 and you know,
30 or 40 years ago,

818
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:17,640
you could be in your early twenties.
I think that this is can be explained in

819
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:18,474
many ways sociologically,
but I think that it's as if you have 

820
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:22,794
another one when you're finished 
university here instead of getting a 

821
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:27,210
position in five years,
it can take 15 years.

822
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:28,680
And I think this is a huge waste of 
talent

823
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,860
because we see,
um,

824
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:30,853
talent,
young town bringing up things like 

825
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:33,690
facebook,
you know,

826
00:44:33,691 --> 00:44:36,210
you'd have to drop out of college even,
you know,

827
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:37,950
to have found Microsoft,
apple,

828
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,330
Google,
facebook,

829
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,400
Yahoo,
not a good sign.

830
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:46,690
It's a general society problem and 
economic problem that things,

831
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:48,783
uh,
more and more seeing the possibility of 

832
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:59,140
funding students to help them to go 
[inaudible] in Belgium,

833
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,200
but it's very difficult otherwise.
Okay.

834
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,383
Very briefly,
anybody got any idea about how they're 

835
00:45:07,061 --> 00:45:07,894
going to be using the new influenced as 
a Nobel laureate to in some way better 

836
00:45:12,491 --> 00:45:13,324
the world?
Not only as a scientist but beyond the 

837
00:45:14,651 --> 00:45:17,560
realm of science?
Professor Marshall,

838
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,140
did you have your hand up?
I will find it out eventually.

839
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:24,850
Professor Fama and I'm going to continue
to do what I've been doing.

840
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,450
My,
my,

841
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,383
my simple attitude is everything that 
creates economic output adds to 

842
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,144
humanity.
My plumber is perhaps as important as I 

843
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:38,020
am.
I wish I had a good one,

844
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:38,854
but you may not.
This one may not be as important as 

845
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:44,410
mine,
but everybody that contributes something

846
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:48,820
to output makes everybody else bigger,
better,

847
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,870
better off.
So I'm good at what I do.

848
00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:53,320
Why would I try to do something I'm not 
good at good at?

849
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:56,170
I think I can make the world better if I
continue what I'm doing.

850
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,633
Eugene Fama,
thank you very much and didn't 

851
00:45:58,511 --> 00:46:00,190
gentlemen.
Thank you all very much.

852
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,370
Well that brings this exclusive program 
to an end.

853
00:46:03,371 --> 00:46:04,204
We've heard what this year's Nobel 
laureates have to say about the role of 

854
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,160
science and Economics in today's 
society.

855
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:12,130
We've also heard from the students here 
from Sweden,

856
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,203
um,
about what they think the road of 

857
00:46:14,591 --> 00:46:15,424
science should also be.
Who knows there may be a future Nobel 

858
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,513
Prize winner amongst you all.
Thank you to the family and friends of 

859
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:21,450
the lawyer,
to the lawyer.

860
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:22,330
It's themselves,
of course,

861
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:23,164
to you,
wherever you are for watching this 

862
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,690
program from me.
Zainab [inaudible].

863
00:46:25,691 --> 00:46:27,970
We're here in the concert hall in 
Stockholm.

864
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,193
Goodbye.
