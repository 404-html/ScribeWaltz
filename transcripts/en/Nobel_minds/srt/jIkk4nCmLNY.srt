1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,030
Hello,
I'm Zina Berdahl.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,903
We welcome to the concert hall here in 
Stockholm where this year's Nobel 

3
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:09,730
laureates received their awards from His
Majesty,

4
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:14,020
the King of Sweden for the outstanding 
contributions to literature,

5
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,460
economics,
and science.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,593
This is the first time that they had 
been brought together in discussion on 

7
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:23,080
television.
And we're also joined in the audience by

8
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:26,950
some of their family and friends who've 
traveled here to be with them as well as

9
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:31,930
students from Sweden.
Welcome to this year's Nobel mines,

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,870
Nobel laureates.
Welcome to you all and congratulations.

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,700
[inaudible]

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,870
you will one your Nobel prizes because 
you know,

13
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:16,100
you are these very rational,
logical beings or you have great clarity

14
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:19,790
of thought in your novels and in your 
economic work and so on.

15
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,624
So,
um,

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,573
do you really act very rationally with 
weight logic in your personal lives of 

17
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:28,660
John when you're nodding,
which has handwritten?

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,320
So yes,
you obviously do.

19
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,010
Yes,
I am.

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,130
I 100% rational,
but very,

21
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:39,550
very occasionally we have to step 
outside that circle.

22
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:40,384
So the one little memory I have is a new
piece of equipment that was being 

23
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:49,270
developed.
We only had access to it before atm.

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,310
I come in very early to try and use it.
Uh,

25
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,160
I couldn't get it to work.
I tried everything,

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,410
unplugged this sampling.
So eventually I said,

27
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:58,840
I'll just have to go home,
but I drive one final thing,

28
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,900
give it a kick.
He kicked it,

29
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,110
it sprang into life.

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,210
And there was a loose wire.
So that was my,

31
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,370
all right,
well let us see you.

32
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,080
I'm going to get around the tube,
you know,

33
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,930
and just get a quick quip from all of 
you.

34
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,840
Think you're lagging,
frank.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,100
Um,
I was,

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,430
uh,
in an earthquake in Pasadena in 1970.

37
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,260
Uh,
it happened at six o'clock.

38
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:18,094
I was asleep.
I went at immediate jump out of the bed 

39
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,143
and went to the,
to the toilet and flush the toilet 

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,460
immediately as it kind of reflex.
It's a reflex.

41
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,510
We won't go there.
Okay.

42
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,470
I can do both Shay and the third of the 
chemistry lab,

43
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:37,304
we'll know the word falsification,
the creation of the rationality of a 

44
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:45,070
scientific.
When you have a good idea,

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,933
you have to prove that it is wrong until
you have tried everything and then you 

46
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:54,250
have proven the idea that I'm very 
irrational.

47
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,550
I tried to show that my id is right and 
sometimes push a bit too far.

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,660
Okay.
Thorn,

49
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,140
uh,
one of the physics laureates,

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,680
my greatest insights come in the middle 
of the night and I'm sound asleep.

51
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,690
It's not rational.
I don't know how it happens,

52
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:16,230
but my mind somehow irrationally throws 
things together.

53
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:17,064
I go write down notes in the bathroom,
make up the next morning and believe it 

54
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,870
or not a third of the time.
It's good.

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,270
It's good.
I have no idea where it came from.

56
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,440
That sounds,
yeah.

57
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,270
So serendipity I guess.
Yeah.

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,931
Ray,
vice,

59
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:34,810
you ever done anything completely crazy 
irrational things?

60
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:38,910
I think the most important one was I 
fell in love at night

61
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,660
teen when chasing a woman,
the Chicago,

62
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,153
and it was the end of me.
I flunked out and then I eventually got 

63
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:49,220
back into that gallery it,
yes.

64
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:50,054
Back then might I flunked out of mit and
back after that I came to and I got a 

65
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,970
job.
And that job made my career.

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,370
The education wasn't worth a damn.

67
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,723
Oh,
well we'll come back onto that kind of 

68
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,780
theme later.
Barry Barish,

69
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,623
another of the physics lawyers,
I became a physicist and shuttle the 

70
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,500
irrational way it was to decide not to 
be a chemist,

71
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,720
not to be an engineer,
and not to be a writer.

72
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,450
In the last bluff was my freshman 
physics class.

73
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,083
I'm going to jump out,
leave you out just for a moment because 

74
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,034
I'm gonna come to you because we're 
going to talk about your economic 

75
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:18,671
theory.
But,

76
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,790
uh,
the medicine laureates might young.

77
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,580
Well,
so choosing to be a scientist is,

78
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,530
uh,
I won't say it's irrational,

79
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,903
but it does come with a lot of risk.
And I got lots of advice from people 

80
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,870
that were close to me.
When am I going to get a job?

81
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,030
Uh,
uh,

82
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,800
when are you going to choose something 
that,

83
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,110
uh,
it's understandable,

84
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,210
uh,
to the outside word world that has,

85
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:44,044
uh,
a simple track forward that you can be 

86
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:49,270
sure to support yourself and such and 
such a way.

87
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,900
So there's a very,
there's a very important component.

88
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:53,734
There's an emotional component.
And choosing to take risks and become a 

89
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,530
scientist.
Michael Ross Fash so,

90
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,160
so I would say,
um,

91
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,190
in,
in order,

92
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,760
uh,
having a,

93
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,733
a,
a self destructive temper as a young 

94
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,250
person,
it's not very rational.

95
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,470
Uh,
being a sports fan,

96
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,930
uh,
is not very rational.

97
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,850
And,
and then,

98
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,090
uh,
the concept of risk taking is,

99
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:21,820
is actually has,
it has a deep biological basis.

100
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,370
But of course people like taking risks 
and a,

101
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,840
that has an upside of course is as Mike 
mentioned,

102
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:32,230
but it's also a,
it also can be destructive.

103
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,700
You seem very benign now.
You've lost the temper.

104
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,640
Have you the self destructive 10.
I'm,

105
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,191
I'm,
uh,

106
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,760
I'm most of the time under control 
check,

107
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,540
progress work in regards their work in 
progress.

108
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,170
What about pants and fellow to my right 
and I worked together.

109
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
He's,
the name escapes me.

110
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,830
We,
we,

111
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,200
uh,
came up

112
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,830
a number of times with

113
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,900
labored pieces of poor royale public 
behavior.

114
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,543
We thought our strengths were hilarious.
I'm not sure that everybody else in our 

115
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:12,180
midst did do,
but we couldn't help her.

116
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:12,741
So,
oh,

117
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,311
right.
Okay.

118
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,144
Well,
can I see the sugar out literature 

119
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:16,664
laureate?

120
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,783
Did you ever done anything?
I'm completely crazy that you look 

121
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,620
crazy,
but I guess my wife and I,

122
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,483
we have a dodge connection is soft toys,
which we pretend still belong to our 

123
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:27,474
daughter.
The daughter is 25 now I would have 

124
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:31,944
voices for the mode and they have whole 
kind of personal histories and the 

125
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:39,210
relationships between them have 
histories.

126
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,270
Uh,
I guess that's verging on the irrational

127
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,400
perhaps,
but I think it's perfectly reasonable.

128
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,530
All right.
Okay.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,833
And when I brought out this odyssey fun,
irrational versus machinal behavior 

130
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:51,294
because you,
Richard Thaler won the Nobel prize for 

131
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:58,290
your work in behavioral economics,
which I'm really,

132
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,130
it says that,
you know,

133
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:01,010
mainstream economics didn't get it 
right,

134
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,910
that people,
individuals,

135
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,744
households don't act in a rational way 
when it comes to taking economic 

136
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:09,630
decisions or indeed any other kinds of 
decision.

137
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,613
So just explain to us,
give us an overview of what behavioral 

138
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,180
economics actually is.

139
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,613
Well,
but he really cannot mix is just doing 

140
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:24,180
economics that would accommodate all of 
the stories that we've

141
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,530
just heard.
It was triggered by a dinner party where

142
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,060
an abode of cashew nuts.

143
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,051
Oh,
well,

144
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:34,370
yes,
I removed a bowl of cashew nuts that it,

145
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,850
uh,
was addicting a dinner party.

146
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,060
And,
um,

147
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,663
after I came back,
everyone thanked me for removing this 

148
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,043
bowl of cashew nuts.
But then since it was a group of 

149
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,074
economists B,
we began to wonder how it was that we 

150
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:51,824
could be happy.
Since an axiom of economics is more 

151
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:58,460
choices are always better than less.
So,

152
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,600
um,
yeah,

153
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,520
that was my apple.

154
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,463
Why did,
why did they thank you for removing the 

155
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:05,820
bowl of cashew?

156
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,310
Because they didn't want to eat anymore

157
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,830
and they had plenty more color.
If the ball were there,

158
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:14,730
they would have continued.
I'm Richard.

159
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,450
I mean a lot of people focused on just 
one component of your work could,

160
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:24,050
which is this concept of notch.
And you wrote a book of course with Cass

161
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,883
Sunstein called nudge and it's about how
people can be nudged into making better 

162
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,830
decisions.
And David Cameron,

163
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:34,790
former British prime minister,
set up a nudge unit and indeed many,

164
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,140
many other countries,
um,

165
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,123
followed suit.
So it just gives us an idea how does 

166
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:43,070
nudge actually work?
What does it try to set out to do?

167
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,970
Well,

168
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,803
a nudge takes into consideration what 
our biases are and then tries to 

169
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,290
introduce small features of the 
environment that will adjust them.

170
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,610
So for example,
I'm supposed to,

171
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:03,720
we're worried that this show mike run 
over.

172
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,790
Um,
then,

173
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,983
uh,
fortunately I set in my phone for the 

174
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,753
amount of time we're supposed to do.
So when it starts beeping will note to 

175
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:17,880
end and we won't worry about the risk of
running over.

176
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,540
I mean,
some people I get the message,

177
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,910
no,
I'm just trying to be,

178
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,330
it's a little nuts.
You can keep going.

179
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:33,860
It'll be beeping to nudge him.
You've advised governments on nudging,

180
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,500
you know,
trying to get policies that,

181
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,780
for instance,
we'll get young people like the students

182
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:39,614
we've got here in the audience to save 
up for the old age pensions and to try 

183
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:45,134
to get people to take decisions which 
are in the self interest based on the 

184
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:52,130
fact that people don't always do so.
Um,

185
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,143
but can we really leave it to 
politicians and policy makers and their 

186
00:09:56,361 --> 00:10:00,950
advisors such as yourself,
to really nudge a person into,

187
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,980
into doing something like that mean 
isn't it manipulation in some ways?

188
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,550
Well,
um,

189
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,623
the,
the real point is that we have no 

190
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:12,210
choice.
So there's no alternative to nudging.

191
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,750
The only alternative is bad nudging

192
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,730
it.
Gentleman.

193
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,563
I mean,
what do you think about behavioral 

194
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,710
economics and in particular this aspect 
of it,

195
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:21,690
which is,
you know,

196
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,533
the concept of nudge with some of you 
have liked to been nudged or have been 

197
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:30,340
nudged into doing something that avoided
reckless behavior.

198
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:31,923
Yeah.
I want to nudge the society into 

199
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:36,010
something different.
I wonder how you think about this.

200
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,503
I mean,
we teach the wrong kind of math to our 

201
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:42,460
kids or you agree with that?
I mean,

202
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:43,930
for example,
I mean,

203
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:47,710
if you want to nudge me into a certain 
thing,

204
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:50,830
I'd like to know the art.
Right?

205
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,040
And we don't know how to make art in 
high school or grade school.

206
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,820
I would teach it by having them gamble.
Yeah.

207
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,450
Right.
So that what people know deadly serious.

208
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,200
Well you want a nation of gamblers?
No,

209
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:04,861
that's not,
no,

210
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:05,940
no.
Okay.

211
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,530
Okay.
Yeah.

212
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,170
Dahlia jumped too fast.
Don't do the first day.

213
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,260
No,
no.

214
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,093
The idea was to use as a mechanism to 
learn the mathematics and the thinking 

215
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,350
that goes with probabilistic reasoning.
Right.

216
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,773
Jeff Hall,
you are one of the three laureates for 

217
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,290
the price in medicine or physiology and 
talking about,

218
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,124
as I say,
you know,

219
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,160
the psychological aspects of economics 
in behavioral economics and how the mind

220
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:35,880
works and the impact it might have on 
economics.

221
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,040
But you,
you won your prize for,

222
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,140
uh,
what makes the body tick?

223
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,970
Um,
our body clock.

224
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,980
Um,
Jeff,

225
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:48,981
why don't you just perhaps spell out for
us what we mean by our body clock.

226
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,280
There are many kinds of revealed daily

227
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,280
rhythms that can be observed and 
measured rhythms,

228
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,173
but there's longstanding information 
from studying a whole variety of 

229
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,424
different kinds of organisms that these 
revealed rhythms are underpinned by 

230
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,210
biological clocks.

231
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,910
Michael Ross,
Masha and Mike Young.

232
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,970
It's doing your research on,
on fruit flies.

233
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,270
We discovered that we have these body 
clocks.

234
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,133
You know,
we're humans as well as all other 

235
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:27,310
animals.
And you discover that by isolating genes

236
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:28,300
in,
in fruit flies.

237
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,134
In fact,
I think the fruit fly is featured in so 

238
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:32,590
many Nobel prize experiments.
It deserves its own.

239
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:34,900
It's a little Nobel prize,
wouldn't you say?

240
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,830
Yeah.
A little teeny little thing.

241
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,090
Yes.
Mike Young,

242
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,230
once you discover the components of 
these clocks,

243
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:47,140
you can look for them all over the 
organism.

244
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,240
And as Jeff and his colleagues,
uh,

245
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,140
showed,
uh,

246
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,640
Andrew Sophala,
you find different parts of the work and

247
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,550
the fruit fly,
a fruit fly.

248
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:58,270
Yeah.
You've got,

249
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,103
you've got many different body parts 
that display these rhythms using these 

250
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,770
clocks.
So it's not just behavior,

251
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:08,330
it's many aspects of physiology.
The,

252
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,340
the other thing that became clear was 
that you could start with the genes that

253
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,010
we found in the fruit fly.

254
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,353
And Lo and behold,
you have relatives in all the other 

255
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,770
members of the animal kingdom,
including us.

256
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,730
So can we ask questions that would help 
shift workers?

257
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,573
You know,
people who work in the emergency 

258
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:33,451
services deal better with the kind of 
work that they have to do at night.

259
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,743
Um,
can it help us understand why babies 

260
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,580
don't sleep during the night?
I mean,

261
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:41,740
I always find that expression at all.
I sleep so well.

262
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:42,574
Just like a baby must've been said by 
somebody who was never looked after a 

263
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:48,610
baby because we know they don't sleep at
night.

264
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,290
Right.
So I mean,

265
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,891
you know,
does,

266
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:54,340
does your work help us understand these 
common experiences?

267
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,890
Well,
in many cases what it reveals is there's

268
00:13:56,891 --> 00:14:00,600
much more complexity to what's wrong or,
or,

269
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,240
or what we think we're observing when a 
baby's not sleeping,

270
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,270
for example,
or take jet lag.

271
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,203
When,
uh,

272
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,030
we go from New York or Boston to,
uh,

273
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,433
uh,
to Stockholm,

274
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,570
what's really going on?
Most of us think,

275
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,460
well,
in a few days,

276
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,980
uh,
my one body clock,

277
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,960
we'll get the stock home and until then 
I'm going to be in a state of malaise.

278
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,843
In fact,
what happens is that since you have 

279
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,083
clocks all over your body,
there is disagreement that starts 

280
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,744
occurring between the cells in different
parts of your body about what time of 

281
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:37,900
day is it is.
And so in fact,

282
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:42,190
at the end of a flight from New York to 
Stockholm for the next few days,

283
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:43,024
you're really occupying,
your body is occupying multiple time 

284
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:50,260
zones simultaneously,
depending on which clock you look at.

285
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,393
Interesting.
Well,

286
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,050
I believe

287
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:57,050
your research says that there's good and
bad times during the day where,

288
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,540
where are we right now?
So it depends.

289
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,960
It depends on the,
there's there's times which,

290
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:12,320
which are more favorable for some things
than others.

291
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,253
Yeah.
So I think what you're alluding to 

292
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,074
perhaps is this,
this is a very successful nap time for 

293
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:18,770
exam,
for example.

294
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,633
For example,
especially for gentlemen or ladies our 

295
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:26,330
age around,
around this table where in fact,

296
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:30,230
who were up late last night,
we were up very late last night was when

297
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:33,530
you received your awards,
do it all the festivities and,

298
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,890
and to an astronaut that has no 
resetting mechanism,

299
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,160
well,
so aren't the cabins.

300
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,790
And My,
my impression was that the,

301
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,840
the,
the cabins have very intense light,

302
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,170
artificial light,
dark cycles to mimic,

303
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,010
to mimic the external environment.
Pretty primitive suicide.

304
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,480
Even if they didn't.
Yeah.

305
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,940
Even if they didn't,
if they weren't constant darkness,

306
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,030
they would show these rhythms and,
and that's fine.

307
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:00,800
In fact,
that's how they were originally revealed

308
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,750
in these models.
Let's see if we do often have,

309
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:03,584
the reality is that if you put an 
organism into cycles that are different 

310
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,220
from a day,
like seven hours,

311
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,054
seven hours,
yeah.

312
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,840
That certain organisms depending on the 
organism can synchronize.

313
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,580
Yeah.
That's the old cult cycles.

314
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,653
But at some point,
you're so far away from 24 when you do 

315
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,730
these tests,
they snap.

316
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:23,763
We know here in Sweden,
actually a lot of people do say they 

317
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:27,670
have these lights that lumps,
that mimic daylight,

318
00:16:27,671 --> 00:16:30,760
don't they?
Because they have such a dark days.

319
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:31,594
But this time with you,
but some of your colleagues working on 

320
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:34,804
the body clock,
you've benefited from the work of our 

321
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:37,720
chemistry,
uh,

322
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,643
laureates because of course some 
gentleman you won your award for 

323
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:44,560
developing a technique called Cryo em,
um,

324
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:50,010
which for the first time captured images
of molecules that were not visible using

325
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,600
standard techniques.
And of course,

326
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:57,250
we know that the world of molecules is 
the core of what we call life.

327
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:02,240
So Richard Anderson in a nutshell,
what is Cryo em?

328
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,663
I think our,
our area of interest and expertise is 

329
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:08,320
the easiest to explain.
In this group.

330
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,190
We basically freeze a thin film of the 
molecules of life.

331
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,280
Take a picture of it and then you look 
at the picture with your eyes.

332
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:17,710
It's magnified and you can see all the 
molecules.

333
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,400
The computer helps you to interpret what
they are.

334
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,503
But the,
the methodologies are the tools that 

335
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,140
were invented by,
uh,

336
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,060
the others particularly shock.
Duboce [inaudible].

337
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,580
All right,
well we'll go to shank dubois show then.

338
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,590
So this tool that enables you to look at
these molecules,

339
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:37,744
I mean its potential,
its possibilities of how it can help 

340
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,210
human endeavor cure illnesses.

341
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,310
We are physicist,
we worked in

342
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,730
biology and we get the Nobel prize in 
chemistry that confused people please.

343
00:17:56,251 --> 00:18:01,251
He goes because we see atoms,
uh,

344
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,800
with the help of those people.
And when we see atoms we do chemistry.

345
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,060
And chemistry is a very powerful science
because if you have a biological object,

346
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,690
you see how the items are interacting,
one with the other.

347
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,810
You see how Alzheimer filaments are 
attach to each other.

348
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,670
Perhaps you see a drug which will 
separate the mall,

349
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,820
will prevent them to associate.
You will see anything with,

350
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,350
with,
with uh,

351
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,970
Kevin History.
It's an extraordinary power for method.

352
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,561
Yeah.
But I mean,

353
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:43,730
in the case of,
of,

354
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,050
you know,
what do you want your price for?

355
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:45,884
For instance,
in the case of the sea can fire is Cryo 

356
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,710
e m was used to generate three d images 
of the virus,

357
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:54,080
which meant researchers could try to 
work out,

358
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:54,914
you know,
what kind of drugs would help to resist 

359
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,670
the virus.
For instance.

360
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,770
I don't know if you want to pick that up
Joachim Front.

361
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,180
Yep.

362
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,130
Uh,
Zika is,

363
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,130
is a,
is a perfect illustration for,

364
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,383
uh,
did this combine a technology that is 

365
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,564
now available.
So when we do know the structure of it 

366
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,170
now,
it doesn't mean that we immediately find

367
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:19,190
a way of combating sees,
but,

368
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,080
but it makes it possible.
So the potential,

369
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:22,800
Richard Thaler.
Yeah.

370
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,633
Yeah.
I was just going to say that this links 

371
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:28,080
up to the conversation we were having a 
bit earlier,

372
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,510
which is,
um,

373
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,520
w whether choice architecture or nudging
is a good or bad,

374
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:36,354
it just depends on who's using it.
So all the scientists here have created 

375
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,850
knowledge that can be used for good or 
evil.

376
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,773
Um,
the s the same is true for a behavioral 

377
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:51,900
science or behavioral economics.
Um,

378
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,230
and many companies nudge for evil.
Um,

379
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,250
last last night I toast was to nudge for
good and,

380
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,410
but that's a hope.

381
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,180
What you trying to send.
I mean all of you have worked,

382
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,050
you know,
for many,

383
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:10,190
many years on your endeavors.
And I think it was one chemist who said,

384
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:11,860
you know,
miracles sometimes the,

385
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,440
but you have to work terribly hard.
I mean,

386
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:18,440
is part and parcel of everything you do,
isn't it?

387
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,274
Failure is part and parcel of that,
that you'll carry out lots and lots of 

388
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:25,670
experiments and expect many of them not 
to succeed.

389
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,903
Yeah,
I think we are aiming to find out 

390
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:29,384
completely you things.
So if when you're thinking of an 

391
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,500
experiment in it,
in any area,

392
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,210
if the,
uh,

393
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,080
the choice that you make is close to the
knowledge that you have already,

394
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,240
then you're likely to have a successful 
experiment.

395
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,470
But you want to have learned very much.
So if you make a bigger jump,

396
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,730
take a bigger risk and then most of the 
time the experience when a feel,

397
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:52,390
but when it succeeds,
you make a bigger jump forward.

398
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,300
So I learned from,
uh,

399
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,590
Fred Sanger who had,
uh,

400
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,483
was,
uh,

401
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,330
had two Nobel prizes for his work in 
sequencing protein and DNA.

402
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,700
He used to say,
uh,

403
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,990
that you should aim for a very high 
failure rate.

404
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:09,991
My interpretation was 99% failure rate,
but the 1% that succeed takes you with a

405
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:11,254
very big step forward,
which is worth all the effort you've 

406
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:15,930
spent or the other night.
I would say that

407
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,310
leaves out one,
one important component,

408
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,130
especially for young people who,
who like science.

409
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:24,370
And that is the discussion of,
of uh,

410
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,480
high risk,
high failure or very lofty goals,

411
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,100
leaves out an element of craftsmanship 
to our profession.

412
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:34,240
In other words,
I think,

413
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:34,990
I think,
uh,

414
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,441
the,
the,

415
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,480
the Chin with you,
the chance of,

416
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,530
of having tremendous success is,
is very small for anyone to individuals.

417
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,873
We are the,
we're the progeny that w we are the 

418
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:48,274
beneficiaries of also a lot of luck as 
well as hard work and perhaps a tiny 

419
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:52,714
little bit of talent.
But the fact is that most of us here 

420
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:56,854
love what we did.
And so that carries you through 

421
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:00,050
failures.
Sure.

422
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,660
And you have to really like to do it.

423
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,050
But an interesting Michael all smash 
because when you were young,

424
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,590
you were marked out as a potential 
failure at school.

425
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,890
You were very unruly by your own 
admission.

426
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,020
Okay.
You've known each other,

427
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:18,460
I know for many,
many years,

428
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:20,340
for 30 years,
but you also shocking to go,

429
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:20,951
I'll show,
you know,

430
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:24,330
you say that you were dyslexic at school
and Richard [inaudible],

431
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,960
you are mildly dyslexic.
I mean,

432
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:26,794
I think it's interesting that your paths
to this success now worrying about the 

433
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:30,910
wrong thing.
It has been,

434
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,160
you know what,
I was just inspiring to people,

435
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:33,680
isn't it?

436
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,680
The list to Michael,
he said something very profound and that

437
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:40,934
is,
people like to work on things that are 

438
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,440
fun,
that are a pleasure to work on.

439
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:49,580
That's absolutely fundamental.
None of us,

440
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,700
at least I certainly in my life,
didn't think I'm good.

441
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:52,940
My win,
the Nobel prize.

442
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:55,790
It was never in my mind.
It was not,

443
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,850
my life was not dedicated to winning a 
prize.

444
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,540
My life was dedicated.
I enjoyed this thing I was working on.

445
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,583
Hey,
it was fun.

446
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,820
I,
my buddies with me,

447
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:07,460
we had a great time.
The whole project,

448
00:23:07,461 --> 00:23:10,710
the Lego project isn't based on the fact
that they all look,

449
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,490
God,
we fail.

450
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,830
We fail.
No,

451
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,030
wait a minute.
Just listen to me.

452
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,123
I got to listen to me.
This is important because that just 

453
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:20,450
stuck in that the,
you said it right and asking,

454
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,920
Oh,
oh God.

455
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:22,701
Failure,
failure,

456
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,440
failure.
That's not the way you think.

457
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,380
Yeah.
So the consequence is that you do things

458
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:28,214
which you get a kick out of.
And Luckily sometimes they turn out to 

459
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:32,144
be important.

460
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,990
Bye.
[inaudible] you are they not done.

461
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:39,830
Brings

462
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,663
me to,
um,

463
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,580
Kazuo Ishiguro universally known as ish.
Um,

464
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,523
who won the Nobel Prize for literature.
And I know that in your writing career 

465
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:50,114
you've had some false starts and works 
that you've discarded and started all 

466
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,610
over again.
Um,

467
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,503
but you know,
you are now amongst the giants of the 

468
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:03,260
world of literature.
You've written eight novels.

469
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:04,094
And so when I see a lot of your,
your novel seem on the surface to be 

470
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:09,410
quite different,
you know,

471
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:10,244
set in different countries and so on,
but there does seem to be a common 

472
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:16,190
theme,
the relationship between the present and

473
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:17,180
the past,
would you say?

474
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,410
Yes,
the surface of my novel.

475
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:25,370
So kind of to set people think I keep 
moving on.

476
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,703
Uh,
truth is I keep writing the same thing 

477
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:28,544
over and over again and people don't 
realize it because they have very 

478
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,474
different settings.
But I think perhaps there is a parallel 

479
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:36,164
between the kind of way I make progress 
in the kind of way that the guys around 

480
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:42,310
this table have done.
Um,

481
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,623
I,
I dig around some sort of piece of 

482
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:51,140
ground.
Sometimes somebody comes up with an idea

483
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:51,974
or a topic that somewhere out there and 
I think what that be great for somebody 

484
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:57,540
else but it's not on this little thing.
Um,

485
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,470
I'm closing in on a,
um,

486
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,573
I'm digging away in the dead of night 
looking expecting to sort of uncover 

487
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:06,800
something strange down there.

488
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,120
You mentioned the scientists around the 
table,

489
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:09,954
but you are interested in a discussion 
about science and one of your most 

490
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:18,540
famous books never let me go.
Um,

491
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,050
looks at um,
scientific advances,

492
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,750
um,
in a world that's kind of gone mad,

493
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,850
perhaps sat in,
in,

494
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:26,684
in the future where society expects that
all illnesses can be fixed and they 

495
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:32,580
don't want to turn the clock back to,
you know,

496
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:33,414
people dying of cancer and so on.
It is that something that really 

497
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,470
concerns you?
The misuse of science.

498
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,270
These are very important things I think 
for books,

499
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,870
films,
plays to address,

500
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,640
but that isn't essentially what 
literature is for.

501
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,670
It doesn't have to directly address 
these questions.

502
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,180
I think what literature does is allow us
to understand each other across cultural

503
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,710
barriers,
linguistic barriers,

504
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,570
so that when we come to have the debates
about how we order our society,

505
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,433
what is important,
we understand how other people not 

506
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,410
obviously like us feel most discoveries.
I think a two edged blades,

507
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,450
and this is at the heart of the Nobel 
metaphase.

508
00:26:19,451 --> 00:26:20,284
You like a man who invents dynamite,
which can do great things and very 

509
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:28,900
destructive things.
We have to have a debate in society.

510
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:29,734
We have to think about what we do with 
the great breakthroughs in the site of 

511
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,473
guys around the table.
The other way to make sure that what we 

512
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:42,541
do is understood enough by the public.
It doesn't have to be exactly what we,

513
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,383
you know,
this

514
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,770
famous problem.
It was this,

515
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,613
a CP snow made such a fuss over and I 
think he had did a lot of damage with 

516
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:54,861
that is the this cross fertilization of 
people do science people who do music,

517
00:26:56,101 --> 00:27:00,210
people who do arts.
That's got TIPCO and it isn't that,

518
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,320
I mean,
I'd like to have,

519
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,154
for example,
if in our country right now I'd like to 

520
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:08,730
have the arts be able to know a little 
more science,

521
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,973
very bearish.
I know you're a great fan of Kazuo 

522
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,763
Ishiguro rose work.
What do you think about this 

523
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:17,990
conversation between science and art?
You want it to be a novelist,

524
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:18,824
didn't you?
Yeah,

525
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,860
I mean I think what I mean,
as I said,

526
00:27:21,861 --> 00:27:24,650
I eliminated several professions and 
ended up in physics.

527
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,100
The earliest one was being a writer 
because I read all the time when I was a

528
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:28,934
kid.
If you write a novel and it's read by 

529
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:31,220
100,000
readers,

530
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:33,440
you're really writing 100,000
novels.

531
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,700
That's why there's book clubs because 
it's not that anybody,

532
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,330
the guy next to you doesn't read well.
It's the how that novel,

533
00:27:41,331 --> 00:27:45,380
this interpreted by them is different 
than how you interpret the novel.

534
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:50,410
So it's a fantastic thing that you can 
write something that actually is 100,000

535
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:51,284
stories I think.
And why the movies never as good as the 

536
00:27:53,931 --> 00:27:54,764
book because the movie does too much.
She doesn't really have the same 

537
00:27:57,621 --> 00:27:59,690
partnership.
That's my view.

538
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,780
Mm.
Did you like the movie of your book?

539
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:03,614
Never let me go.

540
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,563
Yes.
And I loved the movie of the remains of 

541
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:09,460
the day.
I don't myself make a huge,

542
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,040
I don't disagree with you,
but,

543
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:12,720
um,
uh,

544
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,131
you know,
I,

545
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:16,450
I think all the art forms have their 
special powers.

546
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:16,980
Yeah,
sure.

547
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,490
There are things that I can't do that 
the filmmakers can do very,

548
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,840
very well and vice versa.

549
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,180
I just go to you.
I can frank,

550
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:25,014
because I know that you are a writer.
You've written short stories which have 

551
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:29,214
been published and you have a novel 
which has been unpublished about and 

552
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:35,930
astro physicist at a university,
um,

553
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,180
that it might get published now that you
are an Obama,

554
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,933
you know,
any publishers listening unless you've 

555
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:42,620
known.
Yeah.

556
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,790
Yeah.
Thanks for the plug.

557
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,683
A,
well,

558
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,450
for me,
uh,

559
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,290
the English language,
uh,

560
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,160
became a medium of re inventing by 
itself.

561
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,020
Uh,
three,

562
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,540
uh,
I mean it was a very challenging thing.

563
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:59,810
And,
and when I discovered that I could write

564
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,840
dialogue and cut something across a,
it was an incredible experience to me.

565
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,503
I'm,
I'm saying it's sort of daunted by the 

566
00:29:10,821 --> 00:29:15,350
idea.
I'm sitting next to it in the literature

567
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:18,440
and talking about my little little 
production.

568
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,570
Oh,
well why don't,

569
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:22,850
well,

570
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,683
one small point about that.
Certainly in the interest of young 

571
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,670
scientists,
which is,

572
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,563
uh,
I think a lot of young scientists don't 

573
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:36,720
pay any attention to the writing.
I don't mean writing a novel.

574
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,690
Um,
when you do research,

575
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,920
the end product is something written

576
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,430
and until you've written it down,
you haven't done anything.

577
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,551
Uh,
that,

578
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,490
that kind of says to me as well very 
much,

579
00:29:48,491 --> 00:29:51,190
but you just sick as somebody from the 
world of the arts,

580
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,880
there seems to be some sort of 
disconnect with,

581
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,590
with your great discoveries and your 
breakthroughs and,

582
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,890
and then what the rest of society gets 
preoccupied about.

583
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,170
And in popular culture and popular 
debate,

584
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,890
it seems to me we're the world,
the Western world anyway,

585
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,400
very well prepared for a Zombie attack 
on our major cities.

586
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,670
But we don't seem to be addressing,
uh,

587
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,623
you know,
how we reorganize our society as a 

588
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:19,774
result of some of the staggering 
breakthrough started being made in 

589
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,670
science and technology.

590
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,780
[inaudible]

591
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,633
one to take two aspect of science,
which really has captured the public 

592
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:35,380
imagination.
Popular Imagination of course,

593
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:38,080
is the world of science fiction.
Um,

594
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,183
I'll come to the physics lawyers because
you won your prize for the observation 

595
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,253
of gravitational waves.
It was the first time that a passing 

596
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:50,650
gravitational wave has been observed 
directly on earth that you know,

597
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:53,650
huge scientific sensation.
So,

598
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,970
um,
kip Thorne,

599
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:59,410
why don't you just encapsulate for us 
what this was all about?

600
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:04,790
So the black hole is something that 
every child knows from comic books,

601
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,360
but a black hole is a spherical hole in 
space that has such intense gravity that

602
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:16,811
nothing can get out and not even light.
And what we discovered was that 1.3

603
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:22,250
billion years ago in a galaxy far,
far away,

604
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,960
two black holes circled around and 
around each other,

605
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,213
spiraling together.
As they emitted these gravitational 

606
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:32,780
waves losing energy to the gravitational
waves,

607
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,680
the holes came crashing together at half
the speed of light,

608
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,030
and they created a veritable storm in 
the shape of space.

609
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:41,864
And time,
time slow down and sped up oscillated 

610
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:46,700
wildly.
If you can imagine time,

611
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:47,534
they're speeding up.
And slowing down relative to how time 

612
00:31:49,761 --> 00:31:54,761
flows here and that process produced 
these waves and which space is stretched

613
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,540
and squeeze,
stretched and squeezed.

614
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:00,763
The traveled across interstellar space,
intergalactic space to the earth and 

615
00:32:05,871 --> 00:32:06,704
were captured by the,
or monitored by the instruments were 

616
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:14,540
built by the experimental team that I'm 
associated with.

617
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,220
This is a whole new way to study the 
university study aspects of the universe

618
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:20,054
that we've never seen before.
It's a way by which we will in due 

619
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:24,794
course watch the birth of the universe 
and for the first time really come to 

620
00:32:28,551 --> 00:32:31,340
understand through recombination of this
with the theory,

621
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,020
the birth of the universe,

622
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,240
ray and Barry,
I mean,

623
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:38,370
what kind of,
it's a window on the world on,

624
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,253
on our universe.
What kinds of things might we discover 

625
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:44,510
about our universe that we don't know 
now,

626
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,373
Barry,

627
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,470
we've worked for decades developing an 
instrument,

628
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:52,290
much likelihood the chemists talk about 
this.

629
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:53,610
Just astounding.
I mean,

630
00:32:53,611 --> 00:32:58,350
I can't imagine that we could do what we
could do except that we learn very early

631
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,480
that you couldn't prove that we couldn't
do it.

632
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:05,220
So we kept making steps and as I think 
ray said earlier,

633
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,623
people keep asking us,
how could we stay at this so long 

634
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,740
persistence.
No,

635
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,510
it was really a lot of fun because we've
broken new ground all the time,

636
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,320
much as you have without maybe making it
a discovery,

637
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:24,321
but just to experimentally go further 
than people have before.

638
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,543
Black coal was the cause and really are 
very much the stuff of science fiction 

639
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:28,940
films.
Kip Thorne,

640
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:33,380
you a scientific advisor and executive 
producer of one such film,

641
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,990
interstellar,
how important is it for you?

642
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,020
Do you think that science fiction should
actually be pays based on fact?

643
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,243
There's no necessity.
There are different genres of science 

644
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:49,580
fiction and my partner in Hollywood,
Lynda obst,

645
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:55,300
who together with me wrote the treatment
from which interstellar sprang.

646
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:02,110
She calls this science faction icon 
[inaudible] science fantasy.

647
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,470
Harry Potter is science fantasy,
interstellar science faction.

648
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:07,963
But the beauty of this for me is that a 
film like this where the science is 

649
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,400
embedded in right from the beginning,
uh,

650
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,660
it's capable of inspiring people about 
science.

651
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,810
How else could I as a professor succeed 
in providing some inspiration?

652
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:30,950
For 100 million people except for road 
blockbuster film.

653
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:31,630
Like this

654
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,280
one.
One particular thing that you know a lot

655
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:34,114
of people sort of you like to know about
in science fiction so on is are there 

656
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:40,760
other universes out there?
Parallel universes?

657
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:41,594
I mean it could your work in any way 
help us discover whether there are 

658
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,510
indeed other universities,

659
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,110
barry?
Well it,

660
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,640
it might,
there's different ways.

661
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,843
If we had an easy and straight forward 
test to see if there was this idea was 

662
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,590
right,
we'd probably be going after it.

663
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,640
There's various ways that we might get 
clues,

664
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:06,060
whether it's right and some of them are 
through the kind of work we're doing.

665
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,583
It's not very direct.
It's one of the ideas that kind of 

666
00:35:09,661 --> 00:35:12,480
springs from what we don't know about 
the early universe.

667
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,583
So discussing here,
you know the success of films like 

668
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:20,601
interstellar and science fiction to 
contradictions there you might say,

669
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,030
I mean how important it sort of just 
thinking about this,

670
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:24,864
this unit in general terms,
do you think that evidence based 

671
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,273
discourse is in our societies today?
Let me get a view from all of you on 

672
00:35:34,501 --> 00:35:35,281
this.
Particularly as you,

673
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:38,250
perhaps you first jeff or people don't

674
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:43,250
know much about science and technology,
the electricity,

675
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,360
a miracle,
for example,

676
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:53,100
day to day things that never existed 
Dick centuries ago.

677
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:53,934
And now we're taking for granted the 
proper American in the United States is 

678
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:02,661
not only ignorant but is actively 
belligerently pugnacious Lee ignorance.

679
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,540
I refuse

680
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,653
go away or I'm secular humanist before 
who thinks that they're all of these 

681
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,513
irrational influences and that you will 
seek the triumph of reason in the face 

682
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:20,520
of all this.
Um,

683
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,653
Michael Ross Bash.

684
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,030
A lot of this has to do with,
with educational landscape because we,

685
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:28,530
we,
we've seen circumstances,

686
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,970
Eh,
most starkly in the u s but,

687
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:34,800
but in western Europe as well,
where politicians,

688
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,820
ambitious people take advantage of,
of,

689
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,683
uh,
the situation to exploit for their own 

690
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:43,690
benefit,
for power gaining power.

691
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:45,720
It's,
it's not something that's unprecedented,

692
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,233
uh,
happened in the 20th century to 

693
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,760
disastrous,
to disastrous ends.

694
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:52,260
And so it's,
it's a,

695
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,620
it's a very worrisome,
it's very worrisome concept.

696
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,913
Mike Hill,

697
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,110
you can have an attitude that you're not
interested in science and you don't,

698
00:37:02,111 --> 00:37:04,900
can't benefit from science.
Uh,

699
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:05,763
these wouldn't exist if there hadn't 
been discoveries 50 years ago that 

700
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:11,290
invented the technology.
Uh,

701
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,153
if you,
uh,

702
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,053
just about every minute of the day,
everyone depends on some form of 

703
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:23,431
technology so that the notion that it's 
over or we have enough or uh,

704
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,820
it never happened or it never happened,
uh,

705
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:32,710
that this is brand new and created from 
whole cloth is,

706
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,620
is such an incredible mistake.
Which a sailor,

707
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,300
we have a fact free administration in 
the United States.

708
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,090
Um,
worrying about science.

709
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,120
It would be nice if,
um,

710
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,013
there was,
there were scientists and the 

711
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:52,710
administration.
I would,

712
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,723
um,
subtle for some people who are 

713
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:56,340
collecting facts.

714
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,660
Right.
But Barry is interesting.

715
00:37:58,661 --> 00:37:59,140
I mean,
you know,

716
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,390
talk about it.
We've heard anti-science bias from,

717
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:04,120
from Jeff Wall for instance,
but your lego project,

718
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,393
um,
for the observation of these 

719
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,450
gravitational waves,
did,

720
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:12,190
do you think that kind of support would 
happen today for something like we did?

721
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,521
Yeah.
Well,

722
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:14,020
I'm worried not,
not,

723
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,230
you can't do science and move forward 
without taking risks yet.

724
00:38:17,231 --> 00:38:20,110
We have a system this become more and 
more conservative.

725
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:23,770
I personally knowing the funding 
situation pretty well.

726
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:27,790
And the u s through the National Science
Foundation don't believe that right now.

727
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:29,560
You could fund something that was 
equivalent.

728
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,740
We as scientists have a job.
It's not just that we,

729
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,490
we have a job to make what we do more 
intelligible

730
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,340
to people.
I think that that's why,

731
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,620
I mean kipps movie is an important 
thing.

732
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,550
I think you also have to go and talk to 
people who are not at college levels.

733
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,370
You have to talk to high school kids and
grade school kids.

734
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,230
Yeah,
I agree completely with,

735
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,083
with ray on this.
And I think the one key aspect I'd like 

736
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:58,550
to emphasize is the importance that the 
general public,

737
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,100
that the majority of the populace,
uh,

738
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,240
in a democracy particularly,
uh,

739
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:10,420
understands how science works,
understands its powers,

740
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,480
its limitations,

741
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,000
Jack to bullshit.
Uh,

742
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,090
the red mark by Mr.
Ashley.

743
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,983
She go home that it would be easy to 
develop and make great a story about 

744
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:27,830
zombies coming on us and destroy him.
Everything easy.

745
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,693
But why is it so difficult?
Why does it work to make a terrible 

746
00:39:32,391 --> 00:39:33,224
story about our climate going astray,
going about as bad as the Zombie beyond 

747
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,450
earth.
Why can't we make a story of that?

748
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,120
Well,
you know,

749
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,150
I can frank or we talked before about,
uh,

750
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,960
the,
the difficulty of,

751
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,813
of,
of getting science even across to the 

752
00:39:55,341 --> 00:40:00,080
public and it,
that they are no existing forums and,

753
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,160
uh,
you know,

754
00:40:01,161 --> 00:40:04,210
the problem is we have all these forums,
uh,

755
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,770
the media and the media,
you know,

756
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,000
chop everything into pieces,
Eh,

757
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:14,090
and,
and people are completely incapable of,

758
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,060
of getting some kind of a coherent story
out of this.

759
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,263
Richard Henderson do think that the role
of the scientist is to explain their 

760
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:21,834
science to society,
but also beyond that to actually say we 

761
00:40:25,411 --> 00:40:26,244
want to raise the level of knowledge 
based comments and debates and 

762
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,360
completely with you on that.
Actually,

763
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:34,194
I think scientists are,
I am an optimist about this whole 

764
00:40:37,621 --> 00:40:38,610
discussion.
Uh,

765
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,310
I think scientists particularly have to 
be optimists.

766
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,370
You couldn't have worked for 50 years 
to,

767
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,363
to look for gravitational waves without 
being an optimist to differentiate 

768
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:50,850
between a rational,
irrational fact and fiction.

769
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,520
Better education,
I think is the answer actually.

770
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,660
And lots of people,
uh,

771
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,080
want better education for their 
children.

772
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:58,914
Some of them take their children out of 
school to give them a better education 

773
00:41:01,351 --> 00:41:02,184
of home.
Some people take them out of school to 

774
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:05,280
avoid it.
Exactly.

775
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:08,290
So we need to improve the general when 
doctor nate.

776
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,790
Yeah.
So that was nice.

777
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,060
Better education is the bottom line 
correct?

778
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,240
You have in the past,
yes.

779
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,670
I mean you're just thinking with 
scientists,

780
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,240
people to deal with facts,
but you're going to make a plea for also

781
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,313
fiction has a place in society.
Obviously we liked reading works of 

782
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,140
fiction,

783
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,400
fiction culture.
I mean I think one of the issues is that

784
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,263
the business model behind the media and 
journalism reporting is currently 

785
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:45,340
broken.
The traditional ways in which newspapers

786
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:50,341
and periodicals use to spread knowledge 
and debate and they were rewarded for by

787
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,250
and large for accuracy is gone.
Uh,

788
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,690
w what is important at the moment is 
that it's eyeballs in it,

789
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,350
uh,
on websites clips.

790
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,290
You know,
there isn't a good economic,

791
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,530
economically viable business model,
uh,

792
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,420
by which,
uh,

793
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,120
we can have these debates,
uh,

794
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:14,080
because,
um,

795
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,160
people are driven by,
by the fact that you,

796
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:17,994
you have to get,
maximize the number of clips on the 

797
00:42:19,661 --> 00:42:20,440
website.
Right.

798
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,730
Well,
I hope you have fun.

799
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,783
Wow.

800
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,180
I hope you'll make an honorable 
exception of this program at least,

801
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,173
and that you have had the chance to 
interact with these great minds as well 

802
00:42:38,161 --> 00:42:41,940
as adding your great mind to our debate 
here and our discussion.

803
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:43,430
I think everybody has found,
uh,

804
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,313
in the audience and beyond everything 
that you've said really absolutely 

805
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,280
fascinating.
I've certainly enjoyed talking to all of

806
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:53,420
you.
Thank you to all our Nobel laureates 'em

807
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,550
to our audience here in Stockholm at the
concert hall from me,

808
00:42:56,551 --> 00:43:00,510
Xenapp Badawi in all of this on the no 
bomb minds team.

809
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,000
Thank you very much indeed for watching.
Goodbye.
