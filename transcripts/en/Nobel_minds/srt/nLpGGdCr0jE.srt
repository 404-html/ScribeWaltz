00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,120
Hello,
I'm Zina puddle.

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,063
Welcome to the concert hall in Stockholm
where the Nobel prize winners received 

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,093
their awards from the king of Sweden for
their outstanding contributions to 

4
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,970
science,
literature and Economics.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,953
This is the first time that this year's 
laureates or repairing together on 

6
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:31,880
television and they've been joined by 
their family and friends who've traveled

7
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,250
to Stockholm to share in the 
celebrations.

8
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:35,084
And we are also joined by students from 
here in Sweden who are going to be 

9
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:43,961
putting their questions to our laureates
on this year's Nobel mine.

10
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:11,780
So we have discoveries on repairing 
damaged DNA,

11
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,870
which increase our knowledge of the 
universe,

12
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,883
cure tropical diseases.
And in economics we throw light on the 

13
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:22,670
links between poverty consumption and 
welfare.

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,713
And the literature prize gives voice to 
the voiceless in authoritarians 

15
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:29,390
societies.
Laureates,

16
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,160
congratulations to you all.

17
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,700
[inaudible]

18
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,503
wonderful.
Let's go straight away to our first 

19
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:45,640
question from our audience here.
And it is Martin.

20
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:47,980
Martin please.
Your first question to our laureates.

21
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,230
So there are a lot of the prices and 
competitions in all of your fields and I

22
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,064
just wanted to have your opinion,
do you think it is a good addition to 

23
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:59,134
motivate people to get engaged or do you
think it inspires unnecessary 

24
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:03,874
competition?

25
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,890
So well I kind of miss or never 
competitive.

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,960
We have something called perfect 
competition which economists believe in.

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,423
Um,
I'm not sure the Nobel does much of 

28
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:22,094
that.
I've been very impressed by how much 

29
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,323
positive um,
just general happiness and wellbeing it 

30
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,110
seems to generate.
Um,

31
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,493
it's clear though over the years in the 
past there certainly is some resentment 

32
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,110
on behalf of people who don't win.
I've never felt that personally.

33
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:48,040
But you hear discussions stairs when you
pass by.

34
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,460
I have not experienced any of that.
I'd been very fortunate that way.

35
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,970
But I do think in the past people have 
felt that a whole area,

36
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,610
you know,
that should have been recognized,

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,340
never was recognized,

38
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,660
for instance.
And I'm sure,

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,910
and that's a more legitimate feeling 
them.

40
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,260
I'm sure there's some people who feel 
that they should have been writing guys.

41
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,103
They're more not,

42
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,170
you are a professor date.
And in saying that,

43
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,920
but I'm sure you deserved your price,
but let me just see what,

44
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:14,754
uh,
anybody else poor madre to professor 

45
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,440
moderate.
Yeah.

46
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Well I think it's useful and bringing 
visibility to science fields.

47
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,000
Um,
I uh,

48
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,343
agree with Angus.
I think that there have been instances 

49
00:03:28,351 --> 00:03:29,184
where people have felt certainly in my 
field that the certain areas that were 

50
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:39,180
worthy of a prize were neglected.
And,

51
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:42,270
and uh,
so there is a value judgment I think in,

52
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,520
in,
in selection of the fields.

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,220
Professor Campbell,
I think a,

54
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:48,960
it does not create competition among 
sign,

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
just don't compete for that.
And secondly,

56
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,650
I think it's inevitable and it also adds
a nice little bit of,

57
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,170
um,
something special,

58
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,530
uh,
the time just kinda enjoy.

59
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,463
So I think it's sort of inspirational 
and not confrontational and certainly 

60
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:09,200
not inducing and not the juice of,
of competition.

61
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,573
And the chemistry failed our way.
Been very fortunate and that the three 

62
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,920
winners worked on different mechanisms 
of DNA repair and we had no competition.

63
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,440
So we've been fortunate to have it that 
way.

64
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,250
And so in this particular case,
there was no competition.

65
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,930
It rounded off the chemist there.
Professor Thomas Lindahl okay.

66
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,883
Yes.
I think a healthy competition is a good 

67
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:36,650
thing.
Yeah.

68
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,300
Uh,
it's uh,

69
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,980
excellent different scientist goes a 
little bit of a stray with his idea,

70
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:46,760
send that sample Dale's correct them and
uh,

71
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,810
I think it would be too comfortable if 
there was no competition at all.

72
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,683
Huh.

73
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,580
Okay.
So you met us on Alec Serve,

74
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:57,210
which obviously you are the literature 
laureate,

75
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,350
I should say.
Actually,

76
00:04:58,351 --> 00:05:00,300
of course,
everybody that a spirit line,

77
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,750
Alex overage is speaking in Russian.
Um,

78
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,100
and I know the question was specifically
about science,

79
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:08,550
but in terms of receiving the Nobel 
prize,

80
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,520
as Professor Deaton said,
it's a very,

81
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,130
it's a real accolade.
I mean,

82
00:05:14,131 --> 00:05:17,460
do you feel that it's going to help you 
in some way,

83
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:18,990
do what you do better?

84
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,260
Uh Huh.

85
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,260
Yeah.
Just cause [inaudible] [inaudible] no.

86
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,610
[inaudible] [inaudible] no,
they deal with sweat.

87
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,713
Delish murals.
Trixie [inaudible] premiums in a love 

88
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:47,534
with the deal

89
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,983
[inaudible]

90
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,720
the physicist professor aren't 
Mcdonald's and then,

91
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,980
oh,
you want to go first?

92
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:54,510
Professor Cogito.
Yes.

93
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,753
Okay.
Whoa.

94
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,283
We both wanted to understand what is 
[inaudible] properties of neutrinos and 

95
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:03,914
we have the same gold and coming from 
different experiments and we are very 

96
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:10,664
much

97
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,940
complimentary rather than competitive 
complimentary rather than competition.

98
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:19,640
So I'm getting the sense of that to 
Martin,

99
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:21,340
your question about it.
Um,

100
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,660
perhaps encouraging competition is,
uh,

101
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,210
not getting much traction here,
aren't Macdonald.

102
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,920
Yep.

103
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,970
I think the scientists are primarily 
motivated by the science.

104
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,210
They're attempting to understand our 
universe more completely.

105
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,920
I think they're quite satisfied when 
they recognize themselves that they have

106
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:42,670
made a breakthrough and have understood 
things more completely.

107
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,923
I think when there is the recognition 
like this by such a respected body as 

108
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:48,870
the,
uh,

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,833
people who define the Nobel prize,
it's something that is highly respected 

110
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,293
in the community.
It adds to the joy of having made a 

111
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:01,120
significant discovery.

112
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,473
So nobody really,
does anybody resonate briefly on what 

113
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:08,730
professor Deaton said about some sad 
damage,

114
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,760
tormented souls going around saying,
Oh,

115
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:13,220
I should have won the Nobel.
I could have won the Nobel.

116
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,054
It's not fair.
Has anybody come across any of such 

117
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:16,694
individuals?

118
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,290
Yeah,

119
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:21,520
I have a comment when you mom more then 
why I should that none.

120
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,203
Uh,
Juan didn't know about when you see a 

121
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:28,990
major breakthrough in your field.

122
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,340
Yeah,

123
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,173
I personally feel very bad.
I should admit that discover not that 

124
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:39,451
I'm doing right now.
There is something called Crispr is very

125
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:46,561
hot in our field and I wish I would bet 
that just color myself,

126
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,090
I would give anything for it.
So,

127
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,470
um,
it's,

128
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,453
it's not competition per se,
but it is a US scientists and 

129
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:01,910
individuals drive to,
to discover an important thing.

130
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,050
Thank you for your honesty professor 
Joe.

131
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,073
All right.
So now we were moving to a specific 

132
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:09,940
question,
which is for you,

133
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:12,940
Professor Angus Deaton,
your of course economics laureates,

134
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:13,774
and you won your prize for really,
I'm shedding a great deal of light on 

135
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:17,554
the links between poverty consumption 
and welfare and what implications there 

136
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,990
are for policy makers,
um,

137
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,010
particularly in setting levels of 
taxation from instance.

138
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:28,990
But let's see what comes up from our 
students.

139
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,143
Andrea with

140
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,500
hi,
I have a short question.

141
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,670
Is Fighting inequality a realistic aim?

142
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,030
MMM hmm.

143
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,400
It's maybe a short question though.
I'm not sure if short answer,

144
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,200
I mean here I think is the essence of 
the matter,

145
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,390
which has,
we have tools to fight inequality.

146
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,890
You know,
you could have in United States are much

147
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:56,040
more

148
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,650
progressive tax system presidents.
You know,

149
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:02,370
we could spend more money on education 
unless I'm on the fence.

150
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:04,890
I've heard as he's talked about that.
Um,

151
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,260
and there's lots of things you could do.
Um,

152
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:08,094
so the question is not having the tools.
So it's realistic in the sense that we 

153
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,740
have the tools,
right?

154
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,140
It's unrealistic in the sense that the 
politics is extraordinarily difficult.

155
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,750
So you know,
the people who have all the money,

156
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,770
all it's got to have a lot of political 
power and they're not very interested in

157
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,604
fighting inequality.
And so what do you do if you think 

158
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:33,030
there's too much in equality or 
inequality is reached dangerous levels,

159
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:37,190
which I do.
Then I think the best thing to do is,

160
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,123
is you have to participate in the 
democratic process and persuade other 

161
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:43,320
people that it's a problem.
For instance,

162
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,140
by being on a TV show like that.

163
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,100
So it is can be done,
you see?

164
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,590
But it's a lack of political will.
The tools are the,

165
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,630
you mentioned taxation sort of in 
passing,

166
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:53,464
but just briefly outline for us then,
what are the tools that can be used to 

167
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:58,840
reduce inequality?

168
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,331
Well,
this,

169
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:00,820
a lot of tax tools.
I mean,

170
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:04,210
one of them for instances like an 
inheritance tax for example.

171
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,910
But many of us have always thought that,
um,

172
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,863
you know,
fairly stiff inheritance taxes were a 

173
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,104
good thing because it helps,
it stops you having this hereditary 

174
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,153
inequality.
What Thomas picketty famously is called 

175
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,820
patrimonial capitalism,

176
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,713
please.
The French economist has written a lot 

177
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,520
about inequality.

178
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,463
That's right.
And I think many of us think it's good 

179
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,464
for each generation,
each group of kids who are born each 

180
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:33,600
generation to have an equal chance,
not just depending on what their parents

181
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,870
have and two ways of doing that.
One is um,

182
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,190
you know,
um,

183
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,233
and Harrison's taxes.
Another is trying to equalize the 

184
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:42,444
opportunities at schools and there's a 
big concern in the United States now 

185
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,070
that um,
you know,

186
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,440
the best schools are going to the kids,
um,

187
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:53,730
off the well off people and it's very 
hard,

188
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,550
much harder than it was in our 
generation for kids,

189
00:10:56,551 --> 00:11:00,990
for poor families to get into,
to get a really first class education.

190
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,820
And that's absolutely vital

191
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,310
professor as he said.
Joe,

192
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:07,430
would you mind mind bringing you in just
on this particular point?

193
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:08,264
Yeah,
because I hope you don't mind saying 

194
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:12,740
that you were born in Turkey.
That's right.

195
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,110
One of eight children.
Right.

196
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,500
And your parents could not read or 
write,

197
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,140
write,
write and here you are a Nobel laureate,

198
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,420
completely exemplifying what professor 
did

199
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:24,723
do.
United State has 25% of total prisoner 

200
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:33,570
population and that has to do with 
quality.

201
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,260
It has to do with lack of opportunity.
And that is a problem.

202
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,343
I think there was a recent article in 
New England Journal Medicine comparing 

203
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,290
the health care system and in Turkey and
the United States,

204
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,090
it's much better in Turkey,
Turkey not have the resource,

205
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,160
the United States.
And here we,

206
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:57,994
we pass the [inaudible] or Obama care,
which is a universal healthcare system 

207
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,613
and we're still fighting it,
a growth in the United States still 

208
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,250
fighting it.
So,

209
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:10,084
um,
even though I come from a country where 

210
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,400
the resources and,
and uh,

211
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,390
and so on are not as it does as the 
United States,

212
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,170
I think in,
in a certain aspect,

213
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:27,370
in terms of equal opportunity for 
education,

214
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,130
education and Tokyo is free,
you don't have that,

215
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,773
but it was just your,
your own individual personal story 

216
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,113
illustrates that.
If you're given that equality of 

217
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:40,100
opportunity,
somebody of your,

218
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,190
of background can rise to top can do it.
And I wish my adopted country would take

219
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,780
the necessary steps to do that.

220
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,330
All right.
Okay.

221
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,430
Thank you.
There was another question for you,

222
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:55,460
professor Deaton and that's from David 
Gandolfi.

223
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,323
David.

224
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,753
Uh,
thank you professor [inaudible] for 

225
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,820
coming here and think 12 the Nobel 
laureates.

226
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,953
My question is specifically you have 
expressed some criticism about foreign 

227
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:10,680
aid to poor countries.
Now why is that?

228
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,720
Okay.
Um,

229
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,943
so let me start by saying that I'm not 
critical a tall of the wish to help 

230
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:23,530
people in poor countries,
but I think a lot of what we're doing in

231
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:24,364
terms of foreign aid right now is 
actually not helping a tall and there's 

232
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:27,964
lots of things we can do from the 
outside which will make the new 

233
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:34,870
innovations,
the new discoveries and so on,

234
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,973
which will help poor countries.
I think countries that have very large 

235
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,663
aid and flows into the domestic economy 
that tends to undermine the sort of 

236
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,490
responsible government,
um,

237
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,370
that you need in order for development 
to have any chance of taking place.

238
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,473
I think that sort of aid,
I think a bill here is my example of 

239
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,880
exactly the sort of aid that really 
works,

240
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,003
um,
which is we can spend money in the 

241
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:01,684
United States and Sweden and so on to 
get the sort of discoveries that save 

242
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:08,770
millions of lives or save Fifo for being
brought blind.

243
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,690
Um,
that's a sort of aid.

244
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:14,410
So I'm not a blanket against aid,
but if we can help spend money,

245
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:15,244
I mean,
Merck made that drug available through 

246
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:19,720
the World Bank that too many people 
around the world.

247
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,590
And you know that that's a huge gift 
from rich countries to poor countries,

248
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,963
don't you rulers in Africa because you 
can't trust them for what they'll do 

249
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:29,490
with it.

250
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,110
Or we're creating dodgy rulers by,
you know,

251
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:32,944
basically saying,
you don't have to raise anything from 

252
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,500
your own population.
We'll keep you in business by giving you

253
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,940
a norms of sums of money.
So,

254
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,833
you know,
we're making the dodgy rulers even 

255
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,450
dodgier and that's the one of the 
central problem.

256
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,600
He's opened up a whole can of worms 
there.

257
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,960
I know you like worms.
We're going to come to that later.

258
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,950
Now,

259
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,460
Viet China,
alex serve it.

260
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,550
We come to you,
you,

261
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,910
I'm off from Belarus C or better 
Russian.

262
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:04,780
And you won the Literature Prize for,
uh,

263
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,980
your whole body of work that you've 
written over many,

264
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:09,814
many decades giving voice to the 
voiceless you've wished and things like 

265
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:13,744
voices of Chernobyl about the gasoline 
nuclear accident in 1986 of you brisson 

266
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:20,414
and Zinky boys about this Soviet Afghan 
war when though we're young Russian 

267
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:27,310
soldiers coming back in zinc coffins,
hint,

268
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,340
hence Zinky boys talked about,
um,

269
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,960
women's suffering and in the Second 
World War.

270
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,873
And,
and that has led to a genre that you 

271
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:36,484
describe as a documentary novel.
And the citation said that you have the 

272
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:44,950
soul of a historian and in many ways you
write,

273
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,420
um,
your,

274
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,450
your work.
So based on the testimony of,

275
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,860
of,
of real people.

276
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,890
So that's just by way of background of,
of your,

277
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,753
your work.
But let's see what the question is for 

278
00:15:57,911 --> 00:15:59,290
you.
And I think that,

279
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,310
um,
Diana,

280
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,150
you have a question diner.
Yeah.

281
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,023
If Vietnam.

282
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,253
Uh,
so do you believe your message gets out 

283
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:07,824
there in a better way by using a 
journalistic methods rather than a 

284
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:11,484
fictional ones?
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

285
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,553
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

286
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,743
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

287
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,323
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

288
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,293
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

289
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,093
[inaudible] [inaudible] proportion the 
story to [inaudible] [inaudible] 

290
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,543
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

291
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,703
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

292
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,853
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

293
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,983
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

294
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:50,010
[inaudible] [inaudible] cock coach,
totem priests who did them.

295
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,290
But you have also like a journalist's,
been a very political and very outspoken

296
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:03,730
in your criticisms,
both of President Lukashenko of a better

297
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,583
Belarus and a your half Ukrainian.
So you've also been very critical of 

298
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:12,690
President Putin and his actions in 
Ukraine,

299
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,760
particularly over crime mirror and so 
on.

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So I think a lot of people are very 
interested in what you have to say about

301
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:25,911
the current political situation that is 
going on in the former Soviet Union.

302
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:27,774
And I wonder if you would just briefly 
give us an idea of how you see things 

303
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:34,680
evolving in that part of the world.

304
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Was it the chiller Roscoe call tootie.

chance?

320
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:54,431
Could have seen me at create a really 
study [inaudible] is this,

321
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,510
we meet them.
We'll see.

322
00:19:58,511 --> 00:19:59,150
Bearish.

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,073
thank you.
We have another question for his fee at 

333
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,750
Leonard from Jamie.

334
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,893
Right now,
the work is a face with a huge 

335
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,160
challenges.
Sasha

336
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,543
claim change ongoing conflicts on the 
waves of refugees who are fleeing the 

337
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,180
countries.
With this in mind,

338
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,030
what makes you optimistic about the 
future of mankind?

339
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,853
Humanity.

340
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,600
So Soviet zone,
Alec Soviets.

341
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,434
That's a question for you briefly if 
you'd be so kind as to answer that 

342
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:12,514
question because I have to say you have 
been described as a writer of 

343
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:16,540
catastrophes.

344
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,333

00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:59,344
stuff that she's now is through 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

350
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,653
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

351
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,290
[inaudible] [inaudible]

352
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,030
thank you very much indeed.
Uh,

353
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,500
Svetlana.
Thank you.

354
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,760
So,
um,

355
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,593
I think now we moved to a specific 
question for the professor William 

356
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,243
Campbell,
one of the three medicine and 

357
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,150
physiology,
a laureate,

358
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,400
but to your two colleagues are not with 
us,

359
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,234
you,
you two from China who was awarded the 

360
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:35,660
prize for discovering a very effective 
malaria treatment,

361
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,990
artemisinin derived from natural plants.
And interestingly enough,

362
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:42,650
she actually went and referred to a 
Chinese book on h on medicine,

363
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:45,320
Chinese medicine,
which is 1,700

364
00:22:45,321 --> 00:22:46,310
years old.
Um,

365
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,413
but you were also awarded the prize 
Professor Campbell with professor a 

366
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,470
murderer from Japan.
Um,

367
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,353
and he sent you some soil when he sent 
the institute that you're working at 

368
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,750
some soil samples.
And from that do you manage to derive,

369
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,710
um,
treatment for terrible tropical diseases

370
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:08,510
elephantiasis where the limbs really 
swell and river blindness,

371
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:13,511
which is a terrible affliction that um,
ha has ruined lives millions of lives.

372
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,130
So that's what you won the prize for.
But let's hear what the question is from

373
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,590
Jeremy.
Jeremy Falls Forsberg.

374
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,663
Jeremy.
Thank you

375
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,013
professor Campo.
Where do you think that the next 

376
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:29,180
generation of antibiotics will come 
from?

377
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,140
Are they coming primarily from the 
nature itself?

378
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,633
Yes,
I think they are most likely to come 

379
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:38,774
from nature.
And I think we have a approach this 

380
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,353
evenly in the past.
We sometimes get caught up with very 

381
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:54,131
sophisticated modern technology and its 
possibilities of finding new drugs.

382
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,143
It's odd and reassuring to me that all 
three of us involved in this particular 

383
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,930
prize,
um,

384
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,540
worked with plants,
um,

385
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,603
or products of nature.
And I recently made a proposal Arcane 

386
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,250
back to what I've been making for over 
40 years.

387
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,563
But my proposal now is to have a much 
greater scouring of the world for novel 

388
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,480
microorganisms or animals or plants that
may provide the next leads.

389
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,700
And there are talents out there that I 
think could it be brought to bear.

390
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,320
Um,
you know,

391
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:40,154
if,
if countries can put men outside of the 

392
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:45,530
earth and bring them back to Earth,
uh,

393
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:48,920
one would think they could solve some of
these problems.

394
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,863
But when you were working on,
try on what led to Ivermectin and you 

395
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:54,874
talked about how you went to Togo in 
Africa when it was really uplifting for 

396
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:02,620
you to see the children being treated 
from this terrible illness,

397
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:04,930
which their parents and grandparents,
you know,

398
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:07,180
literally rendered blind.
Uh,

399
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:10,630
was that a motivating factor for you,
this sort of compassion?

400
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:11,810
Was that part of the,
uh,

401
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,450
the motivation for they get beard was 
inspirational to me.

402
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:19,200
It was uplifting for me.
It was a fabulous thing for me,

403
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:25,190
but most researchers,
even in medical fields and setting aside

404
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,223
certain idealistic physicians,
but most researchers and medical field 

405
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,363
are interested in the research and they 
are interested in doing research that 

406
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:36,654
might turn out to be good,
but there is their motivation is 

407
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:42,900
basically the curiosity,
the scientific challenge.

408
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,243
Um,
certainly was saw that it'd be great if 

409
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:50,030
this was useful,
but uh,

410
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,350
which is not done for reasons of 
compassion.

411
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,840
And I think that's a frequent 
misunderstanding.

412
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,080
But also by way of perspective,
let me say this,

413
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,100
that's when I was employed by the Merck 
pharmaceutical company many years ago.

414
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,053
I was employed specifically and solely 
to try and find a new drug for 

415
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:09,180
schistosomiasis,
a tropical disease,

416
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,133
sometimes called snail fever.
And that spelled hot sandwich build 

417
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,230
hardship.

418
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,290
I bill her ties.
It was,

419
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,900
and I worked on that,
solely focused on that for seven years I

420
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:23,901
had an unblemished record of failure and
I had a wonderful time doing it.

421
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,123
I was not the slightest bit discouraged.
I intended to spend with the rest of my 

422
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:32,100
life doing it.
But I got into a lot of other things.

423
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:36,210
And that project was carried on by other
people in my department for many,

424
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:39,180
many years.
I was never asked you to stop doing it.

425
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,280
I never ceased to be funded for doing 
it.

426
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,070
And I think there are lots of discussion
we should have about

427
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,890
that.
Anybody pick up a,

428
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:51,891
although despite this breakthrough of 
treating these terrible diseases,

429
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,040
compassion was not necessarily the 
motivating factor.

430
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,330
Yeah.
Professor [inaudible]

431
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,960
we work on cancer research so people 
also call the time,

432
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,310
are you finding any new drugs for 
counselors are trained,

433
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,900
can we cure cancer?
And uh,

434
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,950
I hope that will be an important 
consequence of what we are doing.

435
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:11,784
But as I see it,
it's still the side effect of what we 

436
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:15,024
are doing.
What we are really trying to do is 

437
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:19,980
understand the world we are living in 
how cells function.

438
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,740
Once we know that we can develop new 
drugs and all kinds of other nights

439
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,940
I have follow up.
Yeah.

440
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,390
I have not been this jealous of Nobel 
prize in medicine my entire life.

441
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,223
I rarely buy why an I heard it.
I said this is the way to give no value 

442
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,153
for somebody.

443
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,233
Yeah.

444
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,153
I had a lab meeting that morning and we 
usually discuss our experiments and I 

445
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:04,471
just didn't discuss the experiment.
I discussed Nobel and Madison and I this

446
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,520
cost heroes and these guys are my,

447
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:08,521
yeah,
absolutely.

448
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,320
What they did.
I can I say their professors,

449
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,163
San Joe,
somebody who's an expert in DNA and 

450
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:13,554
maybe jeans and that kind of thing.
You might try and isolate the mvg and 

451
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:21,531
use yourself and then a forward tree 
twice about everybody now.

452
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,033
So well that I just didn't see the,
the chemists Nobel laureates have come 

453
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,380
in here.
Chemistry Nobel.

454
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:28,681
No,
it's,

455
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:32,240
let's go to our specific question on 
your,

456
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:37,070
your work on repairing damaged DNA.
Emma Erickson,

457
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,430
you have a question.

458
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,500
Do you think that the future is strategy
of the,

459
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,733
um,
curing cancer will be to repair the 

460
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:51,320
reparation systems of DNA or,
uh,

461
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,100
will the changes in behavior be more 
important?

462
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,600
So should people change their behavior?
Poor,

463
00:28:58,601 --> 00:28:59,590
moderate,
moderate,

464
00:28:59,591 --> 00:28:59,920
yeah.

465
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,540
Certain behaviors are directly caused 
cancer.

466
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,600
Smoking as one,
um,

467
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,460
alcohol?
Well that I'm not going to that

468
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,290
my personal,
my personal kalea man who enjoys a tip.

469
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:16,320
Hello?
I drink out.

470
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,050
[inaudible] my personal belief is that 
the alcohol,

471
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,610
alcohol itself is not known to the a 
carcinogen,

472
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:24,910
but one of its metabolic products is,
and,

473
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,540
and I think it's quite clear that 
certain,

474
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,860
it's probable in my view that certain 
food products may have a cancer causing,

475
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,660
could you say some food products because
they're happy not to have headlines.

476
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:44,680
I mean there have been any of them been 
addressed in there,

477
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,623
popular media and,
and I think the evidence is incomplete 

478
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,333
and uh,
but I think the evidence will be 

479
00:29:51,901 --> 00:29:54,030
forthcoming and,
and this,

480
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,613
I think we'll probably go a long way to 
reducing or potentially reducing the 

481
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,650
incidence of cancer in the human 
population.

482
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,763
Oh,
so you think the evidence will come 

483
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:07,270
because we have about the British 
breakfast,

484
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:08,420
the English breakfast.
Right.

485
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,893
You know,
15 years ago it was debatable whether 

486
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:14,200
smokers,
you'll say 50 years ago

487
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,860
it's debatable whether I,
oh,

488
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,220
cigarettes cause cancer and,
and it's quite clear.

489
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,160
No,
I mean it's completely unequivocal and

490
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,550
yeah,
not alcohol though.

491
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:26,260
Sometimes you eat cured,
processed meats are cooked.

492
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,630
You too.
Well,

493
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,650
if he's good enough for you,
professor moderate.

494
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,603
Well,
yeah,

495
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:34,643
it was,
I say not as I did a professor has he 

496
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:38,574
Sandra,
cause your particular work focused very 

497
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,464
much on um,
some exposure to sun and Uva damage 

498
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,753
ultra violet down yet he was still,
some babies don't mean that spine off 

499
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,873
there are

500
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,293
vigorous.
I'm like k itself and why men being a 

501
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:57,660
carcinogen,
there is no doubt that uh,

502
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,730
uh,
sun exposure ultraviolet cause just came

503
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:03,950
cancer and uh,
yeah,

504
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,660
um,
uh,

505
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,200
people do some bait and uh,
um,

506
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,060
how you change people's behavior.
I don't know how to do it.

507
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,130
We'll move onto our physics.
Uh,

508
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,203
Laurie,
it's now to cocky Kavita and author 

509
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,683
Mcdonald's because you won your prize 
for neutrinos telling us that neutrinos 

510
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:27,980
which are this subatomic particle which 
is ubiquitous in our universe,

511
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,640
used to be thought that it had no mass.
You've discovered that it does have some

512
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:36,990
mass and I understand that there are 
billions of these things passing through

513
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:39,720
our body and so on and so forth.
And um,

514
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,130
in some way it will help us understand 
how the universe works better.

515
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:47,250
But anyway,
that's a very brief summary of your,

516
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,080
um,
what you won the prize for.

517
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:52,770
But let's get our question from 
Elizabeth Elisabet.

518
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,760
Lily blood your question please,
to the physics laureates.

519
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,850
Do you think that mankind will benefit 
in the future from researchers in fields

520
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:04,204
beyond applied physics such as Astro 
particle physics in more ways than by 

521
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,780
increasing our general knowledge of the 
universe?

522
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,980
Hmm.
Professor Macdonald,

523
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,613
the greater degree to which you can 
understand the details of the laws of 

524
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:22,030
physics to better you are to apply such 
thing.

525
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,483
I'll give you an example,
even from the such esoteric and 

526
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:30,000
difficult to detect particles as 
neutrinos,

527
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,630
neutrinos are outside the general 
experience of,

528
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:34,650
uh,
of humans.

529
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:35,484
Maybe once in your lifetime and the 
trainer will stop in your body and 

530
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:41,270
change one at home and do something else
and you won't even notice it.

531
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,760
But that's really the only influence 
that you have.

532
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,594
And,
and yet there are something like 6 

533
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,290
billion neutrinos going through your 
fingernail per second from the sun.

534
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,513
Well,
we use those neutrinos from the sun to 

535
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:55,094
understand the uh,
fusion processes that are taking place 

536
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:02,150
that power the sun with great accuracy.
In fact,

537
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:02,984
the puzzle that we solved a,
that neutrinos do change from one type 

538
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:09,920
to another,
which implies they have mass.

539
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,043
I was able to sort out what could have 
been a problem with the calculations of 

540
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:16,694
how many neutrinos are produced and 
therefore the understanding of the 

541
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:21,320
basic,
uh,

542
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:26,090
fusion power of the sun confined by 
gravity.

543
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,410
It's now been determined that these 
calculations are accurate,

544
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:34,640
too much better than 10%.
Those are the same types of calculations

545
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:35,474
that are being applied and to try to 
harness fusion power here on earth 

546
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:39,674
confined by magnetic fields.
And so it's a prime example of how 

547
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:46,040
knowing the pure physics as accurately 
as you can,

548
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,113
enables you then to apply those laws of 
physics and trying to move forward with 

549
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,494
applied physics.

550
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,340
Hmm.
Professor Casita.

551
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,213
I mean it's interesting that Professor 
Arch Mcdonald there talks about how I 

552
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:59,820
think it's one of the three types of 
neutrinos is,

553
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,790
is from the sun.
And mentioning this idea,

554
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,030
a few nuclear fusion is what I want you 
to ask you about because it often people

555
00:34:07,031 --> 00:34:11,080
are looking at that now as a source of 
energy for us.

556
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,300
I mean that's,
it is this,

557
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,193
is this something which your discovery 
that neutrinos have mass could perhaps 

558
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:23,260
help us harness nuclear fusion from,
from the sun better?

559
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,050
Let me mention the application of pure 
physics into the,

560
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,280
the uh,
applied science wanting another example.

561
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:34,620
Not neutrino physics.
Okay,

562
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:42,070
well this a year is the a 100 years of 
general later activity.

563
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:49,290
People thought this is really a pure 
science,

564
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,020
no application to daily life.
However,

565
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,123
after wine 100 years,
we cannot leave without the knowledge 

566
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:01,744
of,
to narrow their activity because gps is 

567
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,870
based on Tim,
you know,

568
00:35:08,871 --> 00:35:10,620
later activity.
No,

569
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,753
we use GPS.
But if we have no idea but [inaudible] 

570
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,780
activity,
the GPS doesn't work.

571
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,410
So didn't know Lira tvt which was 
thought to be pure theoretical,

572
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,980
pure basic science.
Is it two hours a day?

573
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:37,450
He died after 100 yet?
So maybe new t knows.

574
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,180
Could it also be great fun?

575
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,593
You know,
I'm just going to bring in a grantee 

576
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,483
Nordstrom,
I think you've got a question which is 

577
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:47,780
very related to the answer you've just 
already given.

578
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,030
Professor Guy Cogito.

579
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,463
Um,
I'm wondering if you think that focus 

580
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,900
off academia should be on fundamental 
research,

581
00:35:55,901 --> 00:35:56,734
so to find out how the world really 
works or if we should focus more on 

582
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:04,770
application and product development.
Who'd like to pick pick up on that?

583
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:07,880
And then professor calculators already 
kind of addressed that.

584
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,850
Yeah,
I've done that too.

585
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,020
I think history is clearly shown us time
after time.

586
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:18,021
The of the power of knowledge and 
knowledge comes from basic science or,

587
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,040
or,

588
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,873
okay.

589
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,300
Basic research and other fields and,
and uh,

590
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,783
I mean it's hard to develop new things 
if you do not understand how the world 

591
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:31,704
works.
And that's really the goal of basic 

592
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,080
science and I think that's,
it's an intrinsic value.

593
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:37,914
I would argue that every major metro 
modern medical advance is directly tied 

594
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,500
to advances in basic science.
Hmm.

595
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,190
Yes,
we Atlanta Elixir richer.

596
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,033
I want you to ask you,
because obviously you're not a 

597
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:49,604
scientists,
but your writing is very much based on 

598
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,523
knowledge.
And research which you get from the 

599
00:36:55,421 --> 00:37:00,421
people you talk to,
who bear witness to the upheavals in the

600
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:04,110
events that you have drawn on for your 
writing.

601
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:05,410
So,
um,

602
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,770
really is picking up the professor.
Modric she's point that,

603
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:09,604
um,
you need to anchor what you do on 

604
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:16,570
research in your case.
Talking to people.

605
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,993

616
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,890
[inaudible] [inaudible] probably will 
give us thank you professor eating.

617
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,743
You won't just give me,
I just wanted to come back a little bit 

618
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:32,560
to compassion and curiosity and you 
know,

619
00:38:32,561 --> 00:38:34,840
fun.
So I,

620
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,190
we all do this.

621
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,980
I mean,
everything I've heard about,

622
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,480
you know,
when you're actually doing the work,

623
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,230
you're motivated by curiosity,
by trying to resolve puzzles,

624
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,123
by trying to resolve paradoxes and saw.
I also remember as he is at a previous 

625
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:50,254
meeting saying that one of the greatest 
moments in his life is when he's in the 

626
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,103
laboratory and he sees something and he 
thinks only God and I for the moment 

627
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,610
understand those processes.
And I,

628
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,680
I mean in my way I can think of things 
like that too.

629
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:09,940
There's a moment when I suddenly 
understand something and everything fits

630
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:13,390
into place and you know,
I just know a whole bunch,

631
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,470
you know those lights suddenly where 
there was darkness and missed before and

632
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:21,250
that's a wonderful feeling.
But so we don't do it for compassion.

633
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,730
We do it for that feeling,
that Aha moment,

634
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:26,980
that discovery.
But you know,

635
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:30,970
it's all within a social context in 
which that are funding agencies.

636
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:31,804
I there their society who's deciding 
which fields are really important to 

637
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:36,034
work on.
There's people responding and economics 

638
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,310
whenever those like,
you know,

639
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,183
in the Great Depression.
That was what caused some of the 

640
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:43,114
greatest future Nobel laureates and 
other people to move into economics 

641
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,330
because they wanted to help people.
So it was the compassion,

642
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,840
the drove people into economics.
It's funding agencies,

643
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:54,280
it's poverty.
In the world.

644
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,300
And for me it's always been,
that's for me it's been very direct,

645
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,590
lovely makeup client.
Uh,

646
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,740
I uh,
as a scientist I usually think that what

647
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,603
I say no,
and I'll start scientists pay any 

648
00:40:09,391 --> 00:40:14,391
attention to and I'm really gratified 
and very happy that Dr Dayton,

649
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,850
uh,
as coach me twice.

650
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,533
Absolutely.
But I should say that actually 

651
00:40:22,011 --> 00:40:24,440
interesting enough,
you as eastern jar or an MD,

652
00:40:24,441 --> 00:40:25,274
a medical doctor as you are to um,
Thomas Lindahl but you only lasted one 

653
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:30,860
year.
It was a doctor and you only two years.

654
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,980
It's a shelter.
Yes.

655
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:36,010
So you didn't have the compassion gene 
to carry on health.

656
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,420
Professor Lindo weekly

657
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:44,190
like to go back to sweat Lana's comment 
that we are in the privilege society,

658
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:45,604
we can pursue our ideas without being 
regarded with suspicion by the 

659
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,484
government.
I'm old enough to have had called digs 

660
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,520
and down some somber kin,
eastern Germany,

661
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,433
uh,
a bit over 35 years ago and it was 

662
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,580
Soviet stepped the local scientist,
they immediately became my friends too.

663
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:08,044
I never met them before because we had 
the common enemy and there were people 

664
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:12,514
in gray suits who are sitting in the 
room trying to figure out if we were 

665
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:16,174
doing something subversive in their mind
scientist for the same thing as 

666
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,270
terrorists.
And uh,

667
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,640
that was an uneasy feeling.
Yeah.

668
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,533
And uh,
I think that has largely disappeared 

669
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:27,844
now.

670
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,160
Okay.
So we've got some,

671
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:33,940
a couple of questions now if I can go to
Anneli Borg first and then Rabiah Aau.

672
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,300
But if you could both give us,
um,

673
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,090
your point,
Anna Lee.

674
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,493
Yes.
So my question is whether you would 

675
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:46,631
encourage young person or a student to 
become a scientist in your own field.

676
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,270
Okay,
thank you.

677
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:51,230
Ruppia.
You,

678
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,880
what skills do you think for most 
important on your way to success?

679
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,010
Okay,
thank you.

680
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:57,843
Um,
who would like to pick up on Annalee 

681
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,373
Borg?
Would you encourage a young person or 

682
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:03,760
student to become a scientist in your 
field?

683
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,470
Professing the,
I have to say it.

684
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,050
Let me ask you because I know that you 
had a teacher,

685
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:13,790
a chemistry teacher who you didn't 
really get on with and who failed you in

686
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:15,200
fact,
and yet here you are.

687
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,370
I can't mistreat laureate.
How about that?

688
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,204
Huh?

689
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,073
Clean stuff.
There are some teachers that are very 

690
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:27,781
bad teacher.
You should be stubborn in science.

691
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,980
Uh,
you shouldn't be easily discouraged.

692
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:40,180
Uh,
occasionally you meet scientists to have

693
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:44,380
some idea that's obviously wrong and 
they just spend years and years pursuing

694
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:47,250
that idea.
But that's exception of the,

695
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:51,220
I think it's much more common that 
scientists give up too easily.

696
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,153
I,
you have an unusual observation and 

697
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:57,260
nature's telling you something here.
You are privileged,

698
00:42:57,261 --> 00:42:58,094
you have new information and that you 
shouldn't just put it in a drawer 

699
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:02,590
because you don't understand it.

700
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,350
Professor Dayton,
you actually didn't start off.

701
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:06,910
They wanted to become an economist.
Did you?

702
00:43:06,911 --> 00:43:09,460
You actually went into university to 
study mathematics

703
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,020
and then gave up on it already gave up 
on me.

704
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,710
Huh?
I would say one thing though,

705
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:17,330
and some of you are not going to like 
this,

706
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:18,164
but you know,
the mathematics I learned early on has 

707
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:24,230
been incredibly useful to me even though
I'm not a mathematician.

708
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,453
And there's a very wide range of 
sciences and economics and other things 

709
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,050
where mathematics is really important.
So,

710
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,270
you know,
push yourself as far as who cam,

711
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:36,920
um,
in that direction.

712
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,213
Um,
there's obviously areas where it's more 

713
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:40,574
important than others,
but it's often extremely important and 

714
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:45,380
it helps you think very clearly.
Um,

715
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:46,303
as part of it,

716
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,640
we're all talk about how this or that 
teacher made a big difference now lives,

717
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,680
um,
because they're not paid well,

718
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,710
they're not respected in society are our
best minds do not go into teaching.

719
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,570
And I just hope that through this 
medium,

720
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:05,743
uh,
both young scientist I young people and 

721
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:11,740
their parents encourage their children,
the capable,

722
00:44:11,741 --> 00:44:14,140
intelligent children to become teachers.

723
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,280
[inaudible].
And one

724
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,710
thing I'd like to say in and use you as 
an example,

725
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:25,544
perhaps professor Bill Campbell,
is that don't be scared of the 

726
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:29,534
contradictions perhaps within you,
because I know that you have a huge 

727
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:39,201
love,
admiration and respect for parasites and

728
00:44:40,231 --> 00:44:42,540
worms.
And yet ironically,

729
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:46,170
you've spent your life researching how 
to kill them,

730
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:47,400
right?
So there's this,

731
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,630
I'm bivalence here,
but I know in your spec on you'd like to

732
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:53,670
paint them,
you paint worms.

733
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:58,200
And when you met President Barack Obama,
he gave you a stuffed animal in the form

734
00:44:58,201 --> 00:44:59,220
of a word,
right?

735
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,250
Pride of place in your home.
Um,

736
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,280
and you also write poems about worms.
So I'm hoping that you might be able to,

737
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:12,450
uh,
give us a rendition

738
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:14,803
and my poems,
I sometimes like to speak on behalf of 

739
00:45:18,231 --> 00:45:21,640
the worms and gives them a chance to say
something.

740
00:45:21,641 --> 00:45:24,650
And then I do happen to have one in 
particular,

741
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,480
the case for a worm that causes river 
blindness.

742
00:45:29,481 --> 00:45:30,360
In fact,
um,

743
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:31,993
I can imagine it being very frustrated 
and getting more and more angry as 

744
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:38,980
people accuse it of causing blindness 
when blind.

745
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:43,981
This in fact is a chance of shoot of 
their infection there.

746
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,373
The causative agent does migrating 
through the skin all over the body and 

747
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:50,960
some of them are going to end up in the 
eye.

748
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:52,040
And those humans,
of course,

749
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,630
we were very,
very unhappy about it.

750
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,583
But I imagine I'm one of those where I'm
saying this and you have to remember 

751
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:02,340
that I think they're pretty frustrated.
I don't need your goddamned,

752
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,410
I,
all I need is a piece of skin big enough

753
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:07,244
to let me drop a few larvae in just 
enough to make sure that they will be a 

754
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:15,710
pickup and delivery.
Don't look at me that way.
