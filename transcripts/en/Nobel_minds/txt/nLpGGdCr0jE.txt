Speaker 1:          00:07          Hello, I'm Zina puddle. Welcome to the concert hall in Stockholm where the Nobel prize winners received their awards from the king of Sweden for their outstanding contributions to science, literature and Economics. This is the first time that this year's laureates or repairing together on television and they've been joined by their family and friends who've traveled to Stockholm to share in the celebrations. And we are also joined by students from here in Sweden who are going to be putting their questions to our laureates on this year's Nobel mine. So we have discoveries on repairing damaged DNA, which increase our knowledge of the universe, cure tropical diseases. And in economics we throw light on the links between poverty consumption and welfare. And the literature prize gives voice to the voiceless in authoritarians societies. Laureates, congratulations to you all.

Speaker 2:          01:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:39          wonderful. Let's go straight away to our first question from our audience here. And it is Martin. Martin please. Your first question to our laureates.

Speaker 3:          01:48          So there are a lot of the prices and competitions in all of your fields and I just wanted to have your opinion, do you think it is a good addition to motivate people to get engaged or do you think it inspires unnecessary competition?

Speaker 4:          02:05          So well I kind of miss or never competitive. We have something called perfect competition which economists believe in. Um, I'm not sure the Nobel does much of that. I've been very impressed by how much positive um, just general happiness and wellbeing it seems to generate. Um, it's clear though over the years in the past there certainly is some resentment on behalf of people who don't win. I've never felt that personally. But you hear discussions stairs when you pass by. I have not experienced any of that. I'd been very fortunate that way. But I do think in the past people have felt that a whole area, you know, that should have been recognized, never was recognized,

Speaker 5:          03:00          for instance. And I'm sure, and that's a more legitimate feeling them. I'm sure there's some people who feel that they should have been writing guys. They're more not,

Speaker 1:          03:08          you are a professor date. And in saying that, but I'm sure you deserved your price, but let me just see what, uh, anybody else poor madre to professor moderate. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          03:16          Well I think it's useful and bringing visibility to science fields. Um, I uh, agree with Angus. I think that there have been instances where people have felt certainly in my field that the certain areas that were worthy of a prize were neglected. And, and uh, so there is a value judgment I think in, in, in selection of the fields.

Speaker 3:          03:44          Professor Campbell, I think a, it does not create competition among sign, just don't compete for that. And secondly, I think it's inevitable and it also adds a nice little bit of, um, something special, uh, the time just kinda enjoy. So I think it's sort of inspirational and not confrontational and certainly not inducing and not the juice of, of competition. And the chemistry failed our way. Been very fortunate and that the three winners worked on different mechanisms of DNA repair and we had no competition. So we've been fortunate to have it that way. And so in this particular case, there was no competition.

Speaker 1:          04:28          It rounded off the chemist there. Professor Thomas Lindahl okay.

Speaker 5:          04:33          Yes. I think a healthy competition is a good thing. Yeah. Uh, it's uh, excellent different scientist goes a little bit of a stray with his idea, send that sample Dale's correct them and uh, I think it would be too comfortable if there was no competition at all. Huh.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Okay. So you met us on Alec Serve, which obviously you are the literature laureate, I should say. Actually, of course, everybody that a spirit line, Alex overage is speaking in Russian. Um, and I know the question was specifically about science, but in terms of receiving the Nobel prize, as Professor Deaton said, it's a very, it's a real accolade. I mean, do you feel that it's going to help you in some way, do what you do better?

Speaker 3:          05:19          Uh Huh.

Speaker 7:          05:20          Yeah. Just cause [inaudible] [inaudible] no. [inaudible] [inaudible] no, they deal with sweat. Delish murals. Trixie [inaudible] premiums in a love with the deal

Speaker 3:          05:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:49          the physicist professor aren't Mcdonald's and then, oh, you want to go first? Professor Cogito. Yes.

Speaker 3:          05:54          Okay. Whoa. We both wanted to understand what is [inaudible] properties of neutrinos and we have the same gold and coming from different experiments and we are very much

Speaker 1:          06:12          complimentary rather than competitive complimentary rather than competition. So I'm getting the sense of that to Martin, your question about it. Um, perhaps encouraging competition is, uh, not getting much traction here, aren't Macdonald. Yep.

Speaker 8:          06:26          I think the scientists are primarily motivated by the science. They're attempting to understand our universe more completely. I think they're quite satisfied when they recognize themselves that they have made a breakthrough and have understood things more completely. I think when there is the recognition like this by such a respected body as the, uh, people who define the Nobel prize, it's something that is highly respected in the community. It adds to the joy of having made a significant discovery.

Speaker 1:          07:01          So nobody really, does anybody resonate briefly on what professor Deaton said about some sad damage, tormented souls going around saying, Oh, I should have won the Nobel. I could have won the Nobel. It's not fair. Has anybody come across any of such individuals?

Speaker 9:          07:16          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          07:17          I have a comment when you mom more then why I should that none. Uh, Juan didn't know about when you see a major breakthrough in your field.

Speaker 9:          07:29          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          07:30          I personally feel very bad. I should admit that discover not that I'm doing right now. There is something called Crispr is very hot in our field and I wish I would bet that just color myself, I would give anything for it. So, um, it's, it's not competition per se, but it is a US scientists and individuals drive to, to discover an important thing. Thank you for your honesty professor Joe.

Speaker 1:          08:06          All right. So now we were moving to a specific question, which is for you, Professor Angus Deaton, your of course economics laureates, and you won your prize for really, I'm shedding a great deal of light on the links between poverty consumption and welfare and what implications there are for policy makers, um, particularly in setting levels of taxation from instance. But let's see what comes up from our students. Andrea with

Speaker 8:          08:30          hi, I have a short question. Is Fighting inequality a realistic aim?

Speaker 9:          08:38          MMM hmm.

Speaker 3:          08:42          It's maybe a short question though. I'm not sure if short answer, I mean here I think is the essence of the matter, which has, we have tools to fight inequality. You know, you could have in United States are much more

Speaker 4:          08:56          progressive tax system presidents. You know, we could spend more money on education unless I'm on the fence. I've heard as he's talked about that. Um, and there's lots of things you could do. Um, so the question is not having the tools. So it's realistic in the sense that we have the tools, right? It's unrealistic in the sense that the politics is extraordinarily difficult. So you know, the people who have all the money, all it's got to have a lot of political power and they're not very interested in fighting inequality. And so what do you do if you think there's too much in equality or inequality is reached dangerous levels, which I do. Then I think the best thing to do is, is you have to participate in the democratic process and persuade other people that it's a problem. For instance, by being on a TV show like that.

Speaker 1:          09:45          So it is can be done, you see? But it's a lack of political will. The tools are the, you mentioned taxation sort of in passing, but just briefly outline for us then, what are the tools that can be used to reduce inequality?

Speaker 4:          09:58          Well, this, a lot of tax tools. I mean, one of them for instances like an inheritance tax for example. But many of us have always thought that, um, you know, fairly stiff inheritance taxes were a good thing because it helps, it stops you having this hereditary inequality. What Thomas picketty famously is called patrimonial capitalism,

Speaker 1:          10:18          please. The French economist has written a lot about inequality.

Speaker 4:          10:21          That's right. And I think many of us think it's good for each generation, each group of kids who are born each generation to have an equal chance, not just depending on what their parents have and two ways of doing that. One is um, you know, um, and Harrison's taxes. Another is trying to equalize the opportunities at schools and there's a big concern in the United States now that um, you know, the best schools are going to the kids, um, off the well off people and it's very hard, much harder than it was in our generation for kids, for poor families to get into, to get a really first class education. And that's absolutely vital

Speaker 1:          11:02          professor as he said. Joe, would you mind mind bringing you in just on this particular point? Yeah, because I hope you don't mind saying that you were born in Turkey. That's right. One of eight children. Right. And your parents could not read or write, write, write and here you are a Nobel laureate, completely exemplifying what professor did

Speaker 3:          11:23          do. United State has 25% of total prisoner population and that has to do with quality. It has to do with lack of opportunity. And that is a problem. I think there was a recent article in New England Journal Medicine comparing the health care system and in Turkey and the United States, it's much better in Turkey, Turkey not have the resource, the United States. And here we, we pass the [inaudible] or Obama care, which is a universal healthcare system and we're still fighting it, a growth in the United States still fighting it. So, um, even though I come from a country where the resources and, and uh, and so on are not as it does as the United States, I think in, in a certain aspect, in terms of equal opportunity for education, education and Tokyo is free, you don't have that,

Speaker 1:          12:31          but it was just your, your own individual personal story illustrates that. If you're given that equality of opportunity, somebody of your,

Speaker 3:          12:40          of background can rise to top can do it. And I wish my adopted country would take the necessary steps to do that.

Speaker 1:          12:48          All right. Okay. Thank you. There was another question for you, professor Deaton and that's from David Gandolfi. David.

Speaker 3:          12:58          Uh, thank you professor [inaudible] for coming here and think 12 the Nobel laureates. My question is specifically you have expressed some criticism about foreign aid to poor countries. Now why is that?

Speaker 4:          13:11          Okay. Um, so let me start by saying that I'm not critical a tall of the wish to help people in poor countries, but I think a lot of what we're doing in terms of foreign aid right now is actually not helping a tall and there's lots of things we can do from the outside which will make the new innovations, the new discoveries and so on, which will help poor countries. I think countries that have very large aid and flows into the domestic economy that tends to undermine the sort of responsible government, um, that you need in order for development to have any chance of taking place. I think that sort of aid, I think a bill here is my example of exactly the sort of aid that really works, um, which is we can spend money in the United States and Sweden and so on to get the sort of discoveries that save millions of lives or save Fifo for being brought blind. Um, that's a sort of aid. So I'm not a blanket against aid, but if we can help spend money, I mean, Merck made that drug available through the World Bank that too many people around the world. And you know that that's a huge gift from rich countries to poor countries,

Speaker 1:          14:26          don't you rulers in Africa because you can't trust them for what they'll do with it.

Speaker 4:          14:29          Or we're creating dodgy rulers by, you know, basically saying, you don't have to raise anything from your own population. We'll keep you in business by giving you a norms of sums of money. So, you know, we're making the dodgy rulers even dodgier and that's the one of the central problem.

Speaker 1:          14:45          He's opened up a whole can of worms there. I know you like worms. We're going to come to that later.

Speaker 7:          14:53          Now,

Speaker 1:          14:53          Viet China, alex serve it. We come to you, you, I'm off from Belarus C or better Russian. And you won the Literature Prize for, uh, your whole body of work that you've written over many, many decades giving voice to the voiceless you've wished and things like voices of Chernobyl about the gasoline nuclear accident in 1986 of you brisson and Zinky boys about this Soviet Afghan war when though we're young Russian soldiers coming back in zinc coffins, hint, hence Zinky boys talked about, um, women's suffering and in the Second World War. And, and that has led to a genre that you describe as a documentary novel. And the citation said that you have the soul of a historian and in many ways you write, um, your, your work. So based on the testimony of, of, of real people. So that's just by way of background of, of your, your work. But let's see what the question is for you. And I think that, um, Diana, you have a question diner. Yeah. If Vietnam.

Speaker 7:          16:04          Uh, so do you believe your message gets out there in a better way by using a journalistic methods rather than a fictional ones? [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] proportion the story to [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] cock coach, totem priests who did them.

Speaker 1:          17:52          But you have also like a journalist's, been a very political and very outspoken in your criticisms, both of President Lukashenko of a better Belarus and a your half Ukrainian. So you've also been very critical of President Putin and his actions in Ukraine, particularly over crime mirror and so on. So I think a lot of people are very interested in what you have to say about the current political situation that is going on in the former Soviet Union. And I wonder if you would just briefly give us an idea of how you see things evolving in that part of the world.

Speaker 7:          18:36          Was it the chiller Roscoe call tootie. Tootie. Uh, per poet. [inaudible] Piatt at the class, each square forma pushkin that year. Now the support as Dallas.

Speaker 1:          20:38          thank you. We have another question for his fee at Leonard from Jamie.

Speaker 7:          20:42          Right now, the work is a face with a huge challenges. Sasha

Speaker 10:         20:48          claim change ongoing conflicts on the waves of refugees who are fleeing the countries. With this in mind, what makes you optimistic about the future of mankind? Humanity.

Speaker 1:          21:07          So Soviet zone, Alec Soviets. That's a question for you briefly if you'd be so kind as to answer that question because I have to say you have been described as a writer of catastrophes.

Speaker 7:          21:19          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] the Dudley diligently worksheet and it weakened the stuff that she's now is through [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          22:12          thank you very much indeed. Uh, Svetlana. Thank you. So, um, I think now we moved to a specific question for the professor William Campbell, one of the three medicine and physiology, a laureate, but to your two colleagues are not with us, you, you two from China who was awarded the prize for discovering a very effective malaria treatment, artemisinin derived from natural plants. And interestingly enough, she actually went and referred to a Chinese book on h on medicine, Chinese medicine, which is 1,700 years old. Um, but you were also awarded the prize Professor Campbell with professor a murderer from Japan. Um, and he sent you some soil when he sent the institute that you're working at some soil samples. And from that do you manage to derive, um, treatment for terrible tropical diseases elephantiasis where the limbs really swell and river blindness, which is a terrible affliction that um, ha has ruined lives millions of lives. So that's what you won the prize for. But let's hear what the question is from Jeremy. Jeremy Falls Forsberg. Jeremy. Thank you

Speaker 10:         23:23          professor Campo. Where do you think that the next generation of antibiotics will come from? Are they coming primarily from the nature itself? Yes, I think they are most likely to come from nature. And I think we have a approach this evenly in the past. We sometimes get caught up with very sophisticated modern technology and its possibilities of finding new drugs. It's odd and reassuring to me that all three of us involved in this particular prize, um, worked with plants, um, or products of nature. And I recently made a proposal Arcane back to what I've been making for over 40 years. But my proposal now is to have a much greater scouring of the world for novel microorganisms or animals or plants that may provide the next leads. And there are talents out there that I think could it be brought to bear. Um, you know, if, if countries can put men outside of the earth and bring them back to Earth, uh, one would think they could solve some of these problems.

Speaker 1:          24:49          But when you were working on, try on what led to Ivermectin and you talked about how you went to Togo in Africa when it was really uplifting for you to see the children being treated from this terrible illness, which their parents and grandparents, you know, literally rendered blind. Uh, was that a motivating factor for you, this sort of compassion? Was that part of the, uh,

Speaker 10:         25:12          the motivation for they get beard was inspirational to me. It was uplifting for me. It was a fabulous thing for me, but most researchers, even in medical fields and setting aside certain idealistic physicians, but most researchers and medical field are interested in the research and they are interested in doing research that might turn out to be good, but there is their motivation is basically the curiosity, the scientific challenge. Um, certainly was saw that it'd be great if this was useful, but uh, which is not done for reasons of compassion. And I think that's a frequent misunderstanding. But also by way of perspective, let me say this, that's when I was employed by the Merck pharmaceutical company many years ago. I was employed specifically and solely to try and find a new drug for schistosomiasis, a tropical disease, sometimes called snail fever. And that spelled hot sandwich build hardship.

Speaker 10:         26:13          I bill her ties. It was, and I worked on that, solely focused on that for seven years I had an unblemished record of failure and I had a wonderful time doing it. I was not the slightest bit discouraged. I intended to spend with the rest of my life doing it. But I got into a lot of other things. And that project was carried on by other people in my department for many, many years. I was never asked you to stop doing it. I never ceased to be funded for doing it. And I think there are lots of discussion we should have about

Speaker 1:          26:44          that. Anybody pick up a, although despite this breakthrough of treating these terrible diseases, compassion was not necessarily the motivating factor. Yeah. Professor [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          26:57          we work on cancer research so people also call the time, are you finding any new drugs for counselors are trained, can we cure cancer? And uh, I hope that will be an important consequence of what we are doing. But as I see it, it's still the side effect of what we are doing. What we are really trying to do is understand the world we are living in how cells function. Once we know that we can develop new drugs and all kinds of other nights

Speaker 3:          27:25          I have follow up. Yeah. I have not been this jealous of Nobel prize in medicine my entire life. I rarely buy why an I heard it. I said this is the way to give no value for somebody.

Speaker 2:          27:52          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          27:53          I had a lab meeting that morning and we usually discuss our experiments and I just didn't discuss the experiment. I discussed Nobel and Madison and I this cost heroes and these guys are my,

Speaker 1:          28:07          yeah, absolutely. What they did. I can I say their professors, San Joe, somebody who's an expert in DNA and maybe jeans and that kind of thing. You might try and isolate the mvg and use yourself and then a forward tree twice about everybody now. So well that I just didn't see the, the chemists Nobel laureates have come in here. Chemistry Nobel. No, it's, let's go to our specific question on your, your work on repairing damaged DNA. Emma Erickson, you have a question.

Speaker 11:         28:38          Do you think that the future is strategy of the, um, curing cancer will be to repair the reparation systems of DNA or, uh, will the changes in behavior be more important?

Speaker 1:          28:55          So should people change their behavior? Poor, moderate, moderate, yeah.

Speaker 6:          28:59          Certain behaviors are directly caused cancer. Smoking as one, um, alcohol? Well that I'm not going to that

Speaker 1:          29:11          my personal, my personal kalea man who enjoys a tip. Hello? I drink out.

Speaker 6:          29:16          [inaudible] my personal belief is that the alcohol, alcohol itself is not known to the a carcinogen, but one of its metabolic products is, and, and I think it's quite clear that certain, it's probable in my view that certain food products may have a cancer causing,

Speaker 1:          29:37          could you say some food products because they're happy not to have headlines. I mean there have been any of them been addressed in there,

Speaker 6:          29:44          popular media and, and I think the evidence is incomplete and uh, but I think the evidence will be forthcoming and, and this, I think we'll probably go a long way to reducing or potentially reducing the incidence of cancer in the human population.

Speaker 1:          30:01          Oh, so you think the evidence will come because we have about the British breakfast, the English breakfast. Right. You know, 15 years ago it was debatable whether smokers, you'll say 50 years ago

Speaker 6:          30:14          it's debatable whether I, oh, cigarettes cause cancer and, and it's quite clear. No, I mean it's completely unequivocal and

Speaker 1:          30:22          yeah, not alcohol though. Sometimes you eat cured, processed meats are cooked. You too. Well, if he's good enough for you, professor moderate. Well, yeah, it was, I say not as I did a professor has he Sandra, cause your particular work focused very much on um, some exposure to sun and Uva damage ultra violet down yet he was still, some babies don't mean that spine off there are

Speaker 3:          30:50          vigorous. I'm like k itself and why men being a carcinogen, there is no doubt that uh, uh, sun exposure ultraviolet cause just came cancer and uh, yeah, um, uh, people do some bait and uh, um, how you change people's behavior. I don't know how to do it.

Speaker 1:          31:12          We'll move onto our physics. Uh, Laurie, it's now to cocky Kavita and author Mcdonald's because you won your prize for neutrinos telling us that neutrinos which are this subatomic particle which is ubiquitous in our universe, used to be thought that it had no mass. You've discovered that it does have some mass and I understand that there are billions of these things passing through our body and so on and so forth. And um, in some way it will help us understand how the universe works better. But anyway, that's a very brief summary of your, um, what you won the prize for. But let's get our question from Elizabeth Elisabet. Lily blood your question please, to the physics laureates.

Speaker 12:         31:57          Do you think that mankind will benefit in the future from researchers in fields beyond applied physics such as Astro particle physics in more ways than by increasing our general knowledge of the universe? Hmm. Professor Macdonald,

Speaker 8:          32:15          the greater degree to which you can understand the details of the laws of physics to better you are to apply such thing. I'll give you an example, even from the such esoteric and difficult to detect particles as neutrinos, neutrinos are outside the general experience of, uh, of humans. Maybe once in your lifetime and the trainer will stop in your body and change one at home and do something else and you won't even notice it. But that's really the only influence that you have. And, and yet there are something like 6 billion neutrinos going through your fingernail per second from the sun. Well, we use those neutrinos from the sun to understand the uh, fusion processes that are taking place that power the sun with great accuracy. In fact, the puzzle that we solved a, that neutrinos do change from one type to another, which implies they have mass.

Speaker 8:          33:10          I was able to sort out what could have been a problem with the calculations of how many neutrinos are produced and therefore the understanding of the basic, uh, fusion power of the sun confined by gravity. It's now been determined that these calculations are accurate, too much better than 10%. Those are the same types of calculations that are being applied and to try to harness fusion power here on earth confined by magnetic fields. And so it's a prime example of how knowing the pure physics as accurately as you can, enables you then to apply those laws of physics and trying to move forward with applied physics.

Speaker 1:          33:51          Hmm. Professor Casita. I mean it's interesting that Professor Arch Mcdonald there talks about how I think it's one of the three types of neutrinos is, is from the sun. And mentioning this idea, a few nuclear fusion is what I want you to ask you about because it often people are looking at that now as a source of energy for us. I mean that's, it is this, is this something which your discovery that neutrinos have mass could perhaps help us harness nuclear fusion from, from the sun better?

Speaker 13:         34:24          Let me mention the application of pure physics into the, the uh, applied science wanting another example. Not neutrino physics. Okay, well this a year is the a 100 years of general later activity. People thought this is really a pure science, no application to daily life. However, after wine 100 years, we cannot leave without the knowledge of, to narrow their activity because gps is based on Tim, you know, later activity. No, we use GPS. But if we have no idea but [inaudible] activity, the GPS doesn't work. So didn't know Lira tvt which was thought to be pure theoretical, pure basic science. Is it two hours a day? He died after 100 yet? So maybe new t knows.

Speaker 7:          35:38          Could it also be great fun?

Speaker 1:          35:40          You know, I'm just going to bring in a grantee Nordstrom, I think you've got a question which is very related to the answer you've just already given. Professor Guy Cogito.

Speaker 7:          35:49          Um, I'm wondering if you think that focus off academia should be on fundamental research, so to find out how the world really works or if we should focus more on application and product development. Who'd like to pick pick up on that? And then professor calculators already kind of addressed that.

Speaker 6:          36:07          Yeah, I've done that too. I think history is clearly shown us time after time. The of the power of knowledge and knowledge comes from basic science or, or,

Speaker 2:          36:21          okay.

Speaker 6:          36:22          Basic research and other fields and, and uh, I mean it's hard to develop new things if you do not understand how the world works. And that's really the goal of basic science and I think that's, it's an intrinsic value. I would argue that every major metro modern medical advance is directly tied to advances in basic science. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          36:45          Yes, we Atlanta Elixir richer. I want you to ask you, because obviously you're not a scientists, but your writing is very much based on knowledge. And research which you get from the people you talk to, who bear witness to the upheavals in the events that you have drawn on for your writing. So, um, really is picking up the professor. Modric she's point that, um, you need to anchor what you do on research in your case. Talking to people.

Speaker 7:          37:20          Yeah. I just cause I [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] totally. Kaltura. Totally mean tiredness. Totally web [inaudible] twist a chiller vehicles. Chill. Avia. Yeah. You do. [inaudible] proud of [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] no. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] probably will give us thank you professor eating. You won't just give me, I just wanted to come back a little bit to compassion and curiosity and you know, fun. So I, we all do this.

Speaker 4:          38:36          I mean, everything I've heard about, you know, when you're actually doing the work, you're motivated by curiosity, by trying to resolve puzzles, by trying to resolve paradoxes and saw. I also remember as he is at a previous meeting saying that one of the greatest moments in his life is when he's in the laboratory and he sees something and he thinks only God and I for the moment understand those processes. And I, I mean in my way I can think of things like that too. There's a moment when I suddenly understand something and everything fits into place and you know, I just know a whole bunch, you know those lights suddenly where there was darkness and missed before and that's a wonderful feeling. But so we don't do it for compassion. We do it for that feeling, that Aha moment, that discovery. But you know, it's all within a social context in which that are funding agencies. I there their society who's deciding which fields are really important to work on. There's people responding and economics whenever those like, you know, in the Great Depression. That was what caused some of the greatest future Nobel laureates and other people to move into economics because they wanted to help people. So it was the compassion, the drove people into economics. It's funding agencies, it's poverty. In the world. And for me it's always been, that's for me it's been very direct,

Speaker 3:          39:58          lovely makeup client. Uh, I uh, as a scientist I usually think that what I say no, and I'll start scientists pay any attention to and I'm really gratified and very happy that Dr Dayton, uh, as coach me twice.

Speaker 1:          40:19          Absolutely. But I should say that actually interesting enough, you as eastern jar or an MD, a medical doctor as you are to um, Thomas Lindahl but you only lasted one year. It was a doctor and you only two years. It's a shelter. Yes. So you didn't have the compassion gene to carry on health. Professor Lindo weekly

Speaker 5:          40:39          like to go back to sweat Lana's comment that we are in the privilege society, we can pursue our ideas without being regarded with suspicion by the government. I'm old enough to have had called digs and down some somber kin, eastern Germany, uh, a bit over 35 years ago and it was Soviet stepped the local scientist, they immediately became my friends too. I never met them before because we had the common enemy and there were people in gray suits who are sitting in the room trying to figure out if we were doing something subversive in their mind scientist for the same thing as terrorists. And uh, that was an uneasy feeling. Yeah. And uh, I think that has largely disappeared now.

Speaker 1:          41:27          Okay. So we've got some, a couple of questions now if I can go to Anneli Borg first and then Rabiah Aau. But if you could both give us, um, your point, Anna Lee. Yes. So my question is whether you would encourage young person or a student to become a scientist in your own field. Okay, thank you. Ruppia. You, what skills do you think for most important on your way to success? Okay, thank you. Um, who would like to pick up on Annalee Borg? Would you encourage a young person or student to become a scientist in your field? Professing the, I have to say it. Let me ask you because I know that you had a teacher, a chemistry teacher who you didn't really get on with and who failed you in fact, and yet here you are. I can't mistreat laureate. How about that? Huh?

Speaker 5:          42:20          Clean stuff. There are some teachers that are very bad teacher. You should be stubborn in science. Uh, you shouldn't be easily discouraged. Uh, occasionally you meet scientists to have some idea that's obviously wrong and they just spend years and years pursuing that idea. But that's exception of the, I think it's much more common that scientists give up too easily. I, you have an unusual observation and nature's telling you something here. You are privileged, you have new information and that you shouldn't just put it in a drawer because you don't understand it.

Speaker 1:          43:02          Professor Dayton, you actually didn't start off. They wanted to become an economist. Did you? You actually went into university to study mathematics

Speaker 4:          43:09          and then gave up on it already gave up on me. Huh? I would say one thing though, and some of you are not going to like this, but you know, the mathematics I learned early on has been incredibly useful to me even though I'm not a mathematician. And there's a very wide range of sciences and economics and other things where mathematics is really important. So, you know, push yourself as far as who cam, um, in that direction. Um, there's obviously areas where it's more important than others, but it's often extremely important and it helps you think very clearly. Um, as part of it,

Speaker 3:          43:47          we're all talk about how this or that teacher made a big difference now lives, um, because they're not paid well, they're not respected in society are our best minds do not go into teaching. And I just hope that through this medium, uh, both young scientist I young people and their parents encourage their children, the capable, intelligent children to become teachers.

Speaker 2:          44:14          [inaudible]. And one

Speaker 1:          44:22          thing I'd like to say in and use you as an example, perhaps professor Bill Campbell, is that don't be scared of the contradictions perhaps within you, because I know that you have a huge love, admiration and respect for parasites and worms. And yet ironically, you've spent your life researching how to kill them, right? So there's this, I'm bivalence here, but I know in your spec on you'd like to paint them, you paint worms. And when you met President Barack Obama, he gave you a stuffed animal in the form of a word, right? Pride of place in your home. Um, and you also write poems about worms. So I'm hoping that you might be able to, uh, give us a rendition

Speaker 10:         45:13          and my poems, I sometimes like to speak on behalf of the worms and gives them a chance to say something. And then I do happen to have one in particular, the case for a worm that causes river blindness. In fact, um, I can imagine it being very frustrated and getting more and more angry as people accuse it of causing blindness when blind. This in fact is a chance of shoot of their infection there. The causative agent does migrating through the skin all over the body and some of them are going to end up in the eye. And those humans, of course, we were very, very unhappy about it. But I imagine I'm one of those where I'm saying this and you have to remember that I think they're pretty frustrated. I don't need your goddamned, I, all I need is a piece of skin big enough to let me drop a few larvae in just enough to make sure that they will be a pickup and delivery. Don't look at me that way. I don't need your God damn high.

Speaker 2:          46:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          46:31          Bill Campbell at that actually thank you to all of our lawyers especially, but both [inaudible] and renewed. Congratulations to all of you. Thank you to our students who have given us questions, some encouraging, inspiring, and I'm honest, uh, words from our Nobel laureates, from me, Xena, we and all the team on Nobel minds from the concert hall in Stockholm, Sweden, goodbye seasons, meetings, and a happy new year.

Speaker 2:          47:01          Okay.
