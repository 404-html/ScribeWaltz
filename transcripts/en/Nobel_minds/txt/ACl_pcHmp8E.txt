Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello and welcome to the concert hall in Stockholm where this year's Nobel laureates received their awards from the king of Sweden for their outstanding contributions to science and economics. And they join us small and elite group. And this is the first time that there'll be a pairing together on TV. And we've also invited the family and friends to our audience as well as some of the best and brightest students from across Stockholm. And they will be putting their questions and comments to our laureates. Well, this year we have discoveries in the development of small machines, a thousand times thinner than a strand of hair. Can you believe that? We also delve into strange forms of matter that could lead to super false computing and does it make economic sense to pay bosses, big checks, salaries, bonuses, that kind of thing while they're amongst the topics that we'd be discussing. But this year's Nobel laureates, gentlemen, welcome to your and renewed congratulations to all of you.

Speaker 2:          01:31          No,

Speaker 1:          01:33          I hope you don't mind starting off by saying that the average age of this year's lawyers is 72 you're all 65 or over. And you know, the trend is to award the Nobel prizes later in life. Do you think it's a good thing that you should wait longer to be recognized for your work? Um, I'll ask you first, Oliver Hart because your father died at the age of 106 and he published his most significant scientific paper when he was 71.

Speaker 3:          02:05          It's true. Yes. I think he was going a little too slowly actually. But um, to answer your question, I think certainly in economics they tend to want to be sure that the contribution that I'm recognizing is, is one that's going to survive the test of time. But then I can understand that because things happen, you know, people get very excited about things. Um, so some sort of hot topic and then it turns out, you know, five, 10 years later, it doesn't seem so important. So I think, you know, they often wait 30 years and that's okay. And that's going to lead to the kind of ages you're talking about it which people win prizes.

Speaker 1:          02:47          I mean, could one of the reasons be that there's so much theory now? I mean, apparently a hundred years ago there were a thousand physicists and now there were apparently a million. What do the physicists think? Did you think it takes longer for real talent to shine through because there's just so much information you've got to assimilate? I don't think it takes longer. It's just as you say, it's a matter of quantitative. Miss so many smart physicists around that. How do you tell which piece of work is going to be significant? It's impossible. Ben, for anger as a chemist. Do you think that, um, the prize acknowledges the kind of benefits of incrementalism, you know, standing on the shoulders of giants as it were, and it kind of goes against the, in Eureka moment in the bath that we often associate with science, of course we stand on the shoulders of giants.

Speaker 1:          03:41          I mean, we work with the knowledge that was made, uh, experienced and developed before us. But there are these certain moments that, uh, in in time that my colleagues and myself and others in the field experience where you suddenly realize that you have made a breakthrough and that opens up a new field. It might take several years before it's recognized that a new field has been opened. But John Pierre has survived. I mean, you're a chemist, but I could ask you this. When we're thinking about drugs and vaccines and that kind of thing. I mean, we do need fast science. Do we to fix urgent problems? I mean like the Zika virus or, or whatever because you know, you can't hang around for ages waiting for vaccines. Yeah, you're absolutely right. But, um, you know, we are, I think probably all of us around this table, basic scientists, we are mostly interested in basic science and um, of course, I mean the research we do, I could lead to new drugs, new vaccines and all that.

Speaker 1:          04:47          Um, but in our everyday research who are quite far away from that, let me just see what the students in our audience thinks. Students, just a couple, a few comments from some of you about sort of life in the fast lane, the slow lane. Because I mean, the world that you inhabit today is quite different from when these Nobel laureate started studying. I mean you've got, you know, instantly knowledge and information. People talk about information overload, the distractions, the constant digital stimulation. Um, you know, confusing inflammation with knowledge. Who feels that perhaps we should have more emphasis on longterm effort and experience?

Speaker 4:          05:25          Oh, uh, I think that um, it may be in reason chair technology may have, uh, affected, uh, student, the young, young generation negatively in that sense. Maybe they have gotten less patients perhaps, uh, when conducting research. I don't know. But uh,

Speaker 1:          05:41          see your attention span might not be as good as it might be because of the constant bombardment. Exactly. Okay. Thank you. Any more comments? Well, I think when these gentlemen probably started out, they had only a couple of journals hardcopy whereas we have basically the entire Internet. So I think you just have to have a better filter, but still great, great breakthrough with, as you mentioned, don't come around like every other week. That doesn't happen. I think nowadays year have often the impression that you have so many options and alternatives that might be a bit hard to focus on one specific goal.

Speaker 5:          06:18          I do think that one of the most important challenges for the educational system nowadays is to teach students how to select information that they can found find on the internet, and in that sense it's very important to be able to use the media as an opportunity rather than a threat.

Speaker 1:          06:40          What's the phrase that does seem to be a bit of a kind of generational divide I think, or how people approach their work today and how you ordered? Yes. I don't think it's as dramatic as being described because we, we're not faced with two journals, but benny journals and we were faced with having to read these journals rather than to access them quickly. We had to go to library, so it was much more time consuming than it is today. You can get information much more quickly today, which is good. Then you think that you just got his time going to the library and that kind of thing. Bengt Holmstrom as an economist, what's your here?

Speaker 6:          07:16          I don't think we think very much about Nobel prizes when we do our research. So I think the key is who is the nature of research and how it's evolving. So it gets to the issue about has it sped up or something like that. And uh, in economics at least, uh, despite all the journals, it turns out that it's harder and takes longer to get publications. But maybe the whole functional publications has changed. The Internet started with physicist circulating their papers at cern. So the, um, now there's a huge overload of papers coming in there with the branch, geophysics. Uh, everything is put on the archive for most immediately. And of course it's, it used to be easy to read what was put out every day or every month, but now there's so much coming in. Again, you get down to this filtering problem. It facilitates our work, no doubt. But I missed something, which is to read an article by accident 40 years ago. I used to his, you know, and to take a journal, just walls and all of a sudden, you know, you find a nice drawing. Uh, you read the paper, you read it more in detail and this is totally accidental and it's a good accident nowadays. You read what you are prepared to read, you go to a journal on the Internet and just look at what you want to look at. There are no accidents anymore.

Speaker 1:          08:48          Senate serendipity, serendipity and always that. Thank you. Well, some interesting thoughts there, but let's, um, now take some of our first questions from the audience and Rebecca Loudin your question please.

Speaker 7:          09:02          So I remember when I was supposed to choose a degree for university, that basic signs was not a very popular field to go into among the students in my class. So how do you think we could encourage more young people to be interested in and wanting to pursue a career in basic science and uh, put silver, uh, recent studies and surveys to show that uh, nowadays, young scientists are under extreme, uh, extremely high pressure to publish, to secure funding and a tenure track positions. And this often leaves serve very little energy and time to, um, to do high quality research and to pursue interest in ideas. So what is your perspective on this? And you end pen. Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:51          My question is, um, what is your opinion towards a global trend of reducing funding for fundamental fundamental science research? Thank you very much. Let's take that last question first from UN pan about the global trend. He says reduced funding for fundamental scientific research. So Fraser, I mean, do you see a difference in, in the research were fundamental and applied scientific research?

Speaker 7:          10:19          Yeah,

Speaker 8:          10:19          no I don't. I think there is no difference between fundamental research and applied research. I think there's only good research and I think the two marriage into each other very nicely. I spent time in industry and did some very fundamental work when I was with imperial chemical industries, corporate laboratory. And that is where most of the ideas that led to my, uh, discoveries in the early nineties came from. So, uh, I've never seen, uh, this, uh, the mnr situation. I've just seen good research and maybe not so good research.

Speaker 1:          10:50          Judge my, you'd like to pick up some of those points that we heard. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          10:52          Um, people talk a lot about, um, the pressure to get tenure. I mean that you have to do a lot to get tenure and that makes people write a lot and all that. But actually I, when I look around and see my colleagues who've got tenure, many of them also seem to continue to produce many papers. And I think the reason they do it so they don't read it, they're not under the prior the garden anymore, but they still do it. It's not just to get grants, it's because I think to some extent they like to feel busy and they like to be able to tell people what they're doing. And actually it's quite difficult to be engaged in a longterm project because then you know, where you meet someone, they say, what are you up to? Well, not much. You know, nothing

Speaker 1:          11:38          in places it doesn't set in. Once they got the 10 year put their feet up.

Speaker 3:          11:43          No, no. Um, but the, the thing is I'm not, I think that you, you would hope they would then say, oh, I'm now free to do a 10 year project. But I think it's

Speaker 9:          11:54          mentally difficult to do that.

Speaker 10:         11:56          I always give my students that want to go into an academic career, the following at fry's walk on two feet, one going align of research, but at least you get some decent paper so that you can ride a grant application or people recognize that you do some decent work and then work also on some fairly challenging question on where you might not have a paper in the next three or four or five years, but where you will make a name in the world for yourself. Of course that's risky. The debt will stay said the states maybe for your next career. So yeah, you cannot deny that there is a pressure to publish some papers because we had our papers. You might not have the possibility to get a grant or the next step or 10 year or so, but you should focus on what are important questions because we forget that sometimes they're, the main purpose of science is to ask the right questions. So about all this information and knowledge is, it's great to know a lot, but it's better to ask the right questions.

Speaker 9:          12:59          Professor Castilla it's one question was how do we encourage more young people to go into science? It's, I think that's a very difficult thing to do because if you think about it from an, most people are going to science, okay they go in very enthusiastic study harder, et Cetera, et cetera. But the chances of being very successful are actually law and so you'll never going to get rich for example of Eh maybe chemistry medicine and so it's different. But certainly in physics you'll never get rich doing it. So why do you know you've bought your prize now that your well actually reached the very top and then a little bit anxious. Yeah, it's wonderful to have this price. But if you think about is monetary value is monthly values, not much. Not after the tax man as as had this cup has had is cut. So the money's not the thing. It's more the satisfaction of doing, of producing something in physics. But how do you know which piece of information is is significant and which is not something 99.9% of the stuff out there is not so significant. This is noise and the one and the 0.1% that is significant out there. You've got to know it significant. How do you know what significant, you have to be familiar with the subject. So it's, it's, it's a very difficult problem.

Speaker 6:          14:30          You obviously have identified that north 0.1%. I think one of the things that's overlooked in this conversation is that mentoring is very important. It's a, and when you ask, you know, how can we improve the on the system? I think if we maintain a good mentoring system that is critical and I don't think these other things that much it came through from your comment about, uh, about, you know, giving advice to students. So I have been, I would say I've been very lucky to have wonderful mentors, one of which sits in the audience here, having good colleagues and so on. And I think looking at it as a monetary issue or, or, or Korea concern is, is just far too narrow and is your mental health. But Wilson is sitting in the corner. They, all right. Put your hand up top is not just my mentor. He's a mentor of many, many find students and a two Nobel prize winners. He looks really young to be a mentor. But anyway, thank you. Our next question please. From Kerstin

Speaker 7:          15:35          blend, uh, recently it seems as though governments and the general public are rejecting experts and ignoring their advice. Where in the past it was held in much higher esteem. Uh, what do you think is driving this trend?

Speaker 6:          15:52          Bengt Holmstrom you worried about experts, advice being rejected by public opinion. I'm worried about the public rejecting the, not just the experts, but it's what our representatives and have the ability or should have the ability to process complex information. And today's situation seems to be characterized by people thinking that they can go directly to the source and not have anybody interpret it and therefore they are very subject, very much subject to misunderstanding what is going on. And uh, and so yes, I'm very rarely it is though the complex this use this be understood by the experts in ordinary people in they're capable of working it out themselves. Here's where the lead is, doesn't mean in this context that it needs to be bad. So this is, this is really part of our democratic system that there are some people who know more than the others and not before, not necessarily because they're smarter or anything like that, but they have just been handed the task to process the information on a broader basis. And what seems to be happening now is as total total almost ejection two four for this principle.

Speaker 3:          17:09          You know, I think some of the, I don't want to call it distrust of experts, but sort of working around them isn't so bad. I mean, for example, you know, once upon a time, if there was anything wrong with you, went to the doctor and you assume that what the doctor was telling you is the truth. Now you can go on the Internet and find out, get a lot of information about what might be wrong with you. And I think that can be actually productive. Sometimes you can end up knowing more than the doctor about a particular thing or, but at least being able to bring to their attention something. Um, I think there's a difference between that and um, you know, if, if you go on the web and you look at things carefully and you might even read some articles so you don't want to exaggerate your competence to understand them, but you can get a sense of it.

Speaker 3:          17:54          Um, I mean that's a good thing. And, and figure if you did that say with global warming, you would undoubtedly end up with the conclusion that the science says this is a really serious problem. What's worrying is when people find somebody who says it's not a problem and focuses, you know, they then focus on that. Yeah. There's a whole tsunami of information. The real point that we are all facing is of course, quality of information. What does it mean? How are we going to educate our young people to distinguish what is right? How are we to eh, Eh, eh, making information available to the general public and probably be a scientist. I have to do a much better job to distinguish facts from fiction and opinions. You cannot develop a smartphone based on an opinion.

Speaker 1:          18:47          It's the phrase, I mean specifically on this, the brexit vote. Um, and you know, experts and politicians seeing their advice rejected that that caused you a great deal of angst. Y

Speaker 8:          19:00          it did. If we were going to enter an era of hard brexit, then this is almost like a chemical reaction that is close to irreversible. And that saddens me. I was at the forefront, I feel when I was in the UK, in Sheffield and latterly in Birmingham, bringing in students from all over Europe and then all around the world. When I left to go to United States, we were something and the excess of 15 different nationalities in a group of 30 to 40 people. This was sheer magic. The switched on the, uh, students, uh, from the British isles in a remarkable way as well as, uh, you know, really raise the standard of our research. And so I'm saddened by the fact that, uh, the, uh, people working, uh, in chemistry at the highest level in the UK could be faced in the near time by having to go down to pooling on a population of 65 million instead of 500 million.

Speaker 1:          20:00          Can I send you that? We happy with what you heard? I mean, what's the answer to your own question? Oh, I suppose, um, I mean for me during my phd has been invaluable in, um, allowing me to consider how the scientific process happens, how to approach something as a skeptic and to look at the evidence. And I think, I feel like that's something that's missing perhaps in, in the general public's mindset. They, uh, tend to, uh, take what the media gives them and ingest that rather than perhaps being as critical as it should be. Yep. Thank you very much indeed. Okay, so we'll go to your specific fields. Um, and now gentlemen, for which he won the prize and let us start with them. In economics. Professor Horton, professor homes strong, the Nobel Committee said you won the prize for your separate work on contract theory. The judges said your work late an intellectual foundation for policies in areas such as where the workers should receive a bonus incentive or ordinary salary where the essential public services should be privatized. And they said there was, these were matters valuable to the understanding of real life contracts and institutions. Um, Oliver Hart, you see parallels between your work on incomplete contracts, what I could turn bad contracts and why people in the UK voted brexit. How does your work on contract theory explain the Brexit vote?

Speaker 3:          21:29          I don't want to say it's explains it, but I, there are parallels because, um, in my work I've looked at contracts between two commercial parties and I've argued that in, in situations where it's hard to write a good contract, um, what becomes very important is who gets to decide on the things missing from the contract. I call that residual control rights. And that sometimes goes together with ownership of assets. Now in the political context, if we, if we take, you can think of the European Union, the arrangement that the co all the countries have in the European Union, it's like a contract. Uh, and you could have, you could imagine in a sort of ideal world, um, that everything would be written down in advance and then the whole European Union would just have been about the negotiation of that initial contract. Well, of course that's not, you can't do that. So instead you set up these decision making bodies and I think that what the British voters fault was, they'd allocated a lot of that power, that residual or authority to the center Brussels as call it a way from the individual countries. And I think people pass felt they had done too much of that. By the way. I am was in favor of remain. I didn't want, I didn't thought it, sorry.

Speaker 1:          22:54          Year brexit where you all opposed to it including the two Europeans, Dutch and French. We all opposed to brexit. Yes. Interesting. All are Nobel laureates at the table for a few British to European say you're all opposed to brexit. Okay. Banks home throw your research, looks at whether contract incentives, how contract incentives affect corporate behavior and you know, whether performance related pay works and the difficulties in assessing say a teacher's performance as you said, it's not as easy to is to measure as a factory worker and how many goods or handbags or whatever they may have manufactured. So in terms of the workplace, what does your research into contract theory tell us? I think the big insight in some in my view is

Speaker 6:          23:46          that uh, we were very focused initially on, on thinking I incentives need to be provided by financial instruments of some kind of others or contract. And we have come to understand how big a part of incentives is actually something entirely different than what most people think as incentives like bonuses or something like that. So

Speaker 1:          24:06          constantly throwing money at people doesn't necessarily

Speaker 6:          24:10          just a matter of money. But yes, the, the sort of stereotype view is, is throwing money at people or you know, there's an incentive problem, let's incentivize them be some money. Actually that is most definitely not the main, main approach the world takes.

Speaker 1:          24:26          Maybe when we have all these debates, particularly in the UK about executive pay and um, executives getting big bonuses and salaries because share prices have gone up in their company or whatever. What's your answer to that? Does it not make economic sense to pay these big checks?

Speaker 3:          24:45          Okay.

Speaker 6:          24:46          It's not so much how big they are. Uh, I mean size matters, but what worries me much more is how they get structured and especially what these candles and other things have caught have led to in terms of how they are designed. So I think, I think we have gone from some arrows that could have been correct. It's a 20 years ago or so, uh, in the designs into much worse designs because of uh, the public being upset and the regulators being upset and they are trying to really solve the problem. We'll levels and not thinking so much about the incentives. So, uh, I think we are gone from, from maybe a somewhat flawed system to a much better system.

Speaker 1:          25:32          Also moving to another area of research that you are watered your price for with this question of whether for public providers of services, whether they could be privatized. For instance, the Obama Administration to the prison service which was privatized, should no longer be provided by a private companies. It was to see a live debate in Africa for instance, about whether education should be publicly provided or provided by the private sector. So Professor Hart, I mean, what, what does economics tell us?

Speaker 3:          26:03          Well, I think it can be helpful. I wrote a paper with causes about this issue and I think, you know, what we say in the paper is, um, you know, one extreme would you privatized nuclear weapons? We thought no. I mean put them in private hands. Didn't seem like I have a contract with someone who holds the nuclear weapons. Probably not a good idea. Um, would you prioritize the State Department? Would you have a contract with a private company to run foreign policy? Um, I dunno whether Donald Trump is thinking along those lines, but I don't think, I don't think that would be a good idea. Ah, he has appointed a businessman, I think so maybe he's moving in that direction. But um, at the other extreme garbage collection, rubbish collection, quite comfortable with that. It depends how good a contract you can, right? And, but you know, what kind of things can go wrong and therefore who should have the residual control rights.

Speaker 3:          27:06          That's it. But that's how to think about these things. Right? Schools or somewhere in between, in between when you have competition that strengthens the case for privatization. So in the case of schools, um, you know, if a school does badly is shading on quality, then people will eventually find out, it may take a bit of time, but you know, and they'll send their kids to a different school. In the case of prisoners, we probably don't think it would be a great idea for the prisoners to be able to shop around. And so, you know, their competition isn't going to work as well. And that strengthens the case from public provision.

Speaker 1:          27:41          Thank you very much. So, and I just turn to a chemistry and the chemistry, uh, Laurie, it's the three of you were jointly awarded the prize for fundamental chemistry. The Nobel Committee said, do you have mastered motion control at the molecular scale, the design and synthesis of machines a thousand times thinner than a strand of hair so small that tens of thousands of them could actually fit on a pinhead. So we've got, um, some questions I think from the students here. If I could have the first one all off. Yonson your question. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         28:17          So what are the fundamental limits to how small you could make these artificial molecular machines?

Speaker 1:          28:25          Okay, great. If we could take the next one, Hilda Bucklin ah, so I wonder, uh, in 20 years time or do you think you'll see the biggest use? So molecular robots a word, for example, be in medicine or molecular electronics. Thank you ben for anger. Let me take the first one with you. What are the fundamental limits to how small you can make an artificial molecular machine? Cause in 1999 you led the first research to produce a molecular motor that continually spins in the same direction. And then in 2011 year old group built a four wheel drive for Nano car.

Speaker 10:         29:02          Yeah, it's very difficult to say what the limits were doing, but we work with molecules and typically our molecular motor is half a nanometer also. So and one nanometers, 1000000000th of a meter, as you know. So the limits will be probably a dead size, but you have to realize if you want to build machines, it's only the moving part is only part of the machine. So you have to integrate it. For instance, you have to put it on the servers or integrate in a device, et cetera. So that is, that all depends on the type of molecules you are designing for a specific purpose. If you look in your eye, which has a beautiful switch, it is the tiny molecule in the NDI is probably one and we do, but it's part of a big protein complex that makes it possible that the signal of the light that comes to your eyes triggers this. In your eye and then changes and there's a cascade of process that make it possible that you get the signal in your brain. The fact that I can see you, when you can see me, the fact that all cells can define that became move on muscles. These are machines of a, of a couple of nanometers at most.

Speaker 1:          30:08          Sean via survives. You mean you managed to meet one molecule, Piro at, around the other in a controlled manner when energy was applied. So our question about where do you see the biggest use of molecular robots in medicine or molecular electronics? The question was what's your answer to make it clear? I have no answer. I have, I have comments.

Speaker 11:         30:33          Um, uh, before our contributions, um, it was considered as extremely difficult to set molecular systems in motion. I mean, we knew everybody knew that there were plenty of such motors and machines in the biological world, but using artificial systems, molecules, which had been made in a laboratory that was considered almost impossible. And I think that was a big step in a way that, uh, the three of us and our coworkers,

Speaker 1:          31:07          just the question or I assume is, is, is thinking won't hit. Yeah. But when she asked about medicine is that, you know, we think about the walking microscopic robots, which could for instance, slip inside the human body and deliver drugs in a targeted manner. Yeah. Perhaps perhaps it's a phrase it, so the question we had about any, do you foresee any negative social or environmental challenges with the misuse of this technology that we should be aware of? An, I should say that you made a key advance by threading and molecular ring onto a rod like structure that acted as a dumb bell. The kind of thing we use in the gym. When you added the two together, the ring jumped forwards and backwards like a tiny shuttle and later you've built numerous molecular machines. I'm including a pump. So that was your particular contribution. But what's your answer to the question? Well if I could tell you the latter part first and just make a comment about the movement to ban for ringer has promoted the movement in a circular sensor, rotary [inaudible]. So I think John Pierre and I with our um, taxing based systems, a molecular shotwell based systems have done the fundamental preliminary work to achieve movement in a linear direction. But it's not just sufficient to have that movement in a willy nilly takeaway. We have got to be able to direct that movement. The first step after you have

Speaker 8:          32:40          the Willy Nilly type of movement is to go to a switch. There's still a lot to be done in terms of going from switches to machines, machines have to do work and uh, this has been a progressive situation from finding how to bring a bank this motion in either a rotary or a linear rate direction to a switch to a machine.

Speaker 1:          33:04          Would you like to see opportunities in, in your, either discoveries you've me, would you like to see them develop, I mean Bedford and go, do you see great opportunities

Speaker 10:         33:12          since I, I definitely say great opposition is my colleagues already said it is very, very early days. So this is fundamental research. The breakthrough that you can induce motion responsive functions in materials opens up an entirely new field of material science and machines. Ultimately maybe science fiction at this moment, but in 30, 40, 50 years from now, I see many opportunities during my whole career. I work together with industry also on potential applications. Uh, and, and so we have close contact then and when we, and this counts for, for the whole community, I think if we see opportunities for cooperation, we will work together with industries. But you have to realize to bring it to a product in the market. My take along development or the directory, develop a new medicine at this moment takes more than 12 years and, uh, lots of money. So this is typically the timeframe we are working in.

Speaker 8:          34:07          It turns out in my laboratory in recent times by working in this area, we have serendipitously gone off in two completely different directions. One is to create very highly porous materials that, uh, as the basis for one startup company starting about 15 months ago, that is looking at, uh, use of, uh, these polars materials in home care, in personal care, in food, and ultimately in pharmaceuticals. And the other one is quite serendipitous discovery that I would never have even predicted. And that is that we are looking at a new ways of isolating gold that get us away from the use of cyanide, which is 83% of the world's isolation. And the other 17% is mercury, two very nasty chemicals. And all of this has come out to fundamental research and most of these are seven deputies discoveries going on while we're making molecular machines.

Speaker 1:          35:05          Thank you. All right, thank you very much indeed. Chemists, Laurie. So turning to the laureates in physics, um, Duncan Hall Day, Michael Costa, Litz and also David soulless or all of your British born and uh, David solders. Professor Thalamus is not with us, but our congratulations go to him. Also, you were jointly awarded the prize for discoveries for your pioneering work on strange forms of matter. The Nobel Committee said your discoveries, it opened the door on an unknown world. Now Mike hostile, it's along with David Thallus. You focused on that arise in flat forms of matter on surfaces inside extremely thin layers that can be considered two dimensional, unlike the three dimensions that are, you know, we describe reality around us with and the work involves a field of maths known as topology topology basically I suppose analyzes the sheep of things. It's a, tells us that a doe not in a wedding ring topologically are the same thing. And do you Duncan of all, Danes studied one dimensional matters. So that's the kind of preface to the question that we have from our physics student. A flora couldn't stop.

Speaker 2:          36:19          Yes.

Speaker 1:          36:20          Um, do you think there will be any technological advancements such as, for instance, quantum computers coming from the new insights in quantum mechanics separate provided by Ortiz?

Speaker 12:         36:32          Most probably, yes. I mean to what we really discovered was, uh, the, there were more interesting materials than we expected. And um, condensed matter physics is a fancy name for understanding the properties of materials and what this work is a really led to, it started off with one dimensional things, but it's not just one dimensional or two dimensional. There are a class of materials which we didn't realize existed before that have a very interesting properties, uh, in the quantum mechanical structure. And the quantum mechanics is a fundamental way to understand all materials. And a, the topology is a side issue in a sense that we discovered the, some very beautiful, unexpected properties of quantum mechanics and the mathematical tools of Topology, uh, turned out to be very useful for analyzing the specific differences between these unexpected forms of matter and conventional matter. So this whole analog about Brett's pretzels and bagels is just that the Bagel has a hole in it. It's different from a football which doesn't, and this a new form of new kinds of condensed matter. Uh, also different from the familiar types as the Bagel is for the football. The, the property of having the whole in the Bagel makes it slightly different. You can, you know, pick up the Beagle and it can get, you can look through it, you can poke your finger through it or whatever. But it's just different. It's not good for playing football with, no, it's not good for playing football, but it will change the game as I said.

Speaker 1:          38:11          Right. So professor Costa lists and we have heard that your work could result in improved materials for electronics and that could lead to super fast computers.

Speaker 12:         38:26          Okay. So this is, it doesn't like the question. No, no, it's not. No, like it, I just fumbling for an answer to that because let me, let me stress that when we, when

Speaker 9:          38:36          we started this work, it was, we had no thoughts about applications or anything like that. It was nothing more than an interesting theoretical problem. There was a, you know, there was, there was a theoretical question that we wanted to try to answer and that's what started it all. Sure. Could it, I mean in theory we can see all the difficulties as well as some of the, the possibilities. And the question was asking about the possibilities. Duncan, I can see many of the difficulties we unanswered difficulties, right? So we simply don't know the answer to the question.

Speaker 1:          39:18          Well, leave the physics there then. Could we go to our next uh, question please end gala link off. Hi. Um, so we've all noticed that there are no women, um, the received the Nobel prize this year. Uh, so my question is what can you ask noble laureates us as young scientists but also general public do to encourage women to go into science and promote them.

Speaker 2:          39:48          Okay,

Speaker 9:          39:48          well a volunteer to start that one. My own view of this, this issue is initial, no question about it, but my own view of this issue is a bit heretical. And you see to me the, the female of the species is actually v too smart to go into physics simply because physics is tough education, no question about it. And the, the, the, the, the resulting, uh, job you going to get with this fancy education is not great. It doesn't pave particularly well and it doesn't give you much free time. So why on earth should somebody who's, uh, who, who is sensible and intelligent go into this difficult field when they can make a much better living in these your fields.

Speaker 1:          40:38          So heretical that your fellow laureates green shakes.

Speaker 12:         40:43          My view is heretical. Fantastic job if you, cause it gives you the opportunity to, uh, discover things and to work on advancing knowledge. Now if you want to people, it's not badly paid. I disagree that it's bad. It's not, I mean people that if you want to make a huge amounts of money, of course you go to Wall Street or whatever. But, uh, the issue with a women in physics, I mean physics departments certainly in that you states, uh, uh, vary tremendously focused on, I'm trying to do something about this. Uh, the, uh, we believe probably it's a question of maybe it's role models to be able to see a successful women scientists. And so people believe that they can have a career in it. We really do wish women to come into physics. And, uh, there's a problem of,

Speaker 6:          41:34          of, of women becoming discouraged and dropping out at each stage of the process. These are experiments that they have done in, in Addis and sob musicians. And they have started toward this and behind the curtain it changes dramatically the motto and the number of women that they are accepted. So it just shows the days a lot of discrimination and it's not a evil disagreements a side. I think it's just subconscious. We are a club, you know, we men behave in a certain way. We understand each other better. We don't understand why men very well, you know.

Speaker 1:          42:08          So Fraser, your late wife was a scientist. Yes. As we all your two daughters.

Speaker 6:          42:13          Yes. What's your answer on this? Gender risky. Why does it happen that we don't have enough women? And what can you do about it? Well, I think it's a changing environment and um, I think we will see over the next 50 years a dramatic change. If I spec express it in terms of my own family, I think my two daughters who are sitting in this audience with phds in chemistry are, um, living in a much different social and home background. And even myself and my wife where they are supported by a husbands who are playing a big role in running the family, looking after the children. And so I think we've seen social changes that will make it very much easier for women to participate in the, uh, follow the rules of science. Um, and so I'm very optimistic that it's going to come about maybe one year in the future there'll be seven women sitting around this table,

Speaker 1:          43:07          optimistic comments. And I think we can end that particular area of Asher just want to end by saying of course. Um, normally we would hope to be joined at the table by the laureate for literature and this air force. It was a Bob Dylan. I should also say, actually, of course we don't have with us Professor Yoshinori Ohsumi who is the Nobel laureate in medicine or physiology and dark. Congratulations. Go to him too. But in terms of Bob Dylan, um, there have been some comments saying that the songwriter perhaps shouldn't have been considered in this category of a literature prize. John, Pierre, you reacted this. So what do you think

Speaker 11:         43:47          our law, I like him as a senior. I liked the music, but I also have difficulties to believe that, uh, there are no writers, you know, very recalling, recognized as writers who don't deserve the pies as well.

Speaker 1:          44:03          All right. Very diplomatic answer. Perhaps a thing that, uh, anybody else bumped into. Yeah,

Speaker 10:         44:09          I think it's fantastic that Bob Dylan got this award. I mean, he, his poems, his songs were so important and influential for whole generation. You know, when I was a student, I had these records and I still know every one of it. It's, it's great. And when it was announced in a typical laboratory like mine, every Laborde, he has his own music and

Speaker 3:          44:32          within a minute they all switched to Bob Dylan.

Speaker 1:          44:35          Oh, really? He said he was speechless when he received being awarded. The one

Speaker 9:          44:41          that's it's influence is boards influence people, you know, what, you know, it seems to me that's later. Okay. Good Choice Professor Castilla it's, I think you're a big fan of personal point of view. When I heard that the literature prize being awarded to bop little, I thought, wow, that's the greatest decision I've ever heard of. Why I love Dylan and his and his music and songs. I really grew up, I essentially grew up with it. Do you do Karaoke for Bob didn't have Bob Dylan. I once I once tried it,

Speaker 1:          45:18          I mean I can't see, you don't want to give us a nice town. Absolutely not. Mac can't sing

Speaker 3:          45:26          heretical to say about Bob Dylan, which is, I think we've spent far too much time talking about Bob Dylan. Well, I don't mean here, right? I mean, just generally, you know, is he calming? Isn't it you calming? I actually don't care. I mean, he didn't come. I mean it seems to me I have, it may have been a fine choice, but uh, um, probably if he had come he would have sucked all the oxygen out of the event. So this is partly, I think, good thing he didn't.

Speaker 1:          46:00          Well, I show 'em take up your recommendation and stop talking about any factions, a movie. We'll stop talking about anything. Thank you to all you laureates and renewed congratulations. Thank you to our audience here of the concert hall in Stockholm, and thank you to you. Of course. Um, wherever you are in the world watching this program for me, Zane Abu Dhabi and the rest of the team or Nobel Mines, goodbye.
