Speaker 1:          00:07          Hello, I'm Zainab. Welcome Susie, magnificent concert hall here in Stockholm where this year's Nobel prize winners received their awards from the king of Sweden. This is the first time that they have come together on television and they're joined him in the audience by their family and friends as well as students from all over Sweden. We'll be asking them if the best kinds of science is useful. Science. Welcome to Nobel minds and this year we have discoveries that help with our everyday lives that bring light to poorer communities and reduce energy costs that tell us how we know where we are and where we're going. The chemistry prize is about seeing now for the first time we have microscopes that can see molecules and the economics prize helps tell us how we can better structure markets to benefit the consumer and society. So that's the work of our Nobel laureates here. Congratulations and welcome to you all.

Speaker 2:          01:34          Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:41          So before we talk about your various activities and so on, I want to know how you all found out that you had become this year's Nobel prize winners and it is wonderful to have a rare species with us today, a female scientists who has won the Nobel prize. You want to medicine or physiology my bridge from Norway. So just tell us how did you

Speaker 3:          02:03          find out? It was a bit for Monday morning and we had a discussion presentation of some data and uh, I was so excited by these data and then I got this annoying phone call and it was a, a number that I didn't recognize and I just know I normally don't answer the phone stuff that I don't know the number. And then I suddenly got this female intuition behave. I'm sort of formed. Your reaction went viral when that, when you realize why you'd won.

Speaker 1:          02:43          You don't sing, didn't you? My Brett, can you show us

Speaker 2:          02:51          one time?

Speaker 1:          03:01          No, we have the Nobel prize laureates here who danced for joy when she heard she got it. EADWEARD. Muybridge is your wife a couple of both them. And also your, your colleague, Professor John O'keefe, who is not with us, you were given the prize in medicine or physiology, but you were on an airplane. I understand. Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:21          Right. So I actually got to know it after everyone else. I landed at Munich airport. I was going to institute and then uh, I was met by a woman and a representative from the airports that picked me up and I asked why does you come to the gate of the plane? And she told me that, uh, I won the price, I didn't take it. And then she said it was a plank for a price for the, from the Max Planck Society. So she mixed it up. And then finally I started checking my phone and then hundreds of messages. And then one from urine. Hanson, he. No, no, no, she was not there yet. And he said that it's important. Call me back and then I.

Speaker 1:          04:06          So that's how you found out. Okay. And I'm Stefan. Hell, so you were, um, I think you were accessible, weren't you? Yes, actually I had a project discussion with the postdoc because we have seen something new and exciting with our sharp light microscope. You will want as a chemist Laurie, as I say. Yeah, right. And actually I wanted to know whether this has been seen somewhere else and, and put down the paper where I felt that it could be perhaps mentioned there or not and I want to start at the paper to see what it was known on, if that is totally new, what we've seen. And it turned out to be new. So. And the phone rang, the phone rang and I was surprised of what's going on in towns chemists laureates here, Eric Betzig. Um, I think you will also see conference in Germany.

Speaker 1:          04:57          I was find out. Well, I think there's somebody here who can speak to that question better than I really? Yes. Will be my son. Ravi is 15 years old. So where's Ruthie? You've got to it. So. Hello everybody, this is Ravi. I'm bad sex. So what happened? So, uh, keep in mind that unlike the others, my father and I live in the states. So the announcement is very, very early in the morning, our time, 5:30 AM night woken up early to do some work and the phone rings. I'm thinking who on earth is calling this early in the morning, but I pick it up and they say it's a secretary and I say hello. And she says yes as Dr [inaudible] and I say yes ma'am. I'm Dr Betsy. She's a little bit skeptical, but um, she transfers the line to our in oldest running man. He says, sorry, Dr Betsy. Congratulations on winning the Nobel prize in Chemistry along with your colleague Stefan Helen Wu Warner. And I said Sir sir. Yes, I'm, I'm actually not Dr Ben. Dr Ben is my father currently on business and Germany. And here's his mobile number if you want to comment

Speaker 2:          06:07          question for you. What were you doing?

Speaker 1:          06:10          Wake up 5:30 in the morning school. What I wanted to finish. Right. Okay. That explains it. Well, thank you very much. So that's how you found out then they called you on your mobile phone, but, but you can see I have a prize. It's much more valuable than a. no, absolutely, absolutely. One of your four children I think. Is that right? Yeah. And I'm professor Wu wwii murder. So what were you up to?

Speaker 5:          06:32          I was in Brazil. I had a conference conferences, scientific conference, getting dressed ready to go to the meeting. And the first thing that happened was a text from my wife. It says, turn on your phone. Of course my phone didn't really work there. So anyway, she had gotten contacted first by the Associated Press and called me.

Speaker 1:          06:53          So you knew it wasn't a prank call. Okay. So two of the three Nobel Prize winners in physics because your, your colleague, professor, Achan Psyche again is not with us professor Nakamura. So I think you live in California because you're at University of Santa Barbara, so it must have been an earthly our for you when you were told.

Speaker 6:          07:12          Yeah. So basically I, you know, I got the phone call out CPM, so it's. So it's him as I was sleeping and also I am the but the sub one day before I know my is totally to me and know you have to put the cell phone. Maybe dad possibility. No. Yeah, I left my cell phone next to my bed and the answer to this,

Speaker 1:          07:35          what kind of for war and so it wasn't a huge surprise for you. What about your colleagues here? Professor Ammonia? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          07:41          Yeah. It might get worse in praying from. Not Weird in Japan to try and get on the ice. So many, many email title. The congratulations from graduation going to. I didn't understand why to the conversation. So I moved to the final destination to Leon and found many journalists came the exit of the whole farm. Find that our funding.

Speaker 1:          08:13          So you actually Leon in France where you found out. So that's it. And professors on zero. You are the um, so winner of the Nobel Prize in economics this year. Now I think you'd miss the initial coordinate because your phone was on vibrate. Were you working on some great new theory?

Speaker 5:          08:28          Did Not. I was, I was working on the European Research Council grant or is it kind of already. We also have to get money. Every scientist and like my vibrator, I didn't want to be bothered so I put my phone on vibrate. So they kept calling and calling and calling and then I have funny or the phone vibrating and I looked at it at a 45, six, 46, 46. Is Sweden what's going on?

Speaker 7:          08:56          So I took it and you're getting then you wonder, is that a joke? And you know, it was not a joke because you're here now let's carry on with you professor too, because um, you would given the Nobel prize basically for various theories that all come under one umbrella as it were, of how to structure markets, regulate, regulate big business and so on, to better benefit the consumer. And I know that um, when you were giving your ceremony, I was listening to the citation, they sort of compared your theories to a baker, how I'm a baker, a selling bad bread and has no competition is going to carry on selling the bad bread rather extensively. And your theory helps set us how we can tackle that kind of market abuse. Oh, that's why it's free. There's always dance shows at firms with child noncompetitive can raise price or offer low quality.

Speaker 7:          09:51          So you have to work through it in two different ways. One is onto trust or competition policy. You intervene to avoid abuses of domain and position on that nurtures which will raise the price and lower quantity. Oh, you're kind of regulate directly today comes and the electricity in banks and the likes. So our work has been to, uh, apply Game Theory and information economics to that kind of situation, so as to provide series and unpack all the work that could lpars those authorities to deal with big firms. Can you see now, um, areas where we have monopolies or only got police where they are kind of crowding out competition and they themselves perhaps or a bit inefficient and give expensive products for the consumer. Could you think that's quite a common problem in the world now? It's a common probably. It has always been. I mean we're still, today comes connectricity on railroads are what we call essential facilities or bottlenecks which are extremely costly to reproduce.

Speaker 7:          10:47          So you have not shown monopolies and you, you have to give access to create competition. So part of our work was to think about how to create the access to those bottlenecks, but you also have, um, you know, an old high tech industries you like, you have like Google and Microsoft and are large fixed costs, for example, building a search engine that allows network side is because there are lots of apps and people want to inter operate and so in the end you tend to have monopolies at some point of time, but the important thing is that a new firms which are more efficient can enter to replace those monopolies if needed. I want to go to the audience here because we've got a couple of questions.

Speaker 1:          11:27          Economic students. Um, we have one here. Just say your name briefly and then put your question please. Maria. Um, when did you ask what do you think it is more effective to regulate large entities like Spain or the United Kingdom or maybe smaller ones like Catalonia and Scotland. Okay. Before you answer that, let's just see if there's any other question. Yup. Young lady behind you. Just give us your name. My name is. You authored that you work. Doesn't have to be influenced by your political ideas, but as economics and politics are quietly related, what are your recommendations for future economies to remain as much as possible? Politically neutral. Okay. Do you want to answer that first of all, is it easier? Is Regulation easier when it's for cause? I mean that's it, you know, you can't just regulate parts of the financial institutions. Globalization means you need a global regular.

Speaker 5:          12:26          Yes. Question is a very important one for one thing. Lots of those firms now like bang socks, she multinationals. So we have to regulate at a broader level. So in Europe for example, the banking union which tries to actually regulate at the ECB level of the European Central Bank level and the antitrust authorities also tried to cooperate more, more and more with each other because it's hard, you know, Google is a worldwide enterprise of course. Um, so that's uh, that's a, that's only point in saying and you know, climate change also ease of use thing that you have to regulate that the, at the world level regulated at the country level is not going to lie because then the pollution is going to migrate somewhere else. So you need a world agreement for that.

Speaker 1:          13:09          Again, in your citation they said that um, you don't shy away from the politics and I know that you've been quoted in the press gave me advice to the French government about its massive deficit and telling them that they have to reform or die and so on. So you don't shirk the political area, do you?

Speaker 5:          13:26          Well, I tried to be neutral in the sand that I'm never comment on 40 titian and politics or you know, support a candidate or anything like that. I think it's very important because otherwise you are linked to a party or to some ideas and, and basically discredited because they will say you, you are saying that not because of your science because it has those particular leaning. So actually when I got to price also John, I wanted to know whether for Walmart, 40th and nobody was able to say and also they wanted to know whether I was a provocateur and the Thai market person and they weren't able to send. And the reason is that I just say what my son says and you know, was I like it or not, I just go for it and you know, and then Jonah is didn't extrapolate. Of course, you know, they're, they're saying, you know, they try to decide soon in support of this color of this person or this part in and that I disliked political

Speaker 1:          14:19          kind of unbiased and you stick to your science, but you do have very strong political opinions. For instance, you've been quoted as saying that you think the euro is a flawed currency and do you believe in what could loosely be described as a EU? EU superstate your big federalist?

Speaker 5:          14:33          I'm a big fit out is. Yes, that's right. I mean do you always on institutions how little bit weak. So it's a currency union, but at the same time you don't have the institution which goes through is a currency union like the US for example, or us as a currency union but also as a common budget has common lowe's and we don't have that in Europe and I would like to have that in Europe as well. Now it's a bit difficult to do right now because there's such a difference between a northern Europe and south Europe. That's, we should have done that earlier of course. But hopefully that will.

Speaker 1:          15:03          But you say you're a big federal. It is, but I mean, you know, you look around European countries at the moment and you know, you in the phone nasional in France did very well with the parliamentary elections. We have the UK Independence Party in the United Kingdom. Uh, your, your opinions perhaps a slightly going against the tide of public opinion in Europe,

Speaker 5:          15:21          right? I'm afraid. So I mean, it's true that Jemena in Sweden, you see what's happening and it's happening almost in every country in Europe where you rehab the casino for big countries and the parties and it's very hard to understand them and we should, it, we should understand the word story is leading you a is leading us and people just don't fly on. And also that very bad economics and all of those parties, those extremist parties, I've terrible economics, but people don't realize that.

Speaker 1:          15:48          Edward, let's turn to what you did. You did. It was divided into two, the price between your work and professor o'keeffe's. And um, since he's not here, just to sort of paraphrase that he identified what are known as place cells working with rats, which kind of tells us about the workings of the inner gps in our brains that tell us how we know where we are and where we're going and how we store that information so we can use it for the next time. Yeah. So tell us, tell us more about why his discovery was so significant. You muybridge, you listen to the small electrical pulses in the brain and the brain says, because they talk about sending electrical pulses and one such a pulse, you can magnify a soda, it's a 10,000, 20,000 a more in amplitude and then you can listen to it and then a place that would be silence, silence, silence,

Speaker 8:          16:45          pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

Speaker 1:          16:49          and whenever the rat is coming back to certain place in the environment, you had the same popcaan sound like a popcorn bag in the microwave oven and it's such a beautiful sound for us and we've got about half a million to a million place cells in our brains in the hippocampus at least, which is somewhere near the temples. Is that right? Yeah. Just somewhere that you identified a separate set of nerve cells involved in navigation which are activated when Irak passes certain locations. Hence the grid cells. So just you tell us about those.

Speaker 5:          17:27          Yeah, so the difference is that the place of subtle Keith discovered they are usually active at one location. The sales, what we discovered, we call them grid cells because they are active at many locations. And those many locations form agreed very, very periodic map or the environment. So it's almost like a coordinate system a while you have points that

Speaker 4:          17:50          are at regular distances.

Speaker 1:          17:51          Sure. And since we're talking about useful science, this discovery, helping us understand how the brain works, but do we know illnesses like brain diseases like Alzheimer's, that sense of space and where you're going is one of the first things to go. So what kind of application might your discovery health, Alzheimer's and other mental.

Speaker 4:          18:08          Yeah, I would like to see two things about that. First of all, a dot area that contains those cells, that's usually the first one to be affected in Alzheimer's disease and you get a problems with a navigation and so on. But so it's very important for Alzheimer, but it also say that it's perhaps even more important because it allows us to understand the basic principles of how the brain works. So these cells are so easy to measure. It's actually provided a window into the working principles of the brain. And I think this is basic research. We understand how the brain works and then in the future I can go and t will also understand other diseases because we get to the fundamental principles of the brain, like what are the diseases, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, the whole spectrum because they all depend on, on some, uh, a rather small number of the working principles that is used by the brain.

Speaker 1:          19:04          Wonderful. Let's say that sauce. Yes.

Speaker 3:          19:07          And, and, and the interesting thing is, well then resend to hear that if you have a window and you can put the window, just remove part of the skull and put the window and use these guys. Microscopes, I'm just,

Speaker 1:          19:19          we'll come to these guys microscopes and go to the audience who's got a question for the most, is this dynamic duo. Obviously the two of you working together and was very successful, but maybe you can tell us a little bit more. How is it if your partner, your colleague at work is at the same time, your wife or husband infused seed or each other? All the time?

Speaker 3:          19:44          I can tell you one thing at least I don't have to sit home and then get the critics. Why isn't a dinner

Speaker 1:          19:51          finished my bread? You are, as I said, a rare species because there are very few women at this table sign with scientists. I will use more exact scientific, precise language. You are the only female amongst these Nobel laureates. That's true and I often sit around this table when I've done this program in the false and they're a new female science laureate, so I have to ask you, why is it that you know, particularly at the top of the pyramid in the scientific community and academic institutions, there are very few. My brother even in your own country, Norway.

Speaker 3:          20:36          No, that's not part of my background in science, so I have to just pick it up and of course when, when when you need to. When when you get such a price, you are sort of top of a pyramid and in order to come to that pyramid you need a pool and the pool you need is a lot of women here and then it's become sharper and sharper up to the top. So it's just about we need to get more women interested and also more women who can trust themselves so that I think I'm good enough to win the Nobel prize. Why not? But uh, to, to be in science, you have to work a lot, you have to travel a lot and especially a mom and here is unlike their bias, but especially a mom who doesn't want to leave the chamber conferences when and girls were very small and, and leaving a baby while you are breastfeeding. You don't do that. It's, it's, it's painful. I've tried it once and never ever again. Any other comments from here, Eric, but thick.

Speaker 9:          21:45          My wife and I, uh, met at Janelia. She's a neuroscientist. And same thing is, is that it's a two heads or even though she's in a different field than I am, you know, two heads are better than one. There's sort of common principles that we can help each other out at work and we can help with the child rearing and tag team take off, you know, time is necessary for the kids. But one thing we don't do is no pillow talk about science.

Speaker 1:          22:14          Once we get home, sciences will tell us where the rubbish out and that kind of conversation. We want a stress free environment. And Professor Mona your views on this.

Speaker 9:          22:26          Well, what I see happening is some improvements in these numbers over time. I bet if you looked at those numbers 10 years ago, you see that there are better now because some of these new policies that are being put in place to help with child rearing that or help with sort of alternative ways of, of helping across this barrier. So we're working hard on it. We're, we're working very hard to get more women in at high levels of the professor at, at, in the United States. I think.

Speaker 10:         22:52          Cool. Definitely in Germany, I think the number of female students in physics and chemistry has gone up substantially. So when I started out of 100 students, we have maybe two or three little women. Now it's 20.

Speaker 1:          23:04          Your Chancellor Angela Merkel is a scientist? Yes. Excellent. Is wonderful module there. Yes. And she works. She's a scientist too, didn't she? She didn't just study it. Yes. That's great. What about the experience in Japan, women scientists in Japan, how do they do

Speaker 10:         23:20          in terms of the statistics? Well, we are doing. The development are only 80 percent. Eight percent of the women in my university. He know where you're immersed. You are per se so. Well one of the top level university, but still

Speaker 1:          23:38          eight percent women. Natural Universe where you will. Yeah. Thank. So let's

Speaker 7:          23:46          turn to the chemist laureate. So you basically working independently came up with a solution to make microscopes work much better so that now for the first time we can look inside cells to see molecules, but how did you do that? Because I mean microscopes had been around for ages. The prize recognizes super resolution fluorescence microscopy and some people might not know what this fluorescents business areas so I can illustrate it a little bit and give you a few of the key ideas here. Here's a liquid. There are a lot of molecules in this vial, maybe 10 to the 24th. That's one with 24 Zeros after it, but inside this we also have some fluorescent molecules that and we want to be able to see these molecules. So let me just illustrate the idea. I have a green laser here, a green laser pointer that's a green, very green, but when I shine it through this solution, the fluorescent molecules inside give you a more of a yellowish color and you can see that I can just like a light saber only where the beam is going.

Speaker 7:          24:53          It's hitting the molecules and the molecules are sending light back. That's what we mean by fluorescents. And so what we are doing, and these microscopes is using lasers and this property I just showed that the molecules themselves, he meant like bags, like little tiny light sources and it's because 25 years ago one of the ways to achieve super resolution relies on being able to see single molecules. That's what I worked on. And you can actually now with your eyes, look into a microscope and see the light coming from individual molecules. So Eric, I mean the, the, the chemistry prize was awarded because it's about seeing. But what is this seeing actually do. What kind of diseases might it help is I always feel uncomfortable when media tries to project us into technologies. It will have applications, but it's very difficult to predict. That's one of the things with technology in general is it's very difficult to predict what the ultimate ultimate benefits will be. And you're willing to predict he's winning.

Speaker 7:          26:03          Question to ask. I mean we have used the high resolution in order to find out key processes going on. For example, in HIV. So biology, I'm quite quite confident, will be strongly impacted by the microscopes that we have invented, professor managing feel queasy about answering what kind of future applications. Well, the real point is you see in much greater detail than what you saw before and you see surprises, you see things that weren't necessarily expected and all of these super resolution methods or something like recognizing that the cell is something like a little city where there are many molecules, proteins that are moving around a little motors and DNA and RNA and so forth. But if you only look at it very, very high up in the sky where it's only fuzzy, you don't see what's going on, super resolution lets you see far more clearly that is a factor five, 10 or more better already. And the point is then you see surprises. Things that we didn't understand about the cell biology. You've benefited from these guys. Discovery something

Speaker 4:          27:11          general. Yes. The advances in microscopy and especially the advances that allow microscopes, fluorescence microscopes to be used in, uh, in living animals. Uh, so, uh, the resolution that the three lawyers have worked on today, it's even beyond what we can use at the moment, but I think this will come.

Speaker 1:          27:32          Professors, Mr. No. And I'm professor of Nakamura along with professor I Kosaki you were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for your blue light emitting diode, which made possible a highly efficient light source that's now replacing the incandescent light bulb that Thomas Edison gave us. So we've had red, green emitting diodes. For what? About 50 years in your blue? One has been around for about 20 years. You combine the blue with the red and the green and perhaps you can show us what happens professor knocking. Laura.

Speaker 6:          28:05          Yeah, a biscuit. We thought a brewer, you cannot make quite big. The is of the led lighting. Is that a point to point? Right source. So we can't use dance to make any kind of shape of light. For example, this is a site coordinator, but he puts some kind of feed into it to be from. They found gonna ship. This is the best, a right to enforce the act art, you know,

Speaker 1:          28:32          so this kind of lights is amazing because it's brought a, the potential of a cheap source of energy for communities all over the world that don't have access tonight. And it's also bringing down energy bills. Yes. Because it's a more efficient use of

Speaker 6:          28:51          yes, at this is can't be opened by buttery mobile cell phone, ipad or kind of mobile device. Have to use this thing to make these sprays. And also most important. Is that a southern country? So the country? Yeah. No electricity, only energy source. Like a Sunday night, just sort of say and sort of our charge the battery, daytime and nighttime edited it.

Speaker 1:          29:17          So you have solar power, this kind of device and a battery with the blue led giving the, the white light and it's how much would that cost as a device?

Speaker 6:          29:28          I see now

Speaker 1:          29:31          $10. Yeah. So a person could use that $10 with the source of solar power. And how long would that last for three years. Three years? Yes.

Speaker 2:          29:42          Yeah.

Speaker 10:         29:49          Especially in Japan. Electricity generation. Maybe you remember that day in 2011, they had the big earthquake in Japan, so the above the old nuclear power print stuff now, so the new group or a presence, a bride, the 30 percent of director issue, but now it all stopped so we have to adapt another way. So the led is very important to reduce energy consumption.

Speaker 1:          30:27          The they enable price. It is that electricity lighting accounts for about 20 percent of global energy use through the use of your white led in time. That could come down to five percent. Not only do these light bulbs last 100 times as long as the incandescent bulb, they also contain no mercury and one application also is the ultra violet light can be used to clean polluted water.

Speaker 6:          30:52          Yes, a buyer a day to use folk are basically to kill bacteria, are able to bias a bias by that virus and also to a pure water. And the Po Po buyers are basically you can't you, you read it back bucket you.

Speaker 1:          31:12          It's amazing. It killed bacteria. Purify light on, but professor like a Marie, you had a very publicized fight with the corporation that was funding your research. You felt that your, you weren't properly remunerated for the research that you did to develop the blue led, you would give them what? A bonus of $180 and they went to and you could potentially make millions and millions out of this invention.

Speaker 6:          31:39          Yes. This guy, he's says, I moved to the United States and my full comm company started the lawsuit against using got infringement over 30 to secret. So I became so angry about, to my, uh, to my former company. So as a counter lawsuit I started that. A lawsuit I guess in my former company using the Japanese pop into roll out through South Dakota is even if I could do embed for company as an employee, potential rights belong to me.

Speaker 1:          32:14          So the patient rights in Japan belonged to the inventor, the company that employs the inventor. That was lucky for you

Speaker 6:          32:23          if I have any. I really meant it all. So it measures so but the but quote and I quote, the judge says, you know, how the incidents to be drawn to the company if the agreement over the document but the judge also same damn fool

Speaker 10:         32:40          with me. You have a right to get that. These are not brutal compensation fee.

Speaker 1:          32:44          I wouldn't say what it is, but he was very reasonable. Wasn't happy with it. Yeah. It made you a millionaire. I'm not talking about $8 million dollars. Not Bad at all. I mean, how do you feel around the table here that in terms of, you know, intellectual property and patent rights and whether your inventions all used in the future in a way which is basically a money spinner. Do you feel that you should. We have a number of paths for our stuff? Uh, most of them are infringed on left and right. And frankly we don't care. You know, I mean, you can either spend your time talking to lawyers all the time and be miserable or you can get back in the lab and invent something else that you looked to your fault tool company. I mean, would he not have appreciated it if you invented? Well, I didn't invent things for his company that just sold poor stuff on my kids.

Speaker 10:         33:40          Very unusual. I started out in my scientific career is writing a patent in 1990 before I had a postdoctoral job and this turned out to be extremely helpful because at the latest stage in my career, um, I run out of support, institutional support and so I use this patent and basically licensed it to a small company in Finland that gave me money, hundred thousand dollars in return and they use this money in a very critical period to do my research. And that nine months of research that was funded by, by $100,000 really got me that.

Speaker 1:          34:14          Glad to hear that. That was very forced. So your patient patients can be absolutely lifesaving. Yes. What about, what about here where you can't really patient? Yours is just the knowledge isn't anybody trust? What about youtube? I think for us,

Speaker 3:          34:32          simple to say that neuroscience is a big family and we share a lot of both ids and a data. So from our lab, we put data on the Internet so that other people can analyze it and the two reasons. One is that we give very good data and the second thing is then we don't need that money anonymous since when did the animal research?

Speaker 10:         34:58          So we've got a question from the audience. My question relates to research in Africa. We know that huge successes have been made in the West and uh, in my opinion is a lack of collaboration with researchers in Africa. We just resorted to the outbreak of Ebola for example. How could this be explained and what was this push to? Global health.

Speaker 1:          35:19          Okay, thank you. We'll take another question from the floor

Speaker 10:         35:23          and my question was a little bit related to question is, are experimental science because high is our main tool. How do you identify that's power kill that will turn into a fire because so many time lens on

Speaker 11:         35:38          something and then because they don't have enough elements to pack it up, sometime that tends to just it on the side, but how do you, what does it get to get the level of price? How do we identify it?

Speaker 9:          35:49          Oh, well, all right, Eric Betzig a few points there. Um, you know, because I have opinions on all of them but I don't want to just touch on it. But you're a very interesting story because here you are a Nobel laureate in chemistry. But I think in your own words you said I was lousy at chemistry. I sucked at chemistry. That was my exact. And in fact none of you is a chemist and yeah, well yeah, you all, you all, sorry. Famous your department physical chemistry but your physicist and do your more like physicists. But anyway, with that, uh, but uh, the committee cited to specific papers for me to get the prize and both of them happy while I was unemployed. So, um, but, but the, in terms of the spark thing, I think what, what you want to do is you want to immerse yourself in problems and try to not sweep problems under the rug, but focus on problems and outstanding problems and try to put pieces of a puzzle together to solve these.

Speaker 9:          36:51          And if a good scientist I think gets this monomaniacal focus on the problem and you may not have all of the problems, but at least in my case, the solutions have come when I'm not directly looking at the problem, but through the subconscious mind, either I was pushing my daughter around in a stroller or so poincare talks about this in his book about how you have to just starve your mind of everything except the problem. So the subconscious is forced to work on it. And then he was taking a vacation, stepping on a bus and then all of a sudden he had this flash of insight. It's, it's kind of for me, I have great confidence in my subconscious mind. I've described you as a counter reaction to chemist and how you, you're not good at chemistry at school, but you also had a bit of a kind of disdain for academia and you know, life in the ivory tower and if fact you quit academia research and went to work for your family's tool business.

Speaker 9:          37:48          Right? So, so I, I still don't think I would ever be comfortable in a standard academic environment in some ways. Um, I've always just wanted to work at the bench and in some ways the standard model seems to me an incredibly inefficient way to do research because you train somebody to excel at bench science through their postdoc and then you make an assistant professor out of them and rip that all away from them and stick them in an office and make an administrator out of them. I've been fortunate both at Bell Labs and then where I work now, they believe in, in allowing scientists be scientists and not administrators and, and people begging for grants and so I can be in the lab and be more productive. Stefan. Yeah. We also had a question about, um, you know, for instance, other viruses

Speaker 7:          38:36          and so on and we're told all the time now the antibiotics and not as effective as they used to be. Does your work in any way relate? How would you answer that question? The context of your work? Because before you can cure something, you have to understand. Exactly, exactly. And I think microscopes allow us better to understand what's going on including the disease cell and of course, I think to some extent below to allow to send much better how drugs work. And um, um, I can imagine that, uh, seeing things now at a cellular level will affect treating diseases substantially. So in conclusion, Olivia, do you think that the best science is useful science and all these putting Nobel laureates we have around. What is your final word of advice to anyone? I want to get back

Speaker 4:          39:26          to the question or basic science. I really think it's so important that we also spend efforts around understanding things where we don't know what it will be useful for because the, in this specialty perhaps we'll see that in neuroscience. I mean, you understand, you don't understand the brain enough to know actually what is useful. But, uh, I think as we get more knowledge about how the brain works, I know that it will be important for, for the whole range of psychiatry, neurology and so on

Speaker 7:          39:58          and for us professional. But there's, there's many ways in which these two ideas are intermingled. A. Absolutely. I agree that basic science is very important, but sometimes basic science can be driven by some technological need and there's many examples of where the technology has an has something new that needs to be invented and that sort of gets people's mind thinking, uh, I can come up with an idea that might make that work and then new science comes out of the ability of that new method to see new things, the original single molecule where it came from, work at IBM on exploring an optical storage scheme and the fundamental limits of a completely different optical storage game completely out in left field and, and we, we saw a single molecules as a result and then that blossomed into applications. In biology. It's, you just have to have both, but you have to have some interplay between them and stable, continued funding for the basic science.

Speaker 7:          40:53          What about your advice to budding Nobel scientists and economists because you're a real superstar now in France. Wherever you go, you're stopped, you know, photographs and resident and we know the Prime Minister Manuel Val said that this was a poke in the eye. All these people who were being emptied, French gallic passionate and so are you happy being a French area? It's trey nice to. I mean, there's a lot of pride in my country about this, uh, you know, the concert in my honor, if I turned on so qwiff and then there was a big banner on the Cto of my city, 12 meter by 15. Wow. The CTO for two weeks and I got stopped me in the street, but in the end, you know, it's flattering, but this guy wants to do is to go back

Speaker 1:          41:34          to my lab and the Japanese and the Japanese media have been really huge in that. Presidents don't comb with three Japanese Nobel laureates. I mean your superstars on the Uw Professor Nakamura, I mean you said you know, your battle with the Japanese corporation. You'd left in disgust and went to the United States because you felt that you could develop your work better there. But how'd you feel holding two directions? Japan is claiming you was that great. One of the great stars.

Speaker 6:          42:07          Yeah. He, I don't know, but I'd be getting bored in Japan. So that's that. As I moved to the United States to challenge a new scenes waterways as a scientist, I have to do new things, new talent, so that, that is. I moved to the United States and about the, the um, but that, um, that now I'm a US citizen. I have my us citizenship stuff. They'll find definitely people find their might use this or they become angry. Noble Nordic for United States. Japan.

Speaker 1:          42:42          What'd you think about what your just said that the United States,

Speaker 10:         42:49          they're right by law. I have a rate of a different opinion. You might get it. It's like an engineering science and know for instance, you might find the most important thing is to imagine the future system or imagined the future for, for example, the Microsoft Bill Gates. Like, so what would the itch like an inpatient oriented. Of course I understand that a fundamental basic study, the very important, but for us the most important thing, so basic studies to freaking direction should we go. So stuff on him. I think it's best to concentrate on problems that seem to be very difficult to solve. Um, I think those problems are the most interesting problems, the most rewarding problems, but there's, of course there's risk in taking a, tackling such problems. So therefore I think we have to embrace not only taking risks, but also we have to embrace the failures, especially also to honor those people who try heart, do their best but fail,

Speaker 1:          43:54          but don't start with this is a problem in the world. I want to fix it.

Speaker 10:         43:58          Um, that may be like that, but sometimes you get an idea of what you want to do and that comes out of the blue. And I'm with intuition of course. And usually if you, if you do it out of intuition, intuition is passion. And yet you have to be passionate about what you do.

Speaker 1:          44:17          No, it is about passion. And you need a vision so you, you, you want to have a burning question. And if you have a burning question, whatever it's microscopes are leds or economy or neuroscience, then that is to start at, is leading you forward. And then you don't care about methods or if you have a salary or whatever you have because it's so burning. You can't stop a passion or an obsession. Obsession. Also, your psychologist, you should know all about sessions and so on. Eric Betzig, what would your advice

Speaker 9:          44:53          to the potential? No, we're just been said passion. Um, but a lot of times I see kids in high school or college who are in science who are in some ways pushed in a science and, and sometimes their motivations are to please their parents or something else. And if you would rather be a rap star or rather be a painter or rather be something else, just follow your passion because in the end the purpose of the passion is get you past the failures and to get you so that you work hard. Because every field of endeavor it comes down in the end to hard work and hard work is kind of like compound interest in a bank. If you work 10 percent harder than the other guy, it actually multiplies year-by-year until all of a sudden your experiences twice or triple the other guy. And then you can excel in your field and then you win a Nobel prize. Well, who cares about that?

Speaker 2:          45:55          So thank you.

Speaker 1:          46:02          You heard it here, folks. Passion. I'm all for passion. That's the end of this exclusive program with this year's Nobel laureates. We've looked into the minds of some of the greatest brains working currently in their fields. That's all from the concert hall here in Stockholm. Thank you to our audience here, family and friends of the laureates, as well as students from all over Sweden. Thank you to you wherever you are watching this for me. Zainab Badawi. Goodbye.
