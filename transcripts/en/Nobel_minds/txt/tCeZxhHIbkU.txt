Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello, I'm Zina Bodnar. We welcome to the concert hall in Stockholm where this year's Nobel prize winners receive their rewards from the king of Sweden. This is in recognition of their outstanding contributions to science and economics, which have brought great benefits to humankind. And this is the first time that they are repairing together in discussion on TV here or Nobel minds and the joint in the audience by some of their family and friends as well as students from across Sweden. Well, Nobel laureates ringing applause and richly deserved. It's been quite a hectic week I think for all of you. Just give me some of your highlights. Professor Donna Street. Well, I'm the one who had the privilege of sitting beside his majesty, the King of Sweden for the banquet. And uh, it was thrilling for me and he was just so much fun and we had a great time having a conversation. And you talked about girls just want to have fun in your speech. So in seems to be the watch word that's just fun. Professor moment

Speaker 2:          01:31          highlights, you know, last night. Do you know when we were, uh, having your perceptions about the wire per class and it was really amazing to see stables and so on. And uh, I was, I had to play you the extra seat next to a point is a con printers. That's what big Toya. Yeah. And where are the Greek quite discussions about whatever thing.

Speaker 1:          01:55          So mixing with the royals or highlight for you, you don't do many often. Well, the same with me. I had a lots of interesting conversation, so I really enjoyed last night. So it sounds like the bank quit so far has been the highlight. Was it for you, Professor Frances Arnold? Well, I have to admit the banquet was really quite special. But coming from southern California, I have to say snow. It's no the night of the ceremony and it was just beautiful. Jim Madison,

Speaker 3:          02:30          for me the most special was when after the Er king person at the metal I looked out for my family was sitting in shop. My wife and son might be tears over rice.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Oh, and you go, oh, your bounce, right? Yeah. I got all my bowels right. Quiet, quiet a procedure yet. George Smith Miller. I hate to be a party pooper, but actually frankly I think the highlight was the Nobel lecture is the thing that

Speaker 2:          03:00          will last on, uh, as the memories of, uh, this celebration beacon to fade. Professor Bill Nordhaus. The highlight for me was to bring my grandchildren here, my grant, my granddaughters, and to bring to the banquet. And then when they were interviewed by the news that they were asked was it

Speaker 1:          03:21          too long? And they said no, it was too short. Oh Wow. Cause I quite young aren't they? And their mother was teaching them how to sit up, right? Yes. But not that one around, but all the adults were getting tired and they would just

Speaker 4:          03:32          beginning to get ribs. Paul Romer, all of these parts were wonderful. I liked getting to know a few people here in Sweden, the Alexander who took our pictures when we were doing the portraits. It was just fascinating to see how he did his job. I also loved getting to know my driver who was a woman and also a body guard. And uh, she's, she's pretty cool. She's bad ass

Speaker 1:          03:58          because I mean, you really are faced it and celebrated, aren't you? So driven around in your own personal limos and so on. Yeah. Well anyway, wouldn't it, let's start talking about, um, why you want some of these prizes and we're going to start with the economists and Bill Nordhaus and Paul Romer. But let's just have a quick look at what you want to your price book

Speaker 5:          04:17          by studying how nature and knowledge are affected by markets and economic behavior. William northouse and Paul Romer designed economic models that address some of today's most fundamental and pressing issues, long term sustainable growth in the global economy and welfare of the world's population. Professor northouse has developed tools that project the economic impacts of climate change and provide approaches for Sloan is progress. Professor Roma has explained how knowledge and ideas can surface engines for long term economic growth and why government policies play a critical role in fostering technological innovation.

Speaker 1:          05:01          Paul Romer. So just explain a bit more to us about the link between innovation and economic growth.

Speaker 4:          05:07          When people look back on this time, what are they going to remember? Uh, things like, uh, the discovery of electric light, uh, antibiotics, uh, the transistor, maybe, maybe cancer immunotherapy that could be as big as antibiotics in the long run. Those kinds of innovations just make all the difference in the quality of life.

Speaker 1:          05:27          But do they actually boost economic growth?

Speaker 4:          05:28          They do. And you know, we get, we get income, but we also get quality of life that isn't always measured in income. The thing to remember is that we need as a society to steer the direction of innovation. There's some innovation that we don't want. Somebody could find a way to get coal out of the ground at very low cost. We don't want that kind of innovation. What we want is more of a say innovation that helps reduce the cost of low carbon, zero carbon energy.

Speaker 1:          05:56          But you say it's got to be, so markets

Speaker 4:          05:58          are not enough to ensure that we have that innovation. Nope. The way to think of the market, it's a market works for us. It's not the boss, the, the word the boss, but don't forget the things that work like cities work. There's a technology for getting millions of people in a pretty small area. So just copy the parts about cities,

Speaker 1:          06:17          intellectual property and all that kind of thing and people putting up, you know, protectionism.

Speaker 4:          06:20          Think of, think of intellectual property is as we always give these two handed answers. On the one hand you could use intellectual property but on the other hand you could use science, you subsidize the research and you, you give the results away. You know. Perfect. President Truman said he wanted a one armed economist cause he was so tired of on the one hand. But, but, but it's still important to remember that that system of science that we all participated in is a very good way to produce discoveries and get them out into a wide circulation.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Bill Nordhaus I me your research looks at how the causes and consequences of climate change and what can be done in economics to try to tackle climate change. I mean, what does your research tell us about what's doable that climate change is bad for the economy and that tackling it is good for the economy?

Speaker 6:          07:10          Well, I, I'll just start with Paul Romer left off, uh, with innovation. So we often think of innovations and inventions. Uh, in terms of the things my, my friends who have done, but let's just say that this was, uh, this was in a, this ballpoint pen was actually historic innovation in about 50 years ago. But these are often, we think of these gadgets so to speak, or more fundamental ones. But also there's a whole nother class which are called institutional inventions where we invent new institutions. And in this field, I think the most important invention would be a fiscal system to steer the economy, whether it's a tax or another way of raising the prices of carbon fuels. This will steer the economy. But this, this is the, actually we think it's obvious, but actually this was an invention of an institutional kind that has been made over the last 60 or 70 years.

Speaker 1:          08:05          So you're an advocate of, um, carbon tax, which just basically makes the use of fossil fuels dirty fossil fuels more expensive and incentivizes producers and people through government policies or subsidies or whatever to try and turn to renewable. Feels, but is that really doable in practice? What what you economists may determine is desirable is sometimes not politically expedient, was it?

Speaker 6:          08:31          Well, the thing I would emphasize is not the carbon tax, but the carbon price that you need to raise the price of co two emissions and thereby raise the price of fuels and all the products that the fuels are embodied in. So it isn't just burning the fuels, but it will be buried in our electricity, in our air, travel, in our ballpoint pen, in, in,

Speaker 1:          08:56          in proportion to the amount, and it doesn't have to be attacks, but does your research, Bill Nordhaus actually show that it makes economic sense to tackle climate change? You can do it and have sustainable longterm growth. So in a, in a broader framework, what we know is that the way we measure our output, which is the gross domestic product, miss measures it because it doesn't incorporate the damages that are outside the Margaret such as health health is not included. Whether we die earlier or die young, whether we're sick or healthy, that is not included in our economic measurements. So we, when we include that, then we see we would actually have higher incomes in this real inclusive, comprehensive sense if we include measures that reduce the damages. It's not just climate change, it's also particulates from burning fuels and Satya and poor Roma. I mean you've worked as a chief economist of the World Bank advising governments and institutions and you come from a political family.

Speaker 1:          09:57          Your father was a former Democratic governor in the state, became a scientist. Politician's job is too hard. I did this, I was going to ask you, I mean, yeah, but you economists can say, look, it makes sense to do this and to do that and we need to direct market forces and so on and so forth as you've been saying, but it's not easy for the politicians to always do what you think is right. Oh, I kinda like Churchill's quote about the United States is just applied to all humans. They always do what's right after exhausting all the alternatives. So you just have to be a little bit patient. But just staying with this idea of, you know, what governments can do. Professor Miller, you live in Paris now and we've seen the [inaudible] on the against President Macron is desire to have these green fuel taxes, which he says are in part to try to combat global warming.

Speaker 1:          10:47          Look at the problem is he's hired, he's abandoned the idea. Absolutely. These guys, you know, he's tying Haiti to do something innovative, signed to Bush, a people headed to save. I mean, there's no way we are going to, uh, to keep this vis a style of living. You know, I stand up, uh, we have to do something. We already have to do something and, and we have to introduce some incentive to do it. Uh, so I think the taxes, I'm not an economist. Okay. But I understand that maybe the tax on any way to put some pressure on the people and say, hey, you know, you, uh, you have to reduce your consumption. So how, how would you recommend that we, uh, we avoid the Yellow Jersey movement in if we raise the, if the price of, uh, of a carbon is raised because it hurts people? Well, I think the first thing is you make it comprehensive rather than focusing on fuel. And that's actually the most politically insensitive tax in the world is, is a gasoline tax or

Speaker 6:          11:53          a fuel tax. You make it comprehensive. If you make it comprehensive, it's more like a value added tax. It, it gets built into the chain of production. And then the other thing is you start at a low level and you build it up gradually. You need not to have the, only to have the tax, but do you need to have the institutions, you ha you have to have people who can accept this and realize it's part of our system is part of the solution. So I think just hitting people, trying to do it as a kind of, um, a kind of shock therapy is actually politically the wrong way. You need to start small, start comprehensive, start universally across countries and build up gradually from there. If I can jump in, I think partly starts small big government programs have an up almost always start small and get bigger. The other thing is we need to have the whole machinery of carbon taxes ready. We need to talk about it, but then at some point there'll be some huge hurricane, some huge fire or something that becomes a crisis and then all of a sudden politicians are going to say, what are we going to do? And if we've done all of our homework, then they'll say, okay, well that's it. Let's do it here. You

Speaker 1:          12:55          [inaudible] else want to come in on this? We'll do the raising the price of these fuels and materials is critical I think. But another way to come at the problem is to invent new technologies and lower the cost of the alternatives. So that's where scientists like us can contribute. We can invent those and improve on those technologies and at the same time then we're joining forces with the institutions and you create, that will bring us into chemistry because I'm Francis Arnold. You awarded half of the prize part for finding green solutions to some of the world's problems, like climate change and so on. So let's just see what the chemistry laureates won their prize for and then we'll pick that up.

Speaker 5:          13:46          Inspired by the power of evolution, Francis on audit develops new biological material in the form of enzymes, catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions. How Barack is currently, yeah, being used in the environmentally friendly manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and the production of renewable fuels. George Smith was studying the biology of viruses that infect bacteria known as phages when he conceived a way of evolving the viruses to generate new molecules with desirable properties and essential part of all living organisms. Greg winter then harness this technique to create new antibodies, immune proteins that attack bacteria and viruses. The work of George Smith and Greg winter has successfully been used to combat or to immune and inflammatory bowel diseases and metastatic cancer.

Speaker 1:          14:44          So Frances Arnold, as we saw just the, your work has led to, um, a multitude of potential users and or what exactly is it being used to develop, do you know? Well, chemistry of the biological world is, is amazing. The biology is the best chemist on the planet because she knows how to take abundant renewable resources and convert them into an array of chemicals and materials, some of which we've used for hundreds of years, thousands of years. Imagine if we could use biology to make most of the things we need, including fuels or agents that can be used for crop control. These things are happening now. You've made institutions that will make that possible by having the, the price reflect the true cost of many of these products, but we are inventing the technologies that will make that possible. I use evolution to do it. Evolution has made everything in the biological world until today and it can help us move forward. So I breed molecules like you breed cats and dogs.

Speaker 1:          15:57          I mean, give us an idea of what your work could really open off in terms of its potential. Use it with a little work courses of life. The do all this chemistry are called enzymes. You have them in your laundry detergents, you're consumer products. They make your blue jeans look nice. Many of the things that you use in your daily lives are developed with enzymes. I make them better than what nature did for human purposes. So for example, we, several students and I started a company about 15 years ago that makes renewable jet fuel for airplanes comes from plant materials, agricultural waste products or trees for example, that you can use then to uh, take those sugars and make jet fuel. So biofuels, biofuels. That's one of the examples. And there are many other examples and also for example, the production of pharmaceuticals. You've also that that can be used to detoxify the process sorts of applications.

Speaker 1:          17:03          You can replace toxic chemical processes that use expensive metals, for example, that are environmentally hugely unfriendly to mine. You can replace all those with clean biological processes. I like to say you replace chemists with bacteria. You're actually a mechanical engineer on she by trained me. Did you always have a very clear vision of the kinds of path and what you wanted to achieve? Well, in some ways, yes, I was always interested in doing something that would help humans and the planet. I think it's a pretty nice planet that we live on and I'd like to see much of the natural world as possible be conserved. We won't do that if we don't

Speaker 7:          17:50          learn how to make what we need in our daily lives in a much more efficient way. How you did that, I had to figure that out through a meandering path, which eventually brought me to evolution. But we know to describe to my students what a wonderful world we live in. I used to tell them, think of the cow as the best chemical refinery you could ever build and all like it takes renewable resources that makes milk, it builds a new one when it wears out, you know, I'd like, I don't know, it doesn't get any better than that. Well and we can, we can link but that we can make something like a cow out of just adams. I mean who'd a thunk or a yeast take sugar and makes alcohol.

Speaker 1:          18:27          Oh, milk can alcohol Georgeson it's just staying with, with, with the chemistry prize, you were studying the biology of viruses that infect bacteria and worked with phages phage display. And so on as we thought. So just explain a bit more to us.

Speaker 2:          18:46          It's a way of creating a huge amount of variety of structures and a way of an investigator choosing a goal and selecting from that huge, um, array of structures, the few that can meet that goal. This is evolution up and down. This is what evolution does. Uh, it, uh, it doesn't have a goal in mind, but if we mimic it in laboratory, we ourselves can have a goal in mind and no a idea in detail how that goal can be achieved.

Speaker 1:          19:20          Phage display your work on that which really allows us to generate human antibodies was then built upon by Sir Gregory winter who is not with us in this discussion. But he used that and it went quite a way to helping tackle rheumatoid arthritis and metastatic cancer. So, uh, you know, something which has really been remarked on greatly. Um, I wonder if you could just mention that link third,

Speaker 2:          19:47          Greg mentioned, um, libraries of a hundred billion structures selecting from among those, the rare ones that will meet, meet a goal. So the goal in that case was a antibodies that would be fully human, could be used in therapy, um, without provoking an immune reaction against the antibodies themselves because they come from a foreign source like a mouse. So Greg set out to create a library of human antibodies artificially, a huge, huge libraries and s and devise a way of selecting those that would have a specificity for a desired target, uh, that has therapeutic, um, important. Okay. Just draw the link to the literature prize, which was an award this year.

Speaker 7:          20:39          Borhees has this famous story, the Library of Babel. The yes. Yeah. I mean what you're describing is really just like what borhees describes the walgreens

Speaker 1:          20:48          that in my Nobel lecture, yes. This is nearly infinite set of possibilities and what the phage display does and, and to lesser extent what enzyme evolution does is give you a way to search through that library that bore Hayes didn't have right that way to do it. But evolution can take us through that infinite set of possibilities to find the ones that are useful for life. And for us, if you think, if we keep looking for a vaccine for malaria,

Speaker 2:          21:20          do you think we'll find it? Cause we've only explored a few very small part of the space. Uh, well, um, maybe you would fund my grant. You can do, yeah.

Speaker 8:          21:32          [inaudible] Smith

Speaker 2:          21:38          pure pitch. Why not? You're on television. Well, I'm retired now, so I'm not searching for grants, but, um, uh, yeah, so it's specifically the approach, uh, that I had suggested was a way of finding many more vaccine candidates. We didn't depend on 10 or 12, but perhaps on 200 candidates that would have a pretty good starting chance of meeting the goal of a vaccine. It seems that a vaccine should be possible.

Speaker 1:          22:13          You've all harness the power of evolution in your work. And, um, W W we've talked about cancer, which remarkably, it's the first time that a Nobel prize has been awarded for advancements in the treatment of cancer. The medicine or physiology laureates will come to you in a moment. But let's just look at what you won the prize for.

Speaker 5:          22:35          James Anderson and Tesco Honjo discovered how to unleash the body's immune system to attack cancer cells. James Alison identified a protein that acts as a brake on the immune system and realize that by reversing it, the system would be able to attack cancer cells independently. Task you honcho discovered another protein which also operates as a brake on the immune system, but with a different mechanism. It's the first time the development of a cancer treatment has been acknowledged with a Nobel prize

Speaker 1:          23:11          professor, Jim Alison. So did you set about trying to find a cure for cancer?

Speaker 3:          23:17          No, not really. I was trying to understand, um, the function of, of t cells, which are a product of evolution and then ultimately that ourselves that go out throughout your body looking for things that out and to be there. And we developed this system, upsells or way of making receptors on them. They can recognize, nobody knows how many different things. So she sells her what type of white blood cells? White blood cells that the PTAB antigen receptors on their call the could record. Does almost anything that nature throws at you because they create in your body or a library such as we've heard about it. It consists of probably you have a, I'm not as big as some of these libraries. We've probably got somewhere between 70 to a hundred million different t cells in your body that can recognize, you know, most anything.

Speaker 1:          24:01          So you set about trying to understand the immune system better.

Speaker 3:          24:05          We found that there was a, a molecule called CTLA four anyway, that was the brakes on that system and it what a large part of what it does. It stop t cells from pluff rating. And one of the ideas that I had was for some other, I just, after we figured that out, was it maybe the reason that immune system isn't so good at attacking cancers because of that, it stops the t cells before you have enough to kill all the tumor cells. And so if we just disabled the brakes for a time, we could let them keep going until they eliminated all the cancer cells. And so that was the idea. I'm pretty far fetched because at the time everybody thought that t cells divide and they die. They stop that this is an active mechanism whose job tells us he chose to stop it.

Speaker 1:          24:51          So that was your work, but what about you professor Tesco, Han Jo, I mean you were working independently and also discovered how to kind of release the brake, um, in the immune system, which stops it from attacking cancer cells. But did you set about trying to just understand how the immune system works better or did you think to yourself some treatment for cancer would be a really good ambition?

Speaker 9:          25:13          Well, in a bottom my heart because I'm a medical doctors or originary, I wanted to have some hope to cure the cancer or any diseases, but the, when I started working in the pd one, it was just molecule. We acts ten three identified sterling, the a t cell, a selection or regulation or that Tisa oh gang. But the one we found, this is a different break than the Jim just mentioned. And uh, why immune system is working so well against the cancer because cancer just accumulate mutations. They become different from the hour 40. So that's what reason why we can attack

Speaker 1:          26:05          professor hundred I mean there are hundreds of types of different cancers. Yes. So when we talk about treating cancer or curing cancer can, can we actually cure cancer and can we queue all sorts of cancers or are we just talking about some specific ones?

Speaker 9:          26:23          Well at this moment there are civil counsel, which we can cure a some which are very difficult. There are several reasons. Uh, one is the immune system cannot approach to the site where the tumor is located. Or some cancers do not express so many different molecule with them. Normal cells mean the mutation rate is low. So at this stage we cannot say we conquer the cancer to just beginning of the whole story. So we need the lots of research.

Speaker 1:          27:03          Professor Jim Allison, I know that you personally have had a lot of experience with cancer. You yourself have had three types, can't see you lost your mother at the age of 10 to cancer at brother, uncles, cousin. And so it's, it's something that you, you know, have experienced firsthand. But I want to bring in one of your patients who were suffering from melanoma. Sharon Belvin, who's traveled all the way to Sweden to be with you at the celebrations of the Nobel prize. And I'm Sharon Belvin. I want to eat. So it give us your story cause you been suffering from or you had cancer. What, what happened?

Speaker 10:         27:42          So I was 22 just out of Grad school and I found out that I had stage four melanoma. So lungs, lymph nodes and brain. Pretty much as a, I was a child. I didn't even know what life was like at that time. Um, every single conventional therapy for melanoma, like doctor Alison said, I mean, not very effective. It was a death sentence at the time. We tried it all, um, until I was offered a clinical trial for an immunotherapy and it worked. Textbook, I got one round of treatment and I had been in remission ever since. I was diagnosed in 2004 in remission since 2006, 2018

Speaker 8:          28:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          28:26          that must be very important to you that yeah.

Speaker 9:          28:29          Yeah. It was weird at first. Um, that happened in the, told me that tumor free and I, I dunno, I cried a lot along with her along with her. And, uh, that was 14 years ago.

Speaker 1:          28:43          Well, let's turn to the physics prize because that's also had some medical applications and a professor Don Strickland and Sherif and the WHO along with Arthur Ashkan who couldn't be with us. And he is in fact the oldest Nobel prize recipient at 96 by some measure. We'll talk in a moment, but let's just, um, look at what you won the prize for

Speaker 5:          29:06          [inaudible] and Donna Strickland pave the way for the highest intensity laser beams ever created. Their optical pulse technique is now used in millions of corrective eye surgeries every year. And in many of the industrial and medical applications off the Ashkin created optical tweezers, precision tools that enables scientists to grab tiny living cells in laser beams without harming them. His work has transformed the way researchers are able to study microscopic life.

Speaker 10:         29:43          So Donna's strickland along with your supervisor, Shit, nothing wrong. She's telling the tables, maybe, um, you, you, you one half of the price dot ostrich. And you said you saw your first laser at the age of 10 and it was love at first sight and there were many societal applications for your work, but you're a great advocate of science for science sake, aren't you? Why? That's right. I mean there are now applications of what Gerard and I did, but at the time we were trying to do pretty basic atomic physics with our laser. And we also knew that when we changed the laser, a intensity by orders of magnitude, it would change how light interacts with matter and, but we couldn't exactly tell how it will change. But we knew that it had to change because we were going to be beating those atoms to death. So, um, but, and then down the road, that leads to discovery and innovation. But my big thing is that we have to remember to always try to push for fundamental science because without that, 20 years down the road, there can't be more innovations if we don't keep trying to understand the world up to a very small level. Do you would agree with that or is the most useful science? The best science.

Speaker 3:          30:59          I'll see if I can buddy. And I think you said in my case it okay from basic science to, I'm trying to understand how t cells work. I think if somebody had just said, how are we going to kill too much? There's, they would have found another way of pushing on him, but they wouldn't have discovered that there's a part, it's part of the take the brakes off and then they'll, they'll do their job.

Speaker 2:          31:18          I didn't take a slightly different view. It's kind of like this notion of diversity. I think you need a lot of different kinds of activities, some of which are very problem focused, some of which are very basics basic. One of the things we say is that, uh, uh, thermodynamics did I, sorry, if a steam engine did more for thermodynamics then thermo dynamics did for the steam engine. So sometimes it's not the basic science that comes first.

Speaker 10:         31:43          If you go to view on this science for science sake or the best science is the most useful. Uh, no, I, I

Speaker 2:          31:49          absolutely not, I don't believe that the best, the best science is the most useful. I mean, I, I, uh, I would analogize, um, innovation, uh, to the phages that I work with, which infect promiscuously and the, the, the, the cells that they, um, that they, that they effect, in fact, uh, they can recombine with each other, make new versions that go on to infect. And I think ideas, uh, uh, intellectual progress is like that as well.

Speaker 10:         32:20          The applied science steals from the basic science. All the tools that we use in applied science to solve a problem were developed by basic scientists so that you cannot have one without the other. And basic science goes backs and you use the new tools that come along. So it's a back, back,

Speaker 7:          32:40          back and forth. And it's not always the basic becomes hers. I mean, I remember the steam engine, so I think I know said it goes back and forth, but some donor said, I'm going to create $100 million prize to come up with a vaccine that's effective against malaria.

Speaker 2:          32:55          Would that be a bad thing? I mean you all talking about life science and this is where I think we differ because for me, from a life life science, he's not very fundamental science

Speaker 8:          33:11          steam engine. We did $100 million

Speaker 7:          33:20          to develop a vaccine for blurry. You get a vaccine for malaria maybe, but you won't learn anything about how to treat cancer. You'll not true. That's not true. When pastor was trying to solve the problem of just how do you carry food for the French army that doesn't spoil, he invents microbiology. Evolution is a great example. No one knows how to design an enzyme, but evolution finds the solutions and then we reverse engineer the solutions that work in order to understand the basic principles. So in that example, you're exactly right. It's going to be a diverse, we are in a very primitive stage,

Speaker 2:          33:59          so we don't know where the uh, bill goodies, you know, if you know which direction you go, you get something great. If that happens, it's great. But at this stage I think all we have to do is dig many places and somebody get the goals. Somebody hit something. And then I have to think,

Speaker 6:          34:25          I just want to reemphasize this in these points in terms of science policy, cause often the other people who paid ours as far as science ask us to do applied science. They say what is the application? What is the use of this? And if you're doing something that isn't obviously useful, then it's more difficult. It's not just an individual project but don't have in terms of this whole streams there we need streams and different areas. And there's this, there's this story that may or may not be true, but when Queen Victoria visited fair day in the laboratory and said to him, uh, what is the use of electricity and which is like a stunning, stunning question. And he said, madam, someday you will tax it.

Speaker 8:          35:15          Which, which may or may not be true. [inaudible] how difficult it is.

Speaker 6:          35:23          4:00 AM fundamentally difficult. As all of you been saying to forecast what direction the science, what we were talking there, Michael Faraday, the British scientist in the 19th century. Donna,

Speaker 2:          35:34          I think the point I was trying to is

Speaker 10:         35:38          that if somebody came to me and said what we need is a better tool to cut an eyeball back in 1985 until we understood that the work that we did actually change how we understand that the Adam and the light sees each other, we would have always stayed a thermal process cause it was the only way we understood it and now it's not a thermal process. And so this is, you can ask for someone to have a cutting tool but we couldn't have come up with it from being asked to do it. At least this would not have been the

Speaker 1:          36:08          where do you have one by accident and maybe relate the story cause laser eye surgery, which was cited in your prize has been one of the benefits along with them. How to tackle um, space debris as well as nuclear waste reducing its radioactive properties by hundreds of thousands of years. But it came about my accident. And that was in Gerard's love though, was not mine.

Speaker 2:          36:32          Exactly what we, what we, uh, we are talking about, yes we will doing fundamental science, but he's trying to understand the interaction [inaudible] light if matter. Okay. Which is very complicated things. And, and when my students, you know, uh, alignings are laser, I've got the laser in his is, we took it, you know, to the, uh, to the ophthalmologists, look at the look at, uh, the students, uh, and the, I was just tonight. And then you say, wow, you got heat with the laser and did, but what kind of lazy or do you have? And the students said, you know, uh, why are asking me these questions and say, well, because you damage is perfect and now you have millions of people each year, you know, getting, uh, I fixed by the femtosecond laser.

Speaker 1:          37:29          So Don Strickland, in the end, your approach to pure fundamental science was actually very useful. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         37:36          Yes. But it took 10. It's a 10 year gap there. That's a, that's what I'm saying is that you can't necessarily hope first of an application right away. And I'm not saying that I don't agree with you. You can come at it from all sides and you have to have everybody working on all levels of it. Yeah. But sometimes I get a little frustrated that the science that just doesn't have an absolute application seeing down the road does not ever get the million dollar funding and baby or it'd be nice if people would just sometimes say, I have $1 million for you to do whatever the heck you might want to do.

Speaker 8:          38:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          38:14          don't a switch. And it's been much remarked upon that your the third one, the third ever female physicist to win the Nobel Prize and the first in 55 years. And you have talked about an implicit bias against female scientists, scientists, you were told, won't you when you were interested in science and math, these are boys subjects.

Speaker 10:         38:36          I was told by a high school teacher that at some point and I was stunned and I thought that was such a ridiculous thing to say that. And I couldn't say that to a teacher. So I turned to my friend who was a male and said, do you know you're into girls subjects?

Speaker 1:          38:49          Because he was so good at English

Speaker 10:         38:53          starting at, I think most institutions to understand and be taught about implicit bias and the fact that you might not think you're prejudice scans one type of thing or another, but that somehow your background ideas coming into play and that you have to learn to get around that. And so I think with effort, uh, things keep changing and I'm sure it won't be another 55

Speaker 1:          39:15          pharmacists on, I mean wonder if you would want to comment on this. The fact is, if you just look at overall 95% of all Nobel prices since it was started in 1901 have been won by men. Is that because, do you think the women are doing the work and not being recognized or they're just not being encouraged in sufficient numbers to go into sciences? Well, in the past, of course the, the numbers were very low and that, that is certainly reflected in the dearth of women. Women winning Nobel prizes. But I agree with Donna that's going to change and it's going to change fast because women are doing science at the highest levels and they make up 50% of the most brilliant minds. So, and they're doing science now. So I'm, I'm looking forward to a much better future professor Mobley actually your supervisor, not only was your student a female then shares the prize with you, but you a supervisor. It was,

Speaker 2:          40:13          yes, I did. At that time. I didn't think anything wrong about it though. We are the body because that may be because of French. Uh, I think we have historically, uh, you know, always accepted woman. I mean you see Mary [inaudible] for instance. No ice. Exactly. And usually, you know, when we were going to a meeting to conference, you were saying you were seeing scientist and often, often, often you know, it was, she was a French, you know, if you saw a woman first, yes. In our field they were French. But it's changing fast and part because of the biological sciences, at least over half the students now are, are women.

Speaker 1:          40:58          I think in the, in the magical horse field, certainly doctors, it's Harvard or even more than worry about why men don't do it. Well, come to the end of this discussion, just want to ask you all and you've reached what some regard is, the ultimate accolade receiving a Nobel prize. Um, what next

Speaker 2:          41:23          George Smith? Uh, well I'm retired so I bought long since a thought of what next. I took a couple of months, um, retirement from my retirement just now. Um, but, um, uh, I guess, uh, first one thing that's next is I have to learn that I don't know everything the way a Nobel prize laureates are encouraged to think of, but, um, my future is, uh, really not specifically in science, but maybe in political activity. I said, well, for me, I don't think anything is going to change because, uh, what I like is I science and so it's not because I get his Nobel prize, but I'm going to change my habits. I think on the contrary, I think I'm going to do it better because now of course, you know, when, when, uh, someone with another advisor speaks, people listen, you know, and, uh, so I'm, I'm going try to do the same thing but better. Don't know what else, what next?

Speaker 3:          42:41          Uh, well I'll, I'll continue to work on the things I've worked on recently, um, which are, um, climate change. But actually I began working in much the same area. Paul Romer did his work, which was on technology and technology has brought, has been miracles. I mean we're living here rather than in caves because of technology, but just as economic growth has side effects that dark side effects like climate change. I also think technology has dark sides and I particularly am concerned about its dark side on our institutions, on our democracies. And I'm particularly concerned about the role of social media, like facebook on a, on our institutions. Well, I think we've shown now that we could cure some patients with cancer. I have the goal of trying to get that right. It's close to a hundred percent. I possibly can. And, and, um, as many different kinds of cancers rehab.

Speaker 3:          43:36          And I'm hoping it to the prize again when I'll give me out a bit of a soapbox first. It's shown that immunotherapy works, which everybody was skeptical. We're up at four and hopefully they'll help bring more funding and help us get the work done, but also to other things that may not be so obvious when I missed to, uh, let patients have hope that they're, you know, death through the diagnosis of cancer isn't necessarily a death sentence and you know, they could actually, some at least can be, can be cured and the sec and the final one is did I think, I hope that uh, the pros will inspire more patients to participate in clinical trials, which will help us progress faster. Professor task you Andrea.

Speaker 2:          44:21          Yeah. Uh, so I know actually to doings one is to get the Nobel prize, but the other one is the age shoot

Speaker 1:          44:32          in my golf game. Beautiful. Oh, well after this week, I have to say my immediate goal is to get some sleep. But I'm very excited about the future of evolution and how I have one good idea in the 1980s. And I've worked at ever since. But there is such amazing things that we can use to move into the future. And the combination with machine learning and artificial intelligence is a frontier that I'm going to ride to the next level. Don't have strickland.

Speaker 10:         45:09          Well, I mean, I have to say that my life has been turned upside down because of a Nobel prize and everybody wants to hear from a Nobel price. So I'm already booking into 2020 at this point. But I agree with George that some, some of the people that actually want to hear from you all of a sudden are the politicians. And I do have some public policy work that is not about my own research, but about photonix in general and how important it is. And A, I'm getting that opportunity to speak to government leaders and, and uh, try to explain that. And in particular, uh, we think photonix has a huge role to play in environmental measurement and monitoring. So we can try to do all these things for clever control, but we have to know that we've done them. And so we think photonix has a huge role for that. And so that's one of the things that I'm out there pushing in public policy and poor Roman,

Speaker 4:          45:57          we get to bring 14 people to the events here at the Nobel, the ceremony and I brought along Professor Caroline Webber and her parents and my family and we got married this week while we were here in install.

Speaker 8:          46:15          Looking forward, I'm looking forward,

Speaker 4:          46:16          do a honeymoon where we can turn off the phones, turn off the devices. Just just read

Speaker 1:          46:23          on that joyous note. Double congratulations to you, Paul Romer renewed. Congratulations to all of you that saw from this year's Nobel mine's. Thank you very much indeed to all the Nobel laureates, to our audience. And of course to you wherever you're watching in the wild for me is Dana [inaudible] and the rest of the Nobel and mind steam from the concert hall here in Stockholm, Sweden. Goodbye.
