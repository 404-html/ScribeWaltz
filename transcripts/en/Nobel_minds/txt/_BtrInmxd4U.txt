Speaker 1:          00:07          Hello, I'm Zina Berdahl. We welcome to the magnificent concert hall here in Stockholm where this year's Nobel prize winners received their awards from the king of Sweden. The Nobel prizes are amongst the most prestigious accolades anywhere in the world. And this is the first time that this year's Nobel laureates or repairing together on television. They're joined by their friends and family who are taking part in the celebrations. And we also have an invited audience of students from here in Sweden. We'll be hearing and whether these Nobel Prize winners believe that scientists should be playing more of a role in tackling the big problems of the day. So here we are gentlemen, and you are of course all gentlemen because sadly, Alice Munro, the Nobel laureate for literature this year couldn't join us, but congratulations to all of you. Um, what were y'all doing briefly when you heard the news? Professor Randy Schekman. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:23          I was deep asleep, but my wife heard the phone and she blurted out, this is it. This is it. I picked up the phone and I heard a soft Swedish voice. And although I'm not a religious person, I blurted out, oh my God.

Speaker 1:          01:36          And you knew that. That really was it. Um, I think you were making your famous banana toast for your grandchildren.

Speaker 2:          01:44          I see that the banana toast all had these seven things, which is, and they know it's good to have to pay to get the recipe. Yeah. Yeah. I go up to a lot of letters asking me for the recipe for the banana toe, the prominent ones that I was there with my three daughters. The events of course could happen this year, but you know, the clock went down home, uh, November 20 one.com. He's doubled number close to zero and a whoa. There no phone calls or he or my daughters were there. And a day Ted dropped off. Nasty thing about the Nobel Committee. You know, you will forever be remembered for the banana toast when then you go down in his role. We do do, do the banana

Speaker 1:          02:41          fellow laureates in physics, Professor Peter Higgs. Um, you famous, you don't have a mobile phone.

Speaker 3:          02:46          I do. In fact put, only my family knew the number.

Speaker 1:          02:49          Ah, that's it. So the Nobel Committee didn't. So how did you find out?

Speaker 3:          02:53          Well, I found out when I was walking back home, I'd left home late morning because although I wasn't intending to avoid hearing the announcement, I was intending to avoid these subsequent to me dear attention. So I made sure that I was somewhere else for lunch. And I went to an Arctic submission afterwards and we walked home about three o'clock. As I was walking home, a former neighbor stopped her car across the street, came across to me and said, congratulations, but my, my daughter's just phone from London and told me the news about the award. And I said, what award? And she told me,

Speaker 1:          03:33          so just a woman pastor by gave you the good news and call my neighbor. Oh, I say former neighbor. There you are. A professor area. Well, so you, you are one of the prize winners for chemistry. Um, what were you doing?

Speaker 4:          03:45          Okay, I took a half ambien to prevent, to Elton flow, the opposite news. So it was snipping very deeply. And then my wife woke me up again, like landed when I held the Swedish accent. And few people in the background. Did you get back to sleep afterwards? No, the newest people already camps.

Speaker 5:          04:11          Okay. I'm Jim Raffman. Well, uh, I was sleeping, the phone rang. I picked it up and I immediately dropped it and it was dark and there were two buttons to push, you know, the green one and the red one. And when you get a call at that hour, you kind of know what it's likely to be. So which one was it? And you know, if you push the right one, maybe you've got a Nobel prize. He pushed the wrong one. Okay. Did they call back? I pushed wine and I was very lucky. The right, it's a lot of luck to get a Nobel prize. Absolutely. Well, a lot of hard work too. We'll talk about that in a moment. In medicine and physiology prize you, I, one of the winners, Thomas suit up. I think we were driving somewhere. I have,

Speaker 6:          04:57          it's flown from San Francisco to Spain the night before. I had arrived early morning and my blood went to the car, was trying to find a somewhat obscure little city, Beautiful City called Pacer. Wasn't happy because I couldn't find the place phone rings thought it was my colleague widely assumed I was lost. Uh, I wasn't actually even the Swedish accent because they never reached me. It was Adam Smith who is the British accent the British hasn't put and who works for Nova Media and who thought I knew, which I didn't. And as a result, my leaf call that phone call, uh, sort of

Speaker 1:          05:44          documents. Yeah. Documents. My next you got the news in deepest Spain and I'm a professor, Robert Shiller, one of the economics. Um, don't want to sound too intimate, but you're in the bathroom. Yeah, I was,

Speaker 7:          05:58          you're catering to leave for a conference in Phoenix, Arizona. And I was stepping out of the shower and the phone rang and I thought maybe I'll just let it ring because it's too difficult to get to the phone that I thought about the, actually thought about the Nobel prize and I thought, well that is a chance. So I went and answered it. Um, and I was pleasantly surprised.

Speaker 1:          06:24          Can I spell it? Very happy moment. And your fellow laureate for economics, Eugene Farmer, you're famous in early riser and the students here will be very impressed to hear that you were doing what?

Speaker 8:          06:33          I was listening to Don Pasquale and do my back exercises, but then I was had to prepare my class after that, so thank you.

Speaker 1:          06:42          And um, I didn't come to you Michael it, um, but do you tell the son what you were doing? Were you also in bed

Speaker 8:          06:49          chemistry? It's of course in California it was a to 16. I had gone to sleep an hour before, so that was pretty much asleep. Um, what was interesting about the core, it's not just the Swedish accent, there's a lot of, uh, I guess a trick call people call you on that day at that time and say you've just won the Nobel prize. And last year, apparently this had happened to somebody the night before. So this time we actually ask you a question. They tell you things that only they could know. Like we got drunk in Italy because as soon as I had the news, I ran. And before I even updated my facebook entry, I called my mother

Speaker 1:          07:24          who your mother and I have to mention actually, I hope she won't mind. So my saying Gertrude levied at 98, you have traveled here to Sweden to join a celebrations with your son. Professor. Love it. Can we, uh, I think she just

Speaker 9:          07:37          [inaudible] is wonderful.

Speaker 1:          07:47          Now I want to ask you some questions. Let's start with the economics. Are Lawyers, uh, professor [inaudible] and professor format for those of us trying to understand how that last financial crisis happened and uh, worried about the next one. Just give us an overview. How far does your research help us do that? Professor shooter?

Speaker 7:          08:07          Well, you're coming into a big disagreement. Lost lawyers agree on most things. You, you've honed right in. And then where gene and I disagree. Now I actually predicted the crisis in a second addition to my book. I believe that smart people can partially predict the market and why shouldn't they? I think it's, it takes like anything else, but you have to remember that you're predicting human behavior. It involves a kind of broad judgment of bubbles, speculative behavior and people.

Speaker 1:          08:43          Okay. I should say I'm professor farm. I mean I should just remind people broadly speaking along with the lost Peter Hansen who side, they could not be with us because he's not well you were awarded the prize jointly for launching hundred in thinking to show that prices are very hard to predict in the short term and even harder in the long term. So professor Fama, what's your answer to the questions? Can economists help us predict and avoid financial?

Speaker 10:         09:09          That's true about me. Use the right words. I believe that's the state of it, but I've looked at the records systematically and tried to test for it. You cannot find it in the traces of the data. Um, so that's where we

Speaker 7:          09:23          great. Okay. So what were you way on evidence about statistical evidence about predictive? There's a difference in perspective. Now I'm married to a psychologist. Maybe that's part of the reason he always blames his way, I believe in the unity of knowledge. And I think there are so many things outside of economics that people have to wait. Psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, and now we're getting new thing. Neuropsychology. Well, well, yeah, these, the what separates us is it interpretation of human nature and about the importance of the individual and the state things that are, and that's why, although I think we are both scientists and agree on some facts, it's the interpretation that different gene Fama is one of the most successful stock market predictors in the world. He misinterprets, he says I'm his, he has dimensional fund advisors, which is, can I say this? Managing $350 billion.

Speaker 7:          10:30          Huge Fun. Why is he so why did these people come to him? Because he can predict the market, not perfectly, but well enough yet to outperform many other f Eric and he's [inaudible] to me is a science who knows how to predict the murder. He just won't admit it. Well now you've brought up the subject of money. So let me, let me, let me explain. I've made a fortune out of predicting what will my students crisis and they've been kind enough to come with me. Handsome wafer professor should have that. His theories, right, but it's not psychology. He can hate me. I explain it.

Speaker 10:         11:11          Oh, what this company does is it, it, it uh, forms portfolios. They concentrate on particular kinds of risks. So it's well understood that stocks are riskier than bonds. So if I phone or portfolio of stocks, I can predict it in the long term that will out likely outperform bonds. In that sense, the market is predictable. That's what he's saying. Okay. But I don't think you can, you can predict whether the stock market is going to do something, but that's a different story.

Speaker 1:          11:38          I mean, there's a lot of debate here about economic students, particularly in the UK. We've got this debate wanting to be engaged in policy debates. We have one, a professor of economics at London University who said, you know, my students are flipping the pages of best sellers in economics. They want to get involved in policy debates. They're not happy with what they're getting in class because they feel they know better equipped to interpret what's going on. Then students of archeology for instance. Do you believe it is your role as professors of economics to teach your undergraduates in your postgraduates how to better understand the world of finance? Well I absolutely, yeah. I think Jane and I are actually similar in that weird real world oriented and Jean, although his, you wouldn't know it. Listening to him, he's had a huge impact on the way finances practice and it's very helpful. He's done a lot. Very generous isn't to your fellow nor yet.

Speaker 1:          12:36          I didn't use often that you get to at Psu who'd been awarded the prize but a different interpretation and yet one is still very generous like that in a, in his comments. Students, I want to ask you, I know you want students of signs, but does any of this resonate with you in terms of the kinds of lessons that your getting from your professors? Do you feel that it equips you to understand what's going on in the wild, in your own particular disciplines? Any comments, fees? In the students? Yes. I think there's a comment here.

Speaker 11:         13:05          As a physicist, a undergraduate student, we are taught to analyze data in a real world environment, uh, famous experiments and around the world, like the large Hadron collider in Geneva. So I definitely think that, uh, our, uh, our schooling and education applies to larger big world pictures for sure.

Speaker 1:          13:23          Okay. Other comments on this point? I think there's a lady here. I, I'm not a economics in economics either. I'm a neuroscientist, but we're taught to problem solve and think critically and that should help in solving many problems that we're faced with. Thank you. I think there's one more just, yeah, yeah. I'm also a science student and I really think I've learned in the last year on my master or eh, the caters real tries us to think critically and understand the world, but you also understand after five years that is really complex. Okay, thank you. Well, um, I think that kind of sets the scene a little bit forwards to move into the, um, into the scientists and, um, there's an underlying theme here. Do you, should you as scientists teach the kinds of signs that will help us address, you know, the big problems of the day, Jim Raffman, by equipping students with the skills of rigorous analytical thinking, of taking a problem, breaking it down to component parts, asking which parts are are, are solvable, which ones can't be solved today, and then directing you referred appropriately. That way of thinking can be, it is the basis for solving problems of any kind, whether they're of immediate import or whether they're problems we don't even know about today. That's what an education is. That what you're saying is, as you said in your speech when you received the Nobel prize, it's a curiosity driven research. It's not research that's driven solving a specific problem. It's [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          14:53          basically can never predict, and I think we all agree on this, they could almost never predict where something will lead in all of our work. There are examples of basic science that we've achieved in our laboratory, in our theoretical work that have applications that one couldn't have imagined in my own work. Uh, what I did was a very basic problem in how proteins are transported in yeast cells, which turns out having application and liver cancer and ways that I couldn't have imagined.

Speaker 1:          15:20          Yeah. But I mean, your research or medicine or physiology helps us with the knowledge of a huge range of illnesses, diabetes, brain disorders. But I should also say botox. I mean, Botox obviously it has a magical purpose because it helps people with that.

Speaker 5:          15:35          As I said in my remarks last night, my colleagues, Rothman and sit half figured out how nerve cells communicate with one another. It turns out that, uh, botulism the disease, uh, works by producing a toxin that, uh, inactivates protein molecules that they worked on. And then that, that has applications in a lot of things. Cosmetic word, uh, or neuromuscular disease. No, I have not used it myself, but I don't think I need it just yet. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         16:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:10          Next to Terry, professor check, like, I think we want to go to one of our students here. A question about physics.

Speaker 13:         16:17          Yes, I am from the Royal Institute of Technology. And that was wondering what do you think? Yeah. Or what kinds of technological applications do you think will come from the discovery of the Higgs Boson?

Speaker 1:          16:28          It, let's go to prosser. Professor Peter Higgs. Yes. Okay.

Speaker 3:          16:31          I don't know of any applications. You're, you're asking about how you would make you to have something which has been discovered, which, uh, you, you have to put, you have to go to a lot of energy into the making obit and then it lasts for an extremely short time. Uh, how, how can you do, do anything useful with, with that? It's true.

Speaker 3:          17:00          Uh, it, it's true that, uh, politicals which have been discovered previously, some of them have applications in medicine for example, but they're relatively long lived particles by our person's standards. Uh, things which even when they were addressed, maybe lost about a micro second. And if you, if you make the move fast and relatively t tells you that they'll last longer and you can make beams and you can use them in, in a cancer therapy and that sort of thing. Well that's okay for that kind of political, but, but when you exploring this extremely high energy range where the things you produce just don't last very long, it's hard to how you could

Speaker 2:          17:50          actually control them and hears them.

Speaker 1:          17:52          Okay. Professor on glow, you shared the prize with, with Professor Higgs for the physics, for the theory that explains why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. I want to be frank with you. I want to ask you, the student, they're mentioned the fact that it's called the higgs based on theory. Everybody says including Professor Higgs, that it should more accurately be known as the b e h particle. The Robert Route who is unfortunately was not able to receive the prize because he died, but it should be known as the Brown on glare. Higgs particle. Does it annoy you that it's known as the Higgs Particle?

Speaker 2:          18:27          No.

Speaker 9:          18:29          You did what? You did my miles. Can you this question?

Speaker 2:          18:36          Okay. Put the wrinkles, but I am not. The way you want to solve this. Um, I've got was, it annoys me just because it's not the public of the whole, the so called his mom was on the chairs first not being introduced by age. That's one thing. Although I have a complete admiration for his work, uh, what should put things right, but the media have a role in calling it, well particular the Anglo Saxon fuse is sometime physics was kind of Taco game know due to poor mode for even sun. That's how also money things in bulk, right. The, the contribution of English is important. Sorry. But, and they have another teams, right? They detect the particular. Okay. And uh, so, uh, I guess one sentence since on their detection and they're quite tight and they need money for that. When I professor [inaudible] haven't paid because I didn't answer your question.

Speaker 9:          20:10          I thought you were on,

Speaker 2:          20:12          no, no. Okay. I think they have been many b, which are played the whole before the theory was remade and people who have made things after the theory is made and as usual, this is complete nonsense to give the name of a person, any person in a group setting, if it's not the right one, it's it. But, uh, I think it's reasonable to give all the particle a letter and personally. Okay. All right. But

Speaker 1:          20:48          I would propose that letter the age.

Speaker 9:          20:52          Ah,

Speaker 1:          20:57          what do you think? And then that final suggestion, take your name off Higgs Boson and just call it the letter h h theory. Anyway, your response.

Speaker 3:          21:05          I would be very happy with that solution because the person's situation embarrasses me. Uh, I think, yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:11          Why does it embarrass you?

Speaker 3:          21:13          Well, because it's, it's, it's come about so accidentally. It's not a, not a recognition of, of, uh, but I, I, I, I was any sort of special, uh, personal in this is story though. There were many people involved as far as wise as I said. And it's, it's, it's, it's so happened that my name has been attached to it for a number of accidental reasons. Uh, and uh, that's unfair to the other people involved. I'd like to make a distinction between the particle and what is called the mechanism, which is how to, how would you get mass rather particles. Uh, I'm, I'm happy with the solution which is now becoming common in particle physics world to call it the b h mechanism. And that's to me the, the, the really the important part of the Siri, uh, the, the particle, it's soul should not carry anybody's name and the solution of giving it the letter h because in the past my name has been attached or it is, is a good one. But the,

Speaker 1:          22:22          okay, well we'll leave, we'll leave that particular exchange there and um, the student, next time you ask your question, be careful what you call it was very, that's what I'm saying. It will be professor Thomas Uhthoff. You, you have one of the joint winners of the medicine physiology prize. I just want to ask you what you think about the application of your particular theories. Does it matter to you that your discoveries for your work on um, vesicles and I won't go into too much, but they kind of are an act as the cells, internal shipping, um, service or postman, they can send materials around the settle can even fuse with its outer surface. But how important was it for you when you were doing your research that this would actually help perhaps save lives?

Speaker 6:          23:10          Uh, I was afraid you were going to ask me about the Hicks puzzle. I think in a common theme in science is we do science best we made on have an application in mind because of the limits, our imagination and creativity. But in the end we feel mostly watered when what we discover out of a quest for knowledge leads actually to an application. And so what I do, and I think what my fellow laureates too, I think it's extremely important for us to find that, I wouldn't call it an accident, but serendipity, what we do actually is useful.

Speaker 1:          23:54          Is it, is it a motivating factor for all of you in your research or do you just see it as a bonus

Speaker 8:          24:01          professor level? What I would say is that, uh, and to use an economic inc similarly here, this is that a research that is longer term is much, much larger pay off. And in some senses I think that this sort of fits into what, uh, when you were saying you don't want to think about solving tomorrow's problems today, you want to solve about problems that haven't even been designed yet and then you'll have a massive impact. And I think this is a very critical thing because we are increasingly wanting to solve short term problems. And I think it is perhaps high energy physics doesn't have a very direct practical application, but it's really hard to imagine the applications that are going to come up.

Speaker 1:          24:45          Yeah. The long views and I mean the, these gentle recognize decades later from the work they actually did. I mean James Rothman just picking up this point about research and the long view and so on. I mean, would you be happy if you are a young scientist starting out today trying to embark on some research which needed funding?

Speaker 14:         25:01          Well, I'd be very happy if I was a young scientist. I wouldn't be an old science, but, uh, you know, uh, I think it, we're, we're in a very challenging era before for the very reasons that we heard a moment ago from, from Michael. There's an increasingly, uh, increasing effort on the short term short term success and it causes young scientists to take less in the way of risk and to do more research. That's more incremental small step here, a small step, they're more likely to reap a short term reward. But, uh, those of us around the table today, I think each in our own way, we're taking on problems that were very challenging in our time quite some time ago.

Speaker 6:          25:46          We all feel an enormous increase in pressure from public institutions or rather from politicians and the public foundations, patient advocates, whatever, to do science that will lead to tangible results tomorrow. Sure. This cure that now and in my view that never works because you can't cure something you don't understand and our case physiology on dre or medicine Professor Rochelle,

Speaker 4:          26:14          Samuel first try to solve problems which are really difficult like how enzyme work Indo case, what is the mass in the universe and eventually some of the solutions has application in lily to your question, what is missing in all of this is teaching politicians in the university, people who will become politician to understand some concepts in science. So in the future they will be able to do better. Making

Speaker 1:          26:44          this is this is something important that we all should be better educated in science by examination.

Speaker 8:          26:54          It seems to me that I don't know if this is necessary because I can go require a very narrow minded politician to say that size hadn't had a massive effect on everything we do over the last hundred years. It seems to me that the general, you know, maybe none targeted investment in science that we've had at say, let's just say since the Second World War has paid off, unbelievably the living standard, you know, maybe that's where we have so many people on earth, but it's all part of the success of science. So it seems to me that we don't have to justify every little

Speaker 1:          27:24          12 point that Professor Walsh and made about, um, might suppose you're basically saying scientific illiteracy, but people need to be better educated, public politicians. I mean, it's scientific illiteracy, more acceptable than other forms of relief.

Speaker 8:          27:36          I have thought about that a lot. If I said, uh, oh Shakespeare, who cares about him? You don't think my God. But if somebody says a billion, a million, what difference does it make? You know, that's a pretty big error.

Speaker 5:          27:46          People need to learn much more statistically. I know, I think there is a check when, and then she has a tremendous ignorance of science in the u s which unfortunately is fostered by the political process right now. We have, uh, uh, a great deal of disbelief. It basic scientific principles in the United States that drives the, uh, politics. There's a dismissal of evolution. There's a disbelief in climate change, in spite of the overwhelming evidence. So w w we have to do a better job. It used to be that the government, you know, I've been the beneficiary of this, we have all been the beneficiary of an investment in science starting with, uh, the end of World War II with the sputnik era in the United States. It was enormous investment. It's science, science education that's diminished particularly in the public.

Speaker 1:          28:31          So it's not happening now. You don't think science is getting funding sufficient,

Speaker 5:          28:35          not enough. And, and, and then what, what is funded is being managed more, much more so than it used to be. I said Shit. Huh?

Speaker 7:          28:42          As an economist, I would like to point out that scientific research provides a public good that benefits the entire world. So one country, let's take Sweden. Politicians here would rationally think, why should we pay for it? The rest of the world will do it anyway. If we pay 1 million kroner for some research project, only a tiny part of that will benefit Sweden. It'll go all over the world. So part of the defense of scientific research has to be a cosmopolitan publix,

Speaker 1:          29:15          what professor said have said, which is that you scientists have to communicate better with the public and politicians about what it is you are doing. But we have a question I think from one of the students here about this subject. Yup. Ricard the Gui, the Karolinska Institute. So I wonder if you think that, do scientists communicate bad leaders science? How do we avoid the misunderstanding and gain a better presence on public debates on this point of communication? Uh, professor farmer economists obviously is, is not a pure science, your social scientists, but you are asked to comment every hour, every day of the week because of the financial crisis and so on. Do you think you make a good job of communicating with the public?

Speaker 8:          29:56          I don't think we make it clear and distinguishing between the things we know based on research that had been done and opinions that we have based on our own interpretation of things. I don't think we do a good job on that. I think too many economists are willing to talk too much about things that they really don't know a lot about. Um, I try to avoid that immature mentality successful. Uh,

Speaker 1:          30:21          and they do lots of media interviews yourself, asked to predict what is going on. And so we're actually, before he got the Nobel prize and nobody was much interested in me, then afterward they became interested in, I said I didn't change. I'm still a dumb guy. You thought I was two months ago. Professor Sheila, you do interact a lot with apartment. You've written books which are supposed to be accessing if a student as it's on that you write books, which is supposed to be accessible to even people who haven't started economics. What's your view on how economists communicate with the public? But I think that economists have been too much in the science model of writing. Concise, Short. I mean there's some of that is good concise, short journal articles that make a very narrow but frontier contribution that we model ourselves after a physics particularly I think.

Speaker 1:          31:12          But I think there's an older, a different tradition that's also valuable and that is writing books that draw together theory and practice and the, and the profession tends to, if you say, I've written a book that is rare, they think, oh that's a, they call it a popular realization, but I don't think that some of these books that are, why are they red, are popular realizations at all there. Their synthesis that can operate at a level of an ordinary intelligence. She's online as well. You provide lectures. Yeah, you can take my car, but you also provide lectures online.

Speaker 8:          31:54          I think that, uh, in the last say 50 years, communication has undergone an incredible revolution. And at the time when, you know, facebook has been phased out for twitter, which has been phased out for a snapshot or whatever, it seems to me that the only way we can communicate thing is not to communicate with people in their forties, even if the way is the community. It was people in their teens and early twenties. And it seems to me that everyone here should be on facebook

Speaker 1:          32:26          freely accessible to non students as students ever won a science. Let's just, um, get some feedback here. Who thinks that scientists do a good job of communicating with the public and I see people their hands up who thinks, does scientists do a good job of communicating with the public? Do you think scientists do a bad job of communicating with the public

Speaker 6:          32:49          mine

Speaker 1:          32:50          who thinks that these Nobel laureates have been doing a good job of communicating it? So know you've got a good, you got a good response to that. I just asked you whether you feel that sometimes scientists are running ahead of what society both understands and thinks is acceptable and without going into various examples here, it's really a question about the potential misuse of your discoveries or a potential lack of understanding of what your discoveries may bring about. I mean, there are so many examples. I'm thinking of the Belgian geneticist who, who brought about gm who says that Professor Montague, Mark Van Montague, who says that society fears science because it upsets the traditional way of living. Do any of you worry at night about how your various discoveries may be misused in the future?

Speaker 6:          33:42          Sure.

Speaker 2:          33:45          To turn the question just a bit, I think there is an overselling our part sometimes of what science can do and just use an example, the war on cancer in the 1970s under President Nixon real, it really wasn't, it wasn't an enormous investment. A lot of science was done, but cancer was not cured. We shouldn't over promise what we can deliver.

Speaker 6:          34:08          Is there overhype professor said hop on the part of scientists. Absolutely. I think that communicating with the public, that's probably one of the biggest mistakes we are scientists have made because we haven't communicated the magnitude of the challenge. We haven't communicate how difficult it is. For example, don't understand a cancer cell or to understand the brain and people expect us to solve this and to have solutions tomorrow and that's our fault. Why do you think that happens? Because we claim to make discoveries as a community that aren't there.

Speaker 1:          34:41          And do you think you're asked the wrong questions sometimes or pushed into saying things you shouldn't say by the media? There's no doubt about that. It's blaming the media again. Absolutely. No question.

Speaker 2:          34:54          Yeah. I think one of the DP guilty, the communication of tides is the basic education to begin with. Do you see either sense? Maybe you can try to give a vague idea to, uh, to people about how they can be cured about some cancer. Then they may understand something, right? But if you try to explain something which is deeper, I don't want to make a deeper, I mean basic far right, which is the, then they don't have any mathematical basis to understand this. And the difficulty comes already from the first year.

Speaker 1:          35:44          No, I said at the start that you are all gentlemen. Obviously Alice Munro won the prize for literature and one of the chemistry laureates, Martin Karplus can't be with us, but obviously another man. What is it about science and women check when Michael Levitt?

Speaker 2:          36:01          I think the problem is with the age group of the gentleman here. Uh, we, we all did our work. I mean, the work that I was credited for, I did as an assistant professor. That was back at a time when there were few women. In fact, there were no women in my department. There are many more women that we hire now. So, uh, I look forward to in 30 years, you'll still be just as young interviewing, uh, uh, a number of women. I like you and still no botox, Professor Higgs, lack of women. Well

Speaker 3:          36:26          and my kind of physics, there are interesting differences between different countries, at least at least within Europe. Um, until I went to Italy, I think my prejudice would have been that the, uh, the, the southern Catholic countries, we're less likely to have women scientists in the northern mostly Protestant countries because of the attitudes of the Catholic Church to what women ought to be doing. It isn't. So it's the other way round. Uh, it's, it's Italy which has the largest proportion of women in physics and the northern countries do rather badly by comparison.

Speaker 1:          37:14          That's a very interesting point you raise there professor higgs because Sweden, which is famous for its very efficient and effective childcare system actually has a very low number of professors right across the board. Not only in science, it's only about 21%. Since we have some students from here, universities in Sweden. What do you think about this gender is to, uh, I would like to comment on what Professor Haig said that religion has some impact on this. And I think in earlier generation, the head nowadays, we can look at this room is full of women. We are gaining power and we are starting to do science, but we still have to take a lot of risks and to do a lot of difficult choices. For example, I had to move from my country because the maternity's and s and those problems in my country, there's still problematic. That's why I moved to northern country. Which country? You are from? Portugal. Portuguese. Okay. Another person, another science student.

Speaker 15:         38:12          I'm in a social sciences which is full of women and in the social worker who was this even more women and still in Sweden we have men that are on the top of the Eh, the top positions in both society and science, so that must reflect something. Even when there is basically all the women in the field,

Speaker 16:         38:37          usually what you do, you have kids as a male and the female and accepts the pregnancy, which usually people are only way maybe for a few weeks. The kids is something you get together and say if it's a female problem, you should also be a main problem.

Speaker 9:          38:56          Right?

Speaker 1:          38:57          Student? Yes. I see somebody there. Yes. Thank you.

Speaker 17:         39:01          Phd Student and molecular biology. There are a lot of women in science now as someone else's plan it out. And I don't think that there are less opportunities for women in science. I think that if you want to have a family and a career, that's your choice. And I think that there are many examples of successful women's science. Science has to, I've made it happen. Maybe not sitting at the table today, but maybe they'll be sat at the table in the future. And I, I think that the future have, will reflect that. But I think that the opportunities are there,

Speaker 1:          39:28          but that's around you shut your not only concerned about encouraging women to study science, you want to ensure that everyone from all walks of life can have access to a university.

Speaker 5:          39:38          I'm very, I'm very concerned about public higher education. That may not be as much an issue in Sweden, but in the United States, the individual states have decreased their support, supportive public, higher education, particularly. Uh, there's virtually an inverse relationship between the funding of prisons in the United States and the funding of public higher education. And I think this has been much to the detriment of the middle class who wouldn't necessarily have that in large numbers, have access to the elite institutions that are represented around this table. You disappointed, very disappointed. And I, I came from a middle class family. I could work a summer job and pay for the whole year, uh, room board books that that is no longer possible. That's, I think that is, uh, that is, has damaged access to, uh, to the, the highest reaches of science at least in the United States.

Speaker 1:          40:31          Anybody else on this issue of access in the UK? Professor next, we have a similar debate about it.

Speaker 3:          40:37          Similar situation where, where, I mean my generation, a lot of public funding going to universities and, and there's a generation of, of academics, not just in science but other fields who, who, who came from all kinds of social backgrounds. But now it's been made much more difficult by the present policies, policies of introducing fees and uh, people from poor backgrounds or simply deterred from trying.

Speaker 1:          41:13          Are you worried that actually this crisis in funding some countries is going to jeopardize their future as being centers of excellence where you can get the kind of people like q who come up with the discoveries and just think about the fact that as far as I understand sociological studies suggest that social mobility

Speaker 6:          41:34          in the United States is now lower than Europe and that sort of puts it on. So we always used to be that social mobility look at me and man, uh, in the United States was better than a New York and now it's the opposite

Speaker 1:          41:47          center of excellence is going to move back to move back to Europe as well as that's possible. But I hope that we'll move to Asia. Asia you're already is. Yeah.

Speaker 14:         41:58          Moving away from the United States, not black and white, you know, but integrated way where it comes back to research support, it comes down to public education. It comes down to a v a value system of, of uh, immediacy versus a longer term view. And a and I think it going to, well I think in part it's a lot, a lot of it has gone already to Europe. Europe had a tremendous task of rebuilding after World War II. Uh, that's largely done in the sciences, especially China. China is it, you know in Asia are very hungry to be major players but they tend to be still quite short term focus. The China thinks in five year plans, it's a 50 year plan. If it's a plant, any kind of a plan at all, it's more like an intent.

Speaker 1:          42:46          And do you think there are certain cultures that better encourage free thinking, the blue skies thinking that brings about the great discoveries.

Speaker 7:          42:54          I was thinking that the United States had a more public spirit after World War II then it does now. The Marshall Plan is an example of something that happened to then that was an aid program to Europe. It wouldn't happen now. And that the, the, the climbing support for education is another example of that. I wanted to remind us that we are here at the legacy of Alfred Nobel who had a tremendous public spirit and that's one reason why the Nobel prize is a renewed inspiration.

Speaker 1:          43:26          Talking about access, you now have access to the air of the powerful in the world. Are you going to be using this new found recognition that you have to put forward the case that you'd be making about greater access or any other issue? I'll come to you, professor love it

Speaker 8:          43:46          for, I think it's really important to have an issue after getting the Nobel prize. You have to do something with the rest of your life and besides science with it, I'll continue to do. I think an issue for me that is really, really worrying is that the the youth to be people who have positions between the ages of 20 and 40 and that whole generation is slowly disappearing. It's becoming very hard to become an independent scientist. If you're younger than 40 and you know, 30 or 40 years ago, you could be in your early twenties. I think that this is can be explained in many ways sociologically, but I think that it's as if you have another one when you're finished university here instead of getting a position in five years, it can take 15 years. And I think this is a huge waste of talent

Speaker 1:          44:28          because we see, um, talent, young town bringing up things like facebook, you know, you'd have to drop out of college even, you know, to have found Microsoft, apple, Google, facebook, Yahoo, not a good sign.

Speaker 2:          44:41          It's a general society problem and economic problem that things, uh, more and more seeing the possibility of funding students to help them to go [inaudible] in Belgium, but it's very difficult otherwise. Okay.

Speaker 1:          45:03          Very briefly, anybody got any idea about how they're going to be using the new influenced as a Nobel laureate to in some way better the world? Not only as a scientist but beyond the realm of science? Professor Marshall, did you have your hand up? I will find it out eventually. Professor Fama and I'm going to continue to do what I've been doing. My, my, my simple attitude is everything that creates economic output adds to humanity. My plumber is perhaps as important as I am. I wish I had a good one, but you may not. This one may not be as important as mine, but everybody that contributes something to output makes everybody else bigger, better, better off. So I'm good at what I do. Why would I try to do something I'm not good at good at? I think I can make the world better if I continue what I'm doing.

Speaker 1:          45:56          Eugene Fama, thank you very much and didn't gentlemen. Thank you all very much. Well that brings this exclusive program to an end. We've heard what this year's Nobel laureates have to say about the role of science and Economics in today's society. We've also heard from the students here from Sweden, um, about what they think the road of science should also be. Who knows there may be a future Nobel Prize winner amongst you all. Thank you to the family and friends of the lawyer, to the lawyer. It's themselves, of course, to you, wherever you are for watching this program from me. Zainab [inaudible]. We're here in the concert hall in Stockholm. Goodbye.
