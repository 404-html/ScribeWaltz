Speaker 1:          00:05          The 2016 film passengers was advertised as a high concept science fiction blockbuster about a romance in space. Based on that, I was excited to see it. Unfortunately, the central premise doesn't make for a very good love story. In fact, it has much more in common with a horror film.

Speaker 1:          00:34          Jim is a passenger, a board, a star ship, making the long journey to another planet when a malfunction wakes him from hibernation too early and where are we? We are in transit from Earth to homestead to we will arrive in approximately 90 years. Wow. It seems he's destined to live and die alone on the ship before anyone else wakes up trapped by his circumstances. Jim starts obsessing over another sleeping passenger named Aurora intent on pursuing a romantic relationship. Jim Sabotage has her hibernation pod and makes it look like an accident from Aurora's perspective. This is a story about a strange man who imprisons her alone with him in space forever. This stranger robs her of her life, her future, and her self determination. And yet because this movie is supposed to be a love story, how audiences are meant to feel sympathetic to Jim and root for the relationship to work out the films. Science fiction setting tends to obscure the fact that passengers is an example of a very old and deeply troubling media convention. Abduction as romance. Abduction is romances, immediate trope where a man kidnaps were in prisons, a woman, and then she eventually falls in love with him. Like a lot of storytelling conventions, abduction as a romance isn't new. It can be traced all the way back to ancient literature and it was a favorite plot device in classic Hollywood. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:30          they must

Speaker 1:          02:30          be terribly in love. I want you to make me angry. I always knew where you were. A nasty, vulgar role. In some versions of the trope, men abduct women for the purpose of finding love. Courtship I a little more strenuous than I like it, but in most cases the woman is kidnapped for some other reason and the romance only blossoms after she's forced to spend time with her. Abductor. If you try and move our climb off the bed,

Speaker 3:          03:00          I'll know I'll feel it and I promise you are

Speaker 1:          03:05          the kidnapping or hostage situation itself. Maybe short lived waste, sunny and their romance may not have a happy ending, but the abductor is always framed as a decent guy in the end. It can be a pretty likable guy and I'm not pointing a gun at somebody I know. Don't believe me, but it's true. You've got to trust me. The plot device is especially popular with screenwriters because kidnapping scenarios provide a quick and easy way to bring two unlikely characters together. May I just say in advance that I am sorry. Sorry for walks. Now, if I'm not mistaken, this means you have to come with me but make no mistake. These are narratives in which men who violate women's rights and autonomy are then rewarded with a romantic relationship

Speaker 4:          03:59          who don't like to be pushed any bread and last June and drug into buses in the middle of the night.

Speaker 1:          04:06          Abduction is romance can be found in all kinds of media including romance films and comedies. Well, I'm asking you, I can't believe this is happening. This is not a joke anymore. I'm thinking that flute called kidnapping if you want to be rude. And even in classic musicals like seven brides for seven brothers.

Speaker 5:          04:27          Oh, they acted angry and annoyed, but secretly they was all her joy by Oh that when corral and yours,

Speaker 1:          04:40          but it's especially popular in action adventures, genres, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis Star in three separate movies each where they have romantic relationships with the women they've kidnapped.

Speaker 4:          04:54          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:55          we see this with Swarts and niggers characters in the running man. I break your neck like a chicken and then again in commando getting the call and then again to his own wife. In true lies, Bruce Willis has characters hold their love interests hostage and bandits in the critically acclaimed film, 12 monkeys and then more recently in red audiences are meant to view the danger that these men pose has an essential part of what makes them exciting and attractive. These are men of action. They take control and take what they want and in the car with violence if necessary. Now you'll notice that with very few exceptions, these kidnappers are white men.

Speaker 1:          05:57          Ho mainstream western audiences tend to give violent white guys the benefit of the doubt to keep your hands high Pothier while rarely extending that same level of sympathy to men of color. In similar situations, which I know everybody on the floor don't kill me, like most media tropes, there are variations on the theme. There's the accidental kidnapping that later becomes a real one. Keep your head, turn your legs all the time. There's the clueless criminal who doesn't know what he's doing. You're the worst kidnapper I've ever met. I'm trying to do my best it under really difficult circumstances, and then there's the Hitman who falls for his mark. But the underlying pattern in all of these abduction as romance narratives revolves around men exercising complete control over women.

Speaker 3:          06:55          Come on please.

Speaker 1:          06:58          A theme that's reinforced by the inclusion of scenes where I'm man forcibly puts an otherwise independent woman in her place.

Speaker 6:          07:06          I learned a long time ago, my lady never trust a mountain catch when she stops snowing. Never Trust a woman when your back is turned.

Speaker 1:          07:14          Indeed the abducted women are rarely portrayed as passive. Damsels.

Speaker 3:          07:20          Are you picking me for a ride? You're not going to move and you're going to keep your trap shut or I'll let you have cheap. I always thought the day you've got a stupid,

Speaker 1:          07:31          even though these women are written to be Feisty, oh, they're often framed as being a little too feisty for their own good to be a little too feisty for your own good, which provides our kidnapper the opportunity to assert his power and control. Am I go sound? Do you understand by aggressively silencing her by anyone that likes the food when they are not alone? No. Oh. Oh. Audiences are treated the scene after scene fetishizing the domination and disempowerment of women. If she tries to turn the tables on her abductor, he remains unfazed and her attempts to intimidate him don't work.

Speaker 6:          08:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:14          In some cases, when he reasserts his control by disarming her, it's framed as an act of seduction.

Speaker 1:          08:23          No kidnapping and false imprisonment are almost universally understood to be reprehensible crimes. And because of that, abduction is widely regarded as an act of villainy and definitely not something the good guy would do. This means that screenwriters need to find some way to make the kidnapper into a sympathetic character. Hey, okay. One way this is done is by giving the abductor a moment of basic human decency. It can be as simple as offering his hostage something to eat or drink, drink, or maybe allowing her to go to the bathroom. I need a little help or not sexually assaulting her. We tell you something, even though I haven't a bit lately, I'm gonna Force myself on. You. Never done that in my life. I'm not. No kidding. Come Howard from the calm of just trying to explain to you that there's no sexual motives for my actions. That's an impressively low bar for men when it comes to being seen as a nice guy. You seem like a nice guy. You're not like the others. You have to do what's right for you. Another way. The abductor is reframed as heroic is by juxtaposing his violence against the actions of even more violent men.

Speaker 3:          09:43          Other the bad guys. Worse guys hold my neck.

Speaker 1:          09:51          Writers also attempt to justify the kidnapping itself by framing it as necessary. No, no problem with it either as something done for the greater good, like saving the world or is something done for the victims owned good, usually saving her life in some way. Just let me go safe not safe. That variation is so common that there's a whole sub category of movies in which a heroic rescue doubles as a kidnapping. To illustrate how these rescue slash kidnapping scenarios work, let's analyze the brief abduction from the original 1984 terminator movie. Kyle Reese travels back in time and save Sarah Connor from the terminator, but during the getaway, he makes it aggressively clear that his help is not

Speaker 3:          10:44          optional. Do exactly what I say exactly. I don't move unless I say, don't make a sound in this. I say, do you understand? Do you understand? Please do. You told her.

Speaker 1:          10:58          Notice that in stories like this, the man typically holds all the cards. He alone understands the true danger that she's in and he alone knows how to survive. Then you are from the future too. Is that right? Right. The insidious thing about scenes like this one is that they're written to twist a man's abusive behavior into a heroic act of love. Just listen. Understand that terminator is out there and it absolutely will not stop ever chill. You are dead. The narrative is specifically designed so that we as the audience will view Kyle's aggression towards Sarah as both a reasonable and necessary. Can you stop it? The storytelling trick here, okay. To set up an elaborate scenario in which a woman's perfectly reasonable and rational resistance to male violence seems like a naive mistake and that framing is not accidental. It's a specific kind of male fantasy where a man taking away a woman's freedom and fundamental rights. He was presented as something done for her own good, which results in situations where she becomes dependent on her abductor for survival. Just so you understand right now out there on your own. Your life expectancy is like with me, without me here with me, without me, with me, without one of the worst examples of this. Abduction for her own good framing can be found in the movie version of V for Victor Data.

Speaker 1:          12:44          Our hero kidnaps Evy, makes her believe that she's been caught by the fascist government and proceeds to torture her mercilessly. It's whenever you want, just tell us where he is. These abhorring actions are framed as necessary because it's only through being tortured for days on end that Evie learns how to be strong. Not only does she forgive him for torturing her, she thanks him for it and then the to go on to share a series of romantic moments.

Speaker 7:          13:23          I always sample a bottle of wine before I buy it. Let's have a sip if you're worth taking along.

Speaker 1:          13:30          Let's not mince words here. Abduction as romance is an abuse trip. All of the male characters that we've been discussing engage in what domestic violence prevention organizations describe as red flag behaviors cures. So I think it's instructive to quickly go over a few of them in detail. Physical force abusers will resort to the use of force strand conflicts. This can include restraining or holding down their partner. These actions are often accompanied by demands that the victim shut your mouth. Threats of violence abusers will threaten their partners with violence as a means of coercion rock and bring it down on your head so hard that a substance resembling guacamole is going to come out of your ears. Controlling behavior. Abusers will attempt to control or restrict their partner's movements and to make decisions for them. Let's go now. This is usually done under the guise of protection and finally the one that's most central to the abduction. As Romance trope isolation abusers will try to isolate the victim from friends, family, or even the outside world. This often includes restricting the use of communication devices. Each of these actions is considered a red flag for an abusive relationship. And most of the male characters in abduction as romance movies check off several of these boxes.

Speaker 1:          15:19          Even the less explicitly violent abductors like Jim from passengers still isolate and control their vision.

Speaker 2:          15:26          Dennis,

Speaker 1:          15:34          regardless of the intentions of the writers, these narratives end up both excusing and romanticizing the violent behavior of abusive men. No discussion of abduction as romance would be complete without mention of beauty and the beast, especially the two enormously popular Disney movies, both of which include a version of this trope. The beast holds the life of Belle's father in his hands and in order to save him, Doug Bell trades away her own freedom and agree is to be in prison forever in the beast's castle. Now pop criticism of beauty and the beast often focuses on something called Stockholm syndrome, which is a psychological phenomenon where in a kidnapping victim comes to sympathize with their kidnapper. However, it's not part of how I'm defining the abduction as romance trope. And that's because of focus on Stockholm Syndrome tends to shift the blame away from the perpetrator and onto the victim, which then works to undermine the female character by implying she's been brainwashed.

Speaker 1:          16:43          As I mentioned before, many of the abducted or imprisoned women in these movies are actually shown to be quite brave, especially given their perilous situations. Many of them tried to escape and some succeed, but regardless the victim and her motivations are not the problem with this trope. The problem stems entirely from the abductor and his actions. After all, it's the beast who in prisons, Bell isolates her verbally, berates her and even for bids her from eating at month I tall. Despite all of this abusive behavior, the beast is still framed as a misunderstood nice guy and he still gets the girl in the end. Story is like this, carry with them some insidious messages about men and masculinity. Chief among them is the idea that abusive men just need to meet the right woman, someone so special that the promise of her love will magically cure him of his violent ways and make him a better person. Now it is possible to read these stories as being about the forgiveness and redemption of troubled men, which in some ways they are. Unfortunately, these redemption arks play out in ways that end up reinforcing some very pernicious myths about domestic abuse. Abusive men don't suddenly change overnight, especially not after a lifetime of it

Speaker 2:          18:25          being a dick.

Speaker 1:          18:28          Men with a history of violent behavior don't spare their loved ones. On the contrary, domestic violence statistics show that intimate partners and family members bear the brunt of their tanks. In the movies. We're usually expected to assume that these abduction romances we'll end happily ever after.

Speaker 2:          18:51          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          18:51          but in the real world, love affairs like this would likely lead to abusive relationships. This is because the strongest predictor of domestic violence is previous acts of abuse. In fact, men with a history of committing violence against women are 13 times more likely to repeat that behavior in the future. Psychologists refer to these patterns of repeat behavior as the cycle of abuse. Once an abusive episodes stops, it's often followed by a honeymoon phase where the abuser will show remorse, promise not to do it again, and then acting kind, even loving ways for a while at least. But inevitably that will be followed by a tension building phase, which then culminates in another abusive episode.

Speaker 8:          19:46          She'll keep you more time. I show keep you on responding to my patient. Your hatred will kill Linda for that day. Dawns folk shows

Speaker 1:          20:03          and the cycle continues. The first step in breaking the cycle is often for the survivor to get away from the abuser. Now, it is possible for violent men to change their pattern of behavior, although it's an extremely difficult process requiring years of therapy, but that's rarely how it happens in Hollywood. In the movies we've been talking about, abusive men are miraculously transformed by finding true love and they gain forgiveness for their crimes through a single act of heroism. This means they're never really held accountable for the harm they've inflicted on.

Speaker 2:          20:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:49          Real redemption requires taking responsibility for your actions. It requires doing the slow, often painful work of self transformation. The bottom line is it's not possible to fix violent men by loving them in exactly the right way, but that's the idea at the heart of the abduction is romance trope. It's the kind of twisted Hollywood logic that can lead people of all genders to remain in abusive relationship.

Speaker 2:          21:21          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:22          The abduction as romance Trobe needs to be retired onscreen relationships can bloom from any number of dramatic or exciting scenarios. There really is no reason for writers to continue romanticizing abusive male behavior.
