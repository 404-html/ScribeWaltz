Speaker 1:          00:09          The last jedi is a movie that's designed to subvert audience expectations.

Speaker 1:          00:18          Nowhere is this more evident than in the way the film handles. It's three male heroes, x wing pilot Po Damron when the gates to him, Trooper Finn and legendary Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker. Initially, all three characters seem like they should fit neatly into familiar archetypes for men in action adventure films in Po, we expect the hot shot fighter pilot who celebrated for blowing up the bad guys in Finn, we expect the noble defector who is determined to take down an unjust system. And in Luke we expect the wise warrior who wields tremendous power in the name of fighting evil,

Speaker 1:          01:05          but in each case the last jet, I doesn't deliver on those expectations, at least not immediately. Instead, director Ryan Johnson throws fans a series of curve balls over the course of the first act. Fin reveals his self centered and defeatist attitude. Po proves that he's reckless and arrogant and Luke is so consumed by paralyzing guilt that he's renounced the Jetta I and become a hermit. These unexpected character twists are part of the reason why some star wars fans left the theater in a state of shock, which rapidly mutated into fits of rage on the Internet. Now to be clear, we're not talking about people who just happen to dislike the last Jetta media is after all, not a perfect piece of cinema. No. We're talking about the subset of mostly male super fans who felt betrayed and personally disrespected by this movie or anything else. The objections from that particular group are wide ranging. The two were accompanied by a girl, but they often involve an obsessive level of scrutiny when it comes to female characters.

Speaker 1:          02:23          On the more extreme end of the spectrum, band complaints have a tendency to devolve into wild conspiracy theories about the Disney corporation pushing an agenda of forced diversity or feminist propaganda, but there is a common thread running through much of the backlash that speaks to an underlying anxiety and anxiety rooted in deep seated insecurities about masculinity. Let me briefly explain what I mean by that. Leading men in action adventure movies are expected to be decisive, righteous, respected, and to take charge. In most situations, men are expected to achieve success by becoming progressively more and more powerful as the story unfolds. This expectation is part of a long running tradition in Hollywood and the formula is so entrenched in mass media that many fans feel aggressively entitled to seeing that particular version of manhood reproduced on the big screen, but as the last gen I begins, it quickly becomes apparent that this movie is an interested in catering to a simple vicarious power fantasy. All three male heroes are presented as vulnerable in their fallibility with each displaying their own set of rather significant character flaws and inadequacies.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Now, flawed heroes in and of themselves aren't all that unusual in speculative fiction. In fact, failure and then learning to overcome that failure is just the standard recipe for structuring a basic character arc. I'd argue the intense fan hate surrounding the last Jedi has a lot more to do with the fact that the male heroes in this movie are directly challenged on their failures by women. This is not something that's supposed to happen. The space cowboys or space wizards in Hollywood blockbusters. Women aren't supposed to interfere with a man's heroic journey. So let's dig a little deeper into the unexpected ways that men are held accountable for their behavior in each of the movies. Three intersecting storylines, as many critics noted when the last jet I first hit theaters. The theme of Women Challenging Male Bravado is most evident in the character arc of Poe. Damron Po is a hot shot fighter pilot. He's impulsive, he is arrogant,

Speaker 2:          05:17          no come back.

Speaker 1:          05:20          And he cares more about being a big damn hero than he does about effective strategy or even the lives of his compatriots. The Gung Ho rebel pilot is a familiar archetype and star wars media. And as a result, we think we know how it's going to play out. Audiences expect the good guys to bring down the enemy death machine in a giant ball of fire. And we expect to revel in the joyful spectacle of impossible explosions in outer space. Dread not down, but instead of framing pose, raid on the dreadnought as cause for celebration, the movie suddenly pulls the rug out from under us. You're demoted, what weight? We took down, a dread not cost. There are things that you cannot solve like Joffrey, excellent and blowing something up. We'll learn. Po is rebuked for his apparent victory and by extension the audience has rebuked for enjoying the fireworks. Those explosions that we were taking such pleasure in just moments ago are abruptly reframed as cause for self reflection and sadness and we find ourselves suddenly confronted with a narrative about consequences for some star wars fans. It must've felt as if Princess Leia had just reached out of the movie screen and personally slapped them across the face.

Speaker 3:          06:52          Yes.

Speaker 1:          06:55          Now it's noteworthy that blowing up the space fascist death ray isn't framed as morally wrong. Instead we're asked to consider the tactical and human cost of that

Speaker 3:          07:08          violence.

Speaker 1:          07:14          If ever a beloved leader is incapacitated, we expect our brash hero to suddenly find themselves in command, but that doesn't happen either. The chain of command is clear as to who should take her place. Vice Admiral Hodo off the cruise and then Vice Admiral Geraldo is even less sympathetic to pose attitude. Then general layer. I've dealt with plenty of trigger happy fly boys like you. You're impulsive, dangerous, and the last thing we need right now, she harshly chastises Po for his recklessness and rightly dismisses his antics as a liability to their mission. And this is really what's at the heart of why so many angry fans tend to hate vice admiral holdovers characters so much. That's what's got, that's what you brought us too.

Speaker 3:          08:09          Get this man off Matt Rich Po Damron

Speaker 1:          08:13          story is that of a cocky, headstrong, never tell me the odd style male hero who is repeatedly reprimanded. You have bet the survival of the resistance on bad odds and put us all at risk until he finally learns to listen to and trust women in positions of power.

Speaker 3:          08:35          Okay,

Speaker 1:          08:36          as episode eight begins, Finn is a man obsessed. He wants nothing more than find his friend Ray and then get as far away from the war as he possibly can. Fins intentions are selfish and driven by a lack of faith. He's convinced that the fight against the first order is a lost cause.

Speaker 3:          08:57          Sorry if this fleet is doom did. If my friend comes back to what she's doing too.

Speaker 1:          09:03          Enter rose Tyco, a low ranking maintenance worker who's a fan of fins, exploits from the force awakens. Got To get back to what I was doing. So what were you doing when she realizes he's not really the commitment resistance hero that she's heard stories about her disappointment is palpable. Rose takes on the role of fins, guide and mentor.

Speaker 3:          09:27          Hold on, come on. Look at this whole place is beautiful. I need, come on. Why do you hate it so much? Look closer.

Speaker 1:          09:36          She is the one who pulls back the curtain to expose the oppression festering just below the surface of the galaxy.

Speaker 3:          09:46          And who do you think these people are? There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich

Speaker 1:          09:54          unlike layer and Holdco. Rose holds no formal position of power, but she does speak from a position of moral authority.

Speaker 3:          10:04          I wish I could put my fist through this whole lousy, beautiful town.

Speaker 1:          10:08          She articulates the political and moral reasons why the resistance is necessary. And in doing so, she inspires Finn to finally identify as a rebel voice. God rebel scope.

Speaker 1:          10:26          And it's her role as moral compass to both Finn and to the audience that's responsible for a good portion of the rage directed at Rose's character from the more toxic side of star wars fandom. Many of these guys can't help but view a woman who is serving as teacher to a male hero as anything other than preachy, annoying or emasculating. Are you kidding me? The fact that rose also happens to be played by an actress of color only magnifies their anger. The other reason for the backlash against rose is because she interrupts fins. Big heroic sacrifice during the film's final battle, Faena embarks on a self destructive charge. His heart is finally in the right place, but his judgment is clouded by his eagerness to act on his new found convictions. Has the movie, makes clear fins a suicide attack is doomed to fail hotels him. So it's a suicide rose tells him so. And we see Hanes rickety air speeder falling apart around him. But Finn is so focused on striking a blow against the first order that he can't see how ineffective this strategy, understanding that his action amounts to a noble. But senseless sacrifice rose steps in to save Finn from himself.

Speaker 1:          12:06          The heroic sacrifice is part of a long tradition in media. We're in death is framed as a way for men to prove their bravery, their convictions. They are love and even their manhood and movies tend to romanticize images of men going out in a blaze of glory.

Speaker 3:          12:35          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:40          Even when their sacrifice is senseless, ineffective or unnecessary. This notion that death and violent death in particular, his redemptive or restorative for men is so deeply ingrained in media that many angry fans are adamant that fins misguided kamikaze attack would have succeeded despite the film explicitly telling us otherwise. These fans are incensed that a woman got the big damn hero moment and she got it in their view by robbing a male hero of his chance at martyrdom. Why would you stop me? I saved you

Speaker 1:          13:30          when ray finally meets her hero. The legendary did I night isn't at all what she expected. Luke Skywalker has become a cynical old hermit, a man so consumed by fear and guilt that he's turned his back on the resistance and closed himself off to the force. Needless to say, this comes as a tremendous shock both to ray and to the audience. Go Away. Like Ray, many star wars fans were expecting loop to appear as a triumph and bad ass. The one they remember or rather misremember from the original trilogy. The thing is, Luke was never really depicted as a great [inaudible]. Hod Did you read my light saber? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:20          When Luke says this, seek what? I'm going to walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole first quarter. His words are a reaction to raise assumptions, but those lines can also be read as a response to fan expectations. As I mentioned earlier, it's assumed that Hollywood heroes, especially men, will grow exponentially more powerful over time. The expectation is that once a man has conquered his demons, those demons will stay forever. But even though Luke rejected the dark side back in return of the Jedi, I'll never turned to the dark side. His struggle to resist the temptation of absolute power isn't over for the briefest moment of pure instinct. All I could stop it and he's still scared of the darkness hiding inside himself just as he was as a young man back on Diggaba. Although this older version of Luke Skywalker is consistent with his characterization from the original trilogy, angry fans still believe that the last Jedi represents a downgrading of his power and his status.

Speaker 3:          15:41          I didn't see you.

Speaker 1:          15:43          The fan fury is exacerbated by the fact that it's a young, untrained female Jedi [inaudible]. I just feel so full from the fools who challenges this mythic hero on his failures. Not only does this young woman reprimand the Great Luke Skywalker, I sent me here with a hope. If she was wrong, she deserves to know why

Speaker 3:          16:07          we will do.

Speaker 1:          16:09          She directly confronts him and inspires him to reconnect with the force later on. Yoda offers guidance too, but it's a ray who opens the door for Luke to overcome his paralyzing self doubt.

Speaker 3:          16:27          Now reach out.

Speaker 1:          16:31          So instead of seeing the old Jedi master teaching ray how to wield the awesome power of the force, I feel something audiences are treated to scenes in which ray reminds Luke what it means to be a Jedi galaxy may need a legend. Of course, ray isn't a more powerful Jedi than Luke and she ends up being wrong about her ability to fix Kylo Ren, but she does possess something that he's lost. Ray still has hope. She still has conviction, and she's still has clarity of purpose. The idea that a young woman like ray would have something important to teach an older mythic male hero like Luke Skywalker is a Roni Asley viewed by some male fans as emasculating.

Speaker 3:          17:22          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          17:22          it's worth pointing out that angry fan defensiveness isn't necessarily just a reaction to women existing in popular science fiction stories. If women are included alongside male heroes in a way that doesn't overshadow upstage or interfere with traditional expressions of masculinity, let's get one thing straight. I'm in charge out here and you do everything I say exactly as I say, just relax. Then we don't see these same kind of temper tantrums for male fans, especially if the female characters in question are cast as young, white and conventionally attractive. The last Jed, I isn't satisfied with simply including women. It goes much further and puts female characters in positions of institutional power or moral authority over male heroes. The movie then has those women leverage that power to challenge and ultimately forced change in men's behavior and that is almost unheard of in a major blockbuster film in the end are three male heroes face up to their mistakes and overcome their failures. Ho learns from Leah and Holdco to put aside his desire for heroic short term gains. Let's go wait, wait, and instead consider the bigger picture. It's only through Rose's moral insights that fin comes to believe in something bigger than himself and ray succeeds in inspiring Luke to be the best version of himself again and ultimately to do the exact thing he mocked her for earlier in the film. Luke does indeed end up walking out with a laser sword and facing down the whole first order.

Speaker 3:          19:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:13          Despite what the reactionary conspiracy theorists claim. This is not an agenda of masculine inferiority. Women in the last Jedi hold their male counterparts accountable, not out of animosity, but because they genuinely care about them.

Speaker 3:          19:32          I like it.

Speaker 1:          19:36          Male heroes are not being diminished or erased in this movie. In fact, a lot of time and effort is devoted to giving men transformative arcs. The last Gen I is a story about men learning to trust women's ideas and decisions and then becoming better people and better heroes because of it. And while that might be an unexpected message for a star wars story, it's a vital lesson that men need to learn if we are to achieve gender equality. Thanks for watching these video essays.
