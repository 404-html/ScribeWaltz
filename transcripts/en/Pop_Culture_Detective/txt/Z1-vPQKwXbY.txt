Speaker 1:          00:05          Pixar is 2008 animated film. Wally is a critically acclaimed masterpiece, about two adorable robots falling in love. The, I'd argue, it also serves as an excellent example of sociological storytelling like most of the best science fiction. This movie uses imaginative visions of the future as a lens through which to interrogate the social systems of today. Now, in order to explore how well he accomplishes this, we need to start with something that makes this movie relatively unique and that's the fact that it doesn't have a villain, at least not the kind we've come to expect from a Disney owned a studio.

Speaker 2:          00:48          This is how he handled things down.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Hollywood loves its larger than life cartoonish billings. The villainous characters that appear on the big screen are typically framed as bad apples. They do bad things because of their personal deficiencies and nefarious intention by this formula makes for a simple easy to understand plotlines, but it also tends to reinforce an individualistic worldview. The individualistic worldview is a false but widespread way of thinking in which society is reduced to a bunch of individuals home making their own independent choices. The central idea. Underpinning the individualistic model of the world is that people do what they are. People do bad things because they are bad people. According to this reductive framework, injustice is a result of the isolated actions of a few bad apples, how day, but that worldview, like the Hollywood narratives that are constructed around it minimizes or completely ignores the important role that social systems and institutions play in our world

Speaker 2:          02:09          world. Just build an economy.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Since Wally's narrative isn't built around that traditional villain formula, the movie presents us with a very different worldview, a sociological one. It's not that this story doesn't have antagonists or central conflicts. It has both. They just don't take the forms were used to seeing in popular entertainment, kosher ro robots. The antagonist of Wally is the film setting itself, the axiom, starlight, or more specifically the automated systems that run the ship in words. The villain of this movie is not a person. It's an institution. I should briefly mentioned that the axioms, AI is named audit, but unlike how 9,000 or other AI villains auto is not sentient, nor are his actions the result of a malfunction auto can't make independent choices. All he can do is follow his preprogrammed directives and in that sense, auto isn't a traditional Disney villain. Instead, he functions as the voice of the ship as an institution.

Speaker 1:          03:37          Okay. Let's quickly recap the plot for those who haven't seen this movie. Recently, humans have abandoned earth after polluting the planet to the point where it's no longer inhabitable. The surviving population lives aboard massive luxury star liners that are drifting through space. These automated galaxy cruisers are run entirely by robots on behalf of the buy in large corporation. By and large, by in large is essentially a combination of Walmart, Mcdonald's, Disney, Ge, and Starbucks all rolled into one time. The company promised the original passengers that they would all be returned to Earth once the planet

Speaker 3:          04:24          made little girl again. There's plenty of space. We'll clean up the mess while you're away.

Speaker 1:          04:35          That was over 700 years ago. The jewel of the VNL fleet. Over several generations. The human passengers have become so complacent in their over indulgent lifestyle that they've even forgotten how to walk under their own power remains stationary. The film's core conflict revolves around individuals of both the human and robotic variety, realizing they're all participating in a system larger than themselves and then working together to break free from that system. And that premise that we as individuals are always participating in something larger than ourselves is the core concept underpinning the field of sociology. Those larger things that we're all participating in are referred to as social systems. Social systems are interconnected arrangements, structures and relationships that combine to form a coherent hole as individual members of society. We are all always participating in a range of different social systems. So for example, the family unit is a social system as our schools and police departments and corporations and whole patriarchy and white supremacy are also examples of complex interlocking social systems.

Speaker 1:          06:05          To paraphrase sociologists, Alan G. Johnson, it's the dynamic relationship between us as individuals and these larger social systems that makes social life happen because the axiom Starliner functions as a self contained social system. Let's use it to help illustrate how all of this works. Like all social systems. The axiom includes sets of rules or social norms which participants are expected to adhere to in order to ensure that the system functions smoothly. In sociological terms, these socially enforced expectations are referred to as paths of least resistance in the movie. We can see this process play out in the directives that each of the robots must follow and it's represented by literal lines along which both the passengers and the crew travel around the ship.

Speaker 1:          07:03          It's important to note that paths of least resistance do not determine the behavior of all individual human beings. We are not robots after all, and that means that we all have a choice in how we participate in these social systems. We can, if we choose, step off the path of least resistance, but doing so will likely lead to pressure from others to get us back in line. Let your timeline with an important message. The most succinct description of how paths of least resistance operate that I've ever seen uses the board game monopoly. The monopoly example along with many of the other concepts we've been discussing can be found in the excellent book, the forest and the trees by a sociologist, Allen g Johnson. He points out that monopoly functions as a mini social system like all social systems. The game includes paths of least resistance which can be found in the rules inside the box.

Speaker 1:          08:10          All we really have to do is glance at those rules and we can predict exactly how people's behavior will be impacted. Why don't we play me the path of least resistance for players is to simply follow the rules. Refusing to adhere to the rules will lead to push back from other players and likely get you kicked out of the game whenever the rules of the game are followed and antagonistic. Pattern of behavior will always emerge. Guidance and that pattern is one of a ruthless greed. You're a little light here, dad. I'm good for the rest. You know, I am. Remember the game of monopoly is over when one player has taken everything of value from everyone else

Speaker 4:          08:56          to three way you little

Speaker 1:          09:03          laughter as Johnson reminds us, if we use an individualistic lens to explain this pattern of behavior, it leads to one explanation. People are greedy. Remember that the core idea underpinning the individualistic worldview is that people do what they are. So according to that, people playing monopoly behave ingredient ways because people are greedy. Now the problem with that as Johnson points out is that most people don't behave in ruthlessly greedy ways when they're not playing monopoly. Sure, all people have the capacity for selfishness to some degree, but the rules of monopoly not only encouraged Gri behavior, the rules actually make greedy behavior, a necessary condition of participation. The personal values of the players are irrelevant to describing the game and its rules. It doesn't matter if you're a Buddhist monk or a Wall Street banker. If you play monopoly as it's meant to be played, you'll end up acting like an absolute monster.

Speaker 4:          10:09          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Paths of least resistance and their outcomes vary greatly depending on which social system we're talking about. So in monopoly, the outcome is greed on the axiom. However, the path of least resistance for the passengers is to be passive super consumers. Many film reviewers noted that Wally functions as a critique of consumer capitalism, which it undoubtedly does. However, the film doesn't take the easy route by vilifying individual, by and large consumers. In that way, it's the opposite of a film like idiocracy, which is a movie I absolutely despise. Idiocracy is also meant as a critique of consumerism, but it traffics in a brand of cynical, elitist humor that ends up blaming individuals, often the most powerless and poorest of people for the destructive actions of corporations and governments.

Speaker 1:          11:13          To its credit, that's not how Wally frames the humans living aboard the axiom. Starliner yes, they're complicit in their situation and yes, they enjoy the privileges the system affords them. If we were to use an individualistic lens to explain their behavior, we would be forced to conclude that the captain and all the passengers acting lazy, stupid, and apathetic ways because they are naturally lazy, stupid, and apathetic people. But since Wally is an example of sociological storytelling, it frames the passengers and the captain as initially acting in the ways they do because that's what the axioms social systems expect from them. Even the passengers, physical appearance is a direct result of the ship's systems and not a result of their personal failings. They are simply following the paths of least resistance that are laid out for them, and that means the passengers are not defined by their complicit role in that system.

Speaker 1:          12:17          They have the capacity to grow and break free, and I'd argue that that idea that people can change how we engage with social systems and in so doing transform or even abolish those systems isn't incredibly hopeful. Message paths of least resistance in the real world are rarely as well defined as the directives aboard the axiom or the rules of a board game. The social expectations in our daily lives are often unwritten and we can form to their norms unconsciously. For example, imagine you hear someone tell a sexist joke, we saw your boobs, we saw your boots. The Path least resistance is typically to laugh.

Speaker 1:          13:06          Imagine shouldn't being confronted with sexual harassment in the workplace. The path of least resistance there might be to stay silent. The issue of men speaking out has been a big talking point with this scandal with many who have worked with Weinstein. Remaining quiet, predatory sexual behavior is not just the result of a few very rotten apples. It's part of a much larger systemic problem. Social Systems of male entitlement work to reinforce excuse and enable that type of behavior. Social Systems are one of the most important and one of the most misunderstood concepts in my work around media and masculinity. From time to time I'll use terms like misogyny, patriarchy and male privilege or male entitlement and that tends to elicit a very defensive reaction, especially from guys who feel they're being personally condemned as villains. However, these terms are not meant as an indictment of every individual man.

Speaker 1:          14:06          They're simply ways of describing the larger social systems that were all part of one of LNG Johnson's key insights from the monopoly example is that we can describe the game of monopoly and its outcome without describing the personalities of each individual player. This also means that we can describe the framework of real world social systems without necessarily saying anything about the personalities of the people participating in those systems. The passengers and rebellious robots aboard the axiom all eventually step off the path of least resistance, and as a result, change the fate of humanity and we as people in the real world can collectively step off our own paths of least resistance and refuse to be complicit in oppressive social systems.
