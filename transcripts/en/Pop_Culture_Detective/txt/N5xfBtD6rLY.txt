Speaker 1:          00:00          So once again, it's David Levinson reminding you and anybody else that's listening don't mess with art SQL to the 1996 and make a blockbuster independence day. Hit theaters this summer. Independence Day, resurgence is built on the same premise that made the original famous, a potent combination of alien Killen and patriotic pandering.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Shouldn't we be nervous?

Speaker 3:          00:31          Yeah, please get gonna kick some serious som some fireworks after the claim date of July.

Speaker 1:          00:46          According to most reviews, the movie itself was unremarkable. What was remarkable, however, was the marketing for the film. Some of you might remember something a little strange about the trailers and I mean in addition to Jeff Goldbloom doing his whole Jeff Goldbloom thing,

Speaker 2:          01:02          when the world was brought to its knees, the army was there to fight back, promised us that this would never happen again. They have been the driving force in United Nations around the world to form the most powerful weapon against another. Attack your space defense. Brave men and women of the ESD or making sure that the war of 96 will never happen again. Join Earth space defense. Next time we will be prepared.

Speaker 1:          01:50          So we see the stars, the film's speaking directly to the camera, praising the u s army and then asking fans to join something called Earth space defense. Then at the end of the trailer, we see a URL join esd.com once fans arrive at that website, they're asked to enlist in the ESD to help fight off future alien invasions and quote, defend Earth's independence at all cost by clicking enlist. Visitors are notified that they're now a soldier with a rank of private. Now in order to determine your role in this fantasy military organization, fans are instructed to complete a series of gamified missions. Mini Games include simulations where players learn how to pilot an unmanned military drone or crack secret alien codes. Completing each mission races your rank and unlocks exclusive independence day. Movie Con. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:47          we've taken fighter jets that the US military would have been accustomed to and we've incorporated alien technology.

Speaker 1:          02:54          You'd be forgiven for thinking that this is just a clever marketing stunt designed to drum up more interest in the film, but there's something a little more insidious going on here in order to compete to unlock those movie extras. Fans are instructed to sign in with Facebook, but by doing so, it allows the U s army access to your Facebook page and your personal data along with it.

Speaker 1:          03:19          That's because this whole Earth space defense campaign is actually a surreptitious recruiting tool for the u s army. It's part of a multimillion dollar joint advertising venture between 20th Century Fox and the United States military. If you look carefully, you'll notice a small unassuming US army logo in the corner of the page right across from the Independence Day movie logo. If you look even more closely, you'll notice that when linking over to join esd.com you're quietly redirected to go army.com or the site's hosted go army.com for those who don't know is the official website for us army recruitment. Surprise.

Speaker 4:          04:03          Not at all. She's a born leader. I know I've been taking orders from her since she was five years old.

Speaker 1:          04:10          See, you don't worry about her.

Speaker 4:          04:12          Of course, I worry about her. I fought in the war in [inaudible] 96 I know what those things are capable of, but I know what my daughter is capable of and I know this planet is safer because she's defending it

Speaker 1:          04:27          now. That trailer is almost indistinguishable from real us army television commercials, at least up into the point where the kindly father figure in the u s army cap starts reminiscing about the war of 1996 you remember that's the fictional one that didn't actually happen with the u s military defeated the extraterrestrial invasion with the help of will Smith.

Speaker 3:          04:53          Wow.

Speaker 1:          04:54          No Earth crossbred promotions are now ubiquitous in Hollywood. You've probably seen commercials for Audi or Doritos or coke that double his trailers for superhero films. These movie Tie ins are meant to trigger an emotional connection and viewers and increase what's referred to as positive brand association by connecting a product with something that people already liked it.

Speaker 3:          05:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:21          The idea is that if you already think that, say the hulk is cool and you're already really excited to see the hawks smash stuff in the latest marvel movie, then seeing the hulk, enjoying a can of coke will link those preexisting happy, fanish feelings in your mind to the product on the screen, even if that's just on an unconscious level

Speaker 1:          05:43          and the uncomfortable truth is that this kind of marketing actually works really, really well, which is why corporations spend billions every year doing it, but here's the thing. Convincing people to eat a bag of street taco flavored, convincing people to eat a bag of Doritos and convincing people to sign away eight years of their lives to the u s army are not exactly comparable. While arguably both might be unhealthy. Life in the military presents significantly more risk to your mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing. Then having a little junk food now and then. Now I've cross branded advertising. Sounds manipulative. That's because it is, which is why it's not exactly surprising that the US military is jumping on the bandwagon. The U s army now spends in excess of $200 million per year of taxpayer money on advertising. The U S Army contracted advertising firm responsible for the Earth space defense campaign. He's upfront about what they're doing, saying quote. It allows us to tell the U s army recruitment story in a very new and very relevant way. The thing is that recruitment story they're selling is pure fantasy. Now, to be clear, many people do initially want to join the military for altruistic reasons. Unfortunately, US army recruiters are notorious for extremely deceptive tactics.

Speaker 5:          07:11          You look like you're really into this. You guys want a real challenge.

Speaker 6:          07:17          You'll find out what you really made us explore over 150 careers. Help pay for college and learn a few. Qualify for an m three nine five now for a free copy of the America's army gains and this new interactive DVD

Speaker 1:          07:31          promises of large cash bonuses and money for college are commonly used to entice poor students into enlistment. But the fine print on those contracts makes it so only about 15% of recruits end up getting a college degree out of the deal and 65% received no money for college at all. Recruiters also routinely hide the dangers that go along with life in the military, even outside of combat scenarios. Potential soldiers are not told that the levels of sexual assault and sexual harassment in the military are alarmingly high. Recruiters don't mention that one in four women and about one in 14 men, they severe and persistent sexual harassment and discrimination while serving. They don't mention the fact that suicide rates among veterans are extremely high compared to civilians, and they certainly don't tell you that a third of all homeless men in the United States are military veterans.

Speaker 1:          08:25          For the record, that's over 200,000 people. Let's be frank. If you enlist in the army does a darn good chance you're going to have a bad time and the military knows it. This reality presents something of a PR nightmare, which is why the military has longterm to Hollywood to help clean up their image and sell the idea of enlistment. Every branch of the US military has offices in Los Angeles which are tasked with collaborating on Hollywood movies and video game productions now for decades they wouldn't touch anything involving UFOS. In fact, a military famously refused to assist on the original independence day because the script referenced area 51 but that's no longer the case. The military has recently collaborated on science fiction movies like battleship man of steel, iron man and transformers.

Speaker 7:          09:26          We're using all the real crew from the ship right now and these guys are acting out scenes and fighting their ship and I think that having a lot of fun

Speaker 2:          09:34          right behind us is the five inch gun.

Speaker 1:          09:36          Now in exchange for granting filmmakers assistance and access to both equipment and personnel, the military just demands one little thing. Return final script approval

Speaker 3:          09:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          10:02          you have to thank her. Now she said the navy again.

Speaker 1:          10:10          This arrangement ensures that Hollywood depictions of the military are always positive and uncritical, even when the story involves dinosaurs are a killer. Robots are aliens from outer space. This cozy relationship is sometimes referred to as militate meant because it produces media that glorifies military institutions, combat and warfare, so there's a long history of military involvement in Hollywood still. I'd argue that this independence day movie collaboration, it's especially insidious now beyond the covert collection of personal data via Facebook, which is bad enough. What's so unsettling about it is that the u s army is leaning heavily on the fantasy of alien invasions as a way to convince young people to become soldiers in real life.

Speaker 2:          10:57          When the soldiers in the movie rise up and they adapt to a new threat facing the world and they find a way to win, no matter what. Remember where Hollywood gets set from. The U S Army has been defending American independence for more than 241 years. Go to go army.com/independence to learn how you can join their ranks, independence day, resurgence in theaters. June 24th

Speaker 1:          11:25          problem is where Hollywood gets that from his from fiction or at least a heavily sanitized version of the U s military. Now this cross branded Earth space defense campaign does fit very neatly with the u army's Pr Tagline defending America's independence. There's just one small problem with that. It's not exactly true anymore. The majority of modern US military operations look a whole lot more like intervention than independence and those operations are certainly not designed to beat back any invasion of the heartland either from foreign or extra terrestrial origin. The long and short of it is the US government has been in a near constant state of war for over a century. In fact, it's overthrown or invaded over 50 countries just since the end of World War II. In an incredibly strange coincidence, most of those military interventions have somehow ended up benefiting or protecting the economic interests of American big business and under the umbrella of the so called war on terror. The U s military is currently raining destruction down on countries all across the Middle East and North Africa. That's the grim, messy and often bloody reality of it. And that unpleasant reality is one of the reasons why the U s army is increasingly turning to science fiction stories as a recruiting tool

Speaker 2:          12:49          who discovered they can do extraordinary things with unique talents and strengths. As an elite class, it's more than a uniform. It's a chance to be part of something bigger than you ever imagined. Try It on at facebook.com/go army and see exclusive content for x hand first class theaters, June 3rd they're strong. And then there's army strong

Speaker 1:          13:17          science fiction can provide a simple good versus evil narrative, one that appeals to patriotism and a desire to save the world without any association with those real life military operations and atrocities. In addition to leaning on science fictional conflicts, the u s army is also leveraging science, fictional technology and science fictional weaponry as an exciting pop culture lore to hook young people into it.

Speaker 2:          13:41          Let's not come on. Come on.

Speaker 1:          13:46          Fighting imagined enemies avoids the uncomfortable associations with us. Foreign policy, so killer robots or zombies or alien invasions. These are all dehumanized conflicts without any messy moral questions attached. There are no real human beings with feelings or families or grievances with us. Imperial, yeah,

Speaker 1:          14:07          invading space. Aliens are easy to kill. There's no guilt, remorse or critical thinking that's required. Unlike the real world where killing other people, no matter how vile they may be is never something you should feel particularly good about. Independence Day, resurgence. It didn't do so well at the box office so we probably won't be subjected to another movie in the series, unfortunately will definitely be seeing the u s military using this type of advertising tactic. Again, that's because both the US military and the advertising industry understand something that many people still want to deny and that is that fiction can be a very powerful and very effective way to influence people's actions and attitudes. The military has a tradition of intentionally blurring the lines between fiction and reality, but this latest movie tion represents a shift to a more insidious form of product placement and we have a word for when the government does this kind of thing and that word is propaganda. I hope you found this video useful.
