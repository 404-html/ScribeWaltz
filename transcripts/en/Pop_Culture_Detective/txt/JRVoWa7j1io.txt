Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Welcome to open access. This is our third is there it is. This is our third annual open access week celebration and we have a lot of exciting things that we're going to present this week. Lots of events. Uh, we can have a keynote address today. Uh, that's going to be followed up by hands on workshop about mashups skills from the renowned Donald duck meets Glenn Beck, creator to a panel of experts about digital textbooks as digital technology and content. Deliberate questions about access, copyright, and fair use continue to come to the surface. This week's events offer lots of opportunities to explore these new areas of creativity, scholarship and technology and how they're all coming together. Let me give you a little preview of the week to come on Monday. Today we have hacking pop culture with remix video by John and Macintosh, our keynote speaker for the week. Tuesday, Rick remixed manifesto, a movie here, the Gould Auditorium at 11:00 AM 11:30 AM how to remix and reuse a workshop by Jonathan McIntosh, which will be in room 1008 at 1:00 PM.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       That's tomorrow. Again, Wednesday, free and open digital textbooks perspectives on impossible future. That would be a panel discussion and room 1150 at 3:00 PM and on Thursday or last event we'll be publishing smart how to make your article visible. Room one thousand9@twopmandifyouwanttogobackandlookatanyofthissoyoucanfinditonourmarriottlibrarydotwordpress.com site. I know you all memorize that really fast. So you've got that and there'll be four our staff announcements and continuing and flash so you can figure out when you're supposed to come to what end. You're welcome to come to all of these events this week. So that introduction, let me turn it over to rob. Gail was assistant professor of new media and the Department of Communication who will introduce our speaker today.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       Yes, I'm Rob [inaudible] and the Department of Communication. Um, before I get started, like to thank Joyce Analysis and Laurie, the folks in library for making this possible and also like to thank Bob Avery who's the chair of the Department of Communication for helping sponsor, uh, Jonathan bringing your manner and those, speaking of Jonathan Mackintosh, he's a remix artist, a self proclaimed pop culture hacker. And if, I guess if you pressed me wanting me to explain what that means, I think of culture is something about day to day life. It's the life that we lead. It's kind of our assumptions, it's what drives us. And so a lot of what we get about day to day life comes from the media. And therefore if we want to think about new messages that we want to think about critiquing our culture, we have to tear apart media. We have to critique it, mash it up, dude, interesting remix things.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       And that's exactly what Jonathan does. He's got a lot of uh, excellent work out there. I want to highlight a couple of my favorites. Uh, his video, Buffy versus Edward twilight remixed is a masterpiece that in his word serves as a metaphor for the ongoing battle between opposing visions of gender roles in the 21st century. It mixes Buffy the vampire slayer of course with twilight. And if I'm not mistaken, there's a little bit of Harry Potter in there just to touch yeah. And, uh, in the video Edwards obsessive stalking behavior, which apparently is acceptable and twilight, uh, grates against and is over ultimately overcome by the tenacious and self assured Buffy, you know, says Buffy being stocked isn't really a turn on for girls. Buffy ultimately has enough spoiler alert, cover yours if you must. Buffy sleighs Edward in right wing radio duck Macintosh uses depression-era Donald Duck cartoons to try to understand the popularity of shock jock Glenn Beck, especially in our current alien or economy.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       Donald Duck could, cannot find a job and has his home foreclosed on wonders why he's in such dire economic straits. Then on the radio, we hear three, two, one beck, Glenn Beck promises to give Donald all the answers, but only after he shows out the money for insider extreme. In the end, Donald gets disillusioned and he eventually overcomes Beck's racist in divisive rhetoric. First part, Glenn Beck has responded to this video calling a and I think we'll see an example of that calling McIntosh's work quote, incredible propaganda if we follow Glenn Beck's logic. Uh, what's your in store for today is a, a talk from a long haired anti-American communist Pinko hippie radical with funding from socialists like Obama or possibly acorn or maybe Mexican narco terrorists. I'm not entirely sure. Listen, well, dear audience, that is if you think the terrorists should, when you like communism and you hate America, um, no. In all seriousness, Jonathan Macintosh is a true artist. He's keyed on what art can be in the digital age. Art can critique, art can inspire, can drive thought. It can expose the best and worst of our culture. You can bring together digital objects and mash them together to build metaphors and ideas. Art Can change the world for the better. Please join me in welcoming Jonathan McIntosh.

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       Uh, thank you everyone. Is My microphone on? Is it working? Um, so that was, uh, that was basically my whole, my whole talk. I can just go home now. Um, uh, so this is an html five web page. Um, what you can find online, uh, after the talk. Uh, but it's also a presentation. You do need the latest, uh, Firefox or chrome browsers. It's sort of we'll work in safari, but only if you have like 5.1 0.1. Um, so let me just start here. Um, like you said, I'm a pop

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       hold your hacker and to talk about what that means in a little bit. Um, I'm also not going to do a big introduction because I wanted, have somebody

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       else do that via video in a second. Um, but, uh, this is me so you can follow me on Twitter. It's radical bites. The hashtag that I'm going to use for just this room here, um, is Hashtag remix Utah. If you want to, um, participate in the larger discussion around open access week, you can use Hashtag, uh, oh a week and that will sort of link you into a larger conversation on Twitter. Um, my youtube channel, it was rebellious pixels and I have two websites. One of them is a rebellious pickles.com. That's where all my, my video work and writing is. Um, and then I also blog at a website called political remix, next video, which is where we take, um, we take I think, interesting examples of politically oriented video from around around the web that, that mashup other content. And then we sort of write about it and blog about it.

Speaker 3:          00:06:49       Um, it started as sort of an archiving project, um, and it's still largely that, but there's sort of people engaging with it as well. Um, and want to say political for this talk. I'm, I don't necessarily mean government or elections, uh, that sort of big p politics. Um, but I, I actually mean it in a much broader sense and that is to include race and sexuality, gender, economy, uh, as well as policy. Um, so that's sort of a wide ranging, a sampling of, of I think some of the best a remix videos on the web that, that deal with remixing, not just the footage but actually we mixing the message of, of mass media often too. So, um, so start with, um, I like to start with this first quote here. Uh, the universe is made of stories not of atoms. What that means to me is that the way that we sort of understand our world, the way that we understand our place in it, the way that we understand the relationships between people and institutions, uh, between people in governments, between people in corporations is often, um, to the stories were told and the stories we tell, right?

Speaker 3:          00:08:05       Um, these narratives come in many forms. Uh, and often in today's Day and age, uh, those narratives, the popular narratives are, are inside of popular culture, right? So that's TV, that's movies, that's um, that is music videos, that's mainstream news. Um, and that's where these sort of narratives are told and then retold a and then changed and transformed. Um, uh, now that space, that pop culture space is of course owned by a very, very small owned and controlled by a very, very small group of, of, of corporate interests. And one of the things that means is that the, uh, majority of, of, of these stories that we are engaging with have a very, I think limiting and limited set of values, a set of myths, a set of serve social norms that they present to us, right? It's actually a very narrow set of ideas on race, on gender, on, on economics, on sexuality.

Speaker 3:          00:09:14       Right? Um, and so for many people, they don't get, they don't get to see themselves reflected or their lives reflected in mass media to have to a very large degree. And so what people have done for the past several decades actually is they've taken those pop culture stories, whether it be a TV show or the news, uh, and they have remixed them or change them in some way to make them better represent or better reflect where they're coming from because they might not be, uh, they might not be represented. One of my favorite examples of this is star Trek, uh, which is, uh, which is a very popular, uh, uh, set of stories in our culture, especially in, in, in the West. Um, and one of the, one of the striking things about it is that there have been a, I think, five, six television series now. Um, some of them lasting seven years each.

Speaker 3:          00:10:04       There've been, um, uh, over a dozen films and not, not, there's not one queer characters, not one gay character, major character in that entire thing. So, um, so fans of star trek might say, you know, I really liked star trek, but it's missing something, right? It's actually missing quite a, quite a few things. And so people will take fanfiction and they will rewrite it and they'll, they'll, they'll add things to that narrative story that's missing. So that's just one example. Um, so, uh, how do people participate in this, in this, in this, uh, culture, right? In this media culture. Uh, and one of the ways they do that is, is that they remix this quote. Uh, I actually love this quote, this quote is, he is from, uh, the screenwriter for rebel, rebel without a cause. Um, any film is at the same time and expression of a writer and that it's an offering to the audience to create their own film.

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       Now, when rebel without a cause came out, he didn't actually mean this literally. Uh, but with technology today, it can be taken literally. And I do take it literally, you can literally remake the film. You can literally rewrite the film. Um, and that is I think, what many mixers are doing. Um, and then lastly, uh, I talk about myself as a pop culture hacker and there's some confusion about this word, uh, hacking. Um, it often sort of brings to mind a not so nice things. Um, but I, I actually liked this definition. This is temperate love with the chaos computer club in Germany. And he says a hat that the hacker approaches the world breaks it apart to better understand how it works in order to figure out what can be done with it. Right. Um, and that's, that's the way that hackers as a, as a subculture have traditionally approached things.

Speaker 3:          00:11:59       They have, they have, um, approached a piece of piece of technology or computer code, and then they, if they have said, I want to know how this works. Right? So they take it apart and then they, then they say, well, you know, because it's built like this, it means that it can do these 10 things that apple or Samsung didn't want you to do with it. Um, but it's possible. And so with what they'll do is they'll make, they'll push the technology to its limits, right? They'll see what else can be done with it. Um, and so in that, in that sentence, it's a, it's a deconstruction and then it's a reconstruction. Right? Um, and that's sort of what I do when I approached television or the movies. Uh, I think of it in terms of here's this thing that I'm given on this face value, um, uh, story, uh, um, a narrative, a visual representation, and I can take it apart.

Speaker 3:          00:12:54       I can see how it works. You know, I can literally, I can literally take it apart as well as, as, um, as, as sort of deconstructed, right? Find out what the embedded myths are, find out what the, um, what the, uh, the embedded messages might be buying it with the value system of that piece of media is. Um, and then I can, once I have it broken down into its components, I can, I can then say, okay, well, because it works like this because these are, this is the way that it's built. This is what drives this, this narrative. I can put it back together in a different way. I can transform it, right. And tell a different story with these parts. Um, and so that's what ha pop culture hacking means to me. I mean, I use that because I think it's a, it's actually a little bit more descriptive a of a term then remix or Mashup.

Speaker 3:          00:13:42       Um, I use those terms as well. Uh, and I think that those, those, uh, that work is very important. Um, and often fantastic. And in terms of, of adding to a larger debate. But, um, it's not just about, often the stuff that I find most interesting and most meaningful and most poignant is not just about taking two things and sticking them together and to see what happens. Sometimes it is that, but often there's a lot of thought that goes into it. It's a very intentional process of, of seeing what it is that's in the meaning of this message, in this piece of media and what's the meaning of this message in this piece of media? And then putting them together, right. Um, uh, removing certain parts, adding certain parts to set, say something different. And I think that that actually is more than just sort of sticking things together to see what happens.

Speaker 3:          00:14:26       Um, and incidentally, I think that most people who do remix work actually do a lot more of that intentional and careful analytical process. It's not just taking things as sticking them together. Um, so, um, I thought that I was show you an example of this. Uh, using my own work. I made this video, um, right wing radio duck. Uh, it took about three months. Um, it's about seven minutes long. So it's, it's the same length as most Disney cartoons, a classic era cartoons. Um, it uses over 50 Donald duck cartoons, um, as well as some Mickey mouse and some goofy that are thrown in there. Um, it also uses, uh, about about 50 episodes of Glen Beck's radio and TV show. Um, cut up. Uh, so this is, this is the version on Youtube, but I'm not going to show you a different version of this.

Speaker 3:          00:15:23       Um, it's actually the same video, but, um, it's html five. And with html five video becomes an element, uh, in a, in a web page that can interact with data. Uh, and so, uh, I find that personally very geeky and fascinating. Um, so, uh, the way that that this, this demo works is that you've got the video playing as an html five video. What that means is that the video element and the timecode of that element can be, uh, can be, can trigger events in this case is javascript events. So what I've done is I've inputted, I've input all of the footage that I used, all of the episodes of, of uh, of the classic cartoons, all of the episodes of Glenn Beck Show, um, as well as some footnotes that, that I have that I was using in the creation of this process. Uh, and then some Wikipedia articles that deal with the specific topic that I was trying to get at, right? So it's adding this sort of layer of metadata on top of, of, of, of a piece of video. Um, uh, incidentally, the red text are links. So if you want to see either the Donald Duck cartoon or the Glenn Beck episode in its original context, you can click on that and you'll take it to the original source so you can see it. I'm so sorry. I'm going to show you this.

Speaker 3:          00:16:43       Yeah. And this is an html five web page using the video tag, which is a new, any tag to the village of you who have already seen this. You can then watch the, uh, the metadata that's dynamically appearing. For those of you who haven't seen it, then you can ignore the metadata or try to, it's a little bit,

Speaker 4:          00:16:59       oh, [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          00:17:27       Do you feel like you're working harder and harder these days just to stay financially afloat while fat cats get richer and richer? It's not just a feeling and you're not alone. The income gap between the rich and poor in America, is that an eight year high as the largest differential since the period immediately proceeding.

Speaker 4:          00:17:45       Gotcha. Labs

Speaker 5:          00:17:47       are getting more while the have nots are getting less. Meanwhile, government isn't helping decades of rising inequality.

Speaker 6:          00:18:03       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:18:05       Slap Blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 6:          00:18:16       Oh, well, I'm going to duck that beer right out of job.

Speaker 4:          00:18:47       Gotcha. Hey. Wow. Wow.

Speaker 5:          00:19:26       Great. Welcome to the program. My name is Glenn Beck. The bad news is just multiplying. Our economy is tanking. It doesn't show signs of improving their people. Losing jobs are government responds to the problems with bailouts and when you call them up and say, what are you doing? You don't get any response or not listening to you. Wall Street owns our government. What did we get here? I think a lot of people feel like they're alone and they just want to give up. Wow. Wow. I love my country. It is the shining example of a place where people work together in peace and friendship and worship God and make things better together. Well, the idea that built America are being lost and perverted. Wow. Wow. Ask yourself this one question. How many Marxist Communist anticapitalist do you have around you on a daily basis?

Speaker 6:          00:20:20       Yup.

Speaker 5:          00:20:29       The truth is that you are the defender of liberty. Our situation is bad. There are Nazis in America, Nazis and communists. You have to think like a German June, 1934

Speaker 6:          00:20:45       the higher higher.

Speaker 5:          00:21:07       There he is, eight perfect storm formulating and it is here we are entering a dangerous and scary time. America, the country will be washed with blood. These people don't mess around. They are taking you to a place to be slaughtered. Death camp. What planet am I landed on? It's like the damn planet of the apes. Did I slip through a worm hole in the middle of the night and this looks like an error. We're in a dark, dark place. We've got some dark dudes coming our way. Black Panthers, acorn reparation, welfare. Jeremiah writes, jumps on my himself. Alcaide ran Islamic Jihad lists, Venice, Venezuelan, immigration, Mexicans, refugees, Hispanic, South America, legal, alien, Mexico, Shiny. Every one is coming. He enemy is not only in the gates there inside the house as atmos come up, Leon pestle. Oh, La Mexican. Erica. It's like a pack of wild clue. Joe's ripping up the flesh of the American people, ruff, ruff, drug lords, illegal aliens, Mexico. They're going to start getting more and more violent. We had been tossed into boiling water. These people are cannibalizing from Hannibal Lecter. Zinging us. That's what Barack Obama is doing to the American people. I'm hoping the guy with horns doesn't actually show up.

Speaker 5:          00:22:53       Everything is about to change to the extreme, the insider extreme. We invite you to join up before 995 a month. It's going to explain everything that is going on.

Speaker 6:          00:23:16       Nope. Hmm. Hi.

Speaker 5:          00:23:29       Yes. Insider extreme is up and on. Hello? Yes. Sick, twisted freak, and welcome to the extremists. Who are you? Why not? Why isn't that a name of some stupid Disney curt, you're going to ask any question.

Speaker 3:          00:23:48       Oh, sucks to be you, doesn't it?

Speaker 5:          00:23:52       When you bought a house, you bet that you could pay it, that nothing would happen. It happened. You lost, move on. Boohoo cry me a river. Hey, I got an idea. Listen to this. Get a job, Lazy Slob that refuses to get off the couch and get a job.

Speaker 6:          00:24:49       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:24:55       um, thank you. Uh, so what I like about a five is it allows you, it allows me as a, as a, as a filmmaker, as a remix artist, to present a very detailed set of my sort of, of notes about my process. Um, it also allows you to connect back to the original sources, right? So one of the, one of the principles of fair use, which I can go over very quickly in a minute, um, that I always advocate is to cite your sources, right? So in the, in the same way that you would quote from, uh, from text, uh, if you're quoting from video to make a remix, you should cite that. Um, and so, uh, occasionally on, on, on Youtube or on Vimeo, you'll see people who have, who have made a remix and they've tried to cover up that fact because they think that it's maybe the logo that we'll get them in trouble.

Speaker 3:          00:25:39       So if it's CNN though, I'll try to cover up the logo or boiler the logo. Um, but actually, uh, what I ever pay people to do is I say, you know, leave that and, and say, you know, where you got it from, um, what episode it is. Because one, you're citing a source, you're saying, I'm using this, it's, it's fair use. Uh, and, uh, if other people are, the remixers are people who are watching your, uh, your video interest in the topic, they can go there and find and look at those original sources. Um, and so this is just sort of, is a way for me to, to present those upfront. And I'm just saying, well, you know, if, if you think that I was unfair to Glenn Beck, you can go into, you can listen to those soundbites, um, in, in, in their original context.

Speaker 3:          00:26:16       I mean, one of the things that I tried to do and one it was very important to me, was to keep, um, both of these, uh, cartoon characters, uh, consistent with their, uh, with their media persona, right? So, uh, I wanted to keep Donald Duck Donald Duck. I didn't want Donald Duck to do things that don't look, wouldn't do. Um, uh, and so, uh, obviously I'm actually using Donald Duck. So that becomes, um, it's almost seems self evident, but you can actually make Donald duck do things that are very and Donald Duck like with remix. Um, but I wanted to keep Donald Duck as Donald Duck. I wanted him to react in situations in the way that he might have done, um, sort of in a very hot headed and a little bit overblown way, sort of fall for things very quickly and then realize that maybe he's been duped. These are all things that happen over and over and over again in a, in, in Donald Duck cartoons.

Speaker 3:          00:26:59       Um, uh, of which I'm a fan and I have watched, I watched since I was very young. One of the only things I was allowed to watch in my very conservative household was, um, was Disney channel. And so I watched all of these over and over again to have, I've had the memorized. And so when I came to this project, I, uh, Donald Duck was the natural choice. Um, and ultimately to keep Glenn Beck a relatively consistent with his message, I didn't, I didn't want, you know, it's very easy to, um, it's very easy to make him say things that are sort of totally insane. Uh, he kind of says things are totally insane once in a while anyway, but you can sort of, you can very easily take them out of context and make them, make him sound like he's talking about, you know, aliens from Mars.

Speaker 3:          00:27:38       Right. And that's not what I wanted to do. I actually wanted to keep his message relatively consistent and that's, that's why the, um, uh, the links are there so you can follow it back. I just wanted to pick up the themes of what he was saying, but keep his message consistent. Um, and then have the, have the, to sort of interact in a way. So it technically it's out of context of course, because it's, you know, I've removed the media clips and made something new, but, uh, I tried to keep their, um, general persona, uh, accurate, um, and as much as you can. Um, so, uh, this, I put this up, I, uh, I premiered this at the opening video conference in New York City, uh, and I think I was on Friday maybe. And by Monday, um, he had already gone viral and so we'd had, in the first week it had about half a million views, um, and it was on every political blog you'd think of including Glenn Beck's block.

Speaker 3:          00:28:31       Um, uh, Roger Ebert tweeted about it and he said, everyone should watch it. Um, and uh, and he put a little urgency in the, in his tweet. He was like, you know, everyone should watch this before Disney takes it down. And so everyone went to watch it right away, which was, I was, I appreciate it. He also blogged about it at the, at the Sun Times. And The Washington Post called me and that was about the half million mark. And they said, uh, this the Washington Post, and, uh, we would like to talk to you about your little video, which I thought it was nice of them, um, and your times to just don't worry about it. Uh, and it sort of ballooned from there. John Cusak tweeted about it. Um, uh, for some reason bill O'Reilly also tweeted about it. He tweeted the video. So I don't know if he'd seen it at that point or not, but he didn't say anything about it as no commentary, just watch this, uh, which is, uh, to me, maybe he's not in control of his own Twitter account. Um, but then, so then on Monday, someone sent me, um, something like this. Uh, and this is a video clip of Glenn Beck on his radio show. He has about, he, he did have five hours of, of, uh, airtime to fill every day. Uh, now it's four cause he's not on, on Fox every day. Um, so it's a lot of time. So I understand that he needs to fill that time. Uh, and he decided to fill that time like this.

Speaker 7:          00:29:55       Um, Donald Duck meets Glenn Beck. Now this took some time, some talent in some money. Cool. It's what, eight minutes? It is. Yeah, it is. It is some of the best wellmade propaganda I have ever seen. Um, but I just want to, I just, I just want to show you what was on his website. Hi.

Speaker 3:          00:30:18       Um, so I'm going to have Glenn Beck introduced me in a more formal way. I didn't do that earlier. Um, and since he has so much time to feel, he reads my entire bio, uh, which was fantastic for me because now I don't have to do it.

Speaker 7:          00:30:30       Aim Is Jonathan McIntosh. I'm a pop culture hacker, video remix artist, photographer and new media teacher, consultant and fair use activist.

My political remix is appear online and also in film festivals and on community TV stations and new media conferences globally. Last year I was a consultant for remix America Online project. Last summer also co-taught a two week intensive workshop called the fair use. Remax Institute was Chicago youth using remix video as a media literacy tool if I'm not mistaken. Um, some of these remix videos, um, it's very interesting, I believe get federal funding. I believe it was one, one of these things that he's involved in was one of the first to receive federal funding to just understand that culture.

Speaker 7:          00:32:01       We're looking into the funding of this gentleman and the incredible propaganda against me. Like you've never seen using Disney and Disney cartoons. Of course it's all fair use so they can use Disney. Apparently Disney doesn't have a problem with, um, with Donald Duck cartoons now being remixed, politicized and politicized for the progressive left. I know a lot about Walt Disney. I know how much he hated the union because he thought they were communists. What, um, I know how much Disney hated the enemies of this country and the constitution, namely the Communists, the Socialists, the union organizers, dare I say it, the progressive's, but apparently they don't have a problem with this. I guess it's all fair use and we'll find out if it's been federally funded, you know, as part of the stimulus package or one of those NEA packages of the White House is simultaneously involved in and, and an off time volts

Speaker 3:          00:33:22       to quote Gandhi and play, um, Indian music and it's offensive anyway. Um, so was fantastic because he proved pretty much every point that I was trying to make in that little response. Um, uh, incidentally, I'm still haven't gotten my check from Obama after all that work. Um, you know, obviously I made this in my living room in my spare time, uh, over a period of three and a half months. Um, uh, I didn't get any funding for it. I haven't been paid for it since or then. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:33:58       so, you know, uh, and I, um, as far as I know, none of the projects I've worked on have gotten any stimulus money. As much as I would like to get some stimulus money, uh, it hasn't happened. Um, so we sort of, you sort of proves all my points there. Um, and so that, um, you know, a bunch of people saw this and it was, it was sort of talking about a little bit, but this response didn't go viral in the way the original video did. Um, however, um, in the, in the, in the, in the way that this sort of call and response remix and, and, um, uh, transformative do dialogue happens, uh, often, uh, on the Internet these days. Um, someone else, another remix her named icat three eight one took Glen Beck's response and took, I'm Mickey Mouse Video, um, to make another response. So this is, this is a remixed response to going back to response to my remix, which is a remix, which is a response to going back. Okay. It's follow that. Um, and I actually think that this is even better than Glenn Beck responding in a lot of ways.

Speaker 6:          00:35:08       [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:35:29       there is a, a story on Donald Duck meets Glenn back. It is some of the best propaganda against me. Like you've never seen using Disney and Disney cartoons, but I just want to, I just, if I'm not mistaken, some of these remix videos I believe get federal funding.

Speaker 5:          00:35:55       The Communists, socialists, the union organizers, Jonathan Macintosh, the enemies, yet another unbelievable attack.

Speaker 7:          00:36:12       But I guess it's all fair use and it's okay because the truth shall set you free.

Speaker 6:          00:36:25       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:36:33       so I, you know, I, that is my one, my favorite things ever. Um, the, this response also went viral. So it sort of a, a week later, uh, this one was also posted it on and many of those of those blogs and in my, my remix now has about a million and a half views, I think. Um, and this one has about a million. So it's, uh, it's sort of gained a lot of popularity. Um, and there's, I think there's very, very little that you can do with, with, uh, um, that amount of sort of hyperbolic rhetoric that has very little basis in reality except mix it with a cartoon. It seems to fit really nicely. And so, okay, so, so let's, let's, that's an example. Um, I just wanna talk a little bit about fair use. You know, I, I, I'm, I'm not going to focus on it a lot because I feel like it's, it's been covered in, in many places and there's, there's, you know, there's an enormous amount of, of, of academic work done on this topic, um, but it's, want to go over it very quickly in terms of some of the questions that I asked myself.

Speaker 3:          00:37:33       Um, so, uh, in terms of fair use, some of the questions that I ask that I ask myself, and this is not all that fair use encompasses, this is just sort of the things that I, I, uh, I talked to remixers about, right? So, um, is, is the remix work transformative, right? Um, that is, does it change and transform the original into something new? Right. And is it distinguishable as something new? Um, is the remix work a commentary at criticism or a parody? Right now? It doesn't have to be a negative commentary. It can be, it can be a celebration. That can be commentary, can be an argument that can be commentary. There are many ways that you can have commentary, but does it comment on, uh, on the source? Um, and then, uh, one of the questions that there's often asked in this, in this list of, of questions about fair use is how much is borrowed.

Speaker 3:          00:38:32       There's no set amount. There's no set amount in terms of words, letters, there's no set amount in terms of video footage or sound clips. Um, the, uh, the doctrine, the fair use doctrine says that you, you can use as much as you need, right? Purposely vague because what if you need, you know, you might need 10 seconds, you might need the entire thing, but you might, but you will. Then of course, we'd have to transform it in a very significant way. Right? Um, so there, there, there is no seven second rule. There's no 32nd rule. There's no two paragraph rule, there's no rule at all. It is how much you need and that you know, is going to be determined, um, by anyone who sort of evaluating whether it's fair use or not. Um, and then the, one of the other things that, that is often, uh, is often brought up is what is the effect on the original works value and that that's, that's the market value.

Speaker 3:          00:39:25       So, um, when this is sort of a disgust in the, in the courts, what they mean by that is, you know, um, if someone watches my Donald Duck Remix, do they no longer have to buy a or see any other Donald duck cartoon or have I shown them everything clearly? I haven't. Um, I've showed them a few seconds of Volvo, very large body of work. Um, uh, and so, and that actually I think is less important, at least in, in, in the court cases that I've looked at is less important. The most important factors. The first one, which is whether it's transformative or not, that is the most important thing. It has to be transformative. Um, incidentally, a, there's no rule that says you can't make money off of it either. There's no rule that says it has to be noncommercial. You can do a fair use remix and you can make a commercial.

Speaker 3:          00:40:12       Um, probably, uh, then it's transformative. Nis is going to be incredibly important in that termination. Um, but there's no rule that says, I mean, if you, if you have it not noncommercial, you might get a, um, uh, judges leeway a little bit. But there's, there's no rule that says you have to. Um, I also love this quote from 1839 works for value only if they give rise to better ones. Um, uh, this actually he's a, he's a German national, a naturalist. He was a, a natural scientist. Um, and, uh, so there were sort of working on, um, working in the, sort of the same fee fields. Darwin, right? I mean, so he's talking about scientific work here. Um, but I think that the quote can be, can be appropriated to mean art or media as well. Um, so that's a very, very brief overview of, of various, if you have other questions we can, we can chat about it.

Speaker 3:          00:41:05       Uh, I'm happy to do that, but I think there's a more interesting question that I want to bring up. And then it's a question about the ethics of appropriation because I think that has a separate completely separate question actually then the legal and fair use question. And it's a question that gets asked I think a little bit less. And there's a lot of focus in, um, especially in, in an open access spaces like this one, uh, about the legality, right? It's all about the legality. Is it legal, is it not like, well, there are lots of things that are legal that are not necessarily good, like ethical I think. Um, and there are lots of things that are illegal that might be ethical, right? So I think that there is another question sort of separate. So I want to separate this question very clearly from the use question.

Speaker 3:          00:41:45       Um, so put that aside and we'll talk about the ethics here for a second. So the has some of the questions that I asked when I, when I, when I'm going to Remix, uh, some piece of media, right? So I asked, uh, you know, who owns, uh, the source media and who's depicted in it? And so for a Disney, right, for instance, it's, it's owned by Disney, right? One of the largest multinational corporations are the richest in the world. And so I, that's who owns that. Um, uh, in terms of Glenn back, there's a, there's a variety of owners. Fox News is one owner. Um, and then Glenn Beck has a variety of his own companies that, that, that, uh, and then there's a radio program as well. So it's right, there's about three different owners there. But all of those are corporate entities. They're all relatively well to do.

Speaker 3:          00:42:29       Um, and so they occupy a position of power. Who's depicted, uh, obviously Donald duck is a, is a cartoon. Um, uh, and then in, in, in Glen Beck's voice, that's, that's going back. So there's, there's a very, very critical questions. And I sort of asking a, who is in this media? Um, and then one of the values, what are the messages he embedded in that source material? We talked about that in terms of, of um, of Glenn Beck and Donald Duck, right? There's, I think two separate sets of values. Um, some of them are contradictory, some of them line up very well in those two pieces of media. And so I tried to pull out those things, including some of the racial stereotyping that was happening both in Glen Beck's program and also, uh, in the, in the older Disney stuff. Um, and then, uh, I think one of the most important things is what positions of privilege and power they hold relative to me.

Speaker 3:          00:43:14       Right? Because when I remixed something, I'm kind of looking in terms of where do I sit on the, on, on the, on the power scale, right? On this sort of social, um, uh, power scales, right? Um, uh, where, where am I? And then where is this media that I'm mixing it and my am I looking up and I am, I am remix mixing people who were in the public sphere, government officials, um, uh, corporate entities, right? Celebrities, people who have a lot of money, or am I looking down in the social sphere, people who were right and I'm mixing people who are homeless or it makes the people who are, you know, who, who, who, who might be oppressed in various ways. And so I was asked those questions when I, um, when I remixed and I try to always remix, especially if I'm being critical, I, I try to remix things that are above me and in relatively in these sort of social space spaces, right?

Speaker 3:          00:44:02       Um, uh, that's not true across the board men, everyone, there's don't do that. Um, it's very easy to pick on people who are below you in, in, in, in power and privilege levels. I'm, it gets a quick laugh, uh, but I feel like it does some damage and we'll talk about that in a second. Um, so that's what I keep in mind that certainly not what everyone does and these aren't, these aren't rules, these are just sort of things that I keep in mind. Um, uh, right. And this is a fantastic quote from bell hooks is one of my favorites. It sort of talks about this. There's a there, especially in spaces, but also in, in, in artists spaces and sometimes in music spaces as well. There's a tendency to um, try to be transgressive for transgressive Sake, right? They try to be, um, uh, to try sort of a be against the grain or a or a, because for the sake of being rebellious, right?

Speaker 3:          00:44:48       As opposed to thinking about what it is like, you know, I want to be rebellious for a purpose. And what is that purpose? What, what does that new message, right on my remix mixing just the material because I want to remix something and it's kind of trend, a subset of subversive, what I want to remix the material for some reasons and have some sort of message behind it. Um, so, uh, some examples of, of, of that. So I think about it in terms of, you know, artists or media makers are, um, are using this tool of remix, uh, to, to say something. Um, and often when you talking about comedy, you talk about, you know, you can comedy, you can, you can, you can adjust your sort of throwing rocks as a comedian, right? You're throwing rocks and you've seen him if it hits and it's, it's, it's funny.

Speaker 3:          00:45:28       Um, and so you can either throw rocks up right at people who are above you in terms of wealth, in terms of, um, of various hierarchies or you can throw rocks that are down, uh, and throwing rocks down is very easy. This is, this is an example, people who are throwing rocks up some of these memes or some of these remixes here, um, at, at, at, at more powerful people and more and more powerful institutions. Um, and I think that these challenge those systems, right? The challenge status quo, they challenge norms. Um, and I think often in a very positive way, not always. Um, there are certainly some, uh, there's some back and forth here, but I feel like they sort of bs one sort of tend to, I don't know how many of you have recognized any of these, any of these images here?

Speaker 3:          00:46:12       Just a couple of you. Um, so, uh, just one of them Gaddafi, he, um, when, when, as the protests began in a, in February, he gave a speech, uh, from a little car with an umbrella, right? And it was a very strange speech, um, one, one of a series of very strange speeches that he gave at that point. And, uh, uh, and especially in, in the Arabic speaking world, this image became a meme, you know, so people would make little youtube videos of themselves with umbrellas and it was like as a whole umbrella meme that those are spread. Um, and, and then he did another one where he could get another speech where he, where he said, uh, that the protests for democracy, we're being controlled by the United States and al Qaeda with hallucinogenics that they had put in people's nest cafe. Right? This is like a national speech that he gave and this is why.

Speaker 3:          00:47:03       And so that was his reason. So nest cafe became this big thing like, you know, if you drink last cafe, you'll freak out and try to overthrow the government. Um, and so that was, you know, another sort of mean that, that, that people picked up on it. And again, they are there. They're using this, this remix footage just sort of make fun of and trying to disempower this very powerful figure. Um, uh, first world problems is another meme. It's a, it's an image macro that people will often use this image or other ones which are then sent. Some of them are quite good. Uh, not all of them. Obviously there are, there are, there are gems. Um, this next one, privileged nine dude, I mean, have you heard of the privilege denying dude? Uh, it's, I mean it's, it's actually quite brilliant. Um, sort of, they found these, these, these images are very smug looking, you know, dot com, uh, a hipster kids and they, uh, uh, they would just write things that, that they had heard their male colleagues say about them, you know, uh, so you know, your, your, or that they, that they had sort of not said, but sort of meant.

Speaker 3:          00:47:58       Right. So, um, your ideas sound so much better when I rephrase it. Right. That's a classic one. I think, um, and that got very popular as well. There was also backlash, I think against it. It was pretty bad. Um, hype, which was making fun of them. Obama's award winning PR campaign to become president. I'm actually won the marketer of the year for that campaign. So that was sort of talking about that, um, Tom Cruise, uh, has, uh, gets no end of, uh, of being made fun of for various, uh, is I think is the one where he's jumping on the couch with Oprah. When you that, um, anonymous, I feel like it's a bit of a mixed, a mixed bag. Sometimes they go after, um, uh, I think, and it actually more recently they've been going after, uh, Dick dictators and systems of power. They don't always do that, but I feel like they've been sort of tending in that in that way recently.

Speaker 3:          00:48:46       Um, they were also have a of an operation against child pornography, which they're trying to take down all of the servers that host it, which I feel like it's a positive thing. Um, uh, Bill O'Reilly had a brilliant freak out that people made into a dance remix. Many times you haven't seen it. It's definitely not say for work, but it's pretty funny. Um, and then this one is, um, uh, I think I believe is Sarah Pailin, constitutional scholar, which also very funny. Um, uh, so some of them tend to be a little sexist and I think you have to kind of sort through it and find the, find the good ones. Um, so, okay, so those are those throwing rocks up. You just throwing rocks down. How many you should recognize these, any of these images are memes, right? If you don't, great. Good, good for you.

Speaker 3:          00:49:29       Don't, don't go looking for them. Um, uh, they're sort of all, you know, all things that were, became very popular or they were, they were sort of remix memes that tended to make fun of people. Um, uh, so make fun of Queer kids was a very, or gay kids will, it was, it was a very, it was a very popular thing to do. It's, and you could have easy kick at people who are lower than you. And the social scale usually. Um, this, this next one is a show called lazy town. I mean, you've heard of lazy town is, there's a Nickelodeon show, um, for kids. This, this woman, this young girl was 12, uh, in this, in the shot here. Um, and she sort of sings and dances and, uh, um, a shot in Iceland, uh, she became a meme because they, um, a bunch of people decided that she, that they wanted to sexualize her and so they put her on all kinds of horrible sexual situations.

Speaker 3:          00:50:17       Um, so, uh, uh, you've got the golden voice, which people sort of, some of them celebrate it, but a lot of them I felt like made fun of. Um, and then it goes down the line, uh, instantly. Obama is in both of these, right? He's, he's in both. Uh, because I, I feel like there are, there are different ways that you can critique power. One of them is to pick on his, on his race. One of them just pick on his, on his political positions. Um, so, uh, these are the questions that I ask myself. I ask myself, you know, um, what are the power relationships here? All right. Um, and then who's the target and where do they sit? Um, and I, I, you know, I hope that this, you know, that these become popular and I hope that these don't, that's not always the case.

Speaker 3:          00:51:02       Um, so, uh, that's about 45 minutes. I want to leave some time for questions. I want to show you one quick thing before I go. Uh, this is, um, a o five remix video, uh, for education. And so this is a project that I'm working on called the gendered advertising remixer. Uh, and so this is the website that we sort of built for their, for their, for the demo. This is just, you're really a prototype and this is the flash version that we're working on. A, and this is the new html five version without flash silage of five. These are all videos that you can, that you can play with. Um, uh, and

Speaker 3:          00:51:36       in, in remix and TV. Whenever I look at TV, I'm always thinking, how could this be different? You know, what are the messages here? Uh, how could they be mixed up? What can be different, right? So, you know, when, when I go see a film, I might be, I might like certain aspects of the film. I might be disappointed with other aspects of the film. And so in my mind, I started mixing things up. All right? So I might go to a CSC, a film, and I might like the cinematography and I like, like the dialogue, but there is no women in the film. And so, which happens quite a lot. Uh, and so I will, I will pretend and all sort of in my mind, switch out the actor for an actress and just see what that would do in my mind. Right? What, what, what, what would that change the story?

Speaker 3:          00:52:12       Um, and so, uh, it's a great way to watch Harry Potter, by the way. If you, if you switch her money and Harry in your mind as you watch it, it becomes quite subversive. Um, anyway, so, uh, this is, uh, you know, I was watching Nickelodeon and I was watching a cartoon network and I noticed that the ads, um, that really something new, but the ads are, uh, are very segregated in terms of gender and it sort of, you know, you have one ad directed at boys and then another ad direct at girls and then boys and the girls sort of stackers that way. Um, and they are incredibly specific in terms of the, uh, the key skill sets that are being taught, the values that are being taught. Um, what it says about, you know, uh, about what it, what it means to be female versus male in a, in, in, in the culture. And if you just look at the types of skills that are being displayed here, um, and, and, and the value sets, and then you ask yourself like, you know, which kind of, um, what kind of, you know, what kind of careers might come out of this set of skills versus come up with that set of skills. Right? You, you get diametrically opposed and very narrow, uh, um, and stereotyped gender roles, right? So in, in, in, in, in the girl's side, across the board, you know, there might be veterinarian, like that might be the most sort of career oriented thing. Everything else is being a mom makeup, finding a husband, you know, um,

Speaker 3:          00:53:39       and the technology is all about shopping or finding a man, right? So if there is technology it shopping, finding man, uh, over over here, right? So you, but you also have some, some positive stuff, right? So when I talked to middle schoolers about the stuff, I, you know, I say, you know, what are the positive things? While there's cooperation, there's compassion, there's caregiving is lots of things that are, that are positive here. Um, not just negative. And then there were lots of things that are positive here, you know, um, confidence being, uh, being in control of your environment and building and creating, right? But there's also a lot of aggression, um, an enormous amount of competition and almost no cooperation whatsoever. Right? And so what happens if you kind of explain that to, to youth, uh, and you can kind of have a discussion about it, but I find it much more effective if you can let them do the deconstructing themselves and actually do it literally. And so for instance, in this case, you can take a Polly pocket airplane for instance, and you can take the Gi Joe Command base, um, and depending on how fast the connection is here, you can create your own mashup.

Speaker 6:          00:54:38       It's a great thing. Yes. The runway, fashion jumbo jet, you put it together or they don't think sold separately.

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       Uh, that's so not only is it sort of fun to play with, uh, any sort of gets a lot of people's laugh, but you can, but it becomes really apparent, right? So you can swap them and you can,

Speaker 8:          00:55:03       so Gi Joe, pimp mobile headquarters converts it to a massive battle station. Always ready for action. Gi Joe are you in? You can join today. Got Gi joe.com the place that they get the vehicles, all separate batteries, not included adults simply required as we're going along.

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       Um, yeah, they're just some of my favorites. And you know, there's about 400 possibilities here just with this. Um, let's see. Audio and then, uh, let's see. Video. Let's do my little pony.

Speaker 6:          00:55:34       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:55:35       Oh No. You know what we're going to do? We're going to do video of Betty Spaghetti. That's very good. And then we'll do talk at the TACO trucks and we'll hope that our internet can

Speaker 6:          00:55:49       new from the Taco garage, not machines, three sizes, one system you can build up and customize your heavy duty truck.

Speaker 3:          00:55:57       All right, so this is, this is, this is a little bit slow, but I am going to show you this. So this is, this is the flash version, um, which we built as well. Uh, for people who can't, who is systems can't handle a Ishma five. So we'll try to build it in flash and see what happens. Uh, we're spreading spaghetti. Here's spaghetti video and then talk a truck's. Here we go, yes. Audio and we'll see if this will work. I'm so, I'm sorry. Starting to build a curriculum around this, right? It's all fair use. It's all transformative. Um, education in all purposes is another, is another fair use. Well, it seems like our Internet here is a little slow anyway. You can go play with this cause it's online. See if you go to a, if you were to gender remixer a.com, you can play with it and you can make your own. I'm the cool thing about this one. Let's see if it works

Speaker 9:          00:56:52       from the top three sizes. One system you can build up and customize your heavy duty truck. Tons of parts get drop the motor into any modern machine, Tonka mom, that's a top.

Speaker 3:          00:57:07       Um, and so with the flash version right now, we had it set up so you can download that to your desktop or you can send it directly to youtube. You can put on your own youtube channel. And so when, when you, um, are, are building things and, um, I think about this in terms of, you know, in terms of Remix, in terms of seeing the world as not just something that you're given, but something that you can make something out of. Um, and you can sort of talk back to this is this is, this is the one on one of the first stages, right? It sort of a gateway, right? So you, you start by making something in one of these applications and then you can learn the tools to go and make things, um, uh, on your own. Even if you, you know, went when I, when I've done this workshop before, even when a young people go home and don't necessarily make another remix their thinking in that way, or they've already, they, they're, they're going in, they're watching television and then not watching him the same way, right? They're watching it in terms of what they, what's behind it and how it's built and what maybe they could do with it. Um, and so even if they don't actually make something, again, that the, in terms of critical media literacy skills, um, they're starting to see that, that, that process and what's behind a lot of it out that made you, so I think I'll stop here and we'll can do questions. Um, and, uh, I'm willing to stay for however long people want. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:58:16       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:58:25       you don't have questions? I'll just keep talking forever. Right now. I'll say rewrite blowing line with the Obama White House.

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       Great. Um, do you have any inkling as to how that will change beer use? Um, given his track record of not hopeful, um, uh, the Obama White House has been, we talked a good talk and then when they got in there, they have been pretty much doing whatever the, um, in a way, whenever the big media companies want, uh, tried to spin it. Um, the way that a lot of the sort of fair use stuff is one and defended his bike by a makers and the lawyers and remixers who get together and challenged and stuff. Um, and,

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       uh, just last year there's something called the DMC I right. The digital Millennium Copyright Act. Um, there's an exception for fair use for educational purposes and for, um, uh, for critical commentary, right. Uh, and every year or every time it comes up for review with the industry, uh, immediate district tries to get those exemptions are projected and reduce or reject fair use. Um, and they come up with these ridiculous, uh, schemes, you know, like you will, you can use a DVD if you, you know, if you film it with a digital camera off a screen in a dark room for 30 cm, like all this stuff, right, which is not what fair you says, but they're there. They're trying to, to limited. Um, and there've been some fantastic organizations like organisation called the Organization for transformative works who has been trying to change that. And last year they actually want a great exception, um, which is sort of already in fair news, but it wasn't, it wasn't, uh, it wasn't, uh, in the DMC A and it's, it basically says that you're a Latin, you are now allowed to rip DVDs for fair use purposes.

Speaker 3:          01:00:28       Before you weren't allowed to do that, which is a little ridiculous. You would actually have to pirate to the media to be legal. Right. Because, because, you know, even though you could use the media in a free and fair use, the active decrypting, the DVD was illegal. And so he couldn't get the footage to use in your classroom because you couldn't do it through. So what people would do is they would download off the internet because someone else had decrypted it. They had done the illegal thing. Right. That obviously ridiculous. And, and, and, and, and the court found that, that they made an exception to the DMC I last year saying, well, you know, if you're doing it for a fair use, you've hit now decrypt the DVD. And that's also fair. Um, so I feel like the fights that are happening are happening on, on the, on, on the advocacy. We that, but, and I think that's where, yeah, that's where I have faith that things can change. I hope that's helpful.

Speaker 3:          01:01:24       Oh, go for it. Do you see videos and those educational media interactive for, for what purpose? Just educating the mass public. It certainly is a very popular one. I feel like I'm, you know, when I, when I remixed things, um, I do it because I want people to see it and I want a, I want a large audience. I don't necessarily just want an audience that agrees with me already or is in my specific field. Right? Um, and that's why he's popular culture, because popular culture is this sort of shared language, right? Um, it sort of a common point that we can come together and say, okay, well we all understand this reference point. Now we can talk about what it means. Um, uh, traditionally fine art video for instance, hasn't done that. Everybody who has been, um, created, uh, for the most part for other artists and for galleries and for academics.

Speaker 3:          01:02:24       Right? And so, um, what would I like about video, especially pop culture video, is that it creates this, this, this space to have conversation about some sort of very serious, and I think deep issues. Um, you know, uh, I, uh, I also use video formats. I think most people do video formats that are also understandable, right? So we all know what a trailer is, right? The trailer is actually a very abstract thing, right? It's a, in terms of filmmaking, it's not a narrative really. It's sort of a, it's, it's meant to give you the essence of what something might be right in order to see if you want to watch the entire thing. Maybe that's an abstract concept. There's, and you might get like hints of narrative, but it's not a narrative. It's a, it isn't, it's abstract. Um, and the same way with tea, with TV ads, TV ads are meant to give you an impression of a feeling that associates with, with a brand usually.

Speaker 3:          01:03:12       Yeah. They're usually not, this is cheap at this price. Buy It. It's been, it, it's cheaper than over here. Like that's not actually what most ads are. They're about there. They're there about, uh, making a brand emotional. And so, um, a lot of remixers we'll then use ads because ads are, again, in abstract form that people understand. Right? And music video, we all understand what it means. The video is right. Even though it's actually a very abstract thing. Um, uh, and so, uh, if you're using those vehicles, you know, like trailers and ads, right. That's, that's, that's another way to, to reach people that, that, that maybe haven't been to, um, I mean he criticism class, but do you know where trailers and now they know where the trailer, it looks like when it's, you know, when it's said Richard Dreyfus falling in love with jaws.

Speaker 3:          01:03:56       Right. Which is a whole different thing, but it's anyway, it's, he gets inside of that those Frank's right, that, that, that vehicle frame and the abstract frame. But it's, it, it's a way to communicate those ideas to people. Um, um, I think in a much more populist way. Right. Um, so does that sort of answer that question? I mean, I think that, I think the educators are sort of lagging behind in this field. I think that, um, uh, certainly, you know, half the students in this building or on youtube right now and looking at video, either learning or laughing or both. And, uh, and I feel like once you come into this end, to the end of the classroom, that should, that should carry over video should become an integral part because it's part of the way people engage with the world. Um, and it's increasingly the way that people engage with the Internet as well.

Speaker 6:          01:04:45       Videos, Ada compliant.

Speaker 3:          01:04:49       That's a good question. Um, well, so here's what I do. Um, and it depends actually, it actually, that kind of means a lot of things. Um, what I subtitle everything first of all. So, um, and I use a universal sub subtitles, which is a free sub title tool, um, to give captions, um, as the, those captions are in that program. Um, uh, then I use translation tools to let other people translate. So it sort of broadens the reach, um, in as much as youtube is then yes. As much as youtube isn't there. No. Right. So, um, the infrastructure that people are using for a lot of this video work right now is, uh, is sort of based on what these corporations have made available. Right. Um, Youtube, uh, is working on it. So they say we're going to a lot of things. So they say, and they're trying to make it better.

Speaker 3:          01:05:51       Um, they did that. They, you know, they have, they have, um, they have, uh, their voice to text tools. I don't know if he's ever used them. They're not very good yet. Um, I find that, uh, that one of the, one of the easiest things to do is to read a transcript. And this is something that, that I, um, that I, that I advocate for it with all my videos and with other people who do videos, you know, just making it make an English transcript, uh, if, if it's an English, upload it to Youtube, uh, upload it to wherever the video is so that at least that option is available. Um, and then, uh, with html five or it's, I mean, these are each trying to five videos that are embedded, um, here. Uh, and there's a whole bunch of, of, of, of add ons that you can work with, right.

Speaker 3:          01:06:42       And so those are sort of very slowly being developed. I mean, for instance, this presentation will only work in a, in two browsers, right? Right. Now there's, you know, it's not quite there yet, but the possibility for, for, for, for having video be integrated in I think a much more accessible way does exist with Asian or five where it didn't exist. Right? You're, you were stuck in youtube before. Um, and like you saw with the, with the dynamic and the annotations happening, right? [inaudible] you can imagine that being done, um, uh, with accessibility in mind. Right? And building a whole app around that. Um, and so because this is all very experimental, you know, people are sort of just beginning to, uh, to, to, to play with that. But I mean accessibility is, I think for me crit critical and is going to be critical for the web. And I know that youtube, at least Google is, is it at least says it's important to them. So

Speaker 2:          01:07:42       you said yesterday when we were talking about loving the sores, talk a little bit more about that. For example, the dog gone thing versus, Hey, I'm struck by is that music takes me back to when I was like eight cause I watched the same things on the Disney channel. There's somebody installed a trip there, but you have to stare at these things for days. How do you do months?

Speaker 3:          01:08:04       How do you do it? Well, so it's, it's um, they're shipped to traditions, I feel like, and this is a home top, but there's two, two, two, two traditions of sort of subversive remix video. One of them and they both go back to the mid seventies. Um, one of them is called a jammy or meaty, jammy. Uh, and that is a pro practice of sort of ridiculing media through remix video, right? So we can go back to, uh, the emergency broadcast network or Ebn, right? Um, uh, we can go back to a whole bunch of groups that were doing that kinda stuff. The video scratchers in the early eighties in, in the UK. Um, often the relationship that those meaty jammers have with media is entirely, um, is entirely negative, right? They are looking at media as a, as a, as a brainwashing tool, Matt, mass mass media, right?

Speaker 3:          01:08:59       And that and that, therefore they're going to ridicule it. Right? And I'm not saying that that work. Um, there's a lot of fascinating stuff that goes on with that work, but that's one type of relationship that is not necessarily the relationship that I'd had with all media. There's another tradition called the [inaudible], which goes back to 1975, which is fans per primarily, um, doing what is essentially fan fiction with video. Um, you know, I'm using music and using, um, and using, uh, uh, clips from mostly TV shows, but increasingly some movies as well to create using the lyrics to change the meaning of the, of the visuals. Visuals are changed, the meaning of the lyrics and create a new sort of fanfiction style story that makes an argument or celebrates a character or does a character study or whatever. Um, and that, and their relationship with their source is very different.

Speaker 3:          01:09:48       Um, they are also transforming and appropriate in media and they have something to say about that media, but it's often a sort of very sympathetic relationship with their, with their, with their source. Um, the way that I approach it as I take a little bit from both. Right. So, typically one of my sources will be something I really enjoy. Um, I feel like if you're gonna spend between three and six months on a project at watching this floor storage every day, you probably don't want to hate every minute of it, right. Unless you're, you know, you're enjoy pain, you know. Um, and so, you know, so I did a remix where I remixed the show. So you think you can dance with the presidential debates from 2008 and let me tell you, I did not enjoy the time I spent with the presidential debates. Uh, it was excruciating and painful and every minute of it, I know I spent as much time with the transcript as I could because I didn't actually want to watch the video again.

Speaker 3:          01:10:42       Um, but, uh, but then I mixed it with, so we think and dance, which I actually is a show that I, that I enjoy. Um, I feel there's a lot of constructive criticism, sort of constructive criticism, reality TV show model as opposed to the ridiculous and making everyone cry model, which is the more the x factor kind of thing. So, um, uh, so be at the auditions are a little bit sketchy, but after the auditions I feel like, you know, so I think in dance is actually gets to a lot of sort of feels very, it feels very different. And so I liked that show. I Oxford like the dances and so I could like stop with Mccain and Obama and go to, so wash them dances and you know, really, um, and enjoy my, my, my process with, with, with that source. And I was kind of a fan of that source.

Speaker 3:          01:11:24       And so now for me, I really love aspects of one thing and I really dislike aspects of something else. Um, but I think what that gets back to is to, is this idea that in the United States especially, we have this idea that you're, you, you either love something or hate something, right? It's sort of like this, this, this rigid, dogmatic binary. Um, but I, I feel like when you're engaging with media and when a lot of people are engaging with media that isn't made specifically for them. Like, I'm very lucky because most media is made specifically for me. Like literally, they have a picture of me in mind, right? A white, straight middleclass, uh, English speaking American, you know, um, uh, and so they're making it for me. I, Star Wars was made specifically for me, mostly because most of the people who were making these things are me.

Speaker 3:          01:12:13       Right? I mean, there, there have been exactly my age and exactly my, and everything. So, um, uh, so I sort of expect everything to be made for me. And so when it's not made for me, I get all annoyed. Right. Um, uh, or I used to, uh, and, but if it's not made for you specifically, like if, if I happen to be a, if I happen to be queer, then I will notice that this not made for me. Um, I, I can still enjoy it. Right? Probably we'll probably do, but, uh, find something missing. Right. Um, and so, you know, and if you're coming from, um, uh, from various other ethnic communities in the United States, you notice that media is not made for you. Um, and so often people, what we'll do when they watch media is, is that that they'll have a critical engagement, right?

Speaker 3:          01:12:54       Just in sort of a casual curriculum and engagement, which is that you can like some aspects of it and be critical of other aspects of it. Um, and what fans and fan fiction often does. It says, well, you know what, I really love the story. I really love the concept. I really love being on the spaceship or whatever. But it would be nice if there were some people who kind of were like me, I'm on a ship or, or people that I know. Um, and so, uh, that's that relationship, right? It says loving something but being critical at the same time and not having those things contradict. And I feel like, um, when I approach my, my work, I try to come from that perspective.

Speaker 6:          01:13:28       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:13:32       Well, software do you use, uh, well that's a good question. I have a small list here. Assuming the Internet still works. Um, it might be, yeah. Oh No, it's fair. It's just, it's just slow. Uh, so I have some of the tools up here on platform makes video. Um, so I use these, these are mostly the free tools right now in terms of like actual editing a, I'm using a falcon pro. Um, but that is because there's no open source alternative. Uh, there will be, as of December 19th, December 19th, I will no longer be using, uh, I've, I'm gonna be using pocket probe using light works and let works as an open source professional video editor. Um, uh, for instance, detecting things that the king's speech which won the academy award was edited. Using light works. Um, the Beta is available for a PC and on December 19th basis, they promise it will be available for Linux and Mac.

Speaker 3:          01:14:32       Um, and so, uh, I'll, I'll move to that. Um, uh, I use these, these various tools to acquire media as well. Um, I mean I get money from everywhere and I get the, any from, from youtube and I get media from, uh, from bittorrent. I get media from me. I mean, depending on where I can get it. Uh, I ripped DVDs, you know, all, all the, all anywhere. You can kind of get it. Um, uh, in some cases you have to, you know, the crew though the Donald Duck one, there was one clip, there's a clip of the Ajax employment agency. And so if you don't know a lot about Disney does Disney, and you're like acme, the Acme company, the Acme Corporation is this big looney tunes. Like it literally is the only company and all of Linton's. Well, in Disney it's called Ajax. So it's the same concept.

Speaker 3:          01:15:11       There's one company. Um, and so there's this, there's this great scene where, you know, there's a, the Ajax employment agency, and that was a piece of footage that I really wanted to use. However, that piece of footage only exists as filler footage between other cartoons, uh, on the wonderful world of Disney television show aired in the 1970s, eighties. So if you don't have that and no DVD, so if you don't have that, uh, can I do it? So I had to find someone who was a collector and who was like a obsessive compulsive collector of Disney material who had a recording at when the show aired in the mid eighties, I think on, um, on the BBC in Manchester in the UK. And he had a video tape of it and it was able to trade with him via a very long process. Something else that he didn't have there was also very rare, uh, so that he would then make a DVD rip of that fee videotape. And then, right. So there's a lot of software involved in all that stuff. Um, uh, but this is the main stuff that I use and I'm going to, I'm out with my, on my, on my workshop tomorrow. I'll talk about it, we'll go over it

Speaker 2:          01:16:19       on your, on your list of topics. I say you have a negative one in there. And a negative, as I recall, was about 10 years ago. Got to a massive copy, right? Metals, yes. A bad name to. Yes. And, um, my question is when you're talking about about locking higher cars, directors were risking that richer, more powerful kind of shut you down. Um, and why do you, why? The question is how have you, I mean obviously you're here at tech. That's what'd, which, which is the corporation that is basically written the cover. It was, was it just the United States right now? Um, so, so when you're advocating the use of this up was remission, um, are you not also suggesting that people are not completely aware of all the power sectors? Maybe asking for a lot of troubles? I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       you could get into a lot of trouble this. Yeah. I mean, yes, yes and no. I feel like, um, some of the reasons why I say yes and no, it's because of the provisions in the DMC. Yay. Um, so for instance, I was to Remix Disney. First of all, Disney's didn't care so much about copyright, how strangely, they care a lot about trademark. Uh, and so, uh, what they care about is whether I sell a tee shirt with Mickey mouse on it and they don't get the profits. That's what they care about. Or that I put Disney on the side of my daycare center or something. That's what they care about, what they, they, but you can watch every single Disney cartoon from the golden era on Youtube. They have been uploaded by whoever for free. And because I think that they're, their reasoning in that is that this has just sort of more brand recognition and that's good.

Speaker 3:          01:18:01       Um, so, uh, I wasn't actually afraid of being sued by them for that reason. Uh, this is not commercial projects, so I thought that was okay. I also have, um, a lot of friends who are fair use lawyers, so I have that in my corner. Um, but even if I didn't, uh, what's the worst that could happen is that I'm not hosting the video or most people are not hosting the video. I mean, I, I'm actually hosting the video, but most people aren't. Most people getting Google to host the video. Right. Um, and in the DMC Aa, the way that it's that it's worded, is it something called the safe harbor provision, which, uh, basically protects, um, youtube or Vimeo or whatever the, the middleman is right from lawsuits. And so what will happen is if they uploaded something that Nike or Disney didn't like or Mattel didn't like me to tell, notorious actually, um, didn't like, uh, they would send a new sort of all happened inside of Youtube, extra judicial process inside of the DMC, a safe harbor, which is like, which is that I would upload something, uh, Disney would send a takedown message, not a notice because it's not legal, it's extra legal to Google Youtube.

Speaker 3:          01:19:11       They would then remove it under the safe harbor harbor version with no questions asked. If I wanted to get it back, I would have to fill out a form that said this. No, I think this is a fair use in hand. Here's why. And it might come back, but I again, I'm not ever being contacted, right. Unless I actually file a counterclaim with Disney. Right. Which is, which is a whole different thing. It's all youtube and youtube system. That's, that's, that's working. So I'm not actually going to be sued, right. Unless I took it and put it the actual video file on my thing on my site, which people couldn't share you, you know, it'd be be be, be a weird thing. It has happened. I think it's becoming, it's be, it's pretty rare and often it blows up in the face of the, of the media company.

Speaker 3:          01:19:51       Right. So it's, um, I feel like, you know, in terms of this one, uh, they just felt like, well, if we say if we take it down, that's just going to make it more popular and you know, we won't do that. So I feel like most media companies are pretty smart about it. Um, if it was a, a project, it would still be fair use, but that, that, that, that might earth than a little bit. I, you know, um, but I'm, I'm actually not concerned. I think there's very, you know, people, the worst that's going to happen to most people is everybody is going to get taken down by youtube and with no legal action taken.

Speaker 2:          01:20:25       Oh, you give an example of how you might describe as a student assignment in a course where you wanted to introduce them to new media, get them thinking about it and actually doing some B, what that assignment would look like.

Speaker 3:          01:20:46       Uh, I can I, can I come to tell you about assignments that I've given and that could be helpful? Maybe. Um, so one of the things that I've found, and this is this true for, um, for organizations that are trying to get people to engage with social media as well. I mean, if you're talking about remix specifically, which is mostly what I do, um, it's often really important to set the parameters for what you expect, right? It's so sort of the last thing you, the I think you want to do is say go make a remix, uh, anything using anything. Um, because often that, that's just so overwhelming, right? Um, I, what would I often advocate for is to say, you know, here's a piece of media or here, two pieces of media, or here's a series of ads, Bucko Cola or whatever it is. Um, and I want you to use them in some way to make a comment on them, but you, you keep, you know, you, you, you want to allow enough creativity for there to be a lot of, um, all of diversity in the response.

Speaker 3:          01:21:41       But you also don't want to sort of allow for anything because that will be a really overwhelming I think. Um, and so often what I'll do like, you know, in terms of the, of of the re mixing tool, right? Um, there's, there's 800 possibilities and they're all different possibilities, but it's within a very specific set of assignments. So it's like saying, you know, it's just saying swapped the audio and the video from these two sets of sources and see what you get. Um, um, and so, you know, I, you can do this on, you know, on the web or you could, you could do a similar project you're using, you know, ads for cleaning products and tools and household, adult, you know, gendered stuff. And you could say, swap the audio in the video. Um, there are, uh, image macros is another thing that I then I often will use.

Speaker 3:          01:22:28       Um, so they're all these sites that will allow you to top load a photograph and then each person can type a different sentence onto that, onto that. Right. Um, and so it might be depending on what your image is and what your, what your, what your, what your topic is like the privilege denying dude was about, um, was what was sort of about highlighting in a funny way, a male privilege and the way that it sort of manifests in the tech field especially, but it sort of, you know, went and talk kinds of directions. I mean, there, there was a, after, um, uh, after, uh, the video monster came out, which is a very sort of misogynist, um, uh, video for, uh, Mr. West Song. Um, it, it, someone made a privilege in nine dude of him and do sort of like swapped out, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:23:17       All right, so you're, you're then commenting on, you're using this, this larger meme to comment on a specific artist and a specific song. Um, and so, um, often that kind of thing can be, can be, can be cool. It can be like, well, here's a, here's an image macro where you can type text on top of something. It's about this sort of theme, but then find other other characters that might work. So whether it's Tucker, Tucker, Tucker Carlson was one of them that people used. Um, uh, there was, there was a thing that happened with the Keith Olbermann where he said some pretty sexist stuff and then refuse to apologize for it. People may want of him, you know, for that, that was up for a couple months. And so, you know, the, the privilege of dude mean became more than just, you know, it's, it's very, it's very, very simple. It's, it's one image and two sentences, right? And in infinite combinations, but that's it. And then you can, you can swap out another image on the same theme with two sentences, right? So it's just sort of constricting the possibilities, but in that construction of possibilities to creativity can become even more, uh, even more exciting, I think. So those are just some quick stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:24:37       You mean my life story? You want to know how old field or, um, so yeah. So, um,

Speaker 3:          01:24:47       so it's a, it's a long story. Uh, I want to try to condense it. I tend to go on and on. So, um, I, uh, I was homeschooled. Um, and so, um, for religious and military reasons, um, my family's very conservative and, and uh, which I'm not, but uh, they are. And, um, until I spent a lot of time playing has education. So my, in a very odd way, the reason I was being kept home was because of very, very fundamentalist religious beliefs. But the educational philosophy is that my parents had, was actually very progressive. Um, so it sort of an unschooling process. And so, um, a lot of that was sort of a facilitated or directed play, right? So a lot of Legos and a lot of audio books and a lot of, you know, a lot of projects that I could, that I could sort of follow me out of my interests.

Speaker 3:          01:25:45       Um, and so, uh, you know, in that process of, of, um, of learning, learning was always fun for me. It always about finding things out and figuring things out. And, you know, like, I mean for me, researching the history of, of, of, of the Disney animators at the studio was really kind of fun because, you know, I wanna know what's happening. Each thing I learned, I feel like it's, it's, it's, it's a fun game, right? But I feel like that a little bit unique to a very specific kind of homeschooling. Oh, philosophy. And, um, and so when I went, when I did go to high school, I went to a magnet art school in Baltimore City. And, um, and it was, it was sort of a, it was a very, uh, it was very structured, but it was also a, you know, it was it an art school.

Speaker 3:          01:26:26       So I was doing picker painting and drawing, and I was doing, I was really interested in, in, in, in, in artistic creation. Um, I went to, I went to college, I went to school. I had no grades, no attendance records, you know, um, uh, there was no required courses. I mean, you could literally not go the entire semester, but then you wouldn't get any credits. I mean, the way that you got credits was that you presented your work, everything you'd done in every field that you were interested in for that entire year, and they gave you credit space on that or not. So 15 credits or zero credits, you still have to pay for it either way. Um, but you, um, that was, that was sort of very hovers it, it's very high pressure and a lot of ways, but it sort of let you self direct.

Speaker 3:          01:27:08       And so that was what I was interested in, in, in, in doing and figuring out. Um, there's also no majors at that school, the museum school in Boston Museum School in Boston, um, no major. So you could bounce between disciplines. I mean, and the, I, the idea being that if you're being, if you're a creative or sort of artistic, uh, in, in, in, in your work, then you will just find whatever medium it is that best represents the idea that you're trying to get across. And so that's what we do. I'd be like, Oh, you know, this, this idea would best work in animation, so I'll go and learn that next semester, you know, or whatever. Um, um, but he allowed me to learn technology in a way that I wouldn't have otherwise, which is that, you know, most of the time I just camped out in the Mac lab and eventually they gave me a job there.

Speaker 3:          01:27:50       And then, uh, cause I was just there all the time and then, uh, and, and learned and taught applications that way, um, including video editing. Um, and then when the, when the war in Iraq started, I was very upset and, uh, I took the, just recorded the TV ads and all and put them together into, into remixes and that sort of how that process happened. And, and, and in that process of, of, of, of doing and learning, you know, I mean certainly there was no class on remix. Um, but doing and learning, um, and figuring out, well, I want to put this on the Internet, but there's no youtube, no, 2003. What do you do? A, I guess you have to find the Kodak and then you'd have to find some software somewhere that we'll put it up. And then you have to, you know, like get a server and like all that stuff. And so I did all that stuff. And, um, and that's sort of how I've learned over time is by doing that, is that helpful? Is that kind of what you meant? And then, then he invited me to come here. So that's the short version

Speaker 4:          01:28:51       five.

Speaker 3:          01:28:54       Yeah. I mean, all of them to leave by the way I look or talk or ask questions. I mean,

Speaker 4:          01:29:23       sure.
