Speaker 1:          00:06          In 1993 comedy Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray has always been a favorite of mine. If you'd asked a younger version of me what the movie was about and I would've said groundhog day is a movie about a cynical's selfish man who must relive the same day over and over again until he learns to care for the people around him and in so doing becomes a better person. It's hard down there at the bottom today. I think I described the plot somewhat differently.

Speaker 1:          00:37          I'd say groundhog day is a movie about a cynical selfish man who must relive the same day over and over again until he's able to learn everything there is to know about his coworker and despite her repeated rejections, use that information to eventually make her fall in love with him. Well, both plot summaries are technically accurate. What I missed as a younger man was an understanding of how movies often presents stalker like behavior as a harmless or endearing part of romantic courtship. How did you do that? I know your face so well. I could have done it with my eyes closed. One Popular Romance Trope in particular provides the foundation for the plot of groundhog day. I call that trope stocking for love.

Speaker 2:          01:32          I would really appreciate it if you would just go away.

Speaker 1:          01:36          If you've spent any time at all going to the movies or watching television, then you're probably already familiar with this romance formula and how it works.

Speaker 2:          01:45          Excuse me. Have you seen the Feminine Mystique? I've lost my coffee. What are you doing here? I heard there was a poetry. You're so Jami.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Wholesome, unwelcome. Our hero is typically a nice guy who doesn't quite fit the Hollywood ideal of manhood and who for a variety of reasons, hasn't found love. One day he happens upon a very special woman and instantly becomes infatuated with her. Time slows down, the music swells and the camera zooms in. These audio visual cues are designed to communicate to us the audience that this is true love, but wait, there's just one small problem. I always wondered if I could a snag your cell phone number or your email before you left. I don't think so, Mike. She doesn't return his feelings. Maybe she's dating someone else. Maybe she's already rejected him. Maybe she doesn't even know he exists or maybe she's just not interested. What's a nice guy to do when faced with such a dilemma? Well, he's certainly not going to give up. No, he'll do whatever it takes. This is true love after all or it will be once he convinces this woman to love him back and so to that end, our hero proceeds to spy on her pastor her and otherwise manipulate her until he finally manages to wear down her defenses and she agrees to go out with him.

Speaker 3:          03:31          Yes. Will you leave? This is my job. 8:00 PM tomorrow. Fine, fine, fine.

Speaker 1:          03:39          As a media convention, stocking for love can be traced all the way back.

Speaker 3:          03:43          The classic Hollywood got this cabinet one

Speaker 1:          03:48          and it's a mainstay of both Bollywood and European cinema. Even though stocking for love is most commonly associated with romantic comedies, what's often overlooked is the tropes prominence in other genres. Have you been following me, especially superhero stories.

Speaker 4:          04:07          I knew it just once a day. Sometimes sometimes more.

Speaker 1:          04:18          In these narratives, a man's obsessive coercive or stalker like behavior is framed as an expression of his love and devotion. If I really have it saw it, I'll ride by her house, my bike, I'll do it like, like a hundred times in a day. It's really, it's intense. And even if the woman in question is initially upset or annoyed by his obsessive attention, his actions are inevitably framed as a compliment.

Speaker 3:          04:52          I don't really know you that well, but you seem like a fine person and I want you to know that I'm flattered by all this.

Speaker 1:          05:00          The trend in more recent media is to lamp shade, romantic stalking, lamb shading is when writers directly acknowledge immediate trope were cliche in the dialogue itself.

Speaker 3:          05:13          Hi, Max. I'm Dustin and Lucas. Yeah, I know the stalkers.

Speaker 1:          05:19          But remember that acknowledgement alone isn't the same thing as criticism or subversion. So for example, in the popular Netflix series, stranger things, Max calls out Lucas's stalker like behavior.

Speaker 3:          05:33          What is the shift? Stalker? Sorry, I just needed a safe place, a safe place to what? Be Creepy.

Speaker 1:          05:40          But in the end, Lucas still gets the girl even after he stalks her, tricks her and traps her alone in a room with him. No. On one level, the popularity of this trope is understandable. Most people want to feel like we're special, like we're worthy of romantic attention from someone we like. And most people really want to believe in the idea of love at first sight. But while it may be nice to imagine sweeping your crush off their feet, the truth is that much of the behavior we see in these movies could very easily land you in jail.

Speaker 4:          06:19          Did you get in here? I like watching you sleep. So it's kind of fascinating to me.

Speaker 1:          06:28          In the real world, stalking isn't romantic. In fact, it's a crime. And beyond the legal implications, stocking can also have a serious emotional effect on the victims leading to anxiety, paranoia, depression. Yes, me or even PTSD.

Speaker 4:          06:51          I'm sorry, did I scare you? I'm just a little on it.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Stalking encompasses a wide range of behaviors, including following someone repeated unwelcomed communication, showing up at a person's workplace, residents or school uninvited. Are you sure about this, sir? We might have some constitutional issues here. Patriot Act, as well as spying on tracking or monitoring an individual, either online or offline. Vr have these amazing Isaiah. This is the type of conduct that we expect from the villain in a horror movie, but pop culture, media consistently frames each and every one of these behaviors as something romantic, curvy. How are you? I'm obsessed. Thank you very much. Now I should say that occasionally the roles are reversed and we see a woman's stocking a man, and we'll talk about that in a minute, but since men are most often the ones who perpetrate this kind of behavior, I want to focus on what this trope communicates about men, masculinity and love. The specific circumstances and severity of the stalking behavior will vary from story to story.

Speaker 4:          08:10          What are you doing here?

Speaker 1:          08:12          Well, I tried to call, but how did you get my address?

Speaker 4:          08:17          The library.

Speaker 1:          08:19          But the bottom line here is that these male characters all refuse to respect women's boundaries, women's personal space or women's privacy. I have a boyfriend. I'm sorry. Make it have a boyfriend so you can get rid of me. No, I'm not. What's his name? Then they don't listen to women's words. I brought you flowers and they ignore all signals of disinterest or rejection. Why don't I just put these in the same water? In short, they refuse to take no for an answer. Stocking for love usually culminates in some sort of grand romantic gesture. These are public spectacles that are designed to demonstrate the depth and intensity of our heroes, feelings for the woman of his dreams.

Speaker 5:          09:29          Right.

Speaker 6:          09:32          Bye.

Speaker 1:          09:35          Now, of course, romantic gestures are not always troubling. If two people are already in a relationship or if their feelings have been openly communicated, then it can be really sweet. I thought this was a good idea and it feels kind of, it feels a little stupid and depending on the context, it might be okay to humbly and privately ask for a second chance. As we saw in the recent Romcom, the big sick, what do you take me back? But that's not how it typically happens in Hollywood. In most movies, grand romantic gestures are designed to be elaborate and bushes and bushes that put women on the spot in a very public way. Yo, just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. There's an undercurrent of coersion running through these schemes because they set up situations where the woman in question will appear callous. We're heartless if she rejects the guy again after he's gone through all the trouble of pulling off his elaborate stunt.

Speaker 1:          10:49          Since these are movies we're talking about, filmmakers usually give us a window into the hidden feelings of each character. This means that we as the audience have access to information that the male suitor doesn't. Information that makes us more willing to overlook his intrusive behavior. So for instance, in the classic 1989 Teen Romance, say anything, we know that Diane broke up with Lloyd because of pressure from her father. Hello, but we also know that she secretly wants him back. That piece of insight or information makes this iconic scene seemed like a touching gesture. The problem is that Lloyd doesn't know how she's feeling at this point. He only knows two things. First that she explicitly told him she didn't want to see or talk to him. And second that she's ignored his many phone calls after the breakup. Given these two pieces of information, Lloyd decides it's a good idea to show up at her father's house and blast Peter Gabriel's in your eyes through her bedroom window. A song that has significance because it was what they listened to when they were having sex for the first time. Imagine an ex lover pulling a stunt like that after you've broken up with them and told them to stay away from you. Nothing about it would be romantic. It would be creepy in the extreme and probably cause for calling the cops.

Speaker 4:          12:22          Oh, hi.

Speaker 1:          12:26          The now infamous sign guy from love. Actually

Speaker 6:          12:29          it's Carol saying is

Speaker 1:          12:31          professors his love for the woman. He's been obsessive. Lee videotaping and who also happens to be the new wife of his best friend.

Speaker 4:          12:39          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:40          inexplicably sign guy is rewarded for his creepy and deeply inappropriate behavior with a kiss. Romantic stocking at its core isn't really about love at all. It's extremely selfish behavior because it's all about the stalkers own personal feelings. Any potential discomfort, fear, or embarrassment on the part of the stockers target is rarely ever considered.

Speaker 6:          13:08          Behold, Jessica Riley, you are my soul mate. The love of my life. I have marked myself for the scarlet Jae, Jessica Ravi gets out from there.

Speaker 1:          13:26          The notebook offers an added layer of emotional manipulation. It's the romantic gesture.

Speaker 6:          13:34          What

Speaker 1:          13:37          will you leave me? No choice then Ryan Gosling's character not only refuses to take no for an answer when I ask you one more time, he threatens to kill himself. If his love interest doesn't agree to a date,

Speaker 6:          13:50          they'll in the head slipper. Okay. Okay, fine. I'll go out with you. I'll do me any favors.

Speaker 1:          13:59          In the critically acclaimed dead poet's society knocks overstreets decision to persistently pursue a young woman from a different school who he doesn't know and who already has a boyfriend is framed by the film as his car pay DM moment,

Speaker 4:          14:13          Tom Tom. Yet

Speaker 1:          14:16          when he kisses her while she's passed out at a party, it's not depicted as assault. Instead, his actions are represented as overcoming his self doubt and learning to live life to the fullest knocks his character. Arc is part of a pattern in Hollywood coming of age stories, a pattern where confidence building for boys often comes at the expense of women's boundaries and women's personal autonomy. Movies have taught us

Speaker 3:          14:52          that never giving up is one of the most admirable traits of all, especially for men. I know how I can get to her. What I know how I can get. Declare, John, you got to drop this thing. I can't do this anymore with you. Okay. It's been several months and you haven't heard anything from her. She hasn't returned your phone calls. She's never responded to one of your letters. She didn't respond to the candy gram. Right. I think it's very obvious at this juncture that she just flat out does not want to see. Yeah, I disagree.

Speaker 1:          15:21          Well, it's certainly true that determination can be a very positive thing. That's only the case when it doesn't ignore the desires of other people or end up violating someone else's privacy.

Speaker 3:          15:33          How are you now she's in here some costumes. Stocking the Fox stuff.

Speaker 1:          15:38          Sometimes writers attempt to justify stocking behavior by framing it as necessary to keep women safe from the dangers posed by other men in these kinds of stories, protecting women from attacks by strangers is depicted as a selfless gesture.

Speaker 5:          15:57          Get in the car

Speaker 1:          16:00          a gesture that proves a man's love as well as his manhood. Did you follow me?

Speaker 5:          16:09          Oh, I feel very protective of you.

Speaker 1:          16:18          Stocking for protection. Storylines are troubling for a whole host of reasons, but chief among them is the fact that regardless of the intentions behind it, stocking does not make women feel safer.

Speaker 3:          16:31          You know, being stocked isn't really a big turn on for girls

Speaker 1:          16:36          counter to what television has led us to believe. Women are far more likely to be assaulted by men they already know then by strangers in dark alleys. Stocking for love isn't framed as something worthy of genuine concern. It's depicted as just a temporary lapse in judgment fueled by passionate feelings.

Speaker 3:          17:00          How could you do that, ted? How could you have some guy you don't even know spy on me?

Speaker 1:          17:06          In some instances the romantic stocker might confess or apologize once he's caught, but rarely are there any lasting negative impacts or meaningful forms of atonement. I did it because I never stopped thinking about you. You are so infuriating. If he comes clean, his transgressions are quickly forgiven and in most cases, his manipulative ploys to spend time with her under false pretenses have already worked their magic and proven that he's Mr. Right? The message is clear. Anything can be overlooked as long as it's done in the name of love. A man's deception is lies. His trickery is none of that disqualifies him from a romantic relationship and even if the two don't get together in the end, he's still shown to be a nice guy and he's often given a consolation prize. Maybe it's a kiss, maybe it's naked photos or maybe it's a different woman. In reality, of course, the willingness to flagrantly violate someone else's space and someone else's privacy is a major red flag. It's behavior connected to deep seated issues of control and extreme levels of entitlement. When the gender roles are reversed and we see a female character stocking a man, her actions are typically portrayed as manic or unbalanced instead of endearing.

Speaker 3:          18:41          I did not move here because of Josh because that would be crazy and I am not crazy.

Speaker 1:          18:45          This is basically the premise for the TV show. Crazy ex girlfriend. Oh my God. I mean it's right there in the

Speaker 3:          18:51          title. Oh my God. No, I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. Not Crazy. I'm not crazy. Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm crazy. You hear me? You're not crazy. You're in love

Speaker 1:          19:09          stories in which women stock men are part of a double standard in Hollywood. This guy here, oh, you know what? She just left because straight male characters almost never find unwanted affections. Charming or romantic. Sorry.

Speaker 5:          19:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:30          Oh God, I made eye contact. I'm in no way suggesting that stocking behavior is okay when it's done by a woman. It's absolutely not. But I do think it's important to note that the social and cultural implications are different. When media shows women stocking men, statistics show that women are more likely to be the victims of stalking and men are more likely to be the perpetrators. That coupled with the fact that women are also far more likely to be the targets of sexual violence or domestic abuse means that women have good reason to be fearful of men who intrude on their lives. Media employing the stocking for love trope has been shown to have negative effects on people's attitudes and expectations when it comes to courtship, Romance, and love in the real world.

Speaker 6:          20:21          There you go again, putting your hand in places it doesn't belong.

Speaker 1:          20:26          Movies like those we've been discussing in this video served to reinforce a variety of harmful myths about romance.

Speaker 5:          20:33          You want to get back together. Is that it?

Speaker 1:          20:36          These include the idea that women don't really know what they want. That stocking like behaviors are justified when love is on the line and that stalking victims are just playing hard to get. Studies have also found that watching media where stalkers are depicted as dangerous or terrifying, has the opposite effect and can decrease people's belief in myths about romantic stalking. Contrary to what movies tell us, attraction is not the same thing as love.

Speaker 3:          21:13          You don't know me, but my name is Edward Blum and I love you.

Speaker 1:          21:18          Neither is infatuation or obsession, both of which Hollywood consistently confuses for true love.

Speaker 5:          21:25          Oh,

Speaker 1:          21:27          romantic love is mutual and reciprocal. It's an exchange between people and unless your partner develops a form of dementia, romantic love is not something that only one person can feel towards another. There's no reason why Hollywood can't tell love stories where all parties involved treat each other with respect. Even within the realm of mutual fact, there are countless possibilities for quirky or humorous scenarios. Well, she had a boyfriend in the house. Nice boy. Oh No, no. The obstacles to romance can come in any number of forms. Things like family disapproval or illness or geographic location, just to name a few. There's no reason why the central conflict in a romance story needs to involve stalking behavior and honestly, making people feel unsafe is a terrible, terrible way to show you care about them. Valley, you want to ride the Ferris wheel. If you ask someone out and they're interested, great, right? But if they say they're not interested, it's not your job to test them on or to try to figure out if maybe they're just playing hard to get, and rejection is not an invitation to try to coerce them into changing their minds.

Speaker 5:          22:57          What do you take me back?

Speaker 1:          23:00          Sure. Rejection doesn't feel good. It just feels totally different now and I can't do that again. But the respectful thing to do is to gracefully accept no for an answer. Do you understand? Okay. Okay. Thanks for watching these videos take an enormous amount of time to produce, especially for just one person. So if you'd like to see more, please consider going over to Patrion and helping to fund the project there. There's also a link to paypal in the description below. Over the next several months, we'll be talking more about masculinity, love, and the media, including a disturbingly popular action movie trope called abduction for love.

Speaker 7:          23:47          Wow.
