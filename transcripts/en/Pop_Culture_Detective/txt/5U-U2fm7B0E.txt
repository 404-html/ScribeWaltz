Speaker 1:          00:14          Uh, my name is Jonathan Macintosh and I do, I do video remixes and I call myself a pop culture hacker. Uh, which basically means that I pull apart fragments of TV, movies, hop music. Um, I pulled them apart and look for their deeper meanings, um, look for the social and cultural context and implication is, and then put them back together to create a new and alternative narratives. Um, so it's really mixing footage and mixing music, but it's also real mixing the message of that media. I began remixing in 2003. Um, I was watching the US invasion of Iraq.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I was very upset about it. Uh, I was very angry about it and I was watching the news every day, you know, 24 hours a day, pretty much, you know, watching, watching, and recording and also, um, and after the first few days, they start to put the commercials back in, you know, that they had, this is what I have the news report, the commercial, the news report, the commercial. Right. Um, and to me it became, they started to become the same thing. You know, because many of the companies that make the weapons also on the new station, you know, um, and uh, and so I started mixing those two together and I made very short ads and they were about the war and they were about the US involvement in the war. And, uh, the corporatization of war and the profit that people were making off of that, when you cross into the blue, everything is different and important, especially you. I was being critical. And then I also was very upset about the way that the u s media covered the war too. You know, they wouldn't show anyone who was dead. There was no impact really in terms of, uh, of humanity. And it was all about how cool the weapons were.

Speaker 2:          02:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:17          For me, that was distasteful, but it was also, I think the moral, and so a lot of the remixes that I made was to put those images back in. So it's that, you know, mixing the ads for, for cars or, or, um, you know, toothpaste or whatever with the news footage. But then also bringing in some of the documentary footage that we didn't see in the u s um, of, of, of people who had been killed.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Would you like to do with your life? You want to be like the good guys riding around? No, to be honest, I want to be the bad guy. Real bad guys. Bad guys at tie people up. Trump cares about the good guys, bad guys. They're the ones you may go back to class now, Gary,

Speaker 1:          03:27          TV, movies, news, right? A politician's speeches. They're part of the popular culture and they're part of the way the, the language we use to talk to each other. You know, we might meet for a coffee and say, what did you see that on TV last night? And you say, Oh yeah, yeah, I saw that. And we talk about it, right? It's a common language. The common ground through which we can talk about larger issues, you know, race, gender, class, a war, right? And we can do it in a language that's audio visual. We don't have to speak the words so we don't have to use text, but we can also use the videos themselves or the audio itself. Um, as a way of communicating.

Speaker 1:          04:04          One of the projects that I've been doing with, um, young people, Middle School, so like 11, 12 years old, um, uh, I've, I've recorded a bunch of TV ads directed at kids for Gi Joe, for Barbie, for Polly pocket, you know, all these toys and brought them into the classroom. And, and, and we, and these workshops and the young people look at them and then we talk about them. What are the boys doing? What are the girls doing? The boys though are, are creating and they're building and they're making things, but they're also being quite violent. You know, a lot of, a lot of military stuff. Um, a lot of competition, a lot of aggression, right? Whereas on the other side, the young, young women in those ads are being caring and nurturing and some positive stuff too. So we talk about all that. And then I have the kids remix the ads.

Speaker 1:          04:52          You know, just take the audio from the girls' ads and put it on the video of the boys ads for five years, it's suddenly become incredibly apparent. You know, it's just, it's really obvious to everyone and everyone sort of laughing and, right. But you're also seeing it, you're seeing what they're doing, what they're telling you about gender, you're seeing those gender stereotypes and you're breaking them down and creating something new right now, a different vision. Um, and so I find that is a very powerful tool, uh, with, with youth. And then when they, when they go home, hopefully when they go home and watch TV again, they can't watch it the same way because they're always thinking, oh, wouldn't that be interesting if these two things are, what about that? What does the message messaging and what if I mixed it with this? And wouldn't that be funny or interesting? You know? Um, and so it's, it's creating, um, hopefully it's, it's creating in the minds of young people and more critical way of watching television. We're in a dark, dark place. We've got some dark dudes coming our way. Alcaide ran Islamic Jihad
