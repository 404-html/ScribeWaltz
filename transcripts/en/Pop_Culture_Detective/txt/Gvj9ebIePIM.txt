Speaker 1:          00:04          Giant robot.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Steven universe. It's an adventure show about a boy with superpowers derived from an interstellar gemstone in his belly, but in many ways it's also a coming of age story about a young man growing up and trying to find his place in the room.

Speaker 3:          00:29          Some of your weapon. Calm down, Steven, breathe. Oh, it was really close to that time.

Speaker 2:          00:46          Coming of age. Narratives for boys usually involve in education, in sex, sports, hunting or fighting.

Speaker 4:          00:52          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:56          These activities are framed as a sort of rite of passage in stories set in Scifi fantasy or superhero genre is combat is almost always the mechanism through which young men must prove their worthiness. This is usually not framed as outright aggression on the heroes part.

Speaker 1:          01:15          What is it

Speaker 2:          01:17          instead? Justified as the ability to fight back. There are accompanying characteristics like wit, determination, cleverness or confidence, but learning how to be tough and proficient in dealing out violence is consistently framed as a necessary

Speaker 1:          01:34          okay

Speaker 2:          01:36          boys to complete their journey into manhood. As the series begins, Steven Universe appears to be following in the footsteps of these well-worn conventions. Steven wants his own gym powered weapon to help fight off monsters like the other crystal gems. But when he finally does Chondra his weapon,

Speaker 1:          01:57          yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:58          it isn't a weapon, Steven, and this is where the series begins to depart from classic genre expectations. Rather than being disappointed and not getting an offensive or aggressive skill. Steven wholeheartedly embraces his new defensive superpower.

Speaker 1:          02:16          I'll get a shoe this way.

Speaker 2:          02:36          The show continues. It's a version of boy hero tropes. When we find out that Stephen is a healer,

Speaker 3:          02:41          what do you see without my glasses? Did I heal your eyes? But how

Speaker 2:          02:48          his mother had healing tears, whereas Steven has

Speaker 3:          02:52          who sparks? I don't have healing tears.

Speaker 2:          02:57          Yeah, maybe little gross, but when you think about it, that essentially means that Steven possesses healing kisses, healing, affection. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:08          There's something new and exciting.

Speaker 2:          03:18          Okay, you should be better now. So Steven's a healer and his Jim power is centered around shielding others from harm. Now that's especially interesting because in many fantasy stories and video games, those were both considered to be secondary or support skills. Medics and other protective spell casters have often been gendered roles are roles that have been filled by women who stand back and supplement the other warrior classes who have traditionally been myth. This convention has begun to change in recent years, which is a really good sign, but the gendering of these types of roles still remains a pervasive pattern in media giving these kinds of support powers to the male protagonist. He's a fun if pretty straight forward in version, but I'd argue that Steven has another superpower, something that's even more important and even more fundamental to his character and to the show's values as a whole. You see, Steven is in Papic. You might even say he's super empathic.

Speaker 3:          04:16          Steven, your mother had Hayden tears flowed from my gym. She felt real love for those around her. She felt real sorrow when they were hot. You have the rose quartz damn. Now I know that power is in youtube.

Speaker 2:          04:29          Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings or emotions of another person, but empathy is not just feeling bad for someone else. It's actually feeling what they feel and that's an important distinction. It's what separates sympathy from empathy,

Speaker 3:          04:45          spirits, sugar, so it's called, I can feel it. It's hurting and obsess.

Speaker 2:          04:54          Wait, how do you know? I don't, but I could just feel it. She was yelling and she was really freaked out as season one begins. The show's structure seems to be following a fairly standard monster of the week adventure show formula.

Speaker 3:          05:13          Right Ben?

Speaker 2:          05:14          In episode 23 which is appropriately titled Monster Buddies, we start to get the sense that this is not just a show about going on fun adventures and fighting baddies like a lot of other shows in the same genre tend to be at the beginning of that episode. We see the gems fighting a monster just like they have many times before. One more attached to it. This time Stephen reacts a little differently. Did you see it? No. Okay. Let's rewind it and watch it again. Okay, so notice that the creatures arm is damaged during the season calendar.

Speaker 3:          05:55          Seeing

Speaker 2:          05:55          this, Steven expresses for her wellbeing while grabbing at his own arm. Essentially Stephen is super sensitive to others. He possesses the capacity to vicariously experience other people's feelings. When someone else is hurting, Steven hurts. He feels their pain as if it were his own. This kind of super sensitivity is especially rare for boy heroes because in our culture, emotional intuition is still stereotypically associated with women and as such, media often frames. It is overly sensitive girl stuff, but on this show, things work very differently. Well, I think you're pretty great in this universe. It's common for male characters to act in carrying an emotionally sensitive way. You can watch my full episode about that right here. Later, Steven makes friends with another monster and names her sentence

Speaker 3:          06:52          speed.

Speaker 2:          06:56          At first, they're both afraid of each other, but remember from my last video that being afraid is not a negative trait on this show and Steven's fear is reasonable. The monster is indeed dangerous, but Steven is resolute in his conviction that monsters are not all bad, that there is still good in them.

Speaker 3:          07:16          It looks so scary. Oh, hi. It's okay. Hello. Please don't be scared of me. See, I'm not going to hurt you

Speaker 2:          07:31          now. Critically, Stephen's belief that his new monster buddy can be redeemed. It's not framed by the show is childish idealism. Instead, it's looked upon as honorable and commendable.

Speaker 3:          07:44          You don't need to fight. This isn't new. You're not amongst already more. You're more than that.

Speaker 2:          07:54          The larger lore of this universe also works to validate Steven's empathetic convictions. Recall that the crystal gems all have extra terrestrial superpowers because of their gemstones in the episode ocean gym, we learned that all the monsters are heroes have been fighting each week are actually gems themselves or more accurately. They once were gems, but they've been, huh?

Speaker 3:          08:18          I can't believe lapis would do this. Jim shouldn't fight each other. We're always fighting. Chems actually what? Oh, how do I put this? All gyms aren't necessarily good. They're all those monsters. We've got used to be just like acid, right, for all, yes, but they've become corrupted and broken. We have to take care of them. Do contain them. It's the best we can do for them for now.

Speaker 2:          08:46          This also illustrates one of the core values of the show, which is the belief in the possibility of transformative redemption. The truth is, rose, I tried to use

Speaker 3:          08:56          her powers to save these months just too, but she was never able to heal them. Never. But if she couldn't do it, who knows? Maybe when you have better control of your powers, you might help them in ways even your mother couldn't even this one. I'll keep it safe

Speaker 2:          09:13          and Steven, along with his supercharged empathy are often the voice of that message.

Speaker 3:          09:18          Wow. Wait for me, centripetal, I promise you, you up Sunday he sees

Speaker 2:          09:28          Daptiv possibility in everyone and everything, even when the much more experienced gems, maybe a little skeptical for Steven. No one is unworthy of compassion or empathy, even monsters.

Speaker 3:          09:47          Steven, be careful. This just happened. Maybe I can do something, Jasper, it's okay. I'm here. I just want to try and heal you.

Speaker 2:          10:01          It's uncommon to see this kind of empathy on television, especially when expressed for the bad guys. Well, it's true that most good guys in media do demonstrate some empathy for their friends, their family and their allies. Those feelings are very rarely extended to their enemies. And it's almost unheard of in programming aimed at children, which tends more than most to break narratives down and just simplistic, good versus evil, easy to digest lesson.

Speaker 1:          10:27          Damn

Speaker 2:          10:29          in most animated shows, the bad guys simply can't be reformed. If you look at everything from say duck tails to the Batman Universe, you'll notice that the villains are by and large framed as evil by nature. Villainy is not just something they do. Villainy is what they are. Prisoner will stand. So any attempt at rehabilitation is ultimately doomed to fail. And the belief in the possibility of redemption is therefore often framed as foolish or naive or worse, something that can actually endanger society itself. But on Steven Universe, things are more nuanced. Here. The bad guys don't just do bad things because they're intrinsically or inherently evil. They do bad things because of their history and their circumstances. Now, the bad guys are no less dangerous, but it does mean they're always exists. At least the possibility for redemption. And that possibility is what guides and shapes Steven's action. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:35          Wait, let me turn this off.

Speaker 3:          11:39          Hey, how's it going? Can you hear me? Are you in there somewhere?

Speaker 2:          11:45          And this brings us to the final point I want to make in this video. A critical part of Steven super empathy is that it's always actionable. The actionable part is key. Not only does he feel for others,

Speaker 3:          11:57          oh, she's coming back. He also does something about it. Alright, everyone be supportive.

Speaker 2:          12:04          Steven consistently intervenes to deescalate and resolve conflicts.

Speaker 3:          12:08          I don't want to fight anymore. I said Hi.

Speaker 2:          12:17          In the episode ocean gem, we get to see Steven using all of his superpowers to de escalate a potentially cataclysmic situation. He ends the fight and ultimately resolves the conflict by talking it out with the antagonist.

Speaker 3:          12:30          Lapis, I'm coming up to see you. Lapis. What are you doing here, Steven? What? I know, what are you doing here? This thing, the ocean. This is crazy. Can we work this out with Joe? Should be friends.

Speaker 2:          12:56          Steven talks with her. He listens to her and he treats her with empathy and kindness.

Speaker 3:          13:01          I just want to go home.

Speaker 2:          13:04          In the end. He even uses his healing powers to mend her broken gym even after she's tried to hurt him, his friends and his family.

Speaker 3:          13:20          Thank you, Steven.

Speaker 2:          13:21          Now it's not all Kumbaya in beach city. The crystal gems are not pacifists. Our heroes are often forced into battle, but when that happens, Stephen's still expresses his discomfort. Even when he's under attack. By muting,

Speaker 3:          13:37          they're attacking the drought. What do we do?

Speaker 2:          13:40          So win or lose, the specter of violence and confrontation weighs heavy on his heart.

Speaker 3:          13:49          Something doesn't feel right about this. Then use the d pad. No, it's just these things. We can't just leave their gems out there. They're going to form again later. If I could just bundle them, then they'd be saying, come on. We've got to help them.

Speaker 2:          14:07          And of course there's tension and discord among friends from time to time, sometimes even leading to physical fights, but on this show, those issues are ultimately resolved through means other than violence and domination, often at the insistence of Stephen himself.

Speaker 3:          14:22          So it was all my fault. Ha. You totally weren't even trying to sync with my dancing. You know how I danced by now. Come on guys. Please stop fighting. Why don't you admit it? I'm just in him. Ferris meals. Amethyst please. No more. I know you're upset, but I can't bear to watch you two already each other.

Speaker 2:          14:50          It's Steven's faith

Speaker 5:          14:52          in the possibility of redemptive transformation that drives his efforts to prevent fights. You listen to me now.

Speaker 3:          15:01          You were talking about things that you do not understand. Garnet, stop please. It's not worth it. We're done here. Let's just go home. Come on, baby melon. We have to stop this. It's staffing hearts you so help me. I alone it didn't do anything. Don't hurt it. I accidentally let it out of its bubble, but it didn't even try to hurt me. It's not like the other monsters. It's just scared and confused.

Speaker 2:          15:32          Everything that we've talked about in this episode is extremely rare for boy heroes on TV, but it really shouldn't be. The world could use a whole lot more of Steven superpowers. We need more role models for boys where empathy and deescalation and diplomacy are framed as brave and heroic behaviors.

Speaker 5:          15:49          Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. You get that much need to counterpoint to a cynical worldview.

Speaker 2:          15:54          The good news is that unlike a magical shield or healing saliva, you don't need an interstellar gemstone to practice empathetic behaviors. Now, it may take us some time to learn how to wield them effectively, but we all have access to those very human superpowers.
