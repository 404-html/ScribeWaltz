Speaker 1:          00:09          The force awakens does something that fundamentally changes how we understand star wars or rather it should fundamentally change how we understand star wars. Strangely, the filmmakers seem unaware of the rather profound implications this new narrative has for the rest of their cinematic universe. In fact, one of the major plot points in episode seven inadvertently sets up something of a storm trooper paradox. Can you explain what I mean by that? I want to focus in on two scenes near the very beginning of force awakens that signal. This shift in the star wars myths. First we see a storm trooper bleeding or a franchise about intergalactic war. Very little blood is ever shown on screen and when it is, it holds a special significance. I know in this case the bloody fingerprints mark, this particular soldier,

Speaker 2:          01:23          Portland

Speaker 1:          01:27          Second, a short time later, we see that same storm trooper take off his helmet to reveal a human face and one clearly disturbed by recent events. The removal of a mask to expose someone's true humanity is a recurring motif in the star wars series.

Speaker 1:          01:50          And we've seen hundreds if not thousands of storm troopers before, but we've never seen one with a face. Both of these scenes communicate that under their iconic Armour storm troopers are people, people with feelings and who feel pain both physically and emotionally. The result is that the force awakens does something. No other movie in this long running franchise has ever done before. It humanizes storm troopers. Do you understand why this revelation is so important and how it impacts the rest of the star wars mythology? We're going to need a quick history lesson in the star wars cinematic universe. Stormtroopers are the army of the galactic empire. They're an intergalactic military force, synonymous with space, imperialism and oppression. They're said to be brutal, precise, and loyal soldiers who have undergone extensive military training on these last points to lack good at presenting to people. Only imperial storm troopers are so precise now despite their role as foot soldiers of authoritarianism. Star

Speaker 2:          03:04          ahead,

Speaker 1:          03:05          there's happy, calm, some of the most recognizable pop culture icons on her. The name. Storm trooper is borrowed for special divisions of German soldiers during World War One translated from the original German. These soldiers. Yeah, we're known as storm that they were aggressive and heavily armed assault troops organized into companies known as storm troopers. Store man would later become a paramilitary rank in the Nazi ss under Adolf Hitler in George Lucas is much maligned prequels. The predecessors to storm troopers are introduced in the fall of the republics. Clone Army soldiers were made to order fighting machines all sharing the same genes in the same face.

Speaker 2:          03:51          They are totally taking

Speaker 1:          03:57          by the time the original trilogy rolls around, clone soldiers have been phased out in the ranks of the new imperial storm. Troopers are made up of conscripts and volunteers are now. Fast forward to episode seven and the first order also uses regiments of storm troopers. Here we're told that many of them were kidnapped his children and brainwashed into loyal fighters.

Speaker 2:          04:18          I'm a storm trooper. I call him. I was taken from a family I'll never know

Speaker 1:          04:25          raised to do one thing. Essentially their child soldiers, which I think is especially noteworthy considering the only storm trooper face we've ever seen belongs to a young black man. Every other storm trooper has no face, no name, and no individuality. They are completely dehumanize across eight feature films. They're portrayed as little more than disposable grunt.

Speaker 2:          04:53          Yes,

Speaker 1:          04:53          ten two one eight seven or Finn as he's eventually known in episode seven is the only exception. Finn is an imperial defector who joins the resistance,

Speaker 2:          05:04          obviously. Yes, I am with. There's just as, yeah, I am. What's the resistance?

Speaker 1:          05:09          He's funny. He's emotional. He's brimming with personality.

Speaker 2:          05:13          You're a pilot. You can fly anywhere. Weigel back. Got a family. I've got a boyfriend to boyfriend. None of your business. That's why

Speaker 1:          05:21          not exactly the characteristics you'd expect from someone kidnapped and brainwashed from an early age, but setting that aside, Finn is the only storm trooper out of presumably millions who we see develop a conscience. Are we to believe he's the only one with the ability to resist first order programming? Well, no. It's possible for other soldiers to reject their conditioning. In fact, the first order has a protocol for exactly this kind of noncompliance.

Speaker 2:          05:47          N Two one eight seven proportion to my division was evaluated and central reconditioning. No prior signs of nonconformity. This was his first offense

Speaker 1:          05:58          and yet fin rebels. Anyway, pins very existence stands in contrast to the rest of the storm troopers in the force awakens. I mean on the one hand we have a likable humanized storm trooper who switches sides and on the other hand we have all his fellow storm troopers who the resistance kill without a second and this is why it feels like the film has a confused dissonant relationship to one of its own plot point. Why it feels like it doesn't really buy into it's own premise because if Finn can remain so very human despite years of programming and conditioning, then that must mean the same could be true for all other storm troopers. Unfortunately, the writer's responsible for this movie don't seem at all interested in pursuing any of the morally complex questions that arise from this fact preferring instead to indulge in more action scenes built around blasting more mindless automatons. Can I try that? In fact, blasting stormtroopers has become so mundane that it's an end universe. Jokes often played for laughs. I like this thing. Stormtroopers are framed as easy to kill, both literally and figuratively and they are killed

Speaker 2:          07:20          a lot

Speaker 1:          07:47          over the course of the force awakens two hour and 15 minute runtime. We see a total of 68 storm troopers, shot, stabbed, vaporized, and those are just the ones that we can see die on screen. Again, these are child soldiers that we're talking about here, which is even more reason for the film to at least acknowledge the underlying tragedy, but there are circumstances but it never does. I mean it's easy to imagine a more emotionally complex plotline perhaps something that focuses on a group of disillusion storm troopers who organize a resistance sell to subvert the first order, but from the insomnia. Remember the fins awakening is triggered not by the death of some innocent villager but by the death of his friend. A fellow, a storm trooper.

Speaker 2:          08:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:39          This is the event that quite literally leaves a mark on him and yet the film quickly forgets this key transformative moment because minutes later we see Finn Who's being an laughing, what blasting his former teammates. Now you might say that Finn and the rest of the resistance are acting in self defense and you'd be right. I mean star wars is after all a story about resistance and when faced with an oppressive police or military force, sometimes violence may be necessary to achieve liberation,

Speaker 1:          09:24          but having to hurt one group of people in order to help another is always a tragic trade off even if it's necessary. If there's a core message to fins, Redemption Story in the force awakens something that the film really wants us to believe in, it's that people can change and if we accept that, then the possibility must also exist other storm troopers to change as well. Now perhaps their transformation, it's unlikely but not any more unlikely than fins own awakening. And isn't that the idea at the heart of the original star wars trilogy, I know there is good in you. The emperor hasn't driven it from you fully at, they're still exist. Good. Even someone as evil as Darth Vader, because if that's the case, and I think it is, and that means the fall of every storm trooper represents the death of the possibility of redemption, the possibility of another fan.
