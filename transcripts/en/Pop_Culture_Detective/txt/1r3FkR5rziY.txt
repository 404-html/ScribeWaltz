Speaker 1:          00:02          Yeah. I don't want to sound too much like the shelving this, but when I come home and dinner's not ready, I go through the roof. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08          Donald Trump's misogyny is obvious. It's part of his brand. It's one of the reasons why he's so famous in the first place. And I'd argue that nearly everybody already knows it, but while some perceived Trump's sexism as horrifying or dangerous, millions of others don't really think it's that big of a deal. It's the difference between seeing Trump like this versus something more like this. Fire her and don't ever make me talk to a woman that old again. And that rather stark difference in perspective is I think at the heart of why Trump's sexism didn't derail his bid for the White House in the way that most political pundits predicted that it would. Now we'll return to our friend Jack from 30 rock in a moment. We have a chance to make this country great again, but first we have to talk about how the next president of the United States views women treat women with respect.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Uh, I can't say that again.

Speaker 2:          01:13          All right, good. All right. It's not an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump sees women as pieces of meat who primarily exist for male pleasure or as trophies to elevate men's social status. This mentality even extends to his own daughter. I've said that if Ivanka warm my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her. He projects a casual disregard for the idea of consent.

Speaker 1:          01:38          I'll go backstage before a show and everyone's getting dressed and ready and I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. Is everyone okay? You know that they did. They would know is everybody okay? And you see these incredible looking women and so I sort of get away with things like that. She was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen. It was incredible. This is a man who incessantly links the inherent worth of women to their physical appearance and to little else. All of a sudden she's gained, I mean literally she went up from about 118 to about 170 pounds. It was incredible. Well, obviously it's great outer beauty. I mean, we could say politically correct that to look, doesn't matter, but the look, obviously it matters. Like you wouldn't have your job if you weren't beautiful.

Speaker 2:          02:18          All of this is again, obvious and uncontroversial. So what's going on in our culture? When a man can say things like this,

Speaker 3:          02:27          you know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful, I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. You just, I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the Pussy. I can do any of that.

Speaker 2:          02:41          And then millions of Americans, both men and women just shrug it off and support him anyway. Now I don't think the 60 million people who voted for Donald Trump did so because they agree with his sexist behavior, at least not consciously. Sure. Some certainly. But the vast majority don't. Most people are not Internet trolls. During the 2016 election cycle, we saw dozens of republican leaders trying to distance themselves from Trump's misogyny. Yet for most of them, it still wasn't a deal breaker. So we have to ask why. Why wasn't such blatant and unashamed? Misogyny a deal breaker. The answer I'd argue has a lot to do with the ways that our culture normalizes sexism in the sociological sense. Normalization is the process by which a particular attitude, ideology or behavior becomes established and entrenched in social life. It's the cultural process through which we come to expect and accept something as natural and as well normal. The cultural process of normalization is of course multifaceted. It operates within many different institutions simultaneously in families, in schools, in workplaces, in churches, in government and entertainment.

Speaker 4:          04:06          What does a gentleman, but it's

Speaker 2:          04:10          that last one and your team that I want to focus on here on the ways in which mass media, friends, misogyny, and sexism, because as bell hook says, pop culture is where the pedagogy is. It's where the learning is happening. Donald Trump is a reality TV star. He is first and foremost and entertain. He revels in making a spectacle of himself in a society that rewards him with endless, yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:37          media attention instead of hair. I'll say it

Speaker 2:          04:40          well. His outlandish behavior, it's clear to me that Donald Trump is always performing, always putting on a show. For an audience and his overt sexism is an important part of that performance.

Speaker 1:          04:54          We get along very well and there's not a lot of disagreement because ultimately Ivana does exactly as I tell her.

Speaker 4:          05:01          I see. Wait a minute, right? Right. Men, is that right? Trump's right. Brand

Speaker 1:          05:11          of misogyny is so unapologetically over the top that it feels very much like a television caricature. Maybe I could help her realize some other life goal to become a doctor's nurse or a lawyer. It's mistress or even the president of the United States shopping association. I want you to get better because, and I mean this, I'm tired of talking this much tool, a woman. I'm not having sex with this lovable misogynist archetype is found everywhere in pop culture. That's right. Barney Stinson is back on the market. Mothers lock up your daughters. The only reason to wait a month for sex is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old. You have been sexually harassing me. He says the very first day of class, sexually harassing. What

Speaker 2:          05:58          makes no sense to me. Why would I harass somebody who turns me on?

Speaker 5:          06:02          There's the house. I found America's top models looked on the roof on ice and Gisella sunbathing European style.

Speaker 2:          06:13          You can recognize people on Google Earth.

Speaker 5:          06:15          Of course not. I got a buddy of mine at norad to have a spy drone fly over.

Speaker 2:          06:21          The thing about Jack Donaghy from 30 rock and the many other characters just like him, is that everybody knows they're sexist. The characters know it, the show knows it. The audience knows across the board, these characters engage in outlandishly, sexist and sometimes downright massage in his behaviors. What did I do? You don't know. Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains. You don't even know which way is up.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Something going with one of the girls here and maybe it's that Russian dancer with the tattoos, which is the crazy sex drive fender

Speaker 2:          06:57          wide eyed farm girl would get off the bus with big dreams of Broadway. No idea what a casting director could legally ask her to do, hold or lick during an audition, but at the end of the day, there's still framed as lovable, well-meaning guys, amazing guy. He's fun. One of my best friends and he landed this hobby. He's a good guy. By the end of each episode, all has been forgiven again, but no life lessons have really been learned and it is on these characters. Sexism is never presented as serious enough to permanently jeopardize their friendships or their relationships or their jobs. In other words, no, it's not a deal breaker. This is one of the ways that our culture works to normalize sexist behavior. Not by denying that it's sexist, but by acknowledging it and then framing it as mostly harmless. For the record, what do you guys are doing is really creepy? You know what? If it's creepy, do use the internet, military satellites and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine. I'm creepy.

Speaker 1:          08:16          It's a younger man's game. I can't say that I don't miss it. You'd be in your office late at night. The new girl would come in with some flimsy excuse to be there. Oh, Mr O'hare forgot to give you the factory. We'll cook death rates and she laughed at your lame joke touch on the arm. Can you take your reward?

Speaker 2:          08:35          Now to be clear, I don't believe the writers and producers of this media or intending to help normalize sexism. I think they clearly intend to satirize it, but when misogyny is consistently framed as a lighthearted joke, it's signals to viewers that sexism isn't something all that serious. I'd argue that this provides us with a clue as to why Donald Trump's misogyny isn't taken seriously either. If we add a laugh track for Trump's statements about women, he becomes virtually indistinguishable from another TV series. Calm carry. I don't want to sound too much like a chauvinist, but when I come home and dinner's not ready, I go through, but in all honesty, we don't need to add a laugh track because Trump's audience provides one for him ready and he referred to my hands. If they're small, something else must be spoiled. I guarantee you there's no problem.

Speaker 4:          09:34          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:36          Just like a TV show. I think we have to face the hard truth that for millions of people, Donald Trump's sexism is not seen as harmful because it's seen as just more entertaining. Trump excels at exploiting the media landscape where misogyny is framed as just guys being guys and it's something that doesn't make those guys dangerous or scary when Trump or his surrogates are occasionally forced to respond to his most egregious sexism. They do it like this, but this was locker room talk. Notice that statements about locker room talk or not a denial of sexism there, an excuse for it. They're an acknowledgement that yes, Trump's statements may be sexist, but it's mostly harmless. It's just not that big of a deal, but of course misogyny is that big of a deal. Misogyny is dangerous, especially to women on both an interpersonal and a public policy level and Trump's presidency promises to bring with it an attack on women's reproductive rights and a dismantling of protections against gender based discrimination. Do you believe in punishment for abortion? Yes or no. Is a principal at the answer is that it has to be some form of punishment for the woman. Yeah. The important thing to understand is that Trump and his brand of toxic masculinity, do you know how to exist in a vacuum? He doesn't exist separate and apart from the world that you and I inhabit, his rise comes in part because we have failed to challenge a culture that tolerates sexist behaviors even while acknowledging that they exist.

Speaker 2:          11:18          Donald J. Trump be a misogynist, but in a society that reduces sexism to a joke he's widely seen as a level of.
