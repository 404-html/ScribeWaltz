Speaker 1:          00:00          During your travels around the Internet, you may have bumped into the term toxic masculinity. It usually shows up in connection with particularly abusive male behavior. So things like harassment, homophobia, sexism or violent outbursts. But what does it really mean? Well, let's find out now since there tends to be so much confusion and defensiveness surrounding these two words, I think we might need to start off with a really clear example. You know, something that we can all agree on. Okay. Yeah, but honestly, I think he needs his own video. So maybe something else. What do you think you're doing? Okay, that's going to work. This charming fellow is biff from the back of the future series.

Speaker 2:          00:50          Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello. Anybody home? Hello? Hello. Anybody home?

Speaker 1:          01:01          Okay, so let's start with the word masculinity itself. Very broadly speaking, masculinity is a set of behaviors and practices that have traditionally been associated with men and manhood in our culture, and that includes both positive and negative things. Toxic masculinity on the other hand is a loose term that's used to refer to a subset of those behaviors, which are harmful or destructive. It's often used as a sort of shorthand to describe behaviors linked to domination, humiliation and control. It's marked by things like emotional detachment and hyper competitiveness.

Speaker 2:          01:34          Fifth, somebody already asked me to dance. Well, George Mcfly, I'm going with Calvin Klein. Okay. Calvin Klein. Nope, it's not okay. You're going with me. Understand, get your focus off of me. When are you going to get it through your thick skull? Lorraine, you're my girl.

Speaker 1:          01:52          It's also connected to the sexual objectification of women as well as other predatory sexual behaviors.

Speaker 2:          01:59          You know, you want me to give it to you? I'm not that kind of girl. You are and you just don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:08          It's also linked very closely with aggression, intimidation and violence.

Speaker 2:          02:14          You want to take a poke at me? Damn it.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Modifier toxic is used to highlight the fact that these kinds of behaviors carry with them some potentially serious and even deadly consequences. Much of this type of masculinity is relational and as such, it's mostly defined in opposition to anything culturally associated with women, which is why toxic masculinity is driven by this overwhelming fear of emasculation. That is to say the fear of being perceived by others as feminine. And therefore unmanly. Many of the most popular male heroes and movies are depicted as engaging in at least a few of these toxic behaviors.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Well, it's both play

Speaker 1:          03:04          cause they're the good guys. They're actions are framed as admirable displays of strength, power and manhood.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Thank meet Felix lighter. It looks, say hello to Dan. Hi Dan. Didn't say goodbye to Phoenix Madden talk. It's like doc said. I know, I know. If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything. And even when those behaviors are not celebrated, it's often framed as acceptable or normal. And then excused. It's just guys being guys or boys being boys. Just to make sure there's no misunderstanding. I want to make something absolutely clear. This term is not a condemnation of men wore manhood because again, toxic masculinity only refers to a particular set of harmful actions and cultural practices. And none of those behaviors are inherent or biological traits of men. There's nothing toxic about just being a man, but some men do act in toxic ways. So, in other words, toxic masculinity is not something that men are rather, it's something that some men do. All right, so let's return to our friend biff here. Now, biff is an obvious buffoon. I mean, he's a school yard bully. He's like a cartoon villain. His actions are easy to spot and understand is damaging because really toxic masculinity is what defines him as a character.

Speaker 2:          04:37          You heard girls party zone

Speaker 1:          04:41          at every point in back to the future. There might as well be a giant neon sign hanging over biffs head that says, Hey, this is the bad guy. So that's really easy. But things are rarely so clear cuts in the real world. All kinds of men can participate in toxic masculinity, including seemingly normal guys who might also be nerdy or charming or witty or intelligent. Since toxic masculinity is a set of behaviors and not a biological trait. The real man who participate or not really one dimensional character archetypes like biff, and they usually don't do all of the things on the list.

Speaker 2:          05:16          Okay,

Speaker 1:          05:17          okay. Well, sometimes they do, but usually that's not the case.

Speaker 2:          05:23          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:26          there's a mistaken impression out there that toxic masculinity means that everything about masculinity is somehow toxic, but that is not the case. In fact, the term toxic masculinity is used to very deliberately to try to differentiate the more damaging or destructive male behaviors from more positive male behaviors. When it comes to this term, it's really important to understand that it's used to reinforce the fact that there are many different types and formulations of masculinity or as rw Connell puts it different masculinities, and since there are many ways to practice masculinity, we as men can choose not to engage in the more toxic behaviors and instead choose to pursue more positive, empathetic and cooperative forms of masculinity. Now, we only just scratched the surface here, but I'll leave some links and resources in the box below if you want to learn more. I hope this video did give you a better understanding of this term and maybe help clear up some of the misunderstandings about it.
