1
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.320
Program complete.
You may enter when ready.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.390
<v 2>This video series primarily focuses on film and television,</v>

3
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.990
but every once in a while I like to check in on the world of video games and

4
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:19.670
there's no better place to get a sense of what's happening in gaming than the

5
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:23.240
electronic entertainment expo or e three for short.

6
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.131
Every summer,

7
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:30.131
the entire video game industry descends on the Convention Center in downtown Los

8
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.490
Angeles for an extravagant week of video game announcements and demonstrations.

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.570
The highlight of the expo or the press conferences,

10
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.710
which are put on by each of the major video game publishers during which they

11
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:45.130
showcase all their latest and greatest title.

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.283
<v 0>Yes,</v>

13
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.240
<v 2>dozens of fantastically rendered breathtaking world's are on display,</v>

14
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.180
and yet somehow I always walk away from [inaudible] with a profound sense of

15
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.400
disappointment and that's because for all the [inaudible] talented developers,

16
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.320
all the hardware innovation,

17
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.460
all the technological advancements and all the new games,

18
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120
you three can still feel remarkably uncreative year after year,

19
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.940
the gaming industry seems to fall back on one underlying theme

20
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.310
kill or be killed.

21
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.313
<v 0>Wow.</v>

22
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.130
<v 2>After a few dozen trailers that all seem to feature essentially the same style</v>

23
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:51.720
of gameplay.
The whole event can turn into a blur of flying bullets,

24
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.050
swinging swords and fiery explosions and that makes it hard not to feel a little

25
00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:00.770
like Captain Picard on the holiday.

26
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.480
<v 1>What are your here to do?
Asked for a refund.
Nah,</v>

27
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.490
I made a killing freeze program

28
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.920
computer.
This isn't what I wanted at all.
Wants to violent.

29
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:19.670
I'm hit a relaxed,
not a dodge bullets.
Reconfigure

30
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.620
<v 2>gaming is now a $100 billion a year industry and that's billion with a B and in</v>

31
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:33.320
many ways he three represents the face that industry shows to the public.

32
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.150
As such,

33
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.980
the event provides an ideal setting to analyze overarching patterns in the

34
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:40.814
gaming moral.

35
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.650
So this year I did it quick statistical breakdown of all the games featured at

36
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:50.030
the major e three press conferences.
Let's see,

37
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.670
a total of 133 games were shown during these events.

38
00:02:55.671 --> 00:03:00.671
That's only 20 of those games didn't include combat mechanics and 10 of those

39
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:06.700
were sports or racing games.
A detailed breakdown looks like this.

40
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.800
82% combat free percent minimal or incidental combat,

41
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.040
5% sports,
3% racing,

42
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.460
1% for dancing with just 7% leftover for all other combat games.

43
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.390
The fact that 82% of the games featured at e three our combat focused

44
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.330
illustrates a pretty serious lack of imagination

45
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.520
to see if that ratio holds up over time.

46
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.200
I went back and compared these stats to the numbers from previous e three events

47
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.300
and I found similar results.

48
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.340
Initially I had intended to include separate stats for a narrative games,

49
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.740
adventure games,
puzzle games,

50
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.670
city building games and exploration games,

51
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.670
but there just weren't enough titles in any of these genres to justify their own

52
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:04.504
category.

53
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.000
A couple quick notes about these numbers or these calculations.

54
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.600
I focused on combat rather than on the presence of violence,

55
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.400
so games in the non combat category aren't necessarily nonviolent.

56
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.250
In fact,
three of the 10 games in that category or rather violent survival horror

57
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:24.300
experiences.

58
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.530
I make the distinction between combat and violence because with combat the

59
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:35.200
player is the one doing the violence.

60
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.670
Violence is unfortunately part of our shared human history,

61
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.840
and so it makes sense that some games would include it.
However,

62
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.800
when combat is the games central focus,

63
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.680
it tends to celebrate that violence rather than framing it as a tragic last

64
00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:57.350
resort.
One such perk,

65
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.420
we'll award the player with a tactical nukes following at 25 player kills

66
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.580
get red hot
dog.

67
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.730
Of course not all forms of combat are equal.
So just out of curiosity,

68
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.910
I further broke the stats down by type of the 108 games focusing on combat in

69
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:23.190
2017 20 of them.

70
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.270
It could be classified as cartoon violence are these titles,

71
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:33.070
it's less kill or be killed and more squish or be squashed.

72
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.270
The violence may be cute,
sometimes downright adorable,

73
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.870
but the focus on combat mechanics still sets up a hostile game environment in

74
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:46.480
which players are forced into an antagonistic relationship with the game.

75
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:49.870
World fee interactions may be a lot less bloody,

76
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.570
but the game play is still largely restricted to some form of get them before

77
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:58.970
they get you.
In many ways,

78
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:02.600
the gaming industry has backed itself into this corner.
For decades,

79
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:07.100
game studios have focused on combat to such a degree that for many gamers,

80
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:08.780
developers,
and even publishers,

81
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.100
combat has now become synonymous with gameplay itself.

82
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.290
The president of Nintendo of America echoed this sentiment at e three this year.

83
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.320
<v 3>The game is fun.</v>

84
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.420
The game is a battle.
If it's not fun,

85
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.680
why bother if it's not a battle,
where's the fun?

86
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.100
<v 2>That's an extremely narrow definition of what constitutes a game and frankly I</v>

87
00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:38.680
didn't even narrower definition of fun.

88
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.930
I'd argued that this obsession with violent combat mechanics is holding the

89
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:48.070
gaming industry back.
Let me quickly explain why I say that.

90
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.180
Gameplay mechanics or the underlying rules and methods for engagement within a

91
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.414
game.

92
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.770
Think of mechanics as a set of tools that players are given with which to

93
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:03.640
interact with the game world,
its characters and other players.

94
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.140
In many of the Games we've been talking about,

95
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.140
combat is the only way to solve problems,

96
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.320
to resolve conflicts or to overcome obstacles.

97
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.310
That old saying that if all you have is a hammer,

98
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.010
everything looks like a nail is apropos

99
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.040
except video games are made so that nearly everything in your path is

100
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:30.250
specifically designed to actually be a nail.

101
00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.930
And if you're given a machine gun as your primary tool for engagement,

102
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.690
that's going to determine how you approach the world.

103
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.430
And practically everything in it

104
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.610
is wanting to do is all
that I shot.

105
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:48.820
This other one showed a couple extra guys just to be shaved.

106
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.860
I did.
I did a lot of shooting about being totally honest.

107
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.880
When games focus so heavily on combat mechanics,

108
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.860
it's severely restricts the options for both emotional interaction and creative

109
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:07.630
conflict resolution or get back to it.
Don't get me wrong.

110
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.020
Conflict is of course an important part of storytelling,

111
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.660
but there are many forms of conflict from the interpersonal to the
intergalactic.

112
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.161
Likewise,

113
00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:22.690
there are many forms of conflict resolution and most of them don't leave behind

114
00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:23.830
a pile of bodies.

115
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.380
<v 4>I should mention that there do exist a small handful of games that include</v>

116
00:08:31.381 --> 00:08:32.670
diplomatic tactics.

117
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.160
<v 2>Layers can talk their way out of every situation in the retro Indie game.</v>

118
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.950
Undertale but that's a rare exception to the rule.

119
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.840
Some genres like role playing games have players doing more than just fighting,

120
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:53.450
but most of the other forms of interaction exist to support the combat.

121
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.490
You talk to other characters.

122
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.020
We will give you quests West's which inevitably involve killing stuff.

123
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.340
You might buy,
sell or craft new items,

124
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.130
items that will help you in killing stuff

125
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.620
<v 5>few days out in the wasteland and it's time to kick back at home.
My home,</v>

126
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.130
<v 2>you might even be able to build a house,</v>

127
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:21.670
a house which you'll have to defend by killing even more stuff because you do

128
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.230
<v 5>built defenses,
uh,</v>

129
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.920
because your settlements can and will get attacked by Raiders.

130
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.070
<v 2>All the other options available to players still ultimately revolve around that</v>

131
00:09:33.071 --> 00:09:33.600
core

132
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.680
<v 5>combat.
Again,</v>

133
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.960
<v 2>this topic is of special concern to me because my work primarily focuses on the</v>

134
00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:44.110
representations of men and masculinity in entertainment.

135
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.420
Everywhere we look in pop culture,

136
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.260
we see models of manhood that are linked to confrontation,

137
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.240
aggression and violence.

138
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.100
And that's especially true in video games were male characters are rarely

139
00:09:57.101 --> 00:10:01.450
depicted solving problems based on deescalation or compassion

140
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.640
<v 5>to be affective in combat.
Award must not feel for his enemy.</v>

141
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.590
<v 2>Things like diplomacy,
deescalation,
negotiation and compromise.</v>

142
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.410
I'll take a back seat to blunt force trauma

143
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:22.850
and that in turn dramatically limits the kinds of stories that can be told.

144
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.970
Now whenever I make these kinds of observations on social media,

145
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:31.710
someone will inevitably respond with a snarky quip about defeating monsters with

146
00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:35.040
hugs or dancing or by serving tea and cupcakes.

147
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.130
They no doubt think these are devastating burns,

148
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.780
but actually those are pretty good ideas for innovative mechanics.

149
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.010
I play those games and I'm willing to bet that a whole hell of a lot of other

150
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:47.844
people would too.

151
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.170
Interactive media as an incredible,

152
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.350
almost unlimited potential to deliver a wide range of emotional deeply human

153
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:02.610
experiences that deal with love and connection and empathy.

154
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.990
Imagine an open world game where you take on the role of an EMT or a firefighter

155
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.460
or a field medic or a climate activist or an intergalactic veterinarian,

156
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.690
or how about a farmer who grows food on an intergenerational space ship?

157
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.480
We're imagine a game set in a post apocalyptic future because every other game I

158
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:27.450
saw at e three was set in a post apocalyptic future,

159
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.060
but instead of fighting over the scraps,

160
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.510
players cooperate to rebuild a better society.

161
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.880
Imagine all the stories we're missing out on because game developers insist on

162
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:46.881
building virtual worlds that we experience from behind the barrel of a gun or

163
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:48.060
the blade of a sword.

164
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.920
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

165
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.830
<v 2>Remember that 7% of non combat focused games,
well,</v>

166
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.870
every year e three does play host to a few small games that break the mold and

167
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:01.110
give us a glimpse into the medium is potential.

168
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.420
Tacoma is one such example.

169
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.850
You play as an investigator using augmented reality to solve a mystery of the

170
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:11.620
missing crew aboard a space station.

171
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.950
It's these small innovative titles that are blazing a path forward for

172
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:22.080
interactive storyteller.
We just need a whole lot more of them.

173
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.623
<v 0>Okay.</v>

174
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.040
<v 2>If you'd like to see more of these long form video essays about the</v>

175
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:32.490
intersections of manhood,
politics,
and entertainment,

176
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.880
then please go over to Patrion and help fund this project.

177
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.670
Every little bit helps me keep making more videos.

178
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.690
Next month's video will be about geeky sexism and the Big Bang theory.
