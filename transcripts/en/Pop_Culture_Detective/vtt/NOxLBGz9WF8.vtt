1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.491
So political,

2
00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:06.720
we're mixing video is just a term that I made up to try to describe a whole set

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.850
of,
of,
of video works.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.970
They often will video works that they're appropriate,
uh,

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.740
material from other sources without permission throughout history,

6
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:21.430
this type of work has been called many things.
Uh,
some it's been called anti-art.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.490
Um,
it's been called sub retirement.
Uh,

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.030
it's been called found footage.
It's been called appropriation art.
Um,
but uh,

9
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:30.301
when I,

10
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.930
when I was bringing that you need to sort of the current context and don't,

11
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:37.150
I was talking about it in terms of youtube.
It's something that,
um,
is,

12
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.880
is much more,
more popular.
People are looking at television and they're saying,

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.420
you know what,
I don't want this to be a one way relationship anymore.

14
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.120
I don't want this to be just me watching a,

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.150
I have something to say and I want to say it in the language of TV.

16
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.100
I want to say it in the language of radio.

17
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:56.580
I want to say it in the language of the movies.
And so I'm going to take that,

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.180
I'm going to mix it up and I'm going to do it for a,
for a purpose.

19
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.540
It can often be funny,
but it's not just to be funny.
Hey,

20
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.340
it has social commentary involved.
And so when I say political remix,
um,

21
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:12.420
what I mean is that it,
it,
it's a commentary on,
uh,

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.020
on society.
It's a commentary on culture.
It's a commentary on politics.
Um,

23
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.630
and when I say politics,
I mean gender,
class,
race,
sexuality,
uh,

24
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.320
economy,
and then also government.
But government is a smaller part,

25
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:27.900
I think of that,
of that thing.
So,
um,

26
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.590
I also call it a subversive remix.
Video was another name for it.

27
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.790
So I began remixing video,
uh,

28
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.920
back in 2003 when the Iraq war was,

29
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.080
was beginning,
you know,
in the United States,
at least the,
the mass media,

30
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.470
they were just cheerleaders,
you know,
they were really excited.
They were like,

31
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:47.580
this is,
you know,

32
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:50.280
there was like a game for them and they got to talk about all the guns and the

33
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.750
different kinds of guns.
And they were really excited,
you know?

34
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.600
And then it would cut to commercial and it would be,
uh,
you know,
buy this truck,

35
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.180
you're too fat.
You need to go to Mcdonald's or whatever.
Um,
and,

36
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.110
and it would come back and say,
Oh,
20 people died.
No pictures of course,

37
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:08.110
but 20 people died,
30 people died.
Um,
and so it,
it,
it became a really,
you know,

38
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.480
in my mind,
the very sick game that they were playing in a 32nd spots.

39
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:15.990
So I would take the foot of some footage from.com documentary film footage,

40
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.630
some footage from the news and some footage of the,

41
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:20.580
of these ads and make new ads.
Um,

42
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:24.990
I started with making new army ads for the U s army.
Um,
and I replaced the,

43
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.180
for the footage and the audio is still there,
but a place to footage.

44
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.210
And I always say to people,
you want to Remix,
start remixing,
mixing ads,

45
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.720
make them more truthful.
You know,
what's what I would call identity correction.

46
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.310
Correct.
The identity of this ad.
