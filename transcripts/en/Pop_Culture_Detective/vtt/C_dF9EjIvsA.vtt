00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.670
Energy and every day it gets harder to find.

2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.420
Where is it?
How do we find it?

3
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.610
We are trying to answer those questions in ways once unimaginable.

4
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.110
Can you see it?
It's here

5
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.260
in a place experts thought impossible to reach.

6
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.710
So every day we push technology,

7
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.520
tell us it can be done.

8
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.290
Then watch as we tap into the greatest source of energy in the world,

9
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.110
this is the power of human energy.
