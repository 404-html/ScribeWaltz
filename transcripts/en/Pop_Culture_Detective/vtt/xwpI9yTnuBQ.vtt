1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.283
Okay.

2
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.730
<v 1>Hello everyone.
My name is Jonathan Macintosh.</v>

3
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.020
As Joy said,
I'm a political remix artist.

4
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.500
I'm an alto and activist and the grass roots style.

5
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:42.090
So I do the protest with the signs that you saw before on a number of issues,

6
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:45.230
especially around social justice and human rights in the United States.
Um,

7
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.690
I'm also a curator,
so I curate a,
the type of work that I do,

8
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.390
but that's done by others into shows.
Um,

9
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.660
it's what I call political remix video.
Um,

10
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.770
and that's what I'm here to talk about today.
Um,

11
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.490
political remix video I think pushes the limits of intellectual property,
um,

12
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.130
in ways that other remix work.
Uh,

13
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.890
it doesn't necessarily do.
Um,
so it's,

14
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:14.220
I think it's unique in that way and it's also part of this symposium is pushing

15
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:18.120
the limits of intellectual property.
So I think it's fitting.
Um,
oh,

16
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.730
the other thing that they can do this type of work I think is to create,
um,

17
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.930
a critical culture or help create critical culture.
Um,

18
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.040
I'll talk about that in a minute.
Um,
so as a quick definition,

19
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.070
uh,
we've talked about Remix,
we've talked about open source.

20
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:40.010
We've talked about free culture a little bit and talk about sharing a lot.
Um,

21
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.670
so I want to talk about what the subset is for political remix video.
Um,

22
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.710
so it's a process.

23
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.610
It's about deconstructing mass media or mass media,

24
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.570
fragments of corporate media or pop culture.
Um,

25
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.300
and then so you capture it off of TV,
off of movies,

26
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.310
off of music videos,
um,
off of mainstream music,
off of news cast especially.

27
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.650
Um,
and then you reconstruct it so you break it apart,
reconstruct it,

28
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.630
um,
and you create a new subversive message,

29
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.250
sort of use the old vehicle to create something new and put that alternative

30
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:21.420
message back out there.
And it's using the same,
the same footage,
the same forms.

31
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.740
Um,
so really it's a definition of subversion,
I think.

32
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.120
Um,
so I'm going to show you a brief example quickly.

33
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:31.970
It's easy to show you then tell you,
um,

34
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.700
I'm going to do this by going to my website first so you can follow along if you

35
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:39.330
have a computer.
Um,
so we are going to my website,

36
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.040
which just rebellious pixels here.

37
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.593
<v 2>Me,</v>

38
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.910
<v 1>uh,
oh,
that's a picture of me.
Um,</v>

39
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.830
I'm gonna go down here to my youtube channel,
check on it.

40
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.570
I also have neuro and blip.
Um,

41
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.200
and I'm gonna go into my ars electronica symposium for playlist,

42
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.650
which you can also find is open on my channel.
So you can take these videos home.

43
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.820
You want a watch them and I'm going to play just a small piece of what I think

44
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.840
is my absolute favorite political remix to date.

45
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.040
It was made by Jackie's Salaam.
Um,

46
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.010
and it is about the media,
Hollywood media,

47
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.220
betrayal of Arabs and Arab Americans,
but Arabs in general,
um,

48
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.330
in mainstream media,
mainstream TV,
movies,
uh,
mainstream blockbuster is et cetera.

49
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.780
Um,
so she's picking apart these,

50
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.290
these films and she's creating a new work.

51
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.910
That new work is a trailer which he calls planet of the Arabs.
Um,
and we can,

52
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.840
I'll show it here real quick.

53
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.450
I'm going to use youtube because this is how you would view it online.

54
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:43.120
This is how I view things.
So that's how we'll do it here.

55
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.080
Hopefully we'll have ring up.
I'm going to show a small piece of this.

56
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.430
The full thing is nine minutes.
You can watch this later.
I recommend that you do.

57
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.680
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

58
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.100
<v 3>that's what Walmart does.
It say what God's command is.</v>

59
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.990
<v 1>Americans.</v>

60
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.070
<v 3>It's a White House.
One day I will go,</v>

61
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.030
I would drive a truck.

62
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.150
You have queued up.

63
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.250
We mean children bombed our cities from a fog like codes and you dare to call us

64
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.130
white sport.
I was bad.
Yeah,
it was in here.

65
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.870
She was in Paris showing the fall collection.
She got hit by a Bursa terrorists,

66
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.290
crossfire.
Palestinians,
French police.
Oh my God.
They found me.

67
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:11.390
I don't know how they found me.
Ooh.
Ooh.

68
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.050
What do you think?

69
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.313
<v 0>Oh,</v>

70
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.010
[inaudible]

71
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.333
<v 3>there's no borders,</v>

72
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.060
no cost go anywhere in the u s there's nothing to stop.

73
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.170
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

74
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.510
<v 5>I ran into another grand.
They'll you a sense of</v>

75
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.900
what I'm saying.
Citizen,

76
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.280
<v 1>he slept really well,
should be parked together.</v>

77
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.840
A small segment of that.
Um,
so she's taking some park and she's,
uh,

78
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.640
she's saying,
look,
here's all these racist portrayals of Arabs in the media,

79
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.160
especially the US media.
Um,
and you know,
I've seen a lot of these movies before.

80
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.490
Uh,
and I,
I'd seen back in the future,
you know,
hundreds of times,

81
00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:30.750
probably the child.
Um,
and it was my favorites and I never saw that.

82
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.370
I never saw that piece of back to the future where he screams,

83
00:06:35.371 --> 00:06:38.790
here come the Libyans and they come screaming and shooting m six teens in a

84
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.420
suburban parking lot in the United States.
Right?
Crazy,
ridiculous,

85
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.490
racist portrayal of,
of Eric's.
Um,

86
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.200
so in this context I went,
Whoa,

87
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.660
now I can't look at that movie in the same way again knowing I have to think

88
00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:55.950
about it in a more of a critical way.
And she does that with cartoons.

89
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.710
He does that with kid shows.
He does that with mainstream movies.
And as the,

90
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.870
as the piece gets longer and longer and you go through it,

91
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.660
you'll see more and more and more of those come out if you expose them to this

92
00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:08.220
process of remixes.
Um,
so that's one piece that I,

93
00:07:08.221 --> 00:07:11.660
that I wanted to show quickly.
Um,
uh,
yesterday,
um,

94
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:17.540
Tim print love talked about hacking and he talked about the hacking approach to

95
00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:22.930
technology,
the hacking approach art and the hacking approach to life.
Um,

96
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.130
which I thought was particularly interesting because you could think about

97
00:07:26.131 --> 00:07:30.450
political remix video as the hacking approach to watching Televi,
right?

98
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.550
So we're watching something,
maybe it's a mainstream movie,

99
00:07:32.551 --> 00:07:35.940
maybe it's a TV show and we're thinking critically and we're saying,
wait,

100
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.990
what's really going on here?

101
00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:39.720
We're breaking it apart and we're looking inside of it.

102
00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:43.650
And then we're trying to find some way to recreate that and expose what's there.

103
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.560
Um,
so,
um,
political remix video,

104
00:07:49.561 --> 00:07:54.540
it was only one small part of a larger remix culture that's being developed,

105
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.890
uh,
all over the world.
Really.

106
00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:00.000
I'm especially among youth and I classify youth as people under 30.
I'm 29,

107
00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:03.460
so I'm still,
yeah,
still youth.
Um,

108
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.920
uh,
and this is,
we talked about a lot of this stuff over the past few days.
Um,

109
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.500
accessibility of technology,
um,
uh,
affordability of that technology,

110
00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:18.501
being able to be online and especially having access to raw video footage.

111
00:08:19.201 --> 00:08:19.350
Right?

112
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.000
I can't sit and watch TV for weeks and weeks and weeks on end trying to get that

113
00:08:24.001 --> 00:08:24.834
little snippet.

114
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.250
But I have youtube and I have tools like vixy or tools like to TV,

115
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.640
which allow me to take youtube and then remix youtube.
Um,

116
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.120
I also a bit too warm so I can get movies and I can remix those,
right?

117
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.380
So I don't have to go to the DVD store if there are such a thing anymore and uh,

118
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.730
and rent them or get them off of iTunes sites.
Um,

119
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.080
right.
So when I think about political,

120
00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:51.750
the political part of political remix video,
um,

121
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.260
for me it's not just about governments.
It's not just about elections,

122
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.570
public policy,
although that's a big part of it.
Um,

123
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.120
but it's also about sexuality,
about race,
about gender,
about class,

124
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:07.110
about economics.
When we saw you in the last video,
it was about,

125
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.850
it was about race and it's about stereotypes and portrayals of,
of people.
Um,

126
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.200
so the other thing that it does then is it challenging social norms.

127
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.910
It challenges power and powerful institutions and myths about our society and

128
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.290
ourselves.
Um,

129
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.130
so just want to show another one real quick.

130
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:28.590
I'm gonna go back to my playlist and pull up another one.

131
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:31.980
This is one that I made.
Um,
it's called go army bad guys.

132
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.070
It is a remix of a,

133
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.330
of a commercial for the US army recruiting commercial for the US army.

134
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.600
It was played during the first few years of the Iraq invasion.

135
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.633
Um,

136
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.520
and it was directed at getting people to come in and fight in Iraq.

137
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.211
So that was this.

138
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.630
It was shown on mainstream television in the United States all the time.
Um,

139
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.830
especially primetime,
especially shows that youth might be attracted to.

140
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.790
Um,
so here,
take a look.

141
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.283
Hmm.

142
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.600
<v 5>You want to be like the good guy is riding around the white hats.
No,</v>

143
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.450
to be honest,
I want to be bad guys.

144
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.720
Bad guys at tie people up

145
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.520
torture.

146
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.730
Sure.
Kitties with the car,
battery

147
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.920
hair so that the good guys,
bad guys,

148
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.800
they're the ones
you may go back to class,
man.
Gary,

149
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:58.610
<v 1>get strength for now.
I'm strength for later.
Learn more@goarmy.com.</v>

150
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:05.940
Apologize for the small sound problem there.
But the idea is to recontextualize,

151
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.900
uh,
a commercial for the u s army,
what it might be like to be in the U s army.

152
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.090
We might have to do and especially what that might be doing to youth,

153
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.680
especially in America,
but around the world.
Um,
and so you have this,

154
00:11:18.681 --> 00:11:22.080
this character who is really excited about going and doing all these horrible

155
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:23.370
things now.
Um,

156
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.110
so it's kind of an anti recruitment at incidentally,

157
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:33.290
since I made this and there are hundreds of these online that I found him

158
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:35.910
recently,
so you can go check them out.
Um,
in fact,

159
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:39.240
I don't think you can find the actual army ads on Youtube.

160
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:43.000
I think it's only remixes at this point,
or at least I couldn't find any.
Um,

161
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.410
so,
um,
this form is a,

162
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.570
it's what I would call do it yourself.
Um,
I would call a,

163
00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:56.440
it's primarily by people,
for people.
And you can see that in the way that it's,

164
00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.760
it's created not by institutions or corporations or governments by and large,

165
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.240
but by people who have access to some software,

166
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.820
a computer and access a net access.
Um,

167
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.660
and then it's distributed this way too.
It's distributed freely.

168
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:13.840
So it's distributed via youtube.
Um,
be a blip,

169
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:18.550
the a half a dozen other video sharing tools because it's not me.

170
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:19.790
I'm not making it for

171
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.000
institutions or policymakers or academics.
I'm making it for other people,

172
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.910
not necessarily people who agree with me,
but other people.

173
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.180
It's to see that and to see,
uh,
a critical take on,
um,

174
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.270
on that of you.
Another one.
This one has a lot,
this is a very specific,

175
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:38.830
I think two

176
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.220
things were happening in California a few years ago.
Um,

177
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.910
she may know Swarts and was the governor of California now.
Um,

178
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.350
and so this is a,
this is a,

179
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:54.260
he give a little bit of context since it's very local.
Um,
there was,
uh,

180
00:12:54.261 --> 00:12:58.210
a gang member who had been arrested and who was being going to be put to death

181
00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:01.090
can be executed.
And um,

182
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.590
this guy Tookie Williams,
he had spent most of his time in jail.

183
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:09.790
It's a substantial amount of time writing books to children to get them out of

184
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:12.370
gangs.
And you become an advocate against gang violence.

185
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:16.800
And He'd been very successful in this.
Um,
and so the plea was,
you know,

186
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.390
governance,
Schwarzenegger,
Nigga,
please don't,
don't kill this guy.
He's,

187
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.430
he's doing amazing work and change,

188
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:25.060
change to turn his life around and turn to the life of young people down to um,

189
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.390
a source negative.
Denied that and kill him.
Anyway.

190
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.370
So this is a video in protest of that

191
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.750
<v 0>a wise man once said,
the death penalty is about three things,
politics,</v>

192
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.680
politics and politics.
Uh,

193
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.930
Stanley Tookie Williams is a repeated founder of the balance clip,

194
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:48.730
stag and was convicted of no less than four murders during his 24 years in

195
00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:53.350
prison.
Williams wrote several children's books about the dangers of gangs.

196
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.940
Trying to discourage young people from a life of violence is work around him.

197
00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:02.941
Six nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize in California's Governor Arnold

198
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:05.170
Schwartzenegger chose not to spare his life,

199
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.050
saying Williams had murdered without remorse.

200
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.320
And that the continued pervasiveness of gang violence leaves one to question the

201
00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:17.650
efficacy of Williams message.
So what does that mean?

202
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.740
It's showtime clemency.

203
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.490
It was rare and as much as anything a political liability.

204
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.390
So I'm gonna see can be seen when it's exercise by the governor as a sign of

205
00:14:32.391 --> 00:14:34.940
weakness or not being top on one of the countries.

206
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.180
I was supposedly a great social issues.
You ass

207
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.490
can't do that wrong

208
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:51.673
gentlemen.

209
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.140
<v 2>We're all feeling at this very moment.</v>

210
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.170
<v 1>We'll be back right after these important messages</v>

211
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.340
<v 2>in the 21st century.</v>

212
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I went to the movie and like no other can be reasoned with

213
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.020
no remorse.

214
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.210
This weapon will be called the terminator.

215
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.393
Yeah.

216
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.350
<v 1>Well there's a strict ritual to executions here at San Quentin.
But this morning,</v>

217
00:15:41.351 --> 00:15:44.380
early this morning,
everything did not go precisely as planned.

218
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.850
It went a long time.
They seem to have trouble finding his veins.

219
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.010
Any appeared to grow,
frustrated,

220
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.330
a guard read the death warrant and the lethal drugs started to flow.

221
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.920
He was tried to keep his head up then laid it back down forever.

222
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.850
<v 5>It's going to be very carefully.
Okay.
Not a terminator anymore.</v>

223
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.400
Right.
Dot.

224
00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:13.720
That you just can't go around killing people.
Why?

225
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:19.980
What do you mean?
Why?
Because you can't
because you just can't.

226
00:16:19.981 --> 00:16:21.640
Okay.
Trust me on this.

227
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:30.030
<v 2>MMM.
So,</v>

228
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.230
<v 1>so that video was by a remixer called the black lantern,</v>

229
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.490
and you saw some of his work,
uh,
yesterday.
Um,

230
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.080
he also made a video.
Uh,

231
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.260
George Bush doesn't like black people remix about Hurricane Katrina,

232
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.200
so some fantastic Regenexx work there.
Um,

233
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.660
so should I guess I'll show you one more quickly.
This is one called George W.

234
00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.660
Bush has down help jam and this one is by Aaron Velazquez.

235
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.080
I'm taking a week commercial and attend their week commercial and remixing it

236
00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:03.910
with,
uh,
the grammatical creativity of my current president.

237
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.153
<v 2>Cool</v>

238
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:17.200
<v 6>families.
Just where a nation where Wayne's take drain.</v>

239
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.560
If you don't say ever something,
you don't stay branding
uhmm

240
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.920
shame on.
Shame on you

241
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.760
can't get fooled again.

242
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:46.590
This war and the defeat of the terrorist and told a territory totalitarians and

243
00:17:47.081 --> 00:17:49.060
a victory for the cause of freedom and liberty

244
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.130
in my state or my state of the union,
our statement,
my speech nation.

245
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.210
I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.

246
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.710
We've never been able to confirm any connection between the and nine 11.

247
00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

248
00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:20.250
So it's a couple of things that I find really interesting about these videos.

249
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:26.650
One is it's use of pop culture.
Now I think that for political remix video,

250
00:18:26.651 --> 00:18:28.980
especially the use of pop culture is,

251
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.390
is vital to being able to make something like this.
And why is that?

252
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.180
Well,
I think that for better or for worse,
pop culture,

253
00:18:37.181 --> 00:18:40.840
especially pop media culture in the United States anyway,
um,

254
00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.660
is a language that people understand.

255
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.660
Most people understand and it has a lot of meaning for people sort of infused

256
00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:54.310
into that,
into that media.
Um,
it teaches us about ourselves,

257
00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.930
about others,
um,
for good and for bad,
um,
and about our society.

258
00:18:59.050 --> 00:18:59.883
So it's,
it's,

259
00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.180
it's a way that we learn through pop culture in some way that we understand the

260
00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:05.800
world and it's the way that we were able to share the world.

261
00:19:05.801 --> 00:19:08.110
Did you see the show last night?
Did you see what happened on the,
on the news?

262
00:19:08.111 --> 00:19:09.250
Did you see this?
Do you see that right?

263
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.320
These are the conversations we have all the time,
at least where I come.
Um,

264
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:19.110
so it's pop culture and media and mass media are constantly constructing these

265
00:19:19.181 --> 00:19:22.510
myths about who we are.
Uh,
and normalizing,

266
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.730
normalizing the things around us,
right?

267
00:19:27.731 --> 00:19:30.730
So sexism is very normalized in mass media,
culture,

268
00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.690
violence or power,
et cetera.
Um,

269
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.010
and so we can take those that,

270
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.590
that logic and we can break it apart and we can say,
hey,

271
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.960
maybe we have a different opinion about this.

272
00:19:40.961 --> 00:19:43.780
Maybe we don't want to see the world in this way.
Let me expose,
let me show it,

273
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.260
uh,
by remixing what you are trying to feed us.

274
00:19:47.261 --> 00:19:50.710
So I think pop culture is not like this magical thing that just happens.
It's a,

275
00:19:50.711 --> 00:19:54.160
it's a very carefully constructed and manipulated thing.
And you know,
we might,

276
00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:59.050
it might be conscious or unconscious,
but remixers can intervene in that culture,

277
00:19:59.340 --> 00:19:59.680
uh,

278
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.680
and challenge it and create a new culture and alternative culture that says

279
00:20:04.691 --> 00:20:08.920
something else with a different meaning.
Um,
uh,

280
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.900
the only thing that I find very interesting about those last two,
especially,
uh,

281
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.620
for me is the form and the style.

282
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.210
So you'll notice the form and the style of both of those mimic mimics mass media

283
00:20:19.211 --> 00:20:22.870
culture,
right?
They Mimic TV ads,

284
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.710
they mimic music videos,
they mimic movie trailers,

285
00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:29.890
they make the quick cuts and the sound bytes,
all the things,

286
00:20:29.891 --> 00:20:33.850
all the devices that mass media uses to tell us a different story.

287
00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:38.240
So just by taking them and changing the place,
uh,

288
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.810
you get a whole different message in a whole different meaning now.

289
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.450
And it also uses humor and irony and sensationalism.

290
00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.550
All the things that TV ads use,
all the things that mass media uses and on it.

291
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.860
So it's not critiquing the mass media forms and styles as much as this

292
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:55.030
particular messages in them.
And I think that's a key component of remix,

293
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.350
especially political,

294
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.620
well specifically political remix video is that it's not just remixing media,

295
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:06.230
it's not just taking footages and audio and remixing that and come up with

296
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.980
something new.
Certainly there's a lot of that out there.
I think it's great,

297
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.730
but the political part for me comes when you're mixing the message also.

298
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.120
So the message is coming is coming at you from the mainstream saying this,

299
00:21:16.121 --> 00:21:19.660
this and this and you can take it and you can change the message.

300
00:21:19.661 --> 00:21:21.880
So you're mixing the message as well as the media.

301
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:27.010
And I think that is what political remix video does.
So well in my opinion,

302
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.650
I want to show another one.
This one also has a lot of uh,

303
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.100
context that's local to the u s elections.
Um,

304
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.010
so I'm going to give this a tiny,
very,

305
00:21:40.011 --> 00:21:44.530
very small synopsis of this video because I think it needs that context in the

306
00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:45.460
United States.
Incidentally,

307
00:21:45.461 --> 00:21:48.330
you don't really have to talk about it cause everyone knows somehow.
Um,

308
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.410
cause this is all the maximum you talked about for months.
Um,

309
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:53.530
this is Jeremiah Wright.

310
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.150
He is the pastor of Barack Obama who was the Democratic nominee for president.

311
00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.440
He has some very critical things to say about US foreign policy.
Um,

312
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.490
the mass media and mass news organizations took little clips,

313
00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:11.491
little nine second clips of what he had to say and play them out of context and

314
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.900
condemned him universally,
right?

315
00:22:13.901 --> 00:22:18.320
So much so that Barack Obama then condemned him as well for these statements.
Um,

316
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.300
so people like me went,
well,
I want to know what else he said.
Like,
did you know,

317
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.600
was it just that nine second thing?
And then he got off the stage or,
well,
no,

318
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:27.740
it's a whole sermon.
It's,
it's 30 minutes.
And this,
uh,

319
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.530
so this remix or whose name is Theodore Lyons,

320
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.920
he took a big segment about a two minute segment.

321
00:22:32.921 --> 00:22:36.190
We can never heard on the mass media and played it in context.

322
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.730
And then over it he played,
uh,
clips from,

323
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.800
especially from blockbuster Hollywood movies,
things that we know,

324
00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:47.140
we understand,
we're familiar with.
We can go,
oh,

325
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.940
I have a connection to that and emotional connection.

326
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:52.780
Cause I saw that in a theater because I liked that movie and he played that over

327
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:56.950
these words to give us some sort of context and some sort of familiarity with it

328
00:22:56.951 --> 00:23:00.340
because we haven't seen this footage of,
uh,
Jeremiah Wright before,

329
00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:03.580
but we have seen the things he put over it for the most part.
Um,

330
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.030
and I think it's a very powerful piece.
So with that context

331
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.150
<v 7>mix scene when he got silenced by Elijah,
Mohammad was in fact true Americans.</v>

332
00:23:12.151 --> 00:23:12.990
Chickens

333
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.350
are coming home to roost.

334
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.510
We took this country by terror away from the Sioux,

335
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.380
the Apache,
the Roi,
the Comanche,
the Arapahoe,

336
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.750
the Navajo terrorism.

337
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.780
We took Africans from their country to build our way of ease and kept them in

338
00:23:39.511 --> 00:23:42.540
slavery and living in fear,
terrorism.

339
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.220
We bombed the Grenada and kill innocent civilians,
babies,

340
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.920
nonmilitary personnel.

341
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:54.220
We bombed the black civilian community of Panama with Stealth bombers and killed

342
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:59.330
unarmed teenager than timeless pregnant mothers and hardworking father cause we

343
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:04.331
bomb Qaddafi's homes and killed his child hood bash your children.

344
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.920
We found the route.
We killed unarmed civilians trying to make a living.

345
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:13.810
We bombed the plant in Sudan for the attack clone.

346
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.730
I embassy killed hundreds of hard working people,

347
00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.250
mothers and fathers who Lebron Nicole that day,

348
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.280
knowing that they never get back home.

349
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.930
We Bomb Nagasaki and we fight him off and then the thousands in New York.

350
00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.520
And I ended up it out and we never batted an eye.

351
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.200
Kids playing in the playground monitors picking up children after school.

352
00:24:37.201 --> 00:24:40.990
So failure,
not soldiers,
people just trying to make it day by day.

353
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:45.910
We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South

354
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:50.910
Africans and how we are in debt because it's done overseas.

355
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.820
And now brought right back into our own front.
Yeah,

356
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:02.170
<v 2>America's chickens coming home to roost.</v>

357
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.120
<v 1>Uh,
so again,
that's theater where lions and uh,</v>

358
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.000
it's called the full title is Jeremiah Wright painting a picture of you.

359
00:25:18.001 --> 00:25:21.410
It's aggressive.
It's hard to find on youtube,
but if find it in the playlist.

360
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.520
So again,
here's,
here's something that you didn't see in the mainstream media,

361
00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:28.460
at least in the United States.
He did not see that full clip down here.
Hear it.

362
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.300
Um,
and now we can hear that and we can have these emotional triggers that,

363
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.220
you know,
whatever you think about it,
it's,
it's,
it's a,

364
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.570
it's a different point of view.

365
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.470
It's something that should have been shown or heard at least,
and it wasn't.
Um,

366
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.340
and so remix was able to do that and use this for this familiarity.

367
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.560
That last clip was from a terminator.
Um,

368
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.570
and so we are familiar with that.
Even though we're not familiar with the words.

369
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.490
Um,
so I think it's very powerful,
um,
that,
uh,
critically though,

370
00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:58.790
what you'll notice is that none of this can be with permission.

371
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.490
I don't think most of it cannot be with permission.

372
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.780
I don't know if the owner is of that media,

373
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.160
those movies,
those TV shows are going to be like,
yeah,
cool.
Go ahead and use it,

374
00:26:10.161 --> 00:26:11.390
remix it,
you know,

375
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:14.540
have this political message critical of the United States and use our movie to

376
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.700
do it right.
That's not going to happen.

377
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:21.020
I don't think that's going to happen for $1 million or more than a million

378
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.270
dollars.
And I don't think there's any way they're going to say,
yeah,
that's okay.

379
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.660
Um,
and so in this case,
it has to be without permission.

380
00:26:26.661 --> 00:26:28.550
And that's what most political remix is,

381
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.940
is it's taking something without permission.
And I'm using it.

382
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:34.850
I'm taking pop pop culture.

383
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.910
A specialists at creative Commons is fantastic,

384
00:26:37.911 --> 00:26:39.330
especially if you're looking for music and your,

385
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.510
you want to create something that you need to,

386
00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.820
you want to put out there and sell or,
or whatever.
Um,

387
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.890
but I think that there's a,

388
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.270
there's something to be said of value in also being able to use elements of the

389
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:53.520
pop culture,
which is all around us,
which is part of us,

390
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.640
which informs who we are and use that as well to tell stories and to especially

391
00:26:59.491 --> 00:27:04.410
to criticize it.
Um,
so I can't imagine that Coca Cola,
uh,
saying,
yeah,

392
00:27:04.411 --> 00:27:09.411
it's cool if you go and use our logo and our commercial to criticize the running

393
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:12.120
of the Olympic torch,
who to Tibet.

394
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:17.190
No way in the world in a million years is cooking to be like,
that's cool.
Right.

395
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.390
But we can do that anyway.
We don't have to ask permission,
I think.
Um,
so,

396
00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:25.910
you know,
is it legal?
Is it not legal as question that I get a lot.
It's fuzzy.
Um,

397
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.630
there's a thing called fair use in the United States,

398
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:31.260
which a lot of people have been using as a defense to something similar here.

399
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.070
I think.
Um,
it is,
it,
is it all fair uses it not,

400
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:38.250
I think that's up to really,
it's up to courts to decide that.
And I,

401
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.820
I'm not going to wait around and say if a judge will give me a stamp of
approval,

402
00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:42.031
but we're,

403
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:44.700
I'll talk about my culture and the things that are happening in my life,

404
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:47.540
in my country,
um,
in this way.
Um,

405
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.430
so I say just do it and see what happens.
Um,

406
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.770
I think the value of the work is way more important than the potential legal

407
00:27:55.771 --> 00:27:57.390
consequences.
Um,

408
00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.260
especially since it might make the copyright owners a little bit angry to have

409
00:28:01.261 --> 00:28:03.840
their work used in various ways that they don't agree with it.

410
00:28:03.841 --> 00:28:08.510
A very highly charged and political and emotional.
Um,
so,
um,

411
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.490
let me just make sure we have time to move on.
Um,

412
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.601
so it creates,

413
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:19.680
I think it critical culture and this is something that I wanted to sort of end

414
00:28:19.681 --> 00:28:20.660
on.
Um,

415
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:25.080
the power of this kind of work is not necessarily that the work will change the

416
00:28:25.081 --> 00:28:28.200
society in a,
you know,
I'd made this and therefore this changed.

417
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:32.260
It's a small piece of a much larger,
um,

418
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.250
political and cultural transformation.
I think that's occurring.
Um,

419
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.710
so little tiny pieces.
So this video is a piece that's been used,
a piece,

420
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.300
this blogs a piece,
right?

421
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:46.920
And all those things together create a torrent of I think,

422
00:28:46.921 --> 00:28:51.000
transformation and change.
Um,
so,
uh,

423
00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:55.680
I'm going to show a lastly,
I'm going to show one that I made.
Um,

424
00:28:55.681 --> 00:29:00.090
I want to show though the original before I show you the remix.

425
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:05.250
So hopefully this will work.
This is the original.

426
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:08.060
This is a,
um,
so I made this a few months ago.
Um,

427
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.520
I was watching TV or just sitting there watching TV,
you know,

428
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:13.470
surfing the channels and I saw a commercial,

429
00:29:13.471 --> 00:29:17.460
which is part of a campaign by Chevron Oil Corporation and they're trying to

430
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:22.170
rebrand themselves as a human environmentally conscious company.

431
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.730
They're spending $15 million,

432
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:28.050
something a lot about that to estimate a on their campaign to make me believe

433
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:32.050
that this company really has my best interest at heart.
Um,

434
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.400
and so I saw this on TV and I went,
oh,
that's,
you know,

435
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:38.160
I'm thinking critically about it.
I'm going,
wait,
what?
Seriously.

436
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:41.710
So then I did some research.
I went to Wikipedia,
I went to blogs,

437
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:45.310
I know around around the country,
human rights blogs,
um,
courtwatch blogs.

438
00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.540
And I found it all this information about Chevron genuine a little bit about,

439
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:53.900
but not all of it.
Uh,
they're the,
one of the last companies that's in,
um,

440
00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.520
or one of the companies that profit in the most out of a burner working with the

441
00:29:57.521 --> 00:30:00.280
dictatorship.
They,

442
00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.630
I some pretty horrific or our environmental destruction,

443
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:07.740
both in the Niger Delta and also in South America.
Um,

444
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.130
there are also profiting off of a rock and the patient abroad.
Um,

445
00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:12.910
these are things are not going to tell you when they're commercial,

446
00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:15.730
but I was able to find with these tools we have,

447
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:18.160
so here's their version of what they are as a company.

448
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.630
<v 5>Oh,</v>

449
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.080
<v 3>can you see it too?</v>

450
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.510
175 miles off the coast of Louisiana.

451
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:37.760
<v 5>Oh,</v>

452
00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.190
<v 3>what's your commute?
Your flight to Phoenix.</v>

453
00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.100
Your way of life?

454
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.823
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

455
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.810
<v 3>More than 28,000 feet below the surface</v>

456
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:55.280
in a place that experts thought impossible to reach,

457
00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:01.460
setting half a dozen world records for technological innovation without a single

458
00:31:01.461 --> 00:31:03.500
safety or environmental incident.

459
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:09.450
Every day the world demands more energy and every day it gets harder to find.

460
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:15.410
So every day we push technology,
we seek alternatives,

461
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.390
and we also attempt the extraordinary to power the world.
Right now,

462
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.220
this is the power of human energy.

463
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.350
<v 1>That's their version.
That's their version,
their version.</v>

464
00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.590
It obviously they have a lot of resources.

465
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:36.100
One of the biggest oil companies in the world,
they spent 15 million,

466
00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:40.240
something like that on this campaign.
Um,
it's a lot of resources.

467
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:41.500
It's not a power there.

468
00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:46.150
I've institutional power and ha high end guy with a computer.
So what can I do?

469
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:51.710
Um,
well,
one is I saw that name.
I went,
oh seriously.
I mean,
no,

470
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:58.000
come on.
Um,
and so,
uh,
I decided to make my own version.
I think their tagline,

471
00:31:58.001 --> 00:31:59.830
human energy is very unfortunate for them.

472
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.080
I don't know if they vetted that through the remixing
liabilities,

473
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.450
but here's my version of that same APP.

474
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.283
<v 5>Oh,</v>

475
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.230
<v 3>every day.
The world demands more energy.</v>

476
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:18.360
Every day it gets harder to find.
Where is it?

477
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.183
How do we find it?

478
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.260
We were trying to answer those questions in ways unimaginable.

479
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.440
<v 5>Oh,</v>

480
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.273
<v 3>can you see it</v>

481
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.520
in a place that experts thought impossible to reach to?

482
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.340
Every day we push technology.

483
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.010
Tell us it can't be done then watch this.

484
00:32:46.011 --> 00:32:49.280
We tap is the greatest source of energy in the world.

485
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.640
Oops.
This is the power of human energy.

486
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.320
<v 1>I noticed you all didn't applaud for the,
uh,
Chevron one,
the original one.</v>

487
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.600
I wonder why that is.
I wonder if that's because you're thinking critically.
Um,

488
00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.500
I wonder if that's because we're trying to promote,

489
00:33:20.501 --> 00:33:22.150
hopefully through all of this technology,

490
00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:27.220
a critical culture that looks at the world around us in a critical way.

491
00:33:27.221 --> 00:33:28.960
Looks at pop culture,
looks at advertising,

492
00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:33.430
looks at the powerful institutions around us and says,
wait,
let me look at this.

493
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.150
What's really happening here?
Let me see what's,
let's break it apart.

494
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.130
Let's hack it.
Let's see what's inside.

495
00:33:39.131 --> 00:33:41.710
Let's see how it works and let's put it back together and say,
well,

496
00:33:41.711 --> 00:33:45.490
we think it might really mean,
certainly I'm talking from a best case scenario.

497
00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:46.660
There's a lot of video out,

498
00:33:46.661 --> 00:33:50.530
there's a lot of remix video about political topics that isn't necessarily
great,

499
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.710
right?
Maybe something that you hate it don't,
don't agree with.

500
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.800
I think that the key component is as long as it's critical of power in some way

501
00:33:59.261 --> 00:34:03.520
or oppressive institutions or mainstream media,

502
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.510
as long as it's critical of that,
it's positive,
right?

503
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.180
And it helps us develop our critical analysis too.

504
00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:13.880
So just in closing here it,
it,
it's,

505
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.140
this is not just being critical,
right?

506
00:34:17.141 --> 00:34:19.840
It's not just being critical of what we see,

507
00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.410
but it's also being creative because we can be critical of what we see and we

508
00:34:23.411 --> 00:34:25.930
can think to ourselves,
well,
how can I make something out of that that says,

509
00:34:25.931 --> 00:34:29.380
when I think,
all right,
so its subversion is taking their thing and saying,

510
00:34:29.381 --> 00:34:31.300
I want this to say something else.

511
00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:35.590
And the creative process of deconstructing it and then reconstructing it and

512
00:34:35.591 --> 00:34:40.570
just something else,
like a remix video.
Um,
I think it's very powerful.

513
00:34:40.571 --> 00:34:43.340
It's part of this tech talk back culture.
Uh,

514
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.090
it can expose oppression and expose injustice,

515
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.370
expose hypocrisy.

516
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.010
It can even empower our collective imaginations.
I think.
Um,

517
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:57.490
there's a video on this playlist,
which I would invite you all to go and see.
A,

518
00:34:57.491 --> 00:35:00.020
it's called Bush for peace.
We don't have time to watch it now.
Um,

519
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.320
but it's a great example,
I think,

520
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.880
of helping us envision a better world by showing George W.

521
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:11.050
Bush give a speech for peace by re cutting his speech and putting it back

522
00:35:11.051 --> 00:35:11.620
together.

523
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:16.620
So he's actually saying things that you could only dream of a president saying.

524
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.170
Um,
and so I think that,
uh,
that's a fantastic version of,

525
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.520
of remix and talking about collective imagination.
Um,

526
00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:29.430
so I think I'm gonna stop there.
If you have questions,
please ask them.
And,
uh,

527
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:30.580
thank you for inviting me.

528
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:36.630
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
