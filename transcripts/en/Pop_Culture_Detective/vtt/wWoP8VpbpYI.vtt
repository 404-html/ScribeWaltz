00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.160
Harrison ford has played some of the most iconic male heroes ever to appear on

2
00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:09.994
film.

3
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.840
The cultural impact with his filmography is so massive that it's hard to

4
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:20.841
overstate an entire generation of young boys learn to idealize his cinematic

5
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:23.270
performance of masculinity.

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.650
These films provided an education of sorts into what it meant to be a man.

7
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.150
I'm Solo Indiana Jones and Rick Deckerd have a lot in common.

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.200
They're lovable.
Rogue is who chart their own path and take what they want.

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.350
They may be assertive or cocky,
but in the end they're always frame

10
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.623
<v 0>as good guy.</v>

11
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.580
<v 1>Growing up,
I watched Harrison Ford's movies dozens of times,</v>

12
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.450
but going back and watching the scan as an adult and he's struck by something

13
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:03.090
else they have in common,
something dark,

14
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.923
<v 0>correct</v>

15
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.680
<v 1>thing I hadn't noticed as a kid,</v>

16
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.320
or at least didn't really have the language to articulate.

17
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.060
<v 2>I don't know.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.430
<v 1>If you look beyond their charisma,</v>

19
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.900
Deckerd Han and Dr. Jones all treat women badly.

20
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.430
So in this video,

21
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.570
we're gonna take a closer look at four iconic scenes from Harrison Ford's Korea,

22
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.400
all of which illustrate and unsettling pattern you choose,

23
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:43.660
essentially framed as as deductions and plays out a similar dynamic,

24
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.810
the dynamic of Predator and prey.

25
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.630
Most critics agree the empire strikes back is the best of the original star wars

26
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:54.464
trilogy.

27
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.550
The film takes a darker tone and focuses more on its character development,

28
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.480
flushing out the relationship between Han Solo and Princess Leia.
Yeah.

29
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.930
<v 3>Now keep in mind that haunted lay,</v>

30
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.420
I haven't had no romantic relationship up until this point.
In fact,

31
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:12.410
their interactions have been tense to say to them

32
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.383
<v 0>least.</v>

33
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.070
<v 3>Oh,
please.
Oh good.</v>

34
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.640
Excited being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.

35
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.360
<v 0>Sorry sweetheart.
Time for anything else.</v>

36
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.580
<v 3>I'd like to focus on one scene in particular,</v>

37
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.780
a scene that's often cited as one of the most romantic in cinematic history.

38
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.210
Let's count the number of times that Princess Leia directly or indirectly

39
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.450
indicates that she's not interested in Hahn's advances.

40
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.790
Hey,
your worship.
I'm only trying to help you.

41
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.440
Please stop calling me that.
Sure.

42
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.230
We make it so difficult.
Sometimes I do.
I really do.

43
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 0>You can be a little nicer though.
Come on.
Admit it.</v>

44
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:05.020
Sometimes I think I'm all right.

45
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.070
<v 4>Occasionally,
maybe when you are an acting like a scoundrel,</v>

46
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.380
<v 0>Scoundrel town.</v>

47
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.370
I like the sound of that.
Stop that.
Stop.
Boy.

48
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.440
Stop that.
My hands are dirty.
Dirty too.
What do you find out?

49
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.860
Frey?
You're trembling.

50
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.440
I haven't like Nice,
nice man.

51
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.840
<v 4>I isolated the reverse power flux coupling</v>

52
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.170
<v 6>in addition to its function in advancing the plot.</v>

53
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.670
This scene is sending us a whole bunch of messages about masculinity,
about men,

54
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.160
and about romance with women.

55
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.180
<v 1>The scene only lasts about a minute and a half during which time she rebuffed</v>

56
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:10.200
his advances eight different times with both verbal and nonverbal communication

57
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.560
and he ignores and disregards her each time.

58
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.820
Some will of course,
object to this reading of the seat.

59
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.410
They'll point out that as viewers were supposed to infer that layer despite her

60
00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:26.910
repeated objections secretly really wants it and that therefore it's okay for

61
00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:28.380
Hong to disregard for work.

62
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.640
I have no doubt that that is how the scene is meant to be understood and therein

63
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.560
lies the problem.

64
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.170
<v 6>The troubling implication here is that when women say no,</v>

65
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.380
they don't really mean it,
that when women say no,

66
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.530
it's just part of some courtship game were good girls play hard to get and that

67
00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:53.060
men are therefore justified in continuing to pressure them until they finally

68
00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:53.894
gave in

69
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.580
<v 1>in perhaps his second most famous movie role.</v>

70
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.390
Harrison Ford's character continues the same predatory behavior.

71
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.980
Indiana Jones not only refuses to listen to women when they say no,

72
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.680
he also uses course to get what he wants.

73
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.910
<v 5>I'm allowing you to tag along.</v>

74
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.540
So one or two the rest.
Okay,
dawn,

75
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.773
what do you mean

76
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.040
<v 4>tag along?
Ever since you got into my club,</v>

77
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.420
haven't been able to take your eyes off.

78
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.153
<v 5>Oh yeah.</v>

79
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.600
<v 1>At the end of Indiana Jones and the temple of doom leading lady.
Really?</v>

80
00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:32.360
Scott has clearly had no,
I mean these antiques,

81
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.980
which of her life in danger at least a dozen times over the course of the film.

82
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.730
So when he suggests she accompany him on another adventure,

83
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.890
Willie rebuffed him and no one's hurt.

84
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.400
<v 0>It's a long way to Delhi.</v>

85
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.210
<v 4>No thanks.
No more adventurous with U.
Dot.
S</v>

86
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.850
<v 0>wait heart after all the fun we've had together.</v>

87
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.760
<v 4>Do you think I'm going to Delhi with you or any else after all the trouble</v>

88
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:01.370
you've gotten me into thinking again,
buster,

89
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.430
I'm going on in Missouri where they never feed you snakes before,

90
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.290
rubbing your heart out lower,
even the hot.

91
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.100
This is not my idea of a swell time.

92
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.310
<v 6>She makes it clear that she's not interested and she walks away.</v>

93
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.140
Indeed doesn't listen.

94
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.980
<v 4>Excuse me sir.
I need a guide to Delhi.</v>

95
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.850
<v 1>He forcibly prevents her from leaving,
pulls her back to him and kisses him.</v>

96
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.060
It's important to note here that willy is written to have a positive response to

97
00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:32.500
indie's aggressive behavior.

98
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.320
Her Reaction Reinforces the myth that women secretly want it even and especially

99
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:44.060
when they explicitly say no.

100
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.400
The scene also contains another regressive message,
one about women's anger,

101
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.350
but we'll get back to that in a moment.

102
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.940
<v 3>Let's skip ahead to a scene in Indiana Jones and the last person just like in</v>

103
00:06:57.941 --> 00:06:58.900
Temple of doom.

104
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.830
Indie and Elsa have not had a romantic relationship up until this point.

105
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.610
<v 7>Knock it off.
You're like,
no,
no,</v>

106
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.540
I don't do things the same way.
You'd still be standing at the Venice.

107
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.150
What do you think is going on here?
Since I've met you,

108
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:23.980
I've nearly been incinerated drowns,
shot at and chopped into fish page.

109
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.500
We're caught in the middle of something sinister here.
My guest,

110
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:30.950
his dad found out more than he was looking for and until I'm sure I'm going to

111
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:34.190
continue to do things the way I think they should be done.

112
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.650
How you kiss me

113
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.280
<v 6>and here's where the narrative begins to reinforce more of those dangerous ideas</v>

114
00:07:44.281 --> 00:07:46.530
about courtship.
If that had been the end of it,

115
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.330
it could have served as a lesson and what men should not do.
Alas,

116
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.980
Elsa is written to reaffirm the same dangerous myths that we've been talking

117
00:07:55.981 --> 00:07:57.540
about in all the scenes so far.

118
00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:03.450
<v 7>I don't like fast women and I hate arrogant.</v>

119
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.310
<v 3>The idea that women secretly want men to force themselves on it.</v>

120
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.810
These two scenes are played as humorous,

121
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.560
but both still reinforce another pernicious idea.

122
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.530
The idea that women's anger isn't real,

123
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:27.050
that women's anger is instead an invitation to men to continue their advances.

124
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.830
For most of my life.
I said that blade runner was my favorite film of all time.

125
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.680
I don't say that anymore.

126
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.310
Ridley Scott's in 1982 masterpiece includes perhaps the most disturbing Harrison

127
00:08:47.311 --> 00:08:51.470
board,
so cold Romeo scenes,
the film frames of violence,

128
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:55.830
sexual assault,
committed by its protagonist as a of seduction.

129
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.390
First,
a little context.

130
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.400
Rick Deckerd has just informed Rachel that our memories are fake and that she's

131
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:08.190
not a human being as she previously believed,

132
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.400
but a machine keep in mind that it's deckards job to kill androids.

133
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Androids like Rachel Deckerd is drunk and Rachel is distraught

134
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.230
and he takes advantage of this vulnerable moment to kiss her.

135
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.370
When she doesn't respond to his advances,
he moves in again,

136
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.390
she backs away,
gets up,

137
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.210
grabs her coat and quickly heads for the door,

138
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.570
but like all the scenes we've looked at so far,

139
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.630
our hero refuses to take no for an answer.

140
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.270
Here's where it crosses the line into sexual assault.

141
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.400
Deckerd responds to rejection by getting angry and turn violent.

142
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.530
He punches the door closed,
grabs her,
shoved her against the window,

143
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.790
pins her there and then forces a kiss on her,
has tender music,

144
00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:20.020
starts playing to indicate to the audience that we are now supposed to find all

145
00:10:20.021 --> 00:10:20.950
of this seductive,

146
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.460
the implicit threat of violence ways on everything in the scene.

147
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.530
The scene includes many of the same dangerous messages we saw in previous

148
00:10:37.531 --> 00:10:41.040
examples.
Again,
we see the myth that women secretly want it

149
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.281
and again,

150
00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:47.930
the myth that women will respond positively to male aggression gets all here,

151
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.630
but there's something else going on as well.

152
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:56.290
We see decorative employing the tactics of a serial abuser to understand what I

153
00:10:56.961 --> 00:11:00.590
mean.
Let's rewind and watch part of that scene again.

154
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.700
Well,
pinning Rachel against the window.
Deckerd orders her to kiss.

155
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.603
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

156
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.160
<v 3>When she tries to protest,
he doesn't listen</v>

157
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.230
and commands her to ask for it.

158
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.420
Just so we're all clear on what's happening here.

159
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.840
Deckerd is forcing Rachel to give him consent under the threat of violence after

160
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:29.610
physically attacking her and trapping her and his apartment

161
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.510
with decker is doing is shifting the blame and the culpability for this assault

162
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.790
away from himself and onto Rachel.

163
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.300
He's forcing her to make the assault her fault.

164
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.210
He's forcing her can literally ask for it.

165
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.150
This is a particularly insidious form of emotional manipulation that's commonly

166
00:12:03.151 --> 00:12:05.340
used by men who commit domestic violence.

167
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:12.480
Lead runner is about a man in crisis,
a man uncertain about his job,

168
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.450
his place in the world,
and his own humanity,

169
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.990
but instead of facing that internal struggle,

170
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.160
Deckerd reasserts his own power by exerting power over women,

171
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.510
especially Rachel

172
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.641
in many ways.

173
00:12:29.641 --> 00:12:34.641
Harrison Ford and represents the paragon of all American Hollywood man who route

174
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.260
the eighties and nineties he was an almost unparalleled cinematic role model.

175
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.930
His movies offered us lessons in how to be a man,
had to be a good guy,

176
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.333
had to be,
yeah,

177
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.740
but they also taught us that aggressive sexual behavior is something that women

178
00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.010
admire and that young men and boys should emulate.

179
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.540
The tactics of invading a woman's personal space,

180
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.740
aggressively propositioning her multiple times and putting her in a very

181
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:11.150
uncomfortable position of having to reject you.

182
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.440
These are strategies that are right out of a pickup artist playbook.

183
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.570
It's the predatory worldview that's at the heart of what's often referred to as

184
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:20.410
rape culture.

185
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.400
Films that confuse coercion or abuse forced seduction are of course not limited

186
00:13:27.311 --> 00:13:29.200
to just Harrison Ford's nomography.

187
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.400
The conventions of predatory manhood are part of a long running Hollywood

188
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:42.090
tradition in popular movies,
television shows,
and music.

189
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.860
In the three decades since the release of blade runner,

190
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.130
very little has changed in terms of many of manhood.

191
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.500
Take this scene from specter,
their most recent James Bond film,

192
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.750
which was released in 2015

193
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.460
<v 0>it killed him
to my husband.</v>

194
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.660
He was an assassin.
Trust me,
he won't take it personally.

195
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.150
You're signing my death warrant.

196
00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.660
<v 3>The movement and blocking in this scene tells the whole story and it's a</v>

197
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:26.494
familiar one.

198
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:31.210
Notice that bond is always advancing on her and she is always backing your way.

199
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.290
Well,
I can tell you the deck on the trust you then you have impeccable packable

200
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.890
stinks.

201
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.660
James Bond is in the role of the Predator that slowly stocking and then trapping

202
00:14:40.661 --> 00:14:43.960
his prey I can think of was the implicit threat of bonds.

203
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:48.880
Violence permeates everything in this interaction as it does with decker in

204
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:49.714
blade runner

205
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.220
<v 0>James Bond.</v>

206
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.683
<v 3>Again,</v>

207
00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.520
we see the aggressive nature of this scene framed by the film as a form of

208
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:05.960
seduction.
The film is telling us that men don't need to listen to women,

209
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.920
that they should take what they want aggressively,
if necessary.

210
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.280
That once backed into a corner once coerced,

211
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.570
women will finally admit that they secretly wanted it all along,

212
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.730
even if they said no.

213
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.510
As the movies we just looked at illustrate,

214
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.840
men in our culture are socialized to believe that it's acceptable to pressure or

215
00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:33.590
coerce women.
When women say,
no,
Han Solo,

216
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.650
Indiana Jones and Rick Deckerd don't hear that.

217
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.320
They like too many men in our culture instead here not yet.

218
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.120
Or keep trying.

219
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.320
Despite the lessons of Hollywood style masculinity,

220
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.080
when women indicate that they're not interested in something,

221
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:55.420
that is never an indication to keep trying the absence of a heart,

222
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.970
<v 6>no.
Or even a very reluctant yes is not enough.</v>

223
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.040
Because if that's all that's required,

224
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.900
it opens up the door for forms of coercion and manipulation and it should go

225
00:16:05.901 --> 00:16:10.460
without saying that coercion and manipulation have absolutely no place in

226
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:12.560
romantic or sexual relationships.

227
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.890
<v 3>What we should be looking for instead is an enthusiastic yes.</v>

228
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.080
<v 4>Okay,
here we are.</v>

229
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.990
<v 3>The affirmative or enthusiastic model of consent encourages open,</v>

230
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:27.710
proactive communication,
mutual excitement and respect.

231
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.950
<v 4>Do you like it?
Like it?
I love it.</v>

232
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:37.160
I could kiss you.
I could.
I mean,
I'd like to,
I may.

233
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:39.720
I we me,
I mean,
maybe we wait,
what

234
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.330
if you'd like to see more videos related to media and manhood,

235
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.350
you can help fund the pop culture detective agency over on our patriot.
