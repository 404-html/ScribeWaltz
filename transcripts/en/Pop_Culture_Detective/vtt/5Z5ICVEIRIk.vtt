1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.500
That shows really weird.
Who wants to watch a cartoon about people crying?

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.813
I do.

3
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.040
<v 2>This is the first in a series of videos that we'll be exploring what Steven</v>

4
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.430
Universe has to say about men,
boys and masculinity.

5
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.020
Steven Universe is an animated show on cartoon network created by Rebecca Sugar.

6
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.180
It focuses on the adventures with the crystal gems,
Garnet,
Pearl,
Amethyst,

7
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.770
and of course Steven.

8
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.570
This series is exceptional for a whole bunch of reasons,

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.260
not least of which is because it's filled with powerful,

10
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:46.730
confident women who are central to the show and its plot.
Now,

11
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:47.870
if you haven't seen the show yet,

12
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.010
just pause this video right here and go and do that because it is good.

13
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.320
I mean really seriously good,

14
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.340
and currently there are something like 85 episodes and there about 10 minutes

15
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.830
long each,
which means that if you start right now,

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.860
you can watch them all in like 15 hours.

17
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.360
So once you've gone and done that does come back and pause the video and keep

18
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:10.040
watching.
All right?
All right.

19
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.750
Those of you who do follow the series probably already know that Steven Universe

20
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.900
has received a huge amount of praise for its diversity,

21
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.100
for it's feminist themes and for its positive depictions of queer relationship.

22
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.530
It really is remarkable for an adventure show to do any of this,

23
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.750
let alone one that's made for a younger audience.

24
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.800
But today I want to talk about something else that makes the show really

25
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:45.634
extraordinary,

26
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.690
something that gets maybe a little less attention and that is the way that it

27
00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:53.800
represents masculinity.
Now,
it may not seem like it at first glance,

28
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.410
but there is a ton of depth to this show.

29
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.530
So I want to break this discussion down into a few different parts,

30
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.060
but I want to start off by talking about emotional expression and highlight the

31
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:08.320
ways in which crying,
affection and fear are framed on the series.

32
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.980
<v 0>Well,
I guess I'm just too tough to cry.
Just today you were crying about snakes.</v>

33
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.750
They don't have any arms.

34
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.760
<v 2>You've probably heard the old adage,
boys don't cry,
but on Steven Universe,</v>

35
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.050
everyone cries.

36
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.290
Men and boys absolutely cry and their tiers are not portrayed as a sign of

37
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:27.020
weakness.

38
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.020
You saved me instead crying as depicted as a perfectly normal and healthy thing

39
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:37.390
for everyone to do.
It certainly is Steven.

40
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.360
Incidentally,
when I say that crying is healthy,

41
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.770
I mean that quite literally in both the physiological and the psychological

42
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:48.880
sense because tears are one of the best ways to relieve stress.

43
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.840
I should also mention that on Steven Universe,

44
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.080
tears are not limited to expressions of sadness.

45
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.580
Instead crying is used to express all of different emotions.

46
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.470
There are tears or pride,
tears of loss,
tears of self pity,

47
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.790
tears of anger,
tears of joy,
tears of suffering,

48
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.080
tears of fear,
tears of love,
tears of concern,

49
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.570
tears of bravery,
tiers of admiration,
tears of embarrassment,

50
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.520
tears of desperation,
tears of morning tears of betrayal,

51
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.930
tears of relief,
tears of confusion.
It's tears of regret,

52
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.170
tiers of determination and many,

53
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.000
many more because tears are so common and so varied crying,

54
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:41.380
it's just accepted as a normal response to all kinds of situations and that

55
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:46.381
normalization then opens up space on the show for it to occasionally poke fun.

56
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:51.481
At a character per behaving in a foolish or melodramatic way without poking fun

57
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:53.860
at the act of crying itself.

58
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.750
The series also has a fantastic sense of humor about all this crying as

59
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.010
evidenced by Steven's favorite cartoon show.

60
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.050
<v 3>Stay tuned for another episode of crime.
Breakfast.
Friends,
I must be getting old.</v>

61
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.850
She's the light cartoons.

62
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.330
<v 2>Open expression of vulnerability is extremely gendered in Western media culture</v>

63
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.740
being emotional,

64
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.720
especially crying is seen as stereotypically feminine as girl stuff.

65
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.020
We're all familiar with this stereotype that women are over emotional or

66
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:25.000
irrational or too sensitive.
Now,

67
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.180
of course that stereotype is complete nonsense.

68
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.710
Everyone has these emotions and everyone has these feelings.
In fact,

69
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.180
research has shown that male infants actually display more emotional expression

70
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.500
than female infants do,

71
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.630
but our society teaches boys at a very early age that it is not okay for them to

72
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:45.580
display their vulnerable sides.

73
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.820
We're taught that young man should bottle up most of their feelings.

74
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.230
The anger or aggression may sometimes be permissible for some men in certain

75
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:54.064
situations,

76
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.050
but that vulnerability is strictly off limits because it's been culturally

77
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:02.470
associated with weakness.
But on Steven Universe,

78
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.860
vulnerability is not equated with weakness.
Instead,

79
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.110
it simply equated with being a human being.

80
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.610
<v 3>Dad,
please,
I have to go back.
I have to.
They don't have my shield.</v>

81
00:05:13.611 --> 00:05:18.030
You do.
You understand?
Yeah.
Okay.

82
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.590
Just be careful.
Oh,
I'm going to run fresh out of family.

83
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.170
Stay with everyone and keep them safe.

84
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.270
<v 2>We see men and boys openly sharing their emotions and talking about their</v>

85
00:05:29.271 --> 00:05:31.400
feelings with their friends and their family.

86
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.840
No one is told to toughen up and no one has made to feel that expressing their

87
00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:37.970
feelings is something to be ashamed of.

88
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.790
<v 3>What are you smiling about?
You loved her.</v>

89
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.060
<v 2>Both physical and verbal expressions of affection,</v>

90
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.080
of love and of support are freely given in Stephen's world.

91
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.770
On Steven Universe.
There are lots and lots of hugs,
so,
so,

92
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.210
so very many hugs.

93
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.380
<v 3>I love you honey.
Welcome.
Well done.</v>

94
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.690
Mock it up.
We gotta go find a slicker.
No,

95
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.583
it's up time

96
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.110
<v 2>and just like crying.</v>

97
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.940
Physical signs of affection hold a vast array of different emotional meanings.

98
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.960
There are hugs of constellations.
It's okay.
We're here.
Hugs,
up,
protection,

99
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.400
hugs.
If forgiveness,
hugs of support.

100
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.190
I am so proud of you.
Yeah,
you to and I knew you could do it

101
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:44.840
and so many more.

102
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.760
It's also common for characters to express their love and their support for each

103
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:54.200
other very directly by simply telling them that that's how they feel.

104
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.490
Oh,
Steven,
there's one more thing I have to mention.
What is it?

105
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.490
I love you.
Bye.

106
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.650
<v 3>I love you paradox.
Why are you getting so worked up?</v>

107
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.950
You care them using beans.

108
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.600
<v 2>This emotional expression is all out there in the open,</v>

109
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.910
so we as the audience don't need to read between the lines on Steven Universe.

110
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.620
Characters don't need to mask their affection for each other behind cynicism or

111
00:07:25.621 --> 00:07:30.000
teasing or self deprecating humor as tends to happen on some other animated

112
00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:30.834
shows.

113
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.230
It's a very brave thing to show love and affection for others and to do it whole

114
00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:38.940
heartedly like Steven does well.
I think you're pretty great.

115
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.410
Tender and loving behavior is never framed as embarrassing or unmanly and his

116
00:07:43.411 --> 00:07:46.860
world and it's not reserved only for romance either.

117
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.360
This is especially remarkable when it comes to depictions of men's relationships

118
00:07:51.361 --> 00:07:54.680
with each other.
We see affection being actively encouraged,

119
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.070
<v 3>even between straight men,
particularly between Steven and yes</v>

120
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.000
<v 2>father,
but also between Steven and his friends,
including be</v>

121
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.680
<v 3>cool.
Okay,
that's nuts.</v>

122
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.670
<v 2>Now a quick note here,</v>

123
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.470
emotional expression is not the same thing as just having feelings.

124
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.600
Men,
even fictional men are not robots.
Well,

125
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.060
I mean they're mostly not.

126
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.970
Almost all male characters in media are meant to have feelings.

127
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.990
At least at some point,

128
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.410
these feelings are communicated to the audience through a variety of filmmaking

129
00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:32.970
techniques.
But most of the time,
men don't openly share those feelings.

130
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.290
Instead,

131
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:39.290
male characters choose to keep it to themselves except under a very narrow set

132
00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:43.620
of traumatic circumstances.
We're showing feelings is momentarily acceptable,

133
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.810
like when a loved one dies,
for example.

134
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.160
So when we're talking about emotional expression,

135
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.950
we're not just talking about men having feelings,

136
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.790
we're talking about male characters that openly share and communicate those

137
00:08:56.791 --> 00:09:00.600
feelings to others onscreen.
Okay,

138
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:04.950
so we've seen how crying and affection are not framed as weak or shameful,

139
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.180
but what about fear?
How has being afraid portrayed on the show?

140
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.330
The first thing to note is that on Steven Universe,

141
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.150
being scared is not framed as something negative.

142
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.320
Being afraid is instead portrayed as normal and as healthy.

143
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.880
<v 3>Now remember,
Steven,
if you run into any trouble out there,
you can always bail.</v>

144
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.080
There's never any shame in baling fatherly advice.
Understood.

145
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.100
Thank you dad.

146
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.600
<v 2>This approach differs from many other coming of age stories in which courage is</v>

147
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:46.020
often conflated with fearlessness.
In those narratives,

148
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.030
young men must learn to bury their fear of deep down because showing that you're

149
00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:54.480
afraid is widely seen as an act of cowardice.
This media message,

150
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:59.340
that fear is somehow shameful or unmanly then encourages young men to go out and

151
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:00.240
take dangerous,

152
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.370
unnecessary risks in a misguided quest to look like tough guys who have no fear.

153
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.350
It's true that unchecked fear can turn into paranoia and then drive people to

154
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:13.290
lash out and harm others and that's obviously not good.

155
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.850
But here's the thing about fear.
Fear is a natural human emotion.

156
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.370
It's a natural reaction to danger.

157
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.610
It's a biological response with a purpose and it's purpose is to keep us safe

158
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.500
and healthy.
That's fierce job

159
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.163
<v 0>space</v>

160
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.010
<v 2>and as such,
it's an important emotional part of life.</v>

161
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.180
Fear can help us assess when a situation may be too risky or too dangerous.

162
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.420
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

163
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.270
<v 2>it's fear that tells us,
hey,</v>

164
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.260
maybe it's not a good idea to go run around with scissors or play football and

165
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:58.200
traffic on the highway.
So only when Steven,

166
00:10:58.201 --> 00:11:00.360
let's his fear control and consume him,

167
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.810
does it become a problem?

168
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.500
<v 3>Tell me what's going to happen with my lunch too.
I choke on a pickle.</v>

169
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.450
You don't choke on a Google.
That means something else happens with the big goal,

170
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.780
<v 2>but as long as fear is not consistent or completely debilitating,</v>

171
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.550
it can be a very healthy thing.

172
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.410
Time and again,
the show communicates that listening to your fears

173
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.830
<v 0>kind of show it to</v>

174
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.430
<v 2>important step in building a good plan of action moving forward.</v>

175
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:46.010
<v 0>Why are you
all,
we're not going to make it</v>

176
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.450
<v 2>in Stephen's world,
acknowledging and being sensitive to your own fears.</v>

177
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.490
He's a true demonstration of bravery,

178
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.330
<v 3>Steven.
The truth</v>

179
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.110
<v 0>is with skin,</v>

180
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.730
we've been scared before,
right?
None of us know what's going to happen,

181
00:12:02.731 --> 00:12:06.840
but that's okay.
We can figure things out together.

182
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.340
<v 2>As I mentioned earlier,</v>

183
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.390
men and boys in our culture are expected to learn to bottle up their emotions.

184
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.730
Men may be allowed to have feelings,

185
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.930
but ultimately they're encouraged to keep those feelings buried deep inside.

186
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:23.764
Most of the time,

187
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.060
the series addresses this gendered convention directly in the episode.

188
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:28.894
Full disclosure,

189
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.700
Stephen is feeling overwhelmed and scared for the safety of his loved ones and

190
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:38.230
seeing this,
his friend Ronaldo gives him some terrible,
terrible advice.

191
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.450
<v 5>Yes,
Steven.</v>

192
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.960
That's just what people like us do suffer quietly shouldering the knowledge.

193
00:12:46.051 --> 00:12:47.430
No one else can bear.

194
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.060
This is no easy path we've chosen here.

195
00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.300
There are sacrifices.

196
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.330
Look at them all down there,
Steven.

197
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.810
It's our duty to let those simple people live out their simple lives without

198
00:13:03.151 --> 00:13:06.570
ever knowing the burden of being friends with us.

199
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.230
<v 2>That idea that men should shoulder difficult burdens all by themselves to</v>

200
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:15.430
protect those who are close to them is something deeply ingrained in our culture

201
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:20.710
and it's evidence of a very unhealthy form of masculinity and one that makes

202
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:25.660
interpersonal connections with others really difficult when men feel they must

203
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.040
go it alone emotionally.

204
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.270
It forces them to deceive their loved ones and try to face all of life's

205
00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:33.130
challenges without any support.

206
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.870
But Steven Universe is not a show about going it alone.
In fact,

207
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.940
this is a show about the opposite.

208
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.030
<v 3>It's time I got serious.</v>

209
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.060
Steven,
why is your communication device playing that song?

210
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.370
It's Connie trying to call me,

211
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:55.790
but I can't face her anymore so you're just going to ignore her forever.

212
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.190
It's the responsible thing to do.

213
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.520
<v 2>It's going to be hard cause she's coming up the steps right now.</v>

214
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.170
Although Stephen initially believes he must isolate himself to protect those

215
00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:10.470
around him.
The show has a very different lesson in store.

216
00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.150
<v 0>I don't want to be friends anymore.</v>

217
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.511
<v 2>In classic,</v>

218
00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:23.500
one of the Tough Guy Fashion Steven tells his friend Connie to leave him alone

219
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:26.180
to is heavy burden.
Steven,

220
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.680
<v 0>I can't be with you anymore.
I have a destiny.</v>

221
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.320
<v 2>Say it to my face,
but she refuses to leave him alone.</v>

222
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.543
She has persisted

223
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.800
and Steven ultimately decides to open up to her.

224
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:50.000
I still want to be friends.
Steven,

225
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.040
your eye,
what happened to

226
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.750
<v 3>you?
I didn't want you to worry about it.
I've been worried sick all day.</v>

227
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:00.950
What do you think I'm doing here?
I just wanted to protect you.
Stop.

228
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.840
Just tell me everything.

229
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.260
<v 2>He cries and he tells her the truth about his feelings,</v>

230
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.460
demonstrating that he has the courage to be openly vulnerable in front of her.

231
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.240
I can't stress enough how unusual this is for any piece of media.

232
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.460
This series is not content to simply hint at what the protagonist maybe feeling

233
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:22.580
deep down inside like so many other superhero stories.

234
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.120
Batman on Steven Universe,

235
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.480
male heroes don't brood or stew with unspoken emotion.

236
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.550
They dare to share their feelings openly with others.
In the end,

237
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.980
Steven's emotional.
Honesty is rewarded.

238
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.200
Connie is supportive of his feelings and affectionately reaffirms that she is

239
00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:43.820
there for him.
No matter what

240
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.940
<v 3>the least I could do is just listen.
I can't ask you to do that.</v>

241
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.560
I want to,
Steven,
I want to be a part of your universe.

242
00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:57.430
<v 2>The lesson here is that men and boys don't need to protect their loved ones from</v>

243
00:15:57.431 --> 00:16:02.410
things that might scare them.
Men Don't have to weather the storm alone.
Instead,

244
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.730
we can work through life's struggles together with our friends,
our lovers,

245
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:07.780
and our families.

246
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:11.980
It's going to take a long time for us to collectively unlearn these harmful

247
00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:13.900
notions about detached manhood,

248
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.220
but Steven's open and emotionally expressive version of masculinity.

249
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.620
That's an inspirational example for us.
All.

250
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.720
Next time we'll talk about Steven's powers and how those powers are connected to

251
00:16:25.721 --> 00:16:30.720
empathy.
I hope this video made you even more excited about Steven Universe.

252
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.110

<v 6>Yeah.</v>

255
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:44.570
<v 2>Hmm.</v>
