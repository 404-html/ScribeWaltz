1
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.370
Do you feel like you're working harder and harder these days just to stay

2
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:32.090
financially afloat while fat cats get richer and richer.

3
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.430
It's not just a feeling and you're not alone.

4
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.230
<v 2>The income gap between rich and poor in America,
is that an eight year high?</v>

5
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.010
That's the largest differential since the period immediately proceeding the

6
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:43.370
great day.

7
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.203
<v 0>Passionate.</v>

8
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.950
<v 2>They're getting more while the have nots are getting less.
Meanwhile,</v>

9
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.700
government isn't helping.
Decades of rising inequality

10
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.893
<v 0>fired.</v>

11
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.173
Wow.

12
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.413
<v 2>Oh,</v>

13
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.483
<v 0>recording.</v>

14
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.133
Wow.

15
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.370
<v 2>Matthew being run out of job.</v>

16
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.800
<v 0>Gosh,
Dang.
Wow.</v>

17
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.730
Hey
tomorrow.

18
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.290
Welcome to the program.
My name is Glenn Beck.

19
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.400
<v 1>The bad news is just multiplying.
Our economy is tanking.</v>

20
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.440
It doesn't show signs of improving their people.

21
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:39.090
Losing jobs are government responds to a the problems with bailouts and when you

22
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.440
call them up and say,
what are you doing?

23
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.240
You don't get any response or not listening to you.

24
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.800
Wall Street owns our government.
What did we get here?

25
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.400
I think a lot of people feel like they're alone and they just want to give up.

26
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.370
Wow.
Are you love my country?

27
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.590
It is the shining example of a place where people work together in peace and

28
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:04.180
friendship and worship God and make things better together.
Wow.
Wow.
Well,

29
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:08.780
the idea that built America are being lost and perverted,
man.
Wow.
Wow.

30
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.930
Wow.
Ask yourself this one question.

31
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.990
How many Marxist Communist anticapitalist do you have around you on a daily

32
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.274
basis?

33
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.163
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

34
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.310
<v 1>The truth is that you are the defender of liberty.</v>

35
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.690
Our situation is bad.
There are Nazis in America,

36
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.280
Nazis and communists.
You have to think like a German.

37
00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:44.600
June,
1934 the higher.
Hi.

38
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.580
Hi.

39
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.643
<v 0>Wow.</v>

40
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.230
<v 1>There is a perfect storm formulating and it is here we are entering a dangerous</v>

41
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:15.340
and scary time.
America,
the country will be washed with blood.

42
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.580
These people don't mess around.

43
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.040
They are taking you to a place to be slaughtered.
Death camp.

44
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.420
What planet am I landed on?
It's like that damn planet of the apes did.

45
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:32.210
I slip through a worm hole in the middle of the night and this looks like a

46
00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:36.640
mirror.
We're in a dark,
dark place.
We've got some dark dudes coming our way.

47
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.150
Black Panthers,
Acorn,
reparation,
welfare.

48
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.740
Jeremiah Wright jumps on my himself.
Alcaide Ram Islamic Jihad is breasts.

49
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.060
Venezuelan immigration,
Mexican was refugees from laws,
Spanish,
[inaudible],

50
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.200
America,
legal,
alien,
Mexico.
Every one is coming.

51
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.590
Enemy is not only in the gates there inside the house,

52
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.260
but again as BIA most come up,
Regan pestle.

53
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.440
Oh,
La Maxim.
Erica.

54
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.410
It's like a pack of wild clue.
Joe's ripping up the flesh of the American people.

55
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.330
<v 0>Drug Lords,
illegal aliens,
Mexico.</v>

56
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.220
They're going to start getting more and more violent.

57
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.470
We had been tossed into boiling water.
These people are cannibalizing,

58
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.583
cannibalize.

59
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.440
<v 1>That's what Barack Obama is doing to the American people.</v>

60
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.640
I'm hoping the guy with horns doesn't actually show up.

61
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.413
<v 0>Okay.</v>

62
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.140
<v 1>Everything is about to change to the extreme,</v>

63
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.020
the insider extreme.
We invite you to join up for nine 95 a month.

64
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.450
It's going to explain everything that is going on.

65
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.540
<v 0>Welcome.
Yeah.</v>

66
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.063
Hi.

67
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.920
<v 1>Insider extreme is up and on.
Hello?
Yes.
Sick,</v>

68
00:06:31.921 --> 00:06:36.800
twisted freak and welcome to the extremists.
Who are you?
Why not?

69
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.440
Why isn't that a name of some stupid Disney?

70
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.960
You can ask any question.

71
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.870
Oh,
sucks to be you,
doesn't it?

72
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.400
<v 4>When you bought a house,
you back that you could pay it,</v>

73
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.370
that nothing would happen.
It happened.
You lost.
Move on.

74
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.010
<v 1>Boohoo cry me a river.
Hey,
I got an idea.
Listen to this,</v>

75
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.720
<v 0>isn't it?</v>

76
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.550
<v 4>Get a job,</v>

77
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.520
<v 1>Lazy Slob that refuses to get off the couch and get a job.</v>

78
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.560
<v 0>All
right.</v>
