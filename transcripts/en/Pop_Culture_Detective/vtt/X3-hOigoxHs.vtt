1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.790
This is tagged to take one mark.
Alright gang.
Here we go.

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.390
The Big Bang theory is the most popular show on television.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.030
It centers on four male friends who were characterized by essentially every

4
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:19.080
Hollywood stereotype about geeks and nerds and exist to us.
All right,

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.400
just a few more feet and here we are gentlemen,

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.230
the gates of L's hubbub.
Good Lord,
don't panic.

7
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:32.550
This is what the last 97 hours of been about.
Leonard,
Sheldon,

8
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.610
Howard and Raj on lack most of the traits traditionally associated with leading

9
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.220
men in Hollywood.
They're not conventionally handsome,

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.910
they're not confident and they're definitely not athletic.

11
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.060
What they are are Dorky,

12
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.470
insecure fan boys who are plagued with a wide variety of anxieties,

13
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.560
illnesses and awkward personality quirks.

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.050
They also happen to be the perfect embodiment of the media trope,

15
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.290
which I call the adorkable,
misogynist,

16
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.380
adorkable misogynists or male characters whose geeky version of masculinity is

17
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:15.000
framed as both comically pathetic and endearing.
Wait,

18
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.210
what's on top of that?
Wireless web cams,
white pillow,

19
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.130
and it's their status as nerdy nice guys.

20
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.490
That then lets them off the hook for a wide range of creepy entitled and

21
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:29.220
downright sexist behaviors you may want to put on slacks.

22
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.850
Now in order to help explain how this convention works,

23
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.510
we will need to take a quick trip back in time to the 1980s

24
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.910
the year was 1984 gs and one of the most popular summer movies was a film called

25
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.960
revenge of the nerds.

26
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.633
<v 1>No,</v>

27
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.360
<v 0>he's worth the first socially awkward nerds to grace the big screen,</v>

28
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.640
but they did help popularize this type of character over the next few years.

29
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.600
This geeky guy archetype quickly gained traction in Hollywood.

30
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.063
How's it gone?

31
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.990
And by the 1990s it had become something of a mainstay in comedy entertainment.

32
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.060
It's worth noting that this type of character is nearly always white.

33
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.680
Though there are a few rare exceptions,

34
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.470
the Hollywood nerd is almost always positioned in opposition to the expected

35
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:45.120
norms of macho man.

36
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.370
This is usually accomplished through the juxtaposition with the jock archetype

37
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.030
when contrasted with hyper masculine guys who perform a crude aggressive form of

38
00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:01.300
manhood are geeky.
Hero gets to be framed as the better,
smarter,

39
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.580
more sensitive,

40
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.390
<v 1>the alternative.
He's the misunderstood.
Nice Guy,
I,
Betty,</v>

41
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.910
I'm not kissing a nurse who was unfairly bullied and mock the by his peers.

42
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.410
Not every guy's born with blonde hair and a chin.

43
00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:20.410
You could crack walnuts with catch babies.
I had to use my imagination.

44
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.530
<v 0>He's presented as the clear underdog in the manhood competition</v>

45
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.790
<v 1>that another way of saying,
I'm out of this world.</v>

46
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.020
I love the excitement right

47
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.903
<v 0>chasing you.</v>

48
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.650
<v 1>It's a good time to ask you about the dance</v>

49
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.620
<v 0>on closer inspection.
However,</v>

50
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.910
we start to notice that these types of characters are shown engaging in a

51
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.530
variety of harassing,

52
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.980
entitled and Sexist Behavior where women are concerned they consistently stock

53
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.200
spy on lie too and try to manipulate the women in their lives.

54
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.210
They're overbearing.

55
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.510
They refused to take no for an answer and they often ignore the basic tenants of

56
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:04.864
consent.

57
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.803
<v 2>Hey,</v>

58
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.750
<v 0>most of this behavior falls under the rubric of sexual harassment and</v>

59
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:17.940
occasionally it escalates to the level of sexual assault.

60
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.840
Both revenge of the nerds and 16 candles includes scenes in which Geeky,

61
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:26.820
nice guys commit acts of rape.

62
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.160
This type of behavior should be understood as reprehensible,

63
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.320
I say should be,

64
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.450
because that's not how these TV shows and movies frame it.
All right.

65
00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:40.740
You guys ready?
Wait,
huh?
Instead,

66
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.800
this behavior is framed as kind of pathetic.
I don't know what you're doing here,

67
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.180
away,
but ultimately harmless.
How's this look?

68
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.930
And even endearing in an adorkable sort of way.

69
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.110
Your Dad nerd.

70
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.790
<v 2>Yeah.
Do you?</v>

71
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.513
Thanks.

72
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.640
<v 0>And it's the adorkable part of the adorkable misogynist that makes this trope so</v>

73
00:05:07.371 --> 00:05:08.204
insidious.

74
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.600
So let's return to the Big Bang theory.
We have to get rid of the time machine.

75
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.930
The four geeky friends on this show are written to be genuinely likable.
Guys,

76
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.610
they're even capable of fleeting moments of heartfelt sensitivity,

77
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.550
thoughtfulness,
and sweetness.
What is it?

78
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.420
It's a snowflake from the North Pole.

79
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.760
Are you serious?
It'll last forever.
I preserved it.

80
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:42.010
And the 1% solution of polyvinyl ass little resin.

81
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.730
This nonthreatening adorkable framing is designed to excuse the other more toxic

82
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:53.500
part of the Tro,
the four leading men on Big Bang theory.

83
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.130
Each present their own distinct flavor of adorkable misogyny.

84
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.150
Howard is the creepy pervert with a heart of gold tone to cover it.

85
00:06:04.151 --> 00:06:05.570
You unkosher delight.

86
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.640
I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

87
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.000
Did you have opened the door if he knew it was me?
Not since I found out.

88
00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:19.460
The teddy bear you gave me had a Webcam in it.
Two route.

89
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.380
The first several seasons.
He's depicted as a want to be pickup artist.
Yes.

90
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.790
We're here to fix the cable.

91
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.120
He stocks harasses objectifies and tries to trick dozens of women into sleeping

92
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:33.440
with him.

93
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.440
How word talks about women the way a zookeeper might talk about trapping and

94
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.450
taming wild animals.
See,

95
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:46.050
first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd and then we go after the

96
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.280
week and the old and the lane.
He's conniving.

97
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.610
He's manipulative and his behavior sometimes crosses the line into criminal

98
00:06:55.921 --> 00:06:58.680
activity.
There's the house.
I found America's top models

99
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.140
built on the roof on I ECM.

100
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.480
Just LR sunbathing European style.

101
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.800
You can recognize people on Google Earth.
Of course not.

102
00:07:10.801 --> 00:07:14.130
I got a buddy of mine at norad to have a spy drone flyover.

103
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.350
I should note that once Howard is in a committed long term relationship,

104
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.850
the way that his male chauvinism is expressed does shifts slightly.

105
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.210
So we stopped trying to be a womanizer,
but he still demands to be taken care of.

106
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.340
Okay,
and he refuses to share any of the domestic responsibilities.

107
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.120
Kind of hard to get your game and how many cleaner cleaning up.

108
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.100
Look at the mess the joker made of Gotham city.

109
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:48.210
I want this to feel like my house to,
oh honey,
of course it's your house.

110
00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:50.610
That was,
why else would you be cleaning it all the time?

111
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.910
Raj is the sensitive guy turned inappropriate crump.

112
00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.120
<v 0>He's the show's token geek of color and is endlessly mocked for being the most</v>

114
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:08.150
feminine of the four friends.
I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

115
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:14.050
Raj is also the most socially awkward around women in the first few seasons.

116
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.460
He can't speak to women at all.
That's just fascinating.

117
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.820
Thank you.
Except when he's drunk or on drugs,

118
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.770
would you like to hear more about it?
In my hot tub,

119
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.550
and it's in those uninhibited moments when we see some very extreme levels of

120
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.130
underlying [inaudible] come to the forefront.

121
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.480
I'm very comfortable here.
Penny.
Joe,
why don't you shoot another silver bullet?

122
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

123
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.610
<v 0>Where are you going?
We're doing so low.
Even got to see my penis.</v>

124
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.180
Leonard is the nice guy enabling.

125
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.570
He plays the more down to earth normal.

126
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:03.510
One of the group still.

127
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.500
He participates in much of the same behavior as his cohorts.

128
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.090
Just to a lesser degree.

129
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.680
Leonard's character arc is basically the pathetic nice guy who refuses to take

130
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:20.310
no for an answer and who eventually gets the girl.

131
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.480
How did you get her to go out with you?
Well,
she moved in across the hall.

132
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.580
They started to slowly wear me down

133
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.900
<v 1>like a river carves,
a canyon.</v>

134
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.060
<v 0>One of the roles that Leonard plays on the show is as the guy who excuses and</v>

135
00:09:36.311 --> 00:09:41.311
enables the sexism of his male friends and you know that deep down inside

136
00:09:41.531 --> 00:09:43.120
Howard's a really nice guy

137
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:48.370
<v 1>cut the crap.
You set this up in you?
Yes.
She's a hooker.</v>

138
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.430
Isn't chain a prostitute?
Yes.

139
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.140
You already gave her the money.
Yes.

140
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.630
<v 0>He might roll his eyes at his friend's antics,</v>

141
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:08.870
but he never seriously challenges their behavior,
but I'd like to get lost.

142
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.100
Awesome.
Herb.
You don't triangle.

143
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.420
<v 1>It's not helpful then I won't say I'd like to cover three quarters of her</v>

144
00:10:16.421 --> 00:10:17.254
surface area

145
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.820
<v 0>and his mild protests work as a springboard for still more sexist jokes.</v>

146
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.730
Not yet.
This is fun.
I know

147
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.850
Sheldon is the innocent bigot.

148
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.550
Most of the guys display a general disdain for icky girl stuff,

149
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.970
but Sheldon is the one who harbors the most virile inform of casual misogyny.

150
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.660
Tonight's theme flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women.

151
00:10:50.661 --> 00:10:52.040
I have a feeling we're responsible.

152
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:59.060
My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas

153
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.163
<v 1>hello</v>

154
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.220
<v 0>zone.
Only appealing for a short time.</v>

155
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.060
The whole shtick is Sheldon's character is that he's too smart to understand or

156
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.570
care to understand what's socially appropriate and what's not.

157
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.650
As such,
he's dismissive of nearly everyone and their feelings,

158
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.590
but when he belittles and devalues women,

159
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.420
it's very specifically because they are women.
Thanks to you.

160
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:32.160
I know better than to ask if you're menstruating

161
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:41.260
and based on your behavior.
I don't have to.
Oh,
you hear women say is,

162
00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:45.340
I'll just have a salad.
Where's my lip gloss?

163
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.890
I think this element should be called radium.

164
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

165
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.090
<v 0>That last one was madame Curie.
You what?
She was kind of an honorary man.</v>

166
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.520
She had a penis,
made a science.

167
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.530
So how does the Big Bang theory keep us as the audience,

168
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.630
sympathetic to men who behave in such a reprehensible ways?
Action.

169
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.111
Well,

170
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:13.111
it's done by leaning heavily on a combination of ironic humor and a popular

171
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:15.400
writers trick known as lamp shading.

172
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.370
Most of the jokes on the Big Bang theory such as they are revolve around the

173
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.810
following ironic hook.

174
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.560
Since geeky guys don't fit into the macho mold of what we expect sexism or male

175
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:30.220
entitlement to look like.

176
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.970
It's funny to watch them engaging in that type of behavior.

177
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.990
It's anything good happened Thursday,
let's hit the clubs and meet hot women.

178
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.250
Do we go lock up?
Your daughters were gonna hit it and quit it.

179
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.840
Notice the target of the joke is not the misogynist behavior.

180
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:53.180
Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
Hold sweat,
good plan.

181
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.020
Instead,

182
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.460
it's making fun of men who are not traditionally masculine enough to believably

183
00:12:58.461 --> 00:13:00.130
pull it off,
smell bad.

184
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.470
It's a smell of new comic books.

185
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.960
Unlike many of our earlier examples from the 1980s the creepy behavior on the

186
00:13:08.961 --> 00:13:12.350
Big Bang theory is meant to be understood for what it is.

187
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.350
I know you think you're some sort of smooth talking ladies,
man,

188
00:13:15.351 --> 00:13:19.430
but the truth is you are just pathetic and creepy and this is where ironic

189
00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:22.100
lampshade shading comes in.
So what are you saying?

190
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.130
Which is when media makers deliberately call attention to a dissonant or overly

191
00:13:28.131 --> 00:13:32.330
cliched aspect of their own production rather than writing better,

192
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:37.360
different punchlines writers attempt to duck any potential criticism by pointing

193
00:13:37.551 --> 00:13:41.900
out the sexism inherent in their own jokes themselves.
Well,
it that's it.

194
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.820
Confirm we now have the address of the top model.
Okay.
For the record,

195
00:13:46.821 --> 00:13:49.140
what do you guys are doing is really creepy.
You know what?

196
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.560
If it's creepy to use the internet,

197
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.790
military satellites and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young

198
00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:59.840
models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly,
then fine.
I'm creepy.

199
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.380
This technique of making something super obvious to viewers is meant to let us

200
00:14:06.381 --> 00:14:10.700
know that the writers are self aware and to make us feel like we're all in on

201
00:14:10.701 --> 00:14:11.534
the joke.

202
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:16.990
Most comedy writers know that Retro Grade Style bigotry is no longer acceptable

203
00:14:17.121 --> 00:14:21.900
on prime time television,
but many of them still want to use sexist,

204
00:14:21.901 --> 00:14:25.590
racist,
and homophobic jokes as an easy way to get cheap.

205
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.250
Actually any monopolies just like regular,
except the money's in rupees.

206
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.720
Instead of hotels,
you build call centers and when you pick a chance card,

207
00:14:34.721 --> 00:14:35.880
you might die of dysentery.

208
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.200
Ironic lamb shading provides a clever way for them to keep getting away with it.

209
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.770
It just Fyi,
that was racist

210
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.200
problem with this comedic device.
Is that by itself?
Hey,
I'm in judge.

211
00:14:51.201 --> 00:14:54.450
Your phone support seems a bit racist.

212
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:59.220
He doesn't critique or challenge sexism,
homophobia,
or racism.

213
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.610
It's simply acknowledges it in a humorous way.

214
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.670
Very clever,
but still racist.
Duly noted,
Steve,

215
00:15:08.671 --> 00:15:09.480
from Wichita.

216
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.770
Acknowledging bigotry is not the same thing as critiquing bigotry,

217
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:19.250
especially when the punchlines end up making light of serious social issues like

218
00:15:19.381 --> 00:15:21.660
sexual harassment.
That to Cooper,

219
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:25.280
you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workflows.

220
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.890
Oh,
I see the confusion here.

221
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.350
Alex thought I was singling her out.
No,
I met that all women are

222
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.540
<v 1>urgent.</v>

223
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.120
<v 0>You know,
even you.</v>

224
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.173
<v 1>No.</v>

225
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.380
<v 0>So while it's true,</v>

226
00:15:41.381 --> 00:15:46.300
the message of the Big Bang theory isn't sexism is super cool or lacks.

227
00:15:46.301 --> 00:15:47.770
No one's going to be looking at her hair.

228
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.950
I'd argue the implications are much more troubling because the show is message

229
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:59.010
is more akin to sexism is mostly harmless and especially when that sexism is

230
00:16:00.971 --> 00:16:05.520
coming from Geeky guys.
There are pitfalls.
Trust me,

231
00:16:05.521 --> 00:16:08.910
I know when it comes to sexual harassment law,

232
00:16:08.911 --> 00:16:11.370
I'm a bit of a self taught expert.

233
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:18.690
Misogyny is presented as just another socially awkward personality quirk as

234
00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:24.280
something that's perhaps deserving of an eye roll or an exasperated look or

235
00:16:24.281 --> 00:16:25.900
maybe some lighthearted chiding,

236
00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:31.180
but never as something to be taken seriously or seriously challenged.

237
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.033
Wow.

238
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

239
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.970
<v 0>You're engaged to my friend,</v>

240
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.520
Bernadette doesn't mine where I get my motor running.

241
00:16:38.521 --> 00:16:40.320
As long as I parked in the garage,

242
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.980
I can't believe you're engaged to my friend and it's core workable.

243
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.700
Misogynists trope is built around the old axiom that boys will be boys.

244
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.753
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

245
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.490
<v 0>and what that phrase really means is boys will be sexist or boys will be creepy</v>

246
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:03.460
stalkers who sexually harassed women as the case may be.

247
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.590
On the very rare occasions when one of the Geeks is called out for his sexism.

248
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.800
The audience has meant to feel bad for him because his feelings got hurt on

249
00:17:16.081 --> 00:17:16.770
television,

250
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.690
men's feelings and bruised egos are nearly always depicted as more important

251
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.590
than women's comfort for women's safety.
Look,
Howard,

252
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.520
I just want to apologize.

253
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.950
Be adorkable misogyny of the four main characters on the Big Bang theory is

254
00:17:34.951 --> 00:17:38.370
tolerated.
It's tolerated by their peers,

255
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.470
by their girlfriends and by their employers.
Well,

256
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.950
despite your quirks that three of you are very accomplished in your respective

257
00:17:46.951 --> 00:17:49.980
fields.
No what mean by quirks.

258
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.680
The trope downplays the sexism of men who don't fit into the macho stereotype.

259
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.720
My framing it as pathetic,
as nonthreatening and is not that big of a deal.

260
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.341
Of course,

261
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:07.341
the reality is that sexism is a big deal as practically any women involved in

262
00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:11.640
Geek subcultures will tell you,
everybody was staring at me.

263
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.250
There is sadly no shortage of real life.

264
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:19.251
Examples of men involved in nerdy hobbies or professions who behave exactly like

265
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:23.730
the guys on the Big Bang theory and it's not harmless and it's not adorkable

266
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:27.660
sexual harassment scandals and had been sweeping through silicon valley.

267
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.520
That's 60% of women who work in the tech industry have reported on wanted sexual

268
00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:36.710
advances as in it's simplest form.
It's a Toric,
the tax against women,

269
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.690
a frequent problem inside Uber,

270
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.920
sexual harassment and sexism she described and it's harmful in all the ways the

271
00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:46.490
Big Bang theory tells us it's not.
It's damaging to women.

272
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.990
It's damaging to their sense of safety to their wellbeing into their careers.

273
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.190
Former Google engineer who wrote a 10 page memo criticizing the company's

274
00:18:55.191 --> 00:18:59.780
diversity programs saying women lag behind in the tech world because of their

275
00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:00.614
biology.

276
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.740
The unnamed Google engineering employee wrote biological causes may explain why

277
00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:08.540
we don't see equal representation.

278
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:13.760
Men have a higher drive for status and women on average have more neuroticism.

279
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.950
If we added a laugh track to that clip,

280
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:20.240
it would be indistinguishable from the casual sexism that we can see on

281
00:19:20.241 --> 00:19:24.900
practically any episode of the Big Bang Theory.
Trouble isn't with me penny,

282
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.930
it's with your gender and Sunday.

283
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.890
Scientists will discover at second x chromosome contains nothing but nonsense

284
00:19:30.891 --> 00:19:31.724
and twaddle

285
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.660
and how difficult it is to do when she's bloated,
cranky and crampy.

286
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:46.720
Just because the performance of a geeky version of masculinity is markedly

287
00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:48.850
different from traditional Hollywood archetypes.

288
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.130
That doesn't necessarily mean that eeky guys are any less invested in sexism.

289
00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:59.920
The bottom line here is that there's nothing cute or harmless about misogyny

290
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.200
even when it's coming from men who may play Cleon boggle time.

291
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.430
It's really not that difficult to write nerdy male characters who aren't total

292
00:20:09.431 --> 00:20:10.264
creeps.

293
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.800
There's our bed from the show community you have to understand about avid.

294
00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.510
He's usually,
you know,
adorable.
We're like more for more.

295
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.720
There's line old from dear white people,

296
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.630
the TV series and there's Ben from parks and rec presenting.

297
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.010
The cones have done Shyer,
a brand new gaming experience.

All these characters somehow managed to perform a quirky,

299
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.980

I'll see you all next month with another video about Big Bang theory this time

308
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.560
