00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.050
Tron legacy Disney's neon infuse sequel to the 1982 classic includes a

2
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:17.670
particularly egregious example of a trope that has bothered me for years.

3
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.990
<v 1>It's a gendered convention that will be instantly familiar to science fiction</v>

4
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:26.824
fans.

5
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.630
<v 2>The convention shows up over and over again in speculative media,</v>

6
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.990
but it didn't have a name,
so I gave it one.

7
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.130
I call it born sexy yesterday.

8
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.901
She said,

9
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:48.901
I saw the character of Cora is an isomorphic algorithm or ISO.

10
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.920
Basically,
she's a sentient computer program in the shape of a woman.

11
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.210
She's the miracle now.
Everything I ever worked for

12
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.450
a digital frontier to reshape the human condition

13
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.960
as the last of the ISOS.
Cora is described it this way.

14
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.620
<v 1>Profounding naive
on imagine a play wise.</v>

15
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.140
<v 2>If that sounds vaguely like something someone might say about a child,</v>

16
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.440
it's no accident because that's exactly how tron legacy portrays Cora,

17
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.920
<v 1>but between you and me,
Jules furnace,
my favorite,</v>

18
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.250
do you know Jules Verne?
Sure.
What's he like?

19
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.140
<v 2>She has the mind of a naive yet highly skilled child,</v>

20
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.950
but in the body of a mature,
sexualized woman.

21
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.550
She also serves as our heroes love interest.

22
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.080
Profoundly naive yet unimaginably wise captures the essence of this trope.

23
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.650
Born yesterday is an idiom meaning extremely naive,
inexperienced,

24
00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:06.580
or ignorant.

25
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.480
<v 0>Hey,
thanks.
I'm too stupid,
Huh?
Uh,
no,
he's right.
I'm stupid and I like it.</v>

26
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.783
<v 0>You do</v>

28
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.353
<v 1>activated</v>

29
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.400
<v 2>as immediate trope,</v>

30
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.730
foreign sexy yesterday as both a figurative and in many cases a literal meaning

31
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.860
in 1997 the [inaudible] cult classic.

32
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.040
The fifth element is probably the most quintessential example of born sexy

33
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:44.484
yesterday

34
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.650
<v 1>told you perfect.</v>

35
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.380
<v 2>Like Cora Lilu is whimsical and naive.</v>

36
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.063
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

37
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 2>but she's also deliberately framed in a sexualized way.</v>

38
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.820
Make perfect.

39
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.160
I know the female characters that this trope is built around are defined by

40
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:12.910
their innocence of an experience with worldly things,

41
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.470
especially when it comes to sex,
romance,

42
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.070
or basic social interaction.
What do you mind if I kissed you

43
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.240
through the use of science fiction conventions they're brought into the human

44
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:33.241
world already fully formed the mind of a child manifest in a mature female body.

45
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.570
She may be an Android,
a computer program,
a mermaid,

46
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.860
an alien,

47
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.100
a magical being or otherwise raised in an environment isolated from the rest of

48
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:48.850
human society.

49
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.310
Many of these female characters have one very specific thing in common.

50
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.540
They're all deliberately written to be completely unaware of their own sex

51
00:03:58.541 --> 00:03:59.374
appeal.

52
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.160
This then provides film makers with an excuse to include at least one scene in

53
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:10.120
which she disrobed in front of men.
And because she's so naive,

54
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.000
she doesn't understand the implications of this action.

55
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.320
As you might imagine,

56
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.350
there's quite a bit of overlap here with the manic pixie dream girl trope.

57
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.480
Where does the water come from?
Uh,

58
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.580
well the uh,
the water comes from the pipes.
The pipes get it.

59
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.920
Although characters who are born sexy yesterday are often highly skilled at

60
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:52.900
something that men will respect.
Frequently that thing has common.

61
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.190
Now,

62
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.810
so far we've only focused on the female characters associated with this trope,

63
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.280
but it isn't really about that.

64
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.900
Like most things in Hollywood born sexy yesterday,

65
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.790
he has written for men and ultimately it's a relationship.
True.

66
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.670
Perfect.
So that means we need to talk about the other side of the equation.

67
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.680
The male heroes,

68
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.520
typically he's a straight red blooded man who has for a variety of reasons,

69
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.030
found himself alone or unsatisfied in love.

70
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.920
He finds himself disenfranchised or otherwise direction.

71
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.490
He either can't find or doesn't want a woman and from his own world,

72
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.390
a woman who might be his equal in matters of love and sexuality.

73
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.500
He does have one thing going for him that he knows all about living life as a

74
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:10.250
normal human being.
It's too bad you don't eat food like find.

75
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.870
It can be quite pleasurable once you get pleasure out of food here.

76
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.000
If you want my secrets,
you'll eat my sandwich.
Of course.

77
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.380
So does every other guy on earth,
which should make him unremarkable.

78
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.920
Ju Ju except to a woman born yesterday because she's presumably never known

79
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:36.050
another man.
He would seem like the smartest,

80
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.990
most amazing guy in the entire universe.

81
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.670
How much cheese on Rye with mail,

82
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.280
and here's where we start to see how the trope is constructed as a male fantasy.

83
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.220
It's precisely her naivety and her innocence that allows her to see something

84
00:06:58.221 --> 00:06:59.054
special in him.

85
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:04.630
Something that other less innocent or more experienced women cannot estimated

86
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.840
times 600 seconds.

87
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.860
Now we don't have time to go into it here,

88
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.050
but born sexy yesterday is absolutely everywhere in Japanese anime.

89
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.180
Now I should note that born sexy yesterday is not a modern trope.

90
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.730
In fact,
it's been a fixture of classic Hollywood science fiction films since the

91
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:32.790
beginning of the genre as well as intriguing.

92
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.450
I wanted to just how far women would permit this to go.

93
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.100
<v 3>There's nothing really personal,
just a kiss</v>

94
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.770
to kiss each other.
It's an old custom,

95
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.500
all of the really high civilizations going forward,

96
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.860
but it's good for you though.
It stimulates the whole system.
As a matter of fact,

97
00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:57.910
you can be in tip top health without it.

98
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.330
I'd be only too happy to show you.
Thank you very much.

99
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.020
<v 2>Forbidden Planet in 1956 is one example.</v>

100
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.380
The time machine in 1960 is another.

101
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.070
Wow.
What's your name?

102
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.260
How do you spell it?
Spam.

103
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.880
Spelled right.
Country ride.

104
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.140
Then there's the character of Nova from the original planet of the apes.

105
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

106
00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.670
<v 2>Touch you to smile.
Who is the protagonist?
Love interest.</v>

107
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.910
Despite not understanding the concept of language.

108
00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.290
The troop usually involves a white women,
but born sexy.

109
00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:03.980
Yesterday is an offshoot of a much older media convention

110
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.033
<v 1>monkey,</v>

111
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.010
<v 2>one in which white adventurers discover indigenous women.</v>

112
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.920
Although in this case,
science fiction replaces colonialism,

113
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.590
has the mechanism driving that narrative.

114
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.330
<v 1>I had a boom,
boom,
boom,</v>

115
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.040
Bada boom,
Bada boom.
Big,
big motto.
Phone

116
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.090
<v 2>still sometimes it's a little of both.</v>

117
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.470
One sexy yesterday fetishize is the stark power imbalance between a wiser,

118
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.710
more experienced man and I'm naive,
inexperienced woman.

119
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.940
It's the ultimate teacher student dynamic.

120
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.780
<v 5>It's the customer by people to help.
I don't know,
one more intro.</v>

121
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.620
<v 2>Star Trek is famous for making frequent use of this truck.</v>

122
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.320
Perhaps infamous is a better word because the trope shows up in the original

123
00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:14.740
series and then in every other series afterwards.

124
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.400
<v 1>This
is this also</v>

125
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.810
you could call it.
That

126
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.140
helped me.
Once again,

127
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.550
<v 2>let's start by doing something different with your hair.</v>

128
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.580
Seven of nines relationship with the doctor on Star Trek.

129
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.960
Voyager is a prominent example,
especially as depicted in the episode.

130
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.770
Someone to watch over shaking your head a little bit.

131
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:58.840
Is this more appropriate fans of that series will remember that the doctor's own

132
00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:03.400
social naivety is never framed by the show as something sexy.

133
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.770
Actually I choose.
I think you'd look very nice and this one,

134
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.780
I am uncertain how to wear such a garment.
Assist me.

135
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.830
Oh,
I'm sure you'll manage.
I'll go prepare the holiday.

136
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.080
Remember the idea is to have fun tonight.

137
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.860
I'll expect a full report in the morning.
Hold on.
Born sexy.

138
00:11:24.861 --> 00:11:29.330
Yesterday was a major part of seventh character at least to begin with.

139
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.660
She is ultimately made much more than that and outside of a handful of rather

140
00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:36.500
cringeworthy episodes.

141
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.420
Seven story is largely one of self realization and self discovery,

142
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.990
which manages to transcend the constraints of the trope

143
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.200
to a large degree.

144
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:52.790
This is also true of a character like Somnio four five one from cloud atlas like

145
00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:57.160
seven romantic relationship is downplayed while her character development is

146
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:57.994
made.
Central.

147
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:58.840
<v 1>No.</v>

148
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.840
Unless you send mirror and for first time in my life I was allowed to see how

149
00:12:04.081 --> 00:12:06.870
high was and who I might be calm,

150
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.000
<v 2>which brings me to this point.</v>

151
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.470
The problem with this trope is not necessarily with the female characters

152
00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:14.304
themselves.

153
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:19.560
If these were simply stories involving naive extra terrestrial women who learned

154
00:12:19.561 --> 00:12:24.360
about love and humanity,
then that wouldn't be an issue.
Likewise,

155
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:27.870
if the male hero was also inexperienced in our two protagonists,

156
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.180
could discover love and sex together,

157
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.870
then that would avoid most of the troubling power dynamic issues.

158
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.920
What's going on.
You need to understand how it works,

159
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.710
<v 1>what
this chip</v>

160
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.020
<v 2>his body,
so for example,</v>

161
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.140
Cameron from the Sarah Connor Chronicles TV show,

162
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:53.530
it's the true but her relationship with a young John Connor is framed as much

163
00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:55.640
more of a mutual exploration

164
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.550
since born sexy yesterday hinges on a lopsided power dynamic.

165
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.790
It's almost never portrayed the other way around.

166
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.320
It's extremely rare for a more experienced female character to teach a naive man

167
00:13:11.421 --> 00:13:14.450
about sex.
I think you better go home now Mary sue,

168
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:19.530
<v 1>why I think I might be ill or</v>

169
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.250
something's happening
that's supposed to happen.

170
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.980
It is.
Trust me.

171
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.070
Well,
wait,
no,
no,
no.
It should just

172
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:44.260
<v 2>perhaps that's because most grown women don't find the idea of dating and</v>

173
00:13:44.301 --> 00:13:47.080
inexperienced adolescent boy.
All that.
Okay.

174
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.540
<v 1>Peeling.
I don't know.
But uh,</v>

175
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.360
you need that last so much first.
So fast.

176
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.650
<v 2>On the rare occasion when the gender is our first male ineptitude,</v>

177
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.500
then becomes the butt of the joke.
Right?

178
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.860
<v 6>This is the woman from the baseball card store.
Remember me?
Oh yes.
Hi.</v>

179
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.120
Hello.
Diggity dog.
Thanks for calling me on the telephone.

180
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.650
<v 2>She may even end up falling for him,</v>

181
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.080
but she falls for him despite his inexperience,
not because of it.

182
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.200
Oh,
sorry.
I forgot about the auto wash.

183
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.310
Worn sexy yesterday is about an unbalanced relationship,

184
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.970
but it's also very much connected to masculinity.

185
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:48.140
The subtext of the trope is rooted in a deep seated male insecurity around sex

186
00:14:48.301 --> 00:14:49.230
and sexuality.

187
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.080
The crux of the trope is a fixation on male superiority fixation with holding

188
00:14:56.661 --> 00:14:58.820
power over an innocent girl.

189
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.670
But in order to make that socially acceptable,

190
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.940
science fiction is employed to put the mind at that girl into a sexualized adult

191
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:11.120
woman's body.
It's a fantasy based on fear,

192
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.780
fear of women who are men's equal in sexual experience and romantic history and

193
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:21.110
fear of losing the intellectual upper hand to women

194
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.730
in Woody Allen's 1973 comedy sleeper,

195
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.330
the protagonist is frozen and when he wakes up in the future,

196
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.690
he's suddenly and very conveniently the only man left on earth who still

197
00:15:36.791 --> 00:15:38.500
remembers how to have sex.

198
00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:45.510
That same exact thing happens just alones character in demolition,

199
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.653
<v 1>ma'am</v>

200
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.300
are all fluid transfer activities like this better,
better,

201
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.960
<v 2>so born sexy.</v>

202
00:15:57.961 --> 00:16:02.070
Yesterday is a science fiction trope that's designed specifically.

203
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:07.130
So male heroes get to automatically be the most extraordinary man in a woman's

204
00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:08.820
life again,

205
00:16:08.821 --> 00:16:12.930
because they're basically the only man to have ever been in her life.

206
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.703
As such,

207
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.780
the true rests on some troubling patriarchal ideas about female purity and

208
00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:26.530
virginity.
By definition,
characters born sexy yesterday,

209
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.880
have no past lovers and no previous sexual experiences.

210
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:36.310
She is framed as pure and innocent sexually and romantically unchanged and

211
00:16:36.311 --> 00:16:38.710
uncorrupted by the attention of other men.

212
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:46.040
The male hero therefore avoids even the possibility of being compared,

213
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.040
of being judged,
of not measuring up.
I never knew.

214
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.670
At the end of the day,

215
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.900
this is a male fantasy about escaping the humiliation of rejection.

216
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.740
Since he's the first end,
only man in this woman's life,

217
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.530
he gets to be the best by default.

218
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:06.450
<v 1>Okay?</v>

219
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.980
<v 2>Which means he doesn't even have to try it.
Better partner,</v>

220
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.560
a better boyfriend or a better lover.

221
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.560
<v 1>That's what we call it.
Kiss.</v>

222
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.010
<v 2>Of course,
the reality is that life experience is a plus,</v>

223
00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.990
not a minus in relationships.

224
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.303
<v 1>Okay?</v>

225
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.760
<v 2>And we need more media to reflect that.</v>

226
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:37.240
We need media and where men enthusiastically embrace women who are their equals

227
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.720
equals in everything,
including in matters of love and sex.

228
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.650
So do all you would be science fiction writers out there.

229
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.310
I'll leave you with this.
Innocence is not sexy.

230
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.310
<v 7>Knowledge and experience on the other hand,</v>

231
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.640
now that that's extremely sexy,

232
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.540
if you'd like to see more videos related to media and manhood,

233
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.590
just hop on over to my patrion page and help fund the pop culture.

234
00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:08.424
Detective agents.

235
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:08.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>
