1
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.600
CBS is hit Sitcom.

2
00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:12.040
The Big Bang theory delights in hooking fun and it's male characters.

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.950
Were there fanboy obsessions with comic books,
video games,
and

4
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.060
often the punch lines aren't really jokes per se.
Instead,

5
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.300
laughs are derived by simply referencing something that sounds vaguely nerdy.

6
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.910
Did you shut the TV off in the middle of the classic deep space?
Nine Star Trek,

7
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.920
the original series trouble with tribbles crossover.
Yeah.

8
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.640
I suspect this is one of the reasons why so many people involved in Geek

9
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:50.090
subcultures tend to dislike the show so much.

10
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.290
It's essentially one long joke at their expense,

11
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.540
but I'd argue there's something more pernicious going on just under the surface,

12
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.260
so that's cool.
If I cry a little,
yeah,
I probably wouldn't.

13
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.690
Yeah.
Beyond its general mocking of Geekdom,

14
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.020
the show is relentless in making fun of it's male characters for not living up

15
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.640
to traditional expectations of manhood.

16
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.880
On the surface.

17
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:25.881
It might seem like these nerdy nice guys represent a welcome alternative to the

18
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.210
Macho archetypes that we've all come to expect from Hollywood,

19
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.740
but on closer inspection we find that despite their status as nerdy outsiders,

20
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.230
these guys are still complicit in many of the most destructive aspects of toxic

21
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:44.700
masculinity.
Yes,

22
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:48.930
but our society has undergone a paradigm shift in the information age.
Sheldon,

23
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.130
you and I are the Alpha males.
We shouldn't have to back down.

24
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.540
I'm going to assert my dominance face to face in my previous video essay about

25
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:01.440
the adorkable misogynists trope.

26
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.800
I discussed the creepy entitled and often sexist ways in which these geeky guys

27
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.973
treat women

28
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.580
and then we get them up to about a 0.15 blood alcohol level and tell them we're

29
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:15.414
millionaires.

30
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.920
But I think it's also worth examining how they treat each other.

31
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.200
The first thing we need is a theme.

32
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.470
I'm thinking to another century.

33
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.490
I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch and by extension how the show's

34
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:39.961
writers end up reinforcing a whole bunch of regressive ideas about what it means

35
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:45.010
to be a real man.
Beer wings,
sliders,
we can watch the football game.

36
00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:46.150
I even painted my stomach.

37
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.580
There's a running gag on this show about how Leonard doesn't understand sports

38
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:56.420
or other activities that are stereotypically associated with men.

39
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.510
Go Sports.
Wow.
It gets you in the mood for baseball.

40
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:06.190
I didn't want to look ridiculous.
Yes.
Are you people watching this?

41
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:08.850
This is amazing.
Or what sweetie?

42
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.440
That's a highlight from 98 championship game.

43
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.633
<v 0>Not Know that</v>

44
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.430
<v 1>the joke relies on the assumption that all men are supposed to like sports and</v>

45
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:24.880
therefore it's inherently funny and absurd if a guy does it.

46
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.030
Now sitcoms are of course supposed to be funny,
but as with all comedy,

47
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.740
it's important to ask who are we meant to laugh with and who are we meant to

48
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:36.610
laugh at?

49
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.180
<v 1>Notice the laughter in this scene stems almost entirely from seeing Howard</v>

51
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.920
wearing an apron.
What's with the gloves?
They complete my ensemble.

52
00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:50.754
What do you want?

53
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.970
The humor relies on the sexist idea that domestic tasks like cooking and

54
00:03:56.011 --> 00:04:01.011
cleaning our women's work and therefore Howard's masculinity is somehow

55
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:04.110
diminished by being forced to clean the house.

56
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.070
This reductive mix of sexism and emasculation is really at the heart of the

57
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:12.030
show's comedic formulas.

58
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.620
When I failed to open this jar and you succeed,

59
00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:18.360
it will establish you as the Alpha male.

60
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.750
I'm not strong enough,
Leonard.
You'll have to do it.
Go ahead.
It's pre loosened.

61
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.670
Notice that these jokes aren't designed to challenge or subvert the limiting and

62
00:04:34.671 --> 00:04:38.420
often toxic ideas about what it means to be a real man.

63
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.060
No,
no,
no.
Instead,

64
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.980
the punchlines reinforced this notion that guys who aren't physically strong,

65
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.490
tough,
or athletic are unmanly enough cardio for me,

66
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.370
stretch out
and therefore worthy of routines.

67
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.130
<v 0>Hold on.
It</v>

68
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.970
<v 1>doesn't make sense.
In order to move forward in this discussion,</v>

69
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.380
we're going to have to get academic just for a minute and very quickly define a

70
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:11.310
couple terms.

71
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.820
Those are hegemonic masculinity and hypermasculinity head Germantic.

72
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:22.731
Masculinity is a term that's used to describe the socially constructed ideal of

73
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:27.900
manhood.
It's characterized by things like physical strength,

74
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.910
aggression,
domination,
suppression of emotions and heterosexuality.

75
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.380
The ideal varies somewhat based on factors like geography,

76
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.860
but here I'm concerned with white western manhood has shaped by Hollywood for

77
00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:44.490
obvious examples.

78
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.700
Think of Conan the barbarian James Bond or captain America.

79
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.650
All the guys on the Big Bang theory are depicted as embodying the exact opposite

80
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.220
of that hedge mnemonic ideal and that man,

81
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.233
<v 0>okay,</v>

82
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:08.390
<v 1>so much so that simply seeing them dress up as their favorite superhero is in</v>

83
00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:10.320
and of itself a punchline.

84
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.613
I mean,

85
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.360
the important thing to understand about this manhood ideal is that it's a

86
00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:26.800
fiction.
It only really exists in the cultural imagination,

87
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.010
which means that men can never actually achieve it.

88
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.690
However,
it's still a standard against which men are held and compared.

89
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.570
The social expectations and pressures on men to try to achieve some version of

90
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:48.571
it is real has is the social status either lost or gained based on a man's

91
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:52.720
perceived proximity.
Okay.
Did that ideal?

92
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.310
The term hyper masculinity is a little different.

93
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.940
It refers to the set of attitudes and behaviors associated with the pursuit of

94
00:07:03.071 --> 00:07:04.240
that hegemonic idea.

95
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.590
Hypermasculinity includes things like aggressive competition,

96
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.400
sexual conquest and destructive or risk taking behaviors like fighting,

97
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.080
reckless driving or heavy drinking.

98
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.720
Hyper masculinity is also obsessively antifeminist.

99
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.350
Now keep that in mind because it's going to be important a little later.

100
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.360
Hyper masculine behaviors are how men are taught to perform their manhood to

101
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:38.050
prove that they are closer to that fictional ideal.

102
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.290
Then the other men around them before geeks on the Big Bang theory are shown

103
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.870
constantly attempting to perform some version of hypermasculinity.

104
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.910
Nope.
Prepare yourself for what may come.

105
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.490
Oh Shelton,
did you really think we're going to fight?

106
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:03.060
They're spectacular failures in their quest to prove their manhood.

107
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.990
Then provides the ironic hook behind much of the shows comedy.

108
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.540
I see this one time instead of wimping out,

109
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:15.070
let's be bad ass is okay.
I'd be a bad ass,

110
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.750
but only if your biggest swear to be one too.

111
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.253
<v 0>Okay.</v>

112
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.650
<v 1>Now you'd think a bunch of Geeks who are regularly derided for being unmanly</v>

113
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.810
would be supportive of each other's insecurities and although there are fleeting

114
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:32.020
moments of compassion between the four friends,

115
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.630
they spend much of their time marking and humiliating each other for not living

116
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:43.930
up to the manhood deal.
I see you decided to get with pathetic and frightening.

117
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.730
It's one of his best moves.
Having female problems.

118
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.270
If you're cranky and retaining water.
I have a theory.

119
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:53.980
<v 0>Yeah.
Did</v>

120
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.920
<v 1>you talk to her about this?
Oh Geez.</v>

121
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:57.600
Why do you girls always want to talk about things?

122
00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.330
This may seem a little counterintuitive.

123
00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.460
Why would nerds who are bullied for not acting manly enough then turn around and

124
00:09:06.461 --> 00:09:11.170
replicate that same behavior within their own circles?
Well,

125
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:16.260
it's because one of the ways men learn to perform manhood shall pass is by

126
00:09:16.781 --> 00:09:19.270
exerting power over others.

127
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.770
Remember when I said that one of the characteristics of hyper masculinity was an

128
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:28.180
obsession with being anti feminine.
A girl's night off.
I'm up,

129
00:09:28.181 --> 00:09:31.840
I'm up for an evening talking about rainbows,
Unicorns and menstrual cramps.

130
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.240
Time and again,
we see the men on the show,

131
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:39.450
demeaning women and expressing the casual disdain for anything considered girl

132
00:09:40.331 --> 00:09:45.010
stuff.
Sex in the city.
Yikes.
Hey,
I happen to love this movie.

133
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.660
Let me swatch it.
Maybe all our periods will synchronize.

134
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:56.150
Anti Feminine Attitudes are also connected to the ways that men police each

135
00:09:56.221 --> 00:10:01.010
other's presentation of manhood.
Because of your lactose intolerance,

136
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.690
you switched over to soy milk.

137
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.200
Soy contains estrogen mimicking compounds.

138
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.390
I think your morning cocoa puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.

139
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.130
Just so we're clear.

140
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.330
When men insult and belittle other men by calling them women,

141
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.940
that is an extension of misogyny.
Yeah,
you're controlling.
You're irritated.

142
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.940
There you go again,
Nag,
Nag.
You're only proving my point.

143
00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:27.774
Little Lady.

144
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.740
Nowhere is this dynamic as clear as in the show's treatment of Raj Edwards only

145
00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:35.880
pushing you away because he loves you.

146
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.670
Got Everything we need for the big game.
Low Fat Turkey Jerky,

147
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.010
low carb bill hundred calorie snack.

148
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

149
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.940
<v 1>Pick up the y chromosome while you were there.
You might be short one.</v>

150
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.710
I won't be making fun of you or the things you like or the fact that you just

151
00:10:56.711 --> 00:10:57.544
wanna have fun

152
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.920
practically every episode over 10 seasons.

153
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.720
The other characters on the show make fun of Raj for acting too much.

154
00:11:06.721 --> 00:11:11.400
Like a woman,
wasn't a Pajama Party.
He was just a couple of Bros hanging out,

155
00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:13.620
giggling,
eating cookie dough and watching princess bride.

156
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.670
<v 0>Okay,</v>

157
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.980
<v 1>please stop talking.
As you might expect,</v>

158
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:24.310
the jokes targeting Raj for not being manly enough are steeped in a thick layer

159
00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:28.360
of homophobia.
Wow.
And that's not even the best part.
See,

160
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.943
I have one too.

161
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.550
Check it out.

162
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.970
You can make yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.

163
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.680
The humor consistently codes.

164
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.980
Raj has more a feminine behaviors and interests as gay and that's always the

165
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.870
punchline.
May I have a crossover with the little umbrella piece?

166
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.933
We may not.

167
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.830
Why I'm not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with that little

168
00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:57.664
umbrella.

169
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.950
<v 0>Bye.
I love a chocolate Martini.</v>

170
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.033
Again,

171
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.230
<v 1>Raj is the only one of the four guys who after 230 episodes still doesn't have a</v>

172
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:11.950
steady girlfriend.

173
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.610
<v 2>Do you have any idea what it's like to be the only one without a good friend?</v>

174
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.790
Even if I get one someday I sit with the guy who got a gun after Sheldon Cooper.

175
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.030
<v 1>All the others have had their longterm partners join the main cast.</v>

176
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.400
I don't think it's a coincidence that the character most ridiculed for being the

177
00:12:31.401 --> 00:12:33.860
most unmanly in a group of men,

178
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:38.950
specifically coded to be unmanly is also the only man of color on the show and

179
00:12:40.401 --> 00:12:44.540
as such,
Raj fits neatly into Hollywood's long running tradition.

180
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.990
Of mocking and diminishing the sexuality of Asian men

181
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.633
at times.

182
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.370
Raj seems comfortable with is softer nor a feminine version of it.
Manhood,

183
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.530
Bridget Jones' diary like God,
I'm good,

184
00:12:58.531 --> 00:13:03.531
I got 50 but the show and the other male characters are not and they let Raj and

185
00:13:06.141 --> 00:13:10.070
us as the audience know that there's something wrong with him for not being

186
00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:13.940
manly enough every chance they get what's up,

187
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.900
not his testosterone levels.
Excuse me.

188
00:13:17.901 --> 00:13:22.280
I happened to be very comfortable with my masculinity and how is that possible

189
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.960
in her 1995 book,

190
00:13:26.961 --> 00:13:31.961
masculinities are w Connell lays out the theory that there's not just one form

191
00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:37.451
of masculinity but rather many different forms of manhood that all exist within

192
00:13:37.641 --> 00:13:40.970
a hierarchy.
The white heterosexual,

193
00:13:40.971 --> 00:13:45.971
hyper masculine ideal is at the top of that hierarchy and then all other forms

194
00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:49.340
of masculinity are made subordinate to it.

195
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.300
Forms of manhood that are in any way associated with homosexuality or femininity

196
00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:00.290
are pushed further down on the hierarchy when you,
I slapped him,
take it in like

197
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.790
this hierarchical structure then creates a social system wherein men are

198
00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:11.680
encouraged to compete with other men for status and dominance even within their

199
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:14.570
own peer groups and subcultures.
You want some more?

200
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.900
This is why even men who are bullied for not meeting the hyper masculine ideal

201
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.680
often feel the only way they can be seen as real men

202
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.020
is by diminishing someone else.
I am.
She bought destroyed.

203
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.450
I wouldn't have the woman.
I'm warning you.

204
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.450
I was judo champion at bath.

205
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.720
The relationship dynamics between Leonard is Sheldon Howard and Raj provides us

206
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:47.560
with a microcosm of how this hierarchy of masculinities works.

207
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.611
Good.

208
00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:52.610
I'm glad you finally got a girlfriend but you to do all that lovey dovey stuff

209
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:55.850
in front of those of us who don't actually,
he might have to.

210
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.990
There's an economic concept and then as a positional good in which an object is

211
00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:04.310
only valued by the possessor because it's not possessed by others.
It's not true.

212
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.240
My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.

213
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.240
Thank you.
Although I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit of a perk.

214
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.910
Practically every aspect of their friendship from the personal to the

215
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:19.880
professional revolves around competition.

216
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.260
Once you do that,
to send a message,

217
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.080
she is not for you.
Back off Sheldon,

218
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.740
what if she could not stop hitting on my lady?

219
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:37.470
You will feel the full extent of my ras it relax.

220
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:39.650
I am not interested in your girlfriend.

221
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.500
You don't want to mess with me.

222
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.710
I am crazy.

223
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.240
Do it.
In fact,

224
00:15:56.241 --> 00:16:00.710
their entire lives are defined by a never ending game of oneupmanship.

225
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.870
Don't just stand there.
Take your breaths out on the Big Bang theory.

226
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.730
Just like in the real world,

227
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
women are often leveraged as symbols of status within groups of male friends

228
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.660
to show people when they don't believe me,

229
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.990
the show consistently frames manhood as something that's either reaffirmed or

230
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:28.130
diminished by the ability of the guys to score with women

231
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.670
at work.
Leave it alone.
That's my girlfriend.
Sorry.

232
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:36.410
We just had sex with me at work.

233
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.920
How'd you swing that?
Two women at the same time.

234
00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:44.280
Nice job play.

235
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.650
Whenever any one of the four nerds doesn't have a girlfriend,

236
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.820
the others will ridicule him for it.
Knock,
knock,
who's there?

237
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.290
I have a girlfriend and you don't.

238
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.060
I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female.

239
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.070
You have none under the narrow constraints of hyper masculinity.

240
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:11.550
The only thing worse than being unable to acquire a woman is being controlled by

241
00:17:12.051 --> 00:17:12.884
one.

242
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.540
I downloaded an APP that might be helpful in this situation.

243
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:25.510
Now the women on the show occasionally join in with the ridicule for another

244
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.060
beer.
I'm good.
No thank you girls.

245
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.820
But the vast majority of the putdowns of nerdy men don't come from women.

246
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.360
They come from other names.
Please.

247
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.570
I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of

248
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:48.650
mine.
Hey,
why do you decide is better in bed?

249
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.270
Begot Zach.
Oh,
wheezy little lantern.

250
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.550
<v 0>Ah,</v>

251
00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.600
<v 1>there is an unfortunate tendency in our culture to try to pin the blame for</v>

252
00:17:56.601 --> 00:17:58.690
men's emasculation on women,

253
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.080
but most of the time the perpetrators are men.

254
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.600
We're participating in this competition for dominance

255
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.380
and in so doing,

256
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.240
they become complicit in the very structures that harm and exclude them.

257
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.870
You know,

258
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.170
for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied,

259
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.780
you can be real jerks.
Shame on all of you.

260
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.440
All this competitive and anti antifeminist behavior is framed by the show as

261
00:18:28.811 --> 00:18:30.880
harmless,
as good natured,

262
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:34.660
fun as normal and natural and inevitable for men.

263
00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.560
But the reality is that the social pressures that society places on men to

264
00:18:41.561 --> 00:18:46.000
engage in this hyper masculine competition is anything but harmless.

265
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.720
It can be dangerous for men and for those around them,

266
00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.740
both in terms of physical health and emotional wellbeing.

267
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.360
It makes it difficult,

268
00:18:55.390 --> 00:19:00.280
if not impossible for straight men to be vulnerable and caring with others,

269
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.520
which in turn makes it very hard to build close,

270
00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:06.790
supportive friendships with women and with other men.

271
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:12.010
It was quite a gesture on your part,
shown yourself to be the bigger man.

272
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.710
Thank you.
Which I find totally unacceptable.

273
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.100
I must be the bigger man.

274
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:19.970
<v 0>Okay.</v>

275
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.700
<v 1>Unlike Leonard Sheldon,
Howard and Raj,</v>

276
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.750
who are locked into a perpetual competition by their writers,

277
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.810
men in the real world have a choice.

278
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.520
We can choose to reject the battle for dominance and instead embrace empathetic

279
00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:37.750
and supportive forms of manhood.

280
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.550
Thanks so much for watching.

281
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.330
If you like these long form video essay is about the intersections of
