1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.773
Yeah.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.070
<v 1>This episode comes with a very strong content warning for frank discussions of</v>

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.030
and immediate clips involving rape and sexual harassment.

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.930
<v 1>There's a surprisingly disturbing trend running through a lot of mass media</v>

6
00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:23.830
entertainment,
a trend that often flies under the radar.

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.270
Let me explain.

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.560
You're watching a popular TV show or movie laughing along at the high jinks when

9
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.690
suddenly things take a jarring term,

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.333
<v 3>chuck go,</v>

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.720
I'm going to smother you and Julie.

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.490
<v 1>Wait a minute.
That</v>

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.553
<v 3>a rape joke.</v>

14
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.990
I'm going to smother you up and giving up and Julie Go.

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.870
Yup.
Certainly was this one.
Here is our booty.

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.460
Maybe it's just an anomaly.

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.310
<v 4>That's an end with us riding into the sunset.</v>

18
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:07.070
It ends with me dying of cancer and you winning the icebox award for softest

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.880
mouse.

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.030
<v 1>Hold up.
That's another rape joke in another superhero.
Blockbuster.</v>

21
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.010
Let's try something else.
Don't drop the soap.
Big homie.

22
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.760
<v 3>Where will you be watching the working consume me from.
That's right.
A prison.</v>

23
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:22.870
So I'll send you Barstow.

24
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.210
<v 1>How about we try a comedy instead?
Lacks and open.</v>

25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.460
Why wait,
wait

26
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.660
my ass.
Yikes.
Let's switch to a TV show.
As soon as you dropped the soap,

27
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.760
Dave rape your buck.
That's what happens.

28
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.393
I'm saying

29
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.860
<v 4>uh,
Bieber was at briefly jailed early this morning.</v>

30
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:50.610
He went to jail early this morning and the police report described him as five

31
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:55.611
foot nine and 140 pounds or as is suddenly put it just right.

32
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.920
<v 1>Likely notice the pattern here.
In each case,</v>

34
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.580
sexual assault is played for laughs and in each case,

35
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.440
the targets of the joke are men.
He's like a bite size seekers.
Yeah.

36
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.443
<v 2>Hi.</v>

37
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.780
<v 1>Scenarios involving the sexual abuse of men can include a wide range of</v>

38
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:23.390
behavior.
No,
we'll do when you're in scene.

39
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.530
Prom casual punch lines about unwanted kissing or touching

40
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.780
gratuitous one liners about anal rape.

41
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.480
They will charge your butthole and told parking garage.

42
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.870
Start putting O'Connor causing their man Buicks.

43
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.760
Carla Sierra's Oldsmobiles.
Somebody's going to put her in Amia.

44
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.320
Yeah,
no,
don't buy down.

45
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.790
It's hard to overstate just how common jokes about men being sexually assaulted

46
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:57.791
are most popular comedic actors and their writers engage in this type of humor.

47
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.940
<v 3>She'll look at me,
I'll get raped like crazy too.</v>

48
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.103
Yeah,
totally.

49
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.970
I get raped just as much as you would think you're more capable than I hate
nick.

50
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.500
I'm not saying anything like that.
Okay.
You're pretty close to say

51
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.880
<v 1>statistically speaking,</v>

52
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.230
men are far more likely to be the perpetrators of sexual violence then our

53
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.820
people of any other gender.

54
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.970
And so that's what we'll be focusing on in this video.

55
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.710
We'll examine media in which women are portrayed as perpetrators in a future

56
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.820
episode.
He's,
he's the one who famously said,

57
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:41.620
I'd take a bullet for Donald Trump.
Well,
nowadays looking at prison time,

58
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.180
we'll see if he's willing to take a dick.

59
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.420
Sexual assault of man has comedy is so ubiquitous and so normalized that you may

60
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:54.330
not have even noticed.
It shows up everywhere.

61
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.170
And when I say everywhere,
I mean everywhere,

62
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.130
<v 6>even at the Oscars.</v>

63
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.400
And why does all per his nerve to rob for this soap because no one wants to do

64
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.220
it alone.
Speaking of songs

65
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.770
<v 1>is about male rape.
There seem to be an awful lot of them</v>

66
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.590
<v 6>hands against the prison while show Kane on a mouthful.
The ball.</v>

67
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.870
<v 1>Yeah.
His sex slave.
You couldn't go go.
Me and Nathan.</v>

68
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.120
<v 6>Oh,
whoa.</v>

69
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.350
<v 1>The sexual assault of men is a Goto joke for many popular animated sitcoms.</v>

70
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.450
<v 7>Rick and Morty go to giant prison.
You know,
if somebody drops the soap,</v>

71
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.240
it's going to land in our heads and crush our spines.
Morty,
you know,

72
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.480
it'll be really easy to rape us after that.

73
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.823
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.200
<v 7>What do you collect?
Mass Lane.</v>

75
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.520
<v 5>Okay,
let's do it.
Not like this</v>

76
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.310
<v 1>because well,
you slept a violet.
Did you?
Repeatedly.</v>

77
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.140
You might be surprised to find out that slightly less explicit variations on

78
00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:07.190
these jokes also show up in children's media with alarming regularity.

79
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.910
This is never going to work.
Of course,
it will look very pretty.

80
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.200
That's what they'll say in jail.

81
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.210
Love is in the air,
judge.
It just smell it.

82
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.560
<v 5>Did you see what's up there?
Just that guys cherry.</v>

83
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.580
<v 1>You got any idea what they do to exit San Ricardo prison?</v>

84
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.630
It ain't over easy.
Notice how these jokes are all designed to demean,

85
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.840
humiliate or emasculate a male character for being the victim or potential

86
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:40.240
victim of sexual violence.

87
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.690
The me too movement has brought to light the rampant sexual abuse perpetrated by

88
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:48.790
powerful men in Hollywood.
Well,

89
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:51.850
many of those telling their stories have been famous women.

90
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.690
There were also a handful of male celebrities coming forward as survivors,

91
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.910
including actors,
Rapp and Terry Cruz.

92
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.440
Cruz has been especially vocal even testifying about his experience in front of

93
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.410
Congress in support of the survivor's bill of rights,

94
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.600
where he stressed that sexual assault isn't really about sex,
it's about power.

95
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.010
<v 3>I was sexually assaulted by a successful Hollywood Asian.</v>

96
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.460
The assault lasted only minutes,

97
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.360
but what he was effectively telling me while he held my genitals and his hand

98
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.720
was that he held the power that he was in control.

99
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.720
<v 1>Since coming forward,</v>

100
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.250
Terry Cruz has faced a good deal of backlash from other straight men and it's no

101
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:41.860
coincidence that much of the ridicule directed at him.

102
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.970
Bayer's an uncanny resemblance to the punchlines we're discussing in this video.

103
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.940
<v 3>This is how toxic masculinity permeates culture.</v>

104
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.430
As I shared my story,

105
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.050
I was told over and over that this was not abuse,

106
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.480
that this was just a joke.

107
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.070
<v 1>As with all comedy,</v>

108
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.270
it's important to ask who or what is being targeted by the joke.

109
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.710
So let's take a few examples from popular mainstream comedies and talk about

110
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:14.930
what we're meant to be laughing at and why.

111
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.910
Because it's the why that helps eliminate how underlying messages can have a

112
00:07:19.911 --> 00:07:23.270
negative impact on the way we think about assault and masculinity.

113
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.320
Fetologist standing by best one you can find

114
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.790
in the 2015 comedy,

115
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:36.200
get hard will Farrell plays a wealthy hedge fund manager who finds out he's

116
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:37.820
going to prison for embezzlement.

117
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.590
The core premise of the movie is that Farrow's character is terrified of being

118
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:43.490
raped in prison.

119
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.540
There's a hundred percent chance that you're going to be somebody's bitch.

120
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.490
Kevin Hart's character exploits that panic to get hired as a toughness coach to

121
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:56.840
help prepare him for life on the inside.
This setup,

122
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.200
as you might imagine,
leads to a steady stream of rape jokes.

123
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.820
You know what that is?
That's a big ass black men.
When you're Pale White,

124
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.270
I don't want any more.
That's enough.
Too late.
He didn't tag the next guy in.

125
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.870
At the heart of these jokes is the perceived emasculation of men who are scared

126
00:08:17.871 --> 00:08:22.460
of or become emotional over the possibility of sexual assault.
Hey,

127
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:24.710
listen up everyone.
I'm extremely sad

128
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.730
thought we have already to set.
Hey fellows,
my heart's already been right.

129
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.400
Get hard is just one of many,

130
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:38.780
many examples where male characters on the receiving end of sexual assault jokes

131
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.330
are framed as weak,
cowardly,

132
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.760
a feminine or unmanly obviously.

133
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.170
<v 3>Yup.
Kenny.
Kenny,
stop crying.
Stop crying.
Can he look at me?</v>

134
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.600
Yes.
Show me a mean face.
Kenny

135
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.170
<v 1>men's vulnerability is an endless source of mockery in mainstream comedy and</v>

136
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:02.220
vulnerability that results from sexual violence is no exception.

137
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.560
I don't want to go to jail.
I know.
You know what happens?

138
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.380
A handsome guy like me in jail and Ron's a drape.
We were also great.

139
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.500
Just keep your mouth shut and try not to cry

140
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.583
to cry.

141
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.050
Crying ticks to set up the idea behind the joke.
Here.

142
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.210
He is as obvious as it is toxic that men who aren't tough or manly enough to

143
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:32.691
avoid being victimized are pathetic and therefore deserving of ridicule or

144
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:37.200
worse.
Hey guys,
did you think he's anyone's girlfriend yet?

145
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.080
He's been in jail for three hours.

146
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.570
Of course he's had one we'd go out for then punch lines about men being sexually

147
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:50.310
assaulted usually revolve around the idea of a man being made subordinate to

148
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:55.311
another man and therefore forced into a role that is stereotypically feminine.

149
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.700
I am
never going on a Beta.

150
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:04.701
Same emasculation jokes are supposed to be funny because in a patriarchal

151
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:06.630
culture like ours,

152
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.310
we're meant to think that there is no greater humiliation for a man then to be

153
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:12.240
treated like a woman.

154
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.460
We'll talk extensively about the 2005 hit comedy wedding crashers in part two of

155
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:20.610
this video series,

156
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.840
but the movie deserves a mention here as well because of how it frames one of

157
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:28.470
several sexual assaults committed against Vince Fonz characters.

158
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.020
The basic setup is that Vaughn,

159
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.570
as our lovable chauvinist suddenly has the tables turned on

160
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.480
comfortable.
I'm not going to want that.
What's the reason?

161
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.670
It's your typical gross out comedies scenario design could make audiences laugh,

162
00:10:48.671 --> 00:10:53.190
squeamish Lee at seeing straight male characters thrust into awkward sexual

163
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:54.630
situations with other men.

164
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.420
There's an underlying homophobia running through scenes like this,

165
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.480
which is connected to some extreme levels of anxiety around straight male

166
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:10.314
sexuality.

167
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.760
Oh pop out at the right moment.

168
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:21.060
The insinuation is that if a man is sexually harassed by another man,

169
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.920
Jesus Christ,
it means he's perceived.
Yeah.
As gay

170
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.160
and being perceived as gay is supposed to be deeply humiliating for straight men

171
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:40.250
and open your mouth guards to go about getting your Dick sucked up.

172
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.160
You're the ones who escaped for sucking Majid.
I will report to you.

173
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.340
You will go to jail or you won't have to pretend to be gay because your assets

174
00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:49.680
will be busier than a test bench and a plunger factory.

175
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.930
Despite what media may tell us.

176
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.680
It's critical to remember that being sexually assaulted has absolutely nothing

177
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:58.660
to do with someone's sexuality

178
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.940
just as it has nothing to do with their masculinity.

179
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.570
If the perpetrator is coded as a gay man or a character of ambiguous sexual

180
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:14.404
identity,

181
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.560
then sexual assault is usually framed as a product of some uncontrollable sexual

182
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:20.704
desire,

183
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.100
which then works to demonize gay men buying directly,

184
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:30.490
linking them to predatory behavior.
I have a question.

185
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.540
Are you single?
Uh,
I'm not gay.
I don't care.

186
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.360
You're a hunky and I'm what they call predatory gay.

187
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.020
It's made worse if as is often the case,

188
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.100
the rapist is the only gay coded character in the whole production.

189
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.810
All of this contributes to the long running pattern in Hollywood where gay

190
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:56.920
sexuality is framed as a clear and present danger to straight people,

191
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:02.500
which it isn't.
Queer sexuality is not a threat to straight people.

192
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:07.870
Rapists are a threat to straight people just as they are a threat to people of

193
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:10.060
all genders and all sexualities.

194
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.980
In 2016 the Metta Ironic Superhero movie,
Deadpool,

195
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:23.190
starring Ryan Reynolds became the highest grossing r rated film in history and

196
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:27.490
one of its opening scenes provides us with a good example of another common

197
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:31.240
media pattern,
the scared straight style rape joke

198
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.240
and our general direction again,

199
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:40.300
and you will learn in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots too

200
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:43.763
<v 5>that came out wrong.</v>

201
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:53.140
<v 1>The punchline here revolves around a male superhero weaponizing the performance</v>

202
00:13:53.481 --> 00:13:57.920
of an ambiguous queer sexuality as a form of intimidation.

203
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.110
The joke comes from the same place as the overprotective father.
Freak out.

204
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.820
Whatever you do to my daughter,

205
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.503
<v 5>I do to you.</v>

206
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.063
<v 1>You want,
it</v>

207
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.860
seems like this end up accidentally illustrating an important point because it's

208
00:14:18.861 --> 00:14:22.880
not just the act of sexual assault itself that functions as an instrument of

209
00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:25.580
domination and control in our culture.
Get in.

210
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.820
It's also the threat of sexual assault.

211
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.340
<v 8>You know what turned out means nothing?
No Sir.</v>

212
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.400
It's when a straight dude rolls into prison and gets his ass fucked.

213
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.180
Then becomes a girl.
Big Boys would come in and push a little more like you down.

214
00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:41.030
Maybe stick a textbook in your mouth and go to fucking town.

215
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.510
What that happened to you?
I don't think so.

216
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:50.070
<v 1>Sexual assault is in many ways simply another form of violence and leveraging</v>

217
00:14:50.771 --> 00:14:55.771
the threat of that violence as a deterrent to keep young men and boys in line is

218
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:57.320
a frequent theme in media.

219
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.880
<v 9>Well,
you better keep though.
Damn mouth shut.
Oh No.</v>

220
00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.910
You're going to be going back to the showers and the only speed you're going to

221
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:06.920
reach is 88 dudes.
Bow.

222
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.960
<v 1>Probably noticed by now that a lot of this comedy has something in common he did</v>

223
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:17.770
involves prison rape.

224
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:20.743
<v 5>Wow.</v>

225
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:28.320
<v 1>Prison rape jokes are so pervasive in mass media entertainment at the phrase,</v>

226
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.400
don't drop the soap has become a routine sight gag.

227
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.270
Despite the insinuation of anal rape,
don't drop the soap.

228
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.990
Punchlines have also found their way into children's cartoons.

229
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:49.170
Where do advice don't drop the soap got balloons now,

230
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:49.540
God,

231
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.540
I'm one of the reasons these rape jokes pass under the radar is because for

232
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:57.910
straight adult men of able body and mind,

233
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.230
the possibility of being sexually assaulted isn't a real concern in their

234
00:16:02.231 --> 00:16:06.460
everyday lives.
The one exception to that,
and it's a big one.

235
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.280
Our street adult men who are incarcerated,

236
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:15.670
prison rape is a rampant,
horrifying problem that destroys lives.

237
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:16.830
<v 10>Okay?</v>

238
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.431
<v 1>Each year,</v>

239
00:16:17.431 --> 00:16:22.431
over 200,000 people are raped or sexually assaulted while in prison in the

240
00:16:23.491 --> 00:16:24.450
United States.

241
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.150
It is important to remember that just like on the outside,

242
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.860
sexual assault in prison should not be confused with consensual sex between

243
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:38.710
prisoners.
Do you know what they do to soft,

244
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.430
bald,
overweight Republican's in prison?
Earnest.

245
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.990
While the vast majority of the comedy we've been looking at invokes the rape of

246
00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:49.820
straight men.
In reality,

247
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:54.050
it's queer and transgender prisoners who are most likely to be the targets of

248
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:55.370
sexual assault in prison.

249
00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:02.120
Many prison rape jokes also carry with them some explicit racist overtones.

250
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.310
It's no accident that punchlines regularly involved white men being threatened

251
00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:12.020
with rape by a big scary black man.
So I've got new volunteer,

252
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:12.854
Huh?

253
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:15.770
<v 9>Well,
let me tell you cupcakes.
What's your first day?</v>

254
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.730
<v 1>It don't expect no flowers afterwards.</v>

255
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.500
Scenes like this one are built around the racist idea that black men are more

256
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:30.680
brutal,
aggressive or predatory than other men,

257
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.470
and that therefore it's black men specifically who pose a special threat to

258
00:17:36.471 --> 00:17:37.850
white men's masculinity.

259
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:42.600
So it was a beautiful white boy like you doing in place like this.

260
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:45.081
Terry crews,

261
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:50.081
his story about being sexually assaulted is so powerful because it that scary,

262
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:54.570
intimidating black man narrative.
Before his personal evolution,

263
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:59.630
some of those scary characters were even played by cruise himself to see him now

264
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:04.350
choosing to speak up and be publicly vulnerable challenges those racist media

265
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:06.090
myths about black masculinity.

266
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.070
<v 11>When my assault happened,
quite honestly,
uh,</v>

267
00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.560
I probably would have been laughed out of the police station.

268
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.250
<v 1>It's not unusual for police officers or other authority figures to be shown</v>

269
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.200
engaging in forms of dark comedy that involve the sexual violation of men

270
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.710
procedural style dramas in particular,

271
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.080
frequently to pick law enforcement officials,

272
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.830
threatening male suspects with rape as a way to get them to talk.

273
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.760
Do you have any idea what it's like in sing sing for a guy with your
limitations?

274
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.480
You're going to be the poster boy for bitch of the month.

275
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.670
When are you not getting the dice?

276
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.810
<v 3>Nope.
It's how it goes.
She's selling rolls the dice.
Nah,</v>

277
00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.950
it's made days.
You get to play his girlfriend.
Prison guard isn't an inmate.

278
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.070
I hear.
They make you prom queen and every night is prom night.

279
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.980
You talk now and we'll make sure you're not putting him with the general

280
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.450
population.
When I get it

281
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.350
<v 1>to see the look of love and a meat wranglers,</v>

282
00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:14.960
I had a damn make some spoiled rich kid is no celly.

283
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.810
<v 3>Look on the bright side.
In prison,
you want to have to pay for dates.</v>

284
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.910
<v 1>Writers seem to love these extra judicial taunts and use them as a source of</v>

285
00:19:24.911 --> 00:19:25.744
Shodan.
Freud out

286
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.870
<v 3>shot him.
Freud,
it's German.</v>

287
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.720
But when you feel good because your enemies anus has been violated,

288
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.880
<v 1>the quips are designed to elicit a satisfied snicker from viewers at seeing the</v>

289
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:39.470
bad guys

290
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.300
<v 3>square.
It's up.</v>

291
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:46.760
Could be started at felony or you could be shared.
So this filler rod here,

292
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.090
you'd like that.
Would you see there?
You're already making friends.

293
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.720
<v 1>For some reason,</v>

294
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.830
Denzel Washington has a lot of dialogue to this effect in his filmography.

295
00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.250
<v 11>This time next week I'll be sucking down Pina coladas and a hot tub with six</v>

296
00:20:00.251 --> 00:20:02.520
girls named amber and Tiffany,
more likely

297
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.260
<v 12>taking a shower with two guys named Jamal and Hey Susan,
if you know what I mean?</v>

298
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:11.090
And here's the bad news.
The thing is sucking on,
it's not a Pina Colada.

299
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.780
You better have some divine intervention,
buddy.

300
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.050
You better have some k y you're going to need

301
00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:27.150
<v 3>you a term of no less than four years in a federal prison.</v>

302
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.930
<v 1>So why does this matter?
Well,</v>

303
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:35.110
the harsh reality is that rape is one of the unofficial but widely sanctioned

304
00:20:35.571 --> 00:20:40.310
ways that criminal justice institutions punish undesirable prisoners,

305
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.500
especially Queer men,
trans folks,
and people with mental disabilities.

306
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.790
You know,
do you know what this means?
Don't you

307
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:53.890
make no mistake?

308
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.160
The powers that be allow prison rape to happen sometimes too passive

309
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:03.400
facilitation and other times through direct participation.

310
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:09.970
It's part of how the prison system maintains control over men's bodies and

311
00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:12.430
sexualities while they're incarcerated.

312
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.430
There's just one of the thing I've got to check.

313
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.350
The type of police brutality as comedy that we've been talking about here isn't

314
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:24.700
designed to critique or aluminate the widespread of uses of law enforcement.

315
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.060
Even when police officers are shown as humorously and competent,

316
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.740
the jokes are still made at the expense of those being victimized

317
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.450
by and large audiences except these sadistic punchlines because of who the rape

318
00:21:43.451 --> 00:21:45.990
threats are directed at.
You know what happens?

319
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.290
Pretty boys like you go up to the farm,
low stage charges.

320
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.223
We look at that.

321
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.680
I've got some 11 as long as it's criminal suspects being victimized and likable,

322
00:21:58.811 --> 00:22:00.970
authority figures doing the victimizing,

323
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:05.020
then it's widely seen as criminals getting what they deserve.

324
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.330
<v 3>You want to know about anarchy.</v>

325
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.780
You don't tell me what another bone is going to make sure he's been your prison

326
00:22:12.781 --> 00:22:16.440
time when you're big and it has a nice big smile on some context here,

327
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.670
<v 1>what he say and tell the whole story.
I'll try new ways to be an entrance.</v>

328
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.290
I don't know.
Brothers inside of till your guts up,
fucking you stupid.

329
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.890
When it's a cop drama.
The lead characters are generally presented,

330
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.100
has tough guys for occasionally tough gals who are being tough on crime.

331
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:42.060
<v 5>He comes for you middle of the night when you're least expecting it,</v>

332
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:43.960
you do me a favor.

333
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:51.630
<v 1>This is often referred to as reciprocal punishment or Karmic justice.</v>

334
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.500
<v 3>Nice petite white boy like you,
the federal penitentiary.
I,</v>

335
00:22:56.501 --> 00:22:57.460
let me just put it this way.

336
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:00.910
I don't think you'll be able to remain anal retentive for very long.

337
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.380
<v 1>It's a morally a parent,
but widely accepted idea.</v>

338
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:09.060
Best encapsulated by the idiom.
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for tooth.

339
00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.810
Don't you feel kind of bad for them?
Sure.
I feel lousy for her.

340
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.620
He's a murderer and he should pay for it with this life.
No.

341
00:23:16.621 --> 00:23:18.510
He should be doing 60 years in a prison,

342
00:23:18.511 --> 00:23:22.560
breaking rocks and making special friends with Roscoe,
the weightlifter.
Yikes.

343
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.360
The quality of mercy is not Buffy.

344
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.140
Sometimes these karmic rape plot lines involved villains being sexually
assaulted

345
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.073
<v 3>with a weapon</v>

346
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.600
<v 1>or alternatively raped by a large male animal.</v>

347
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.780
The word for this is injustice.
The word for it,
his revenge.

348
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.500
You know where you're going.
This crew,
people in a very uncomfortable place.

349
00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:56.150
Now,
it should go without saying that rape can never ever be a form of justice.

350
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.420
When media frames the sexual assault of men,

351
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.810
even bad men as getting what they deserve,

352
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.780
it perpetuates a culture of rape.
Acceptance.

353
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.620
Pinos not some penis

354
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.570
means you could go to jail.
Where are you could get some pain.

355
00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:20.783
<v 2>Yes.</v>

356
00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.230
<v 1>It also makes prison rape seem inevitable,
which it's not.</v>

357
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.680
There are solutions to the prison rape epidemic,

358
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.230
namely keep people out of prison,

359
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.970
which means working towards mass d incarceration through a combination of

360
00:24:36.971 --> 00:24:41.971
decriminalization and a focus on education and rehabilitation programs instead

361
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:46.900
of locking people up.
But with every casual prison rape joke,

362
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.900
it makes those goals more difficult to achieve.

363
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.060
<v 2>I'm trying to talk about sexual assault.</v>

364
00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.300
It's not like that's a new topic in comedy without a rape drugs forever,

365
00:24:57.301 --> 00:24:59.190
but it's just like those jokes have usually been like,

366
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.750
that's the full joke in an audience,

367
00:25:07.751 --> 00:25:09.730
because that's a taboo word will have a response.

368
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.570
None that comic.
We'll hear that response.
Ooh,
I have done a good joke

369
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.310
<v 1>as comedians like Cameron Esposito and Lindy West have pointed out,</v>

370
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.080
it is possible to tell jokes about rape from a survivor's perspective where the

371
00:25:24.081 --> 00:25:25.730
punchlines target rave culture.

372
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.650
But that's not what's happening in the movies and TV shows we've been looking at

373
00:25:30.651 --> 00:25:34.880
here.
Oh,
oh no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm,
I'm actually getting married

374
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.460
as we've seen again and again.

375
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:45.020
The targets of these jokes are the victims of sexual assault and harassment.

376
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.630
You're ready cause they're here.
What cubs.

377
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.523
<v 2>Oh.</v>

378
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.760
<v 1>Which is why when actors,</v>

379
00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:58.750
writers or directors try to defend this type of comedy from criticism,

380
00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.000
there are arguments.
Don't hold any water.

381
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:02.880
<v 13>Anytime you're doing any comedy,</v>

382
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:07.570
somebody is going to do somebody who's going to go,
go do,
do the face.
Oh my word.

383
00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:14.470
But that's kind of what we do.
We provoke,
we prod,
we,
we,

384
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.920
we also show a mirror up to what's already existing out there.
You know,

385
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:23.330
<v 1>the idea that these comedians are somehow bravely pushing boundaries or</v>

386
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.680
fearlessly transgressing taboos by telling prison rape jokes.

387
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:32.630
He is pure self delusion.
So now he comes,
God wants to rub your face.
Ha,

388
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.260
I liked his hair.
He's breathing on you.
That's disgusting.
But guess what?

389
00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.030
You can look forward to 10 years of it.

390
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:42.530
When Will Ferrell or Kevin Hart or Adam Sandler or any other famous comedian

391
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.840
amplifies dismissive and toxic ideas about rape in their comedy routines.

392
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.890
It's not meant to raise awareness and it's certainly not designed to hold up a

393
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:55.680
mirror and give voice to rape survivors.

394
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.880
Let me guess.
You drop the soap,
please take that out of my ass.

395
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:07.410
They're acting out these rape jokes because it's an easy way to get cheap
laughs,

396
00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:08.503
Charlie.

397
00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:16.270
And the price of those laughs is the further trivialization of rape in a culture

398
00:27:16.461 --> 00:27:18.820
that already doesn't take survivors serious things.

399
00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.340
<v 14>Okay,
so you were violated by two people while you are under the gas.</v>

400
00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:24.174
So what?

401
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.320
<v 2>Yes,</v>

402
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.070
<v 14>single.</v>

403
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.251
<v 1>Well,</v>

404
00:27:28.251 --> 00:27:32.660
at the same time as we've talked about reinforcing a whole bunch of aggressive

405
00:27:32.661 --> 00:27:36.800
ways of thinking around race,
masculinity,
sexuality,

406
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:40.340
and criminal justice.
Beyond that,

407
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:44.570
these jokes also give people permission to continue silencing and shaming

408
00:27:44.571 --> 00:27:46.880
survivors.
Brian,
if you don't mind,

409
00:27:46.881 --> 00:27:49.160
we'll start thinking up by prison rape jokes immediately.

410
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:56.280
If Hollywood writers and Comedians really want to break taboos and push

411
00:27:56.281 --> 00:27:57.114
boundaries,

412
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.890
they could try treating survivors of sexual assault with a measure of dignity

413
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:07.100
and empathy because that would be a guaranteed way to shock their audience.

414
00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.920
Thanks for watching.
Now I know this can be a difficult and intense topic,

415
00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.240
so I've left a bunch of resources and additional information in the text below

416
00:28:19.241 --> 00:28:20.074
this video.

417
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.680
I want to thank all of my scripted visors for their invaluable feedback in

418
00:28:23.681 --> 00:28:26.650
writing this episode,
especially Reverend Jason Liden,

419
00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.170
who founded an organization called black and pink,

420
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.480
which is dedicated to supporting queer prisoners.

421
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.090
You can find that link in the description below as well.

422
00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.010
In part two of this discussion,

423
00:28:36.011 --> 00:28:40.390
we'll shift focus and talk about media where women assaulting men is played for

424
00:28:40.391 --> 00:28:43.330
laughs.
If you'd like to support my video series,

425
00:28:43.331 --> 00:28:46.960
you can do that over on Patrion and I've left a link to paypal in the

426
00:28:46.961 --> 00:28:49.060
description below.
See you next time.
