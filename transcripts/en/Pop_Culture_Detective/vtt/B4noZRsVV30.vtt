1
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.860
Remix video is about re mixing the stories that make up our world,
right?

2
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.730
Where were we?
We,
well,
we,
we live off of stories.

3
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:18.390
We understand the world based on stories,
based on narratives.

4
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.120
We understand our place in it and the commute,

5
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.580
the connections between things based on stories.
You know,

6
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:25.830
people more and more are taking those stories and saying,

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.050
this is a story that was given to me,
you know,

8
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:33.051
on the TV or in the movies or on the radio and it's not quite what I want,

9
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.520
what I want.
It doesn't,
it doesn't work for me.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420
So I'm going to change that story a little bit.
Uh,

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.520
I'm going to add something too.
I'm going to take something away from it.
Um,

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.420
and I'll create a new narrative based on what I'm missing in the well.

13
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:50.070
And I actually think that that,
uh,
that kind of thing,
um,
has mass appeal.
I mean,

14
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:55.071
people who know the original source then are really interested in this

15
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.040
alternative version of,
of,
of that source.
For me,

16
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.120
remix video,
um,
is much more accessible,
um,

17
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.450
and much more populist and much more participatory.

18
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.860
Then video art has been traditionally.
And,
and in that way,

19
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:14.850
I think it's much more important,
much more relevant and says much,
much,

20
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:18.120
much more because really what is art?
But it could be communication tool,

21
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.020
you know,
if,
if you're,

22
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.310
if you've got video artists who were intending their work to be seen by other

23
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:27.030
artists,
um,
by gallery,
the,
uh,

24
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.060
owners or by people who are interested in high art or academic art or art theory

25
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.830
and methods,
a very small sort of elite group of people,
um,

26
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.090
who might sit through a long kind of boring,

27
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.720
strange experimental video piece.
Whereas the political remixers,

28
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.520
uh,
or the,
the remix video artists for the most part on,
you know,
on,

29
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:50.740
on most of their work is what is on the Internet right now.
Um,

30
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.080
but even before the Internet,

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.490
this work was meant for a general audience for and for,
for me,

32
00:01:56.491 --> 00:02:00.730
the question of,
you know,
is the world functioning on,
in,
uh,
in,

33
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.980
in a remix way,
um,
is a given?
Yes,
of course.
You know,
I,

34
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.830
I think it has been for a long time.
I mean,
you can look at Star Wars and say,

35
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.570
you know,
Star Wars is almost taking shot for shot from a Japanese films,

36
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.310
you know,
of a decade or two decades earlier.
Um,
you know,
and,
and uh,

37
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.880
so for me that's just a given.
That's just,
yes,
of course.
Um,

38
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.430
and what the question for me that I think is most interesting,

39
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.930
the question for me is,
um,
remix is a,
is a tool.

40
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.260
It's a medium.
And the question is,
what do you do with that medium?

41
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.000
What are you trying to say?
Are you challenging traditional power structures?

42
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.960
Are you challenging a stereotypical notions about gender or sexuality or class

43
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:44.320
or race?
You know,
are you challenging,
um,
government or corporate institutions,
uh,

44
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.160
through your remix work in some way?
It could be funny,
it could be interesting,

45
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:49.080
it could be entertaining,
but you know,

46
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.000
what does that sort of subversive messages,
you know,

47
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.310
what are the ethics of Remix?
Um,

48
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.010
because you're appropriating someone else's media,
right?

49
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.160
You're appropriating some other story that made,

50
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:01.750
was made by someone else or a group of people or a corporation or whatever.
Um,

51
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.030
and,
and the way that I think about it,
uh,
when I think about this question,
uh,

52
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.480
I think about what is it that I'm remixing,
right?
Where did it come from?

53
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.860
Um,
is it something that,
um,
came from a corporation or a government,

54
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.850
a powerful institution or not?
You know,
is it,
is it is,

55
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.330
where am I on the,
in the system of power,
right?

56
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.960
And then where is the thing I'm remixing?
Is it above me?
Is it below me?
I,

57
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.380
I think that you have to be very aware of the power relations of what you're

58
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.490
remixing.
You know?
So I encourage people to take corporate media.

59
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:38.120
I encourage people to take movies and TV shows,
um,
politicians especially and,

60
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.730
and,
and do what they want with it because those people are,
are,
are,

61
00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:45.280
are figures of power.
They are,
um,
and,
and they,
often,

62
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:49.770
their messages are messages of power.
Um,
but if you're looking down on,
on,
on,

63
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.040
on the social sphere and you find someone who's relatively powerless and then

64
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:57.820
you remix and make fun of them,
that for me crosses the line.
Now that's my line.

65
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.890
The fact that Google has become that,
that Google and youtube have become so,
uh,

66
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.850
corporate,
um,
and,
and have built in this system,
this,

67
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:09.470
this is this automated copyright system,
um,

68
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.090
makes it difficult.
Often.
I mean,

69
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.120
I would say that maybe 10 or 15% of all the remixes that I've posted on my blog

70
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.200
from other people how are gone.

71
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.030
Many of the playlists that I have created a of my favorite remix videos they

72
00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.760
have have,
it has holes in it,
right?
This is why I say that,

73
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.390
that because of the way that youtube has set up,
um,

74
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.050
it creates holes in the Internet,
right?

75
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:34.750
You go to a blog post and you want to see the video and it talks about the video

76
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.410
and you click play and it says,
I'm sorry,
blocked for content,
copyright reasons.

77
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.710
You know,
even when it's,
it's clearly a transformed work.

78
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.530
Even when it's clearly fair use,
it's,

79
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:46.540
it's gone because the robot on the other side doesn't know the difference.

80
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.300
You know,
there's no people looking at this and saying,
yes,
this is fair use.
Yes,

81
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.790
you should be able to transform the system matters.

82
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.360
The system that we share with manners and youtube is great because it reaches an

83
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.160
enormous amount of people,
you know,

84
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.270
way more people than you could ever hope to reach just by putting it on your own

85
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:04.330
website.
Um,
and it also has a community involved,
right?

86
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:07.030
So you meet other people who are doing things that are similar to you and you

87
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.550
support each other and you subscribe and you comment,
right?

88
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.260
All that stuff is great and important.
And it it,
for me,
I,

89
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.550
what I wish was that youtube was a public space.
You know,

90
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.540
that doesn't really exist on the Internet public space,

91
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.050
but I wish youtube was because it's that valuable,
right?

92
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.240
If it's going to be a public square,

93
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.610
we're going to talk about youtube and the Internet is a public square,

94
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.810
but it's not public.
It's private.
This is a critical moment where we have to say,

95
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:35.980
look,
this is not,
not only important and legal,

96
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.120
but also a critical part of communication is for the human right of

97
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:43.090
communication is to be able to use the audio visual language.

98
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:47.080
The audio visual culture to communicate with each other.
Uh,
and so in that way,

99
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:48.160
I think it's,
it's,
it's even much,

100
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:52.270
much deeper than what is traditionally thought of as art.
You know,
it's,
it's,

101
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.830
it's,
it's human communication.
