Hi everyone.
My name is Jonathan McIntosh.

2
00:00:02.291 --> 00:00:05.770
I'm the curator of the Buffy versus Edward remix video.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.520
I thought I put together a collection of the deleted scenes that didn't quite

4
00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:11.770
make the final cut.
So here we go.

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.130
So this first scene was really just a test at the beginning of the project to

6
00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:18.460
see if I could get Buffy and Edward interacting in a convincing way.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.810
It serves no narrative purpose and so therefore wasn't in the final version.
But,

8
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.940
um,
I did use this sort of clip at the very end where Edward walks away.
Um,

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.840
as part of the narrative and the final piece,

10
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.480
<v 1>I just need to spend all my time to walk a little while to get back into the</v>

11
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:33.314
school.

12
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.500
Everybody's in a hurry.

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.770
<v 0>Ultimately,
I couldn't fit all of these Scooby's all Buffy,</v>

14
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:46.870
he's friends and mentors into the final piece.

15
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.770
It just was too hard to introduce them all,

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.880
make them make sense to people who hadn't seen Buffy and then drive the

17
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:57.710
narrative forward.
So they,
uh,
I ended up cutting out Giles and is mom.
But,
um,

18
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.880
I really loved this little clip.
Where's Andrew says,
you know,
I've read the book,

19
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.470
I've seen the movie and I still don't get it.

20
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.200
I'm obviously in this case referring to the twilight books.

21
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.000
<v 2>I think it's very clear what's happening here.</v>

22
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.110
Fill me in then because I've read the book seeing the movie and I'm still fuzzy

23
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.380
about what's going on.
Deadly and seductive demon.

24
00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:18.570
He draws people to him with promises of love,

25
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.870
power and knowledge present impressionable mind.

26
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.730
<v 1>There's something about this from that scares me.
I</v>

27
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.133
don't have to be,

28
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.230
<v 0>this is a really quick clip of Edward continuing his stocking of Buffy.</v>

29
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.680
But in the end it didn't quite fit with the,
uh,
with the story.

30
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.590
This next clip is probably the longest of all the deleted scenes.

31
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.030
It's meant a show.
Edward escalating is stocking,
uh,

32
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.840
and buffets reaction to that.
But it does include Giles and Bobby's mom.

33
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.210
And since I cut them out of the narrative,

34
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.160
it didn't make any sense to include this scene.

35
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.010
And it also kind of interrupts the flow of,
of the final piece,

36
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.590
which is sort of very fast paced and,
and all about Buffy and Edward.

37
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.823
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.630
I was just checking the back porch.
Somebody young.

39
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.070
How obscene is that?
Something about me had to make him feel that,

40
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:44.360
right.
Something that made him say,
woof,
that's the one for me.

41
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.910
Does anyone else want to smack that guy?

42
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.830
<v 0>This last little bit is an alternative last line,
the very end of the Remix,
uh,</v>

43
00:03:00.831 --> 00:03:04.610
where I had Buffy kind of making a pun and being a little bit snarky when I had

44
00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:05.450
to put together,
you know,

45
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.890
it seemed like she was one sort of making fun of Edward for not being tough

46
00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:12.950
enough,
which is not the point of the remix at all.
Um,

47
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.560
and to kind of plays down how dangerous he is.
And I,
you know,

48
00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:17.140
I think it actually,
he is his,

49
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.330
his character and what it represents is it's actually a very dangerous and very

50
00:03:20.331 --> 00:03:23.090
serious.
And so sort of ending on sort of a pithy little,
well,

51
00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:26.710
he doesn't mean anything anyway,
line,
um,
didn't quite fit for,
I wanted to do

52
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.370
<v 1>[inaudible] that's how I got</v>

53
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.660
the forces of darkness are even trying.

54
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.470
<v 0>So check it out.</v>
