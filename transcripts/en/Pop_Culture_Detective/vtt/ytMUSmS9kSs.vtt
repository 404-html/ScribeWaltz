00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.700
I often discuss the negative impacts that pop culture media can have on people's

2
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:09.750
attitudes and opinions,

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.270
but if entertainment can propagate harmful ideas,

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.650
then it stands to reason that it can also have positive effects on our lives.

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.340
So in this video,
I want to focus on media that fosters empathy and solidarity.

6
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.840
Now admittedly,
that's a pretty broad category.
So to narrow it down,

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.980
I'll be highlighting a handful of my favorite movies from my most formative

8
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.110
years,
the 1980s

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.340
looking at Hollywood today,

10
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.430
it's pretty clear that the 1980s are back in a big way.

11
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.110
The current nostalgia craze is largely driven by Hollywood's obsession with

12
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:53.570
remakes,
reboots,
sequels,

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.720
and loving homages to popular 80th franchises.

14
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.240
The apex of this wave of nostalgia comes in the form of the novel turned

15
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:04.430
blockbuster ready player one,

16
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.180
I was born in 2025 but I wish I had grown up in the 1980s Ernest Cline's book.

17
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:12.050
And by extension,

18
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:17.051
the film is built around a long list of superficial and rather ostentatious

19
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.240
references to Kiki pop culture entertainment.

20
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.820
As a boy who grew up in the 1980s most of the media that's named dropped and

21
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:30.770
ready player one I remember well the Goonies Gremlins,

22
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.630
weird science tron back to the future.
I watched them all,

23
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.390
but thinking back to my childhood,

24
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.250
the cinematic moments that had the most profound impact on me and my emotional

25
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:47.990
development weren't necessarily from the most popular,
were iconic movies,

26
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.130
the movies scenes that left the biggest impression on my young mind.

27
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.420
We're unapologetically sappy and sentimental.
Goodbye Charlie.

28
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.050
They're the moments that still put a lump in my throat,

29
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.830
the ones that make my eyes water and my heart swell

30
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.070
like big
dog

31
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.070
movie critic Roger Ebert Once said that movie is our empathy generating machines

32
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.820
by which he meant that we as viewers identify with the characters on the screen

33
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.440
and that helps us understand experiences and perspectives other than our own

34
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.700
movies can also affirm the human spirit by showing us examples of what empathy

35
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.200
and solidarity looked like.

36
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.000
Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings or emotions of

37
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:48.620
others.
Now it's important to note that empathy isn't just feeling bad for the

38
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:53.360
misfortunes of other people.
Empathy is about feeling what others are feeling.

39
00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.040
Solidarity is when people from diverse backgrounds find a common cause and then

40
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.730
work together to achieve social change.

41
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.520
You can think of solidarity as empathy put into collective action.

42
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.330
So with those two definitions in mind,

43
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.720
here's my personal list of five lesser known movies from the 1980s that helped

44
00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:17.840
shape our humanity.

45
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.450
The journey of Natty Gan chronicles the adventures of a young woman and her

46
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:33.451
canine companion as they hop freight trains from Chicago to Washington state in

47
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.930
a quest to find her father

48
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.090
set against the backdrop of the Great Depression.

49
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.830
This is a quiet film with beautiful cinematography that shows us the world

50
00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:46.540
through the eyes of characters living in poverty.

51
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.750
The film makers deliberately place us as the audience firmly on the side of the

52
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:57.751
downtrodden as we see police evicting impoverished families and company bosses,

53
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.000
treating workers with heartless difference.

54
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.070
But while this depression era world is harsh,

55
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.820
it's not defined by cynicism.
That was nice.

56
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.400
Acts of kindness and solidarity between economically oppressed people are

57
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:19.600
highlighted throughout the movie.
There's food in here and money for a chicken.

58
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.950
<v 1>No,
Charlie,
don't tell me no.</v>

59
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.980
<v 0>The journey of Natty Gan is also reminiscent of the classic a boy and his dog</v>

60
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:34.981
adventure stories genre except here the boy is a girl and the dog is a wolf.

61
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.150
It's especially important for young women to be represented as leads in their

62
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:45.151
own adventure stories and I'd argue that it's just as it Portland for young male

63
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:50.070
audiences to see these kinds of representations.
That's a nice dog.

64
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.173
He's a wolf.

65
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.830
Boys need to learn to identify with female characters and see women and girls as

66
00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:03.780
fully human equals with their own stories.

67
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.320
NASA of the Valley of the wind is set 1000 years after humans have destroyed

68
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.860
civilization and the planet in a great apocalyptic war.

69
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.510
We follow the adventures of a young woman named Nassa princess of one of the few

70
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:27.100
remaining human kingdoms and she struggles to understand and heal a world that's

71
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:30.520
been overrun by Newton creatures and toxic forests.

72
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.740
<v 2>Take home whatever you do,
don't start open.</v>

73
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.940
<v 0>The story is centers on NASA because struggle to restore equilibrium to the</v>

74
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:46.440
environment and to end the violent conflicts between human tribes and the giant

75
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:47.640
insects of the jungle.

76
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.920
<v 2>We are not your enemies.
We mean you know hard</v>

77
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.870
<v 0>in group depictions of empathy for friends,</v>

78
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:58.520
teammates and family members are common in pop culture.

79
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:03.500
Media stories built around expressions of outgroup empathy that is empathy for

80
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.010
strangers or outsiders to your own group are more unusual

81
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.070
and expressions of empathy for one's enemies are especially rare.

82
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.310
Stop it.
Oh,
this killing my stock

83
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.790
and empathy for the enemy is really the guiding principle of this film.

84
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.150
<v 3>Sorry.
Is there any way you can forgive us?</v>

85
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.340
You've treated you so badly.

86
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.310
<v 0>NASA remains acutely aware of the danger posed by the gigantic bug light</v>

87
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.144
creatures,

88
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.420
but she nonetheless extends her empathy to these mutant beasts and it's that act

89
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:46.340
of empathy that ultimately saves humanity.

90
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.200
It has a range of 7,000 miles and a 20 mega ton warhead.

91
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.230
Amazing grace and chuck is about a small town boy who refuses to keep playing

92
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:09.430
little league baseball because of the existence of nuclear weapons and what the

93
00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:09.730
hell is it?

94
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.530
<v 4>[inaudible]
just can't play,</v>

95
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.840
can't play because of nuclear weapons.
What's that got to do with baseball?

96
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.140
Nothing.
What's my best thing?
I have to give up something.

97
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.870
<v 0>I feel real bad about this.
You know that</v>

98
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.280
God games all that Dave,
we foreclosures,

99
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.330
his protest inspires the professional basketball star.

100
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.190
Amazing grace to join his strike and together they organize a global movement

101
00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:40.820
for nuclear disarmament.
Alright.

102
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.940
Hollywood very rarely gets political activism,
right?

103
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.800
The depiction of activism in most movies is limited to raising awareness or

104
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.870
personal acts of defiance.
Amazing grace and chuck on the other hand,

105
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.440
manage just to show how social change actually happens.

106
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.240
Social change is brought about when organizers raised social costs higher and

107
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:11.371
higher until it becomes more advantageous for the powers that be to give in to

108
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:16.390
people's demands then to keep opposing their cause.
In the movie.

109
00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:21.391
We see this play out when so many athletes join chuck strike than it forces all

110
00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:24.460
professional sporting leagues to cancel their seasons

111
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:28.950
<v 3>has now effectively destroyed professional sports plus college athletics,</v>

112
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.370
High School Sport,
even such things as little league.

113
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.590
So far it has made a shambles of the World Cup Wimbledon and events as far away

114
00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:39.390
as India and mainland China.

115
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.020
<v 0>These protests raise social costs to the point where the public,</v>

116
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.210
the media and world leaders have to pay attention.
Hello,

117
00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:53.190
chuck,
and then begrudgingly take action.
In the end,

118
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.780
the world is radically changed,
but unlike most Hollywood movies,

119
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:03.030
this social transformation is not brought about by defeating the bad guys or

120
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.160
through the actions of benevolent leaders.

121
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.060
This social change comes from the bottom up.

122
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.680
It comes from people organizing and standing in solidarity together.

123
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.510
Harry and the Hendersons is about a typical white American family who

124
00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:26.140
accidentally hit big foot with their station wagon.

125
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.840
Cool.

126
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.320
The family's relationship with this gentle giant who they named Harry ultimately

127
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:38.030
changes their lives forever.

128
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:40.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

129
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.390
<v 0>This one really is better than a campy big foot movie has any right to be</v>

130
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.680
over the course of the film,

131
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.270
the empathy that Harry demonstrates towards other living creatures inspires the

132
00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:55.160
family to rethink their worldview,

133
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.640
especially in regards to hunting and guns.

134
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.370
The father played by John Lithgow,

135
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:06.290
undergoes and especially striking transformation from avid hunter and firearms

136
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:09.710
dealer to someone who over the objections of his own father,

137
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.610
learns to value nonviolence and embrace his creative side.
Did she drove it?

138
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.950
Yeah.
Beautiful

139
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.040
depictions of men and boys who reject guns and violence as markers of their

140
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.040
manhood are critically important in our current culture.

141
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.810
<v 5>I wanted King Kong.
You brought me a God damn giant durable.</v>

142
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.740
I told you exactly what to do.
He didn't even come close at all.

143
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.330
Maybe it's right on the nose.
I mean,
how do we know?

144
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:41.330
Maybe it's not vicious at all.
Maybe it's gentle.

145
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.960
Even has feelings.
Where'd you dream of that shit?

146
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:46.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.850
<v 0>Has this movie illustrates,</v>

148
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.230
there's no reason Hollywood can't present empathy as a defining feature of

149
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:53.064
masculinity.

150
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.520
<v 0>Batteries not included centers on the tenants of an Old New York City apartment</v>

152
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:05.720
building who are resisting or real estate tycoons efforts to evict them in order

153
00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:06.860
to build a skyscraper.

154
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.753
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

155
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.740
<v 0>the residents are a band of down on their luck,</v>

156
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.770
but kindhearted misfits who find unlikely allies in a group of mechanical aliens

157
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.880
looking for a place to recharge.

158
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.860
Our group of humans embrace their strange extraterrestrial visitors and they all

159
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:32.820
work together to help their new friends by providing fuel and energy for the

160
00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:34.470
aliens reproductive process.

161
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:37.973
<v 1>Good</v>

162
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.453
<v 0>in return,</v>

163
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.420
the mechanical life forms help the residents by repairing damage done to their

164
00:11:46.421 --> 00:11:50.280
building by the tycoons.
Henchman Dan,

165
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.160
<v 1>the fixes,
they liked it.
They have that knack.</v>

166
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.820
<v 0>This story is really built around solidarity on all sides.</v>

167
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.800
The human tenants and the alien creatures come from very different backgrounds

168
00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.570
and have very different needs,

169
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.100
but they still feel for each other and work to provide mutual aid and support.

170
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.240
Going back and rewatching these unapologetically sincere and sentimental movies

171
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.410
feels like an antidote to the superficial or ironic appeals to nostalgia that

172
00:12:22.411 --> 00:12:24.210
saturates much of Hollywood today.

173
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.470
Now I should say that none of the movies on my list are without their flaws,

174
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.750
like a lot of pop culture in the 1980s some include racial stereotypes and the

175
00:12:36.751 --> 00:12:39.690
story's mostly focused on the experiences of white people.

176
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.440
Still the core themes of empathy and solidarity had a profound impact on me and

177
00:12:45.781 --> 00:12:50.130
my values growing up.
My list is of course a personal one,

178
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.580
and therefore specific to my identity and my upbringing.

179
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.980
Depending on your age,
your gender,
and your cultural background,

180
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.340
your own list of movies,
we'll likely look quite a bit different.

181
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

182
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.370
<v 0>If I were making a list like this one,
but for media from this decade,</v>

183
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.940
there are a handful of excellent movies that I definitely include.

184
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.160
I've made video essays discussing a few of them like Wally and fantastic beasts,

185
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.110
which you can find elsewhere on this channel,

186
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.450
but entertainment built around empathy and solidarity is still relatively

187
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:25.220
uncommon in 2018

188
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.900
which is too bad because we really need more movies that embrace their role as

189
00:13:32.031 --> 00:13:36.530
empathy generating machines.
I hope you enjoyed this.

190
00:13:36.531 --> 00:13:40.580
Look back at some of my favorite movies from the 1980s if you'd like to see more

191
00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:44.060
of these long form video essays that examined the messages in our media,

192
00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.810
then please consider going over to Patrion and helping to fund this project

193
00:13:47.811 --> 00:13:51.170
there.
There's also a link to paypal in the description below.

194
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:55.190
Next time we'll be talking about a rather disturbing action movie trope called

195
00:13:55.191 --> 00:13:56.410
abduction as romance.
