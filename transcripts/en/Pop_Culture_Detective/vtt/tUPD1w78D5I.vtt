1
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.410
Oh,
see,
she's with you young

2
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.673
<v 2>Chennai.</v>

3
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.450
<v 1>The Star Wars Saga is set against the backdrop of an intergalactic struggle</v>

4
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.130
between the forces of light and

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.013
<v 2>dark.</v>

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.530
<v 1>There are a fantastic alien worlds ethic,</v>

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.800
space battles and cryptic ancient prophecies,

8
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.570
but at their core,

9
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.810
George Lucas's six star wars films are really coming of age story about boys

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.253
becoming men.

11
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.820
Both Luke and antiquing Skywalker begin their respective trilogies as wide eyed

12
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.430
idealistic young men eager to explore the universe.

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.770
They both leave their sheltered lives to embark on a journey of self discovery

14
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.090
that takes them to the farthest reaches of the galaxy and their adventures

15
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:04.091
ultimately usher them from adolescence into manhood and although their narrative

16
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:07.610
arcs and in wildly different ways,

17
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.720
both are guided and shaped by the principles of the Jetta Thousand Generations

18
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.350
of Jeddah,

19
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.450
<v 2>Jedi nights for the Guardians,
peace,
justice,
and the old republic.</v>

20
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.990
<v 1>But buried within those principles,</v>

21
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.000
we find some troubling and deeply unhealthy ideas about stoic masculinity.

22
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.940
In order to explain why I say that,

23
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.650
we first need to talk a little bit about the jet I ordered

24
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.140
<v 3>itself.
I have a bad feeling about this.
I don't sense anything.</v>

25
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.340
<v 1>The Gin I order is an ancient organization of intergalactic warrior monks who</v>

26
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:47.290
are framed as wise enlightened heroes with access to powerful mental abilities.

27
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.050
<v 3>You don't need to just see his identification</v>

28
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.430
<v 1>as originally presented in star wars episodes one through six.</v>

29
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.390
The Gen I order is remarkably male dominated and male identified.

30
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.240
If you freeze frame and a few scenes you can catch brief glimpses of female

31
00:02:08.241 --> 00:02:09.350
Jeddah in the background,

32
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.820
but all the jet I speaking roles in both trilogies are filled by men.

33
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

34
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.263
<v 1>On the surface,</v>

35
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.500
Janai nights appear to be a welcome alternative to more traditional male action

36
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:23.080
hero archetypes.
I'm looking for a great warrior,

37
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.560
forced not to make one great.
They're soft,
soft-spoken,

38
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.740
careful,
deliberate and cool.
Under pressure,

39
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.740
they practice meditation and rely on Intelligence and dexterity over physical

40
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.574
strength,

41
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.930
but even though the Jetta I are in some ways presented as different from the

42
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.340
expected Hollywood fair,

43
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.470
that doesn't necessarily mean they represent a positive version of masculinity.

44
00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.300
George Lucas drew on a wide variety of cinematic sources when of his star wars

45
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:04.510
mythology.
The elements he borrowed from the Samurai movies of Akira.

46
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.340
Kurosawa are fairly self evident.

47
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.483
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

48
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.870
<v 1>but when asked about his inspiration for the jet,</v>

49
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.470
Lucas most often cites the US marshals of the old west is all the boys on them

50
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.000
has filtered through Hollywood movies.

51
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.440
I'll give you a five seconds to unbuckle your guns and it's not hard to see why.

52
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.160
In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic you're under arrest like the

53
00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:34.080
upstanding lawmen from classic Westerns.
The Jed,

54
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:39.081
I are framed as a rugged stoic warriors who bring order to a lawless land.

55
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.800
This party's over,
Jed.
I don't strike first,

56
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.210
but if provoked,

57
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.510
they're proficient in the use of violence and capable of a rather extreme level

58
00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:55.820
of brutality.
Jed,
I business.
Go back to your drinks.

59
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.940
Most of what we know about Gi philosophy we gleaned from the words of Yoda and

60
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:02.900
Obi wan Kenobi.

61
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.320
We know for instance that Jedi masters admonish recklessness and advocate

62
00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:11.410
patients that fit your

63
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.940
every judge.
I crave not bs thing.
Ooh,

64
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.760
I read nurse.
But the real heart of Gi Dogma,

65
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.470
the teachings that are given,
the most importance have to do with emotions

66
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.150
in star wars.
Uh,
Janai is worst.
Enemies are not agents of the dark side.

67
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.560
His true enemies are his own emotions.

68
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.160
And because of that,
Jan,

69
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.180
I masters teach that the expression of emotion must always be suppressed.

70
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.390
The tenants of Jen I philosophy are left a little bit vague in the original

71
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:58.680
trilogy to really get specifics.
We have to travel back to the beginning.

72
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.550
Long before he dawned the mask of Darth Vader and can Skywalker is instructed to

73
00:05:05.551 --> 00:05:06.600
wear another mask,

74
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.760
a mask of emotional and vulnerability in the phantom menace.
Uh,

75
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.750
young Anagen is identified as being forced sensitive players.

76
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.140
You again,
as a result,

77
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:23.550
he's taken away from his mom and his home planet to be trained as a Jedi
warrior.

78
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

79
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.840
<v 1>But when he's presented to the Jedi Council,
he's soundly rejected.</v>

80
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.450
And the reason that Yoda gives for rejecting this nine year old boy is because

81
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.070
he's too emotional.
And why is he deemed to emotional?

82
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.920
Well,
it's because he admits that he misses his mother sat through you.

83
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.220
We can his mother who,

84
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:54.240
let's remember the gin I have just left in slave to to an unscrupulous junk

85
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:58.610
dealer in another part of the galaxy.
Being mindful of your feelings,

86
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.180
your thoughts dwell on your mother.

87
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.950
I miss her
afraid to lose her.

88
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:10.220
I think what does that got to do with anything?

89
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.680
Everything
is the path to the dark side.

90
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.470
I want to underscore the message being presented here and it comes.

91
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.800
Feelings of pain and loss are understandable and completely normal,

92
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.910
but instead of getting the emotional support that he so desperately needs,

93
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.180
this child is instead publicly shamed for expressing his feelings of grief and

94
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:38.780
sadness has sense,
much fear in you

95
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.690
and that's because emotional detachment is valued above all else in the jet I

96
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:49.691
order young Jedi are instructed to sever all close emotional connections to the

97
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.380
people they care about.

98
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.330
They must learn to hide their feelings from others to deny their emotional

99
00:06:56.331 --> 00:07:00.860
selves and to always present a stoic exterior to the world.

100
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.220
Now at this point,
some star wars fans may be saying to themselves,
hold on,

101
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.180
I thought the Jed I,
we're all about feelings.
Strategize with your feelings.

102
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.540
Well,
not exactly Jedi masters do encourage students of the forced to trust their

103
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:20.540
intuition.
Let go conscious

104
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.380
act on instinct.
Think of it as a jet eyes,
sixth sense,

105
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.210
but they're also sternly warned to always keep their emotions buried deep

106
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:36.044
inside.

107
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.663
To be clear,

108
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.050
Jedi masters don't push stoicism on boys to be cruel or malicious.

109
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.210
Truly wonderful.

110
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.870
The mind of a child is they like many well meaning.

111
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:55.130
People in the real world firmly believed that boys need to disassociate from

112
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:58.040
their feelings and learn to tough it out in silence,

113
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.850
but regardless of the intentions leaving young men emotionally abandoned is

114
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:06.770
psychologically damaging and extremely unhealthy.

115
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.030
Author Bell Hooks describes this emotional hardening process in a book I highly

116
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:18.650
recommend entitled the will to change men,
masculinity and love.

117
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.630
The way we turn boys into men is through injury.

118
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.980
We sever them from their mothers.
Research tells us far too early.

119
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.090
We pull them away from their own expressiveness,
from their feelings,

120
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.190
from their sensitivity to others.

121
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.630
The very phrase be a man means suck it up and keep going.

122
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.680
Disconnection is not fallout from traditional masculinity.

123
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.880
Disconnection is masculinity by what she means.

124
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.710
That emotional disconnection has become synonymous with manhood itself.

125
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.990
Viewed through this lens.

126
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.800
Yodas words the young antiquing Skywalker are downright traumatizing.

127
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.030
We start to see the fallout from July teachings can attack of the clones where

128
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.100
we rejoin anagin as a bratty entitled teenager,

129
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:13.390
a teenager who's still struggling to follow the imperative of emotional

130
00:09:13.391 --> 00:09:14.224
detachment,

131
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.900
even though he's been clearly instructed to forget about his mother and a

132
00:09:19.901 --> 00:09:21.670
consensus that something is wrong

133
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.600
and his concern for her wellbeing transforms into premonition filled nightmares.

134
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.600
<v 5>You look tired.
I don't sleep well anymore</v>

135
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.970
because of your mother

136
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.690
<v 1>and it can still isn't getting the emotional support that he needs.</v>

137
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.780
I don't know why I keep dreaming about it.
Instead,

138
00:09:46.781 --> 00:09:49.420
he's just meant to put his mother's suffering out of his mind.

139
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.080
<v 5>Dreams pass and time</v>

140
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.940
<v 1>as a general in training,
he must strive to become an autonomous,</v>

141
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.340
detached emotional island.

142
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.620
<v 5>Be Mindful of your thoughts and again,
they betray you.</v>

143
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.660
You've made a commitment to the jet.
I order a commitment not easily broken.

144
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.180
<v 1>Manikins inability to bury his anxieties about his mom's wellbeing is seen as a</v>

145
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:16.160
manifestation of his emotional volatility.

146
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.250
In fact,
throughout the prequels,

147
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.910
men's expression of grief is consistently demonized.

148
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.740
I miss you
so much.

149
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.440
Crying in particular is framed as evidence of a dangerous loss of control.

150
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.550
I,
whenever we see tears from antiquing,

151
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.410
it's always meant to represent his weakness of character and communicate to the

152
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.380
viewer that he's being seduced by the dark side.

153
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.040
Contrary to popular opinion,

154
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.150
men burying their feelings is not a sign of strength.

155
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.720
Real strength is having the courage to ask for help.

156
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.060
The courage to talk about your feelings,

157
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.360
the courage to risk being vulnerable in front of others,

158
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.770
but the Jedi order for bids,
any of that

159
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.050
<v 0>are you allowed to laugh?
Thought that was forbidden for debt.</v>

160
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.890
Attachment for a minute.

161
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.240
<v 5>Possession is forbidden.
Compassion,
which I would define us,</v>

162
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.720
unconditional central Georgia has life.

163
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.940
<v 1>George Lucas likes to say that the Jed I are compassionate,</v>

164
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.160
but there's an important caveat there.

165
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.700
The Gi practice and impersonal detached,

166
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.880
Birdseye view sort of compassion one that's decidedly unconcerned with the

167
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:48.120
suffering of individual people,
which is one of the Jetta I don't lift.

168
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:51.990
A finger can try to help an Akins and slaved mom despite their considerable

169
00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:52.824
influence and,

170
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.080
and it can longs for human contact.

171
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.050
But since July Dogma prohibits attachments,

172
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.320
he must satisfy his emotional needs in secret.

173
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.320
He conceals his marriage to pat may and hides her pregnancy from everyone around

174
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:12.154
him.

175
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.000
When Anik and attempts to seek advice from Yoda about his continuing nightmare

176
00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:30.560
is in revenge of the sith he does so without revealing his secret concern for

177
00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:35.510
the safety of his wife and unborn children and he gets what might be the worst

178
00:12:35.511 --> 00:12:37.520
advice in the history of the galaxy.

179
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.700
<v 5>The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.</v>

180
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.680
Death is a natural part of life.

181
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.630
Rejoice for those around you who transformed into the force.

182
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.630
Mourn them.
Do not miss them.

183
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:59.600
Attachment leads to jealousy,
the shadow of greed.

184
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.120
<v 1>That is what must I do.
Mastery over.</v>

185
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:09.210
<v 5>Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.</v>

186
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.720
<v 1>I just need to pause here for a moment because although Yodas words are framed</v>

187
00:13:15.721 --> 00:13:20.130
as a form of enlightened wisdom,
his advice is truly unhinged.

188
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.130
Had Yoda been interested in actually helping antiquing?

189
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.550
There are a whole host of things he could've done.
First.

190
00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:29.730
He could have acknowledged and validated Anticon spheres.

191
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.850
He could have listened and shown a little bit of empathy and he could've

192
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.100
encouraged and akin to seek counseling for his obvious trauma and anxiety.

193
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:43.530
But Jed,
I orthodoxy prevents Yoda from doing any of that.
So instead,

194
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:48.000
antiquing is essentially told to stop caring so much and that if something

195
00:13:48.001 --> 00:13:52.710
tragic were to happen to his loved ones,
he should just be happy about it.

196
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.930
Now,
it's true that men,
being possessive of women is a negative thing,

197
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.460
but that's not what's happening in anacon story in this scene.

198
00:14:02.461 --> 00:14:05.190
He is just afraid for the safety of his family,

199
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.840
which brings us to one of the central themes in July.

200
00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:12.480
Philosophy in both trilogies,

201
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.080
fear is framed as the gateway drug to the dark side.

202
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.160
It's the emotion that we hear Yoda warn against in the most ominous of tones.

203
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:29.370
Skew is the path to the dark side.
In reality,
of course,

204
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.810
fear like most human emotions serves an important physiological function.

205
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.540
It can help keep us safe and healthy.

206
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.610
You'd think a quasi spiritual organization that preaches balance in all things

207
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.770
would understand that.
But did I teachings leave no room for such subtleties?

208
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.400
And that's because Jen I philosophy is constructed around what I'd call an

209
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:57.140
emotional domino.
Theory is the path to the dark side.

210
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.590
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate,

211
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.230
hate leads to suffering.

212
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.360
Setting aside George Lucas's misappropriation of some spiritual concepts that

213
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:09.410
originate in Asia,

214
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.740
that formula is incredibly reductive and also not how emotions work.

215
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:21.080
What being afraid is not a slippery slope to all consuming evil.

216
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:27.080
And yet this emotional domino affect theory is core to the judge I belief
system.

217
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.060
They believe that young men are inherently volatile and if they succumb to one

218
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:33.170
intense emotion,

219
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:38.530
it will spark and inevitable chain reaction that leads to hatred like knocking

220
00:15:39.111 --> 00:15:40.310
over a set of dominoes.

221
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.310
So let's see if we can untangle some of the twisted logic here.

222
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.300
Even though Yoda starts his bizarre equation with fear.

223
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.700
That's not the first domino in the chain.

224
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.850
The fear of loss is a path to the job site.

225
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.530
Notice that he's warning about fear of loss,

226
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.210
which he says stems from emotional attachments to other people.

227
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.840
This is why the jet I order expressly for bids,

228
00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:11.950
romance and prohibits its members from having families.

229
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.800
Just so we're clear on what that means.
According to the I,

230
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.780
it's loving relationships with another person that leads men down the path to

231
00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:23.614
evil,

232
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:31.610
afraid to lose her.
I think what does that got to do with anything?

233
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.540
Everything.

234
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.290
Although the jet I caution against emotional attachments in general,

235
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.090
it's close relationships with women in particular that are framed as the most

236
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:45.924
dangerous.

237
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.270
This has made a specially evident in the prequels,
this too,

238
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.640
where emotional bonds with women are framed as something that eats away at a man

239
00:16:56.641 --> 00:17:01.641
sanity and indirectly drives men to fits of uncontrollable rage.

240
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.890
By the end of episode three,

241
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.040
it's been made abundantly clear that antiquing turns into Darth Vader because

242
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.740
he's unable to suppress his love for the women in his life.

243
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.240
Embedded in that plot point is a toxic idea.

244
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:25.640
That emotional intimacy and connection with women represents a loss of control

245
00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:26.474
for men.

246
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.810
The framing of relationships with women as something that drains men of their

247
00:17:32.811 --> 00:17:33.644
autonomy,

248
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.360
their power or their control is not a new storytelling device.

249
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.620
It goes all the way back to Samson and Delilah and beyond.

250
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.260
Though in George Lucas's version,
women don't actively sabotage men.

251
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.150
Instead,

252
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:56.150
they serve as the impetus for men's instability and that message that women are

253
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:01.671
the catalyst for men's loss of control is part of a deeply sexist worldview.

254
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.860
It's an especially pernicious myth because it fosters resentment towards women

255
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:13.220
and also encourages men to view healthy expressions of emotional intimacy with

256
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:14.064
suspicion.

257
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.390
For those of us who grew up as fans of the original trilogy,

258
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.650
it can be tempting to pin all the blame for this on the prequels.

259
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.360
Unfortunately,

260
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.830
there are echoes of everything we've been talking about here in Luke story as

261
00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:34.860
well.
Again,
it's like poetry.
So if they ride,

262
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.440
every stands are kind of rhymes with the last one in return of the Jedi,

263
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.560
Obi wan Kenobi articulates the second reason the jet.

264
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:48.170
I demand that boys tightly control their emotions,
feelings deep done.

265
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.620
<v 5>They bill.
Your credit couldn't be made to serve the emperor.</v>

266
00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.530
<v 1>He Instructs Luke To Bury His love for layer because if he doesn't,</v>

267
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.040
his feelings will be seen as a weakness.
Yes,

268
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.800
you'll betray you and we'll make him vulnerable to the manipulation and control

269
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:09.814
of other men

270
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:10.803
<v 6>sis.</v>

271
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.733
<v 1>So</v>

272
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.510
<v 6>sister,</v>

273
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.360
<v 1>your feelings have now betrayed her too.</v>

274
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.990
If you will not do the dark side,

275
00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.670
then perhaps she will.

276
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.481
The emperor,

277
00:19:31.481 --> 00:19:35.940
his master plan for turning and akin to the dark side follows the same logic.

278
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.330
Learn to know the dark side of the force and you will be able to save your wife

279
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.670
from certain.

280
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:49.590
It revolves around exploiting the weakness of antiquing.
His love for Pat May

281
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.970
and the narrative lessons for both protagonists.

282
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.020
Closely Mirror hyper masculine socialization in the real world,

283
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.830
men and boys are taught to hide their feelings because we are told expressing

284
00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:06.750
vulnerability demonstrates weakness

285
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:16.170
and leaves them open to being manipulated or dominated by their rivals.

286
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.333
Control.

287
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.550
I think it's instructive to talk a little bit about why Anna can becomes Darth

288
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.930
Vader while his son remains a hero like antiquing.

289
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.990
Luke's Janai training includes the demand that he buried his emotions,

290
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.140
sever his attachments and abandoned his friends and like an Akin Luke doesn't

291
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:43.530
always follow the instructions of his teachers.
You must face

292
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.650
<v 5>again.
I can't kill my own father.</v>

293
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:48.703
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

294
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.020
<v 1>then the emperor has already won.</v>

295
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.670
The difference is that unlike his father,

296
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.110
Luke doesn't take the generic orthodoxy surrounding emotional detachment to

297
00:21:00.111 --> 00:21:00.944
heart.

298
00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.860
When an Akins emotions bring him into conflict with Jed I teachings he feels

299
00:21:06.861 --> 00:21:11.810
deeply ashamed and tries to hide his relationships.
Luke,

300
00:21:11.811 --> 00:21:12.650
on the other hand,

301
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.750
openly vocalizes his objections and defies both Yoda and Obi wan.

302
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.520
<v 5>The training I keep division out of my head.
They're my friends.</v>

303
00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.510
I got to help them.
You Mush not glow,
but Han and Leia will die if I don't.

304
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:34.380
Patience and sacrifice on and layer if you honor what they fight for it.

305
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.693
<v 0>Yes.</v>

306
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.220
<v 1>Are to fire up the converters.</v>

307
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.760
He chooses to embrace his attachment to his friends,

308
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:50.210
chooses to try to save his father and critically chooses not to always bottle up

309
00:21:50.281 --> 00:21:51.780
his vulnerable feelings.

310
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.290
When you really think about it,

311
00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.850
Luke Skywalker is at his very best when he doesn't follow the path of the Jedi.

312
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:00.913
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

313
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:07.190
<v 1>The belief that emotional disconnection is an essential step for boys on their</v>

314
00:22:07.191 --> 00:22:09.470
journey into manhood is a common one,

315
00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.500
but following that path leads to a life of loneliness,
emotional dysfunction,

316
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:20.420
and anger.
Let's return once more to bell hooks.

317
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.790
Anger often hides depression and profound sorrow.

318
00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.750
Depression often masks the inability to grieve.

319
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.410
Males are not given the emotional space to grieve.

320
00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.450
There still being taught to keep it in and worse to deny that they feel like

321
00:22:38.451 --> 00:22:42.860
crying,
unable to cope with the loss of emotional connection.

322
00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:48.170
Boys internalize the pain and mask it with indifference or rage.

323
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:50.040
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

324
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.040
<v 1>That passage gives us some clues as to the real reason why Anna can Skywalker</v>

325
00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:57.240
can't handle grief or loss.

326
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.920
He's been well trained by the Jedi to stipel his emotions and hide his

327
00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:06.921
vulnerabilities and he's never learned how to process or work through painful

328
00:23:07.021 --> 00:23:08.610
emotions in healthy ways.

329
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:14.670
The results are as predictable as they are dysfunctional and it can is left

330
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.860
completely unprepared for tragedy

331
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.360
and like so many young men in our own culture,

332
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:26.640
he eventually lashes out in anger and leaves behind a trail of horrific
violence.

333
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.680
Jed,
I philosophy gets it entirely backwards.

334
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:38.780
Emotional detachment doesn't prevent men from turning to the dark side.

335
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:44.420
Emotional detachment is the cause of men turning to the dark side.

336
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.713
In the end,

337
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:52.550
it's the Jetta and their philosophy of emotional detachment that's ultimately

338
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:54.590
responsible for the creation of Darth Vader.

339
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.860
In this video,
I focused on the Jetta.

340
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:08.310
I as presented in George Lucas's six feature films because they provide the

341
00:24:08.311 --> 00:24:12.030
foundation upon which everything else in the star wars university is built.

342
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:19.520
The star wars cinematic universities.
Now,
thankfully out of George Lucas,

343
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:20.354
his hands,

344
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:24.410
and it'll be interesting to see how Disney handles the GI I mythos moving

345
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:28.760
forward,
especially now that we have our first female I with her own trilogy.

346
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.430
Hopefully ray won't be forced down the same path of emotional detachment as her

347
00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:35.540
male predecessors.

348
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.610
The stoic imperative is expected of men in our society,

349
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.610
but it's an unhealthy ideal for people of any gender.

350
00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.350
As we've discussed in this video,

351
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.150
listening to the teachings of Yoda and Obi wan is a guaranteed recipe for

352
00:24:52.151 --> 00:24:54.160
creating lonely,
angry,

353
00:24:54.161 --> 00:24:57.960
broken people like all human beings,

354
00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:02.880
men and boys need love.
They need affection,
they need emotional support,

355
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.240
and they need opportunities to openly communicate their feelings.

356
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:12.210
The glorification of emotional detachment is one of the more pervasive and

357
00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:15.630
insidious messages about masculinity in popular media.

358
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.090
And it's something that we as men need to organize a rebellion against.

359
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.500
I hope you enjoyed that video.
Uh,

360
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.940
these essays take an enormous amount of time to produce.

361
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.220
That one took about three months,
all told.

362
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:34.920
So if you like these long form video essays,
