1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.210
Fair.
Well,
sweet cookie cats.
Always remember the time we spent together.

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.333
<v 1>Hush.
Now</v>

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.900
<v 0>are you crying</v>

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.690
<v 1>by my friends?</v>

5
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.560
<v 0>Go Away.
They never will.</v>

6
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.603
<v 1>Oh,</v>

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.310
<v 0>I'm going to disappear without ever making a single friend.</v>

8
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.430
Come on

9
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.160
guys,
please stop fighting.
I love to eat oatmeal.

10
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.950
I sincerely hope nothing happens to

11
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.543
dancing.

12
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.653
I'm

13
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.380
not strong enough to do anything.

14
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.400
Just once.
I'd like to burn him back

15
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.470
that night.
I really thought

16
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.340
player two is that just your way of saying I could have been anyone?

17
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.660
This isn't you.
You're not amongst already more.

18
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.980
You have to remember this all happened today.

19
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.140
You saved me with this.
You're going to get hurt.

20
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.770
We could ever find the way under all this.

21
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.190
Are you okay?
Keep going.

22
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.700
<v 1>Please.
Let me be a magic healer.</v>

23
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.210
<v 0>Oh,
come on.</v>

24
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.670
If I don't have powers,
then I can hang out with them at this or garden.

25
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.150
<v 1>Eh,</v>

26
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.170
<v 0>now what if I can't do anything?</v>

27
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.160
Stay tuned for another episode of crime.
Breakfast,
friends.

28
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.920
<v 1>I wanted to see you guys acting like friends.</v>

29
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.700
<v 0>What if I never get back home?</v>

30
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.810
Do you ever get lonely when you're around people?

31
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.830
<v 1>Oh,
PT,
PT,
PT.</v>

32
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.940
You got to look at the big picture here.

33
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.570
<v 0>Oh,
it hurts.
No,
give back the gym.</v>

34
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.890
My precious.
I thought I'd never see you again.
Daddy.
Come on.

35
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:36.790
We got open up.

36
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.370
<v 1>I should have listened to you.</v>

37
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.890
<v 0>Please tell me what's going to happen with my lunch too.
I choke on a pig.</v>

38
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.833
<v 1>Oh,</v>

39
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.050
<v 0>master of ceremonies.
Bear bear.</v>

40
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.450
I never asked to be made amethyst.

41
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.350
Amethyst,
please.
No more.
I know you're upset,

42
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:08.140
but I can't bear to watch you two already.
Each other.

43
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.870
You want to pretend that none of this ever happened.

44
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.610
You think I'm just a big mistake.
I hope you can forgive me.

45
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.880
You're the one good thing that came out of this mess.

46
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.640
I always thought you were proud of that.

47
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.940
<v 1>Return to us.
The Emison Satie.</v>

48
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.510
<v 0>Oh,
Herve,
you bed all these years.</v>

49
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.220
Is She okay?
I think you're pretty great.

50
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.163
I like

51
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.750
you.
You're welcome.

52
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.920
<v 1>We did everything.
We could
turn the van around.</v>

53
00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.940
<v 0>I have to go back.
I have to.
They don't have my shield.
You do.</v>

54
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.670
You understand?
Yeah.
Okay.

55
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.230
Just be careful.
I'm going to run fresh out of family,

56
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.080
but this is my own.

57
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.980
I do
don't want to be friends anymore.

58
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.270
I still want to be friends.
You're ungrounded from TV.

59
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.293
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.420
<v 0>Sorry.
Sometimes I get caught up in the drama zone.
You know</v>

61
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.700
us
never love again.

62
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.220
Put Pearl to two whole weeks to come back and I already missed you at this so

63
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:50.220
much.
Oh,
okay.
Hey,

64
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.900
I mean rose made me feel like I was everything.

65
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.960
Five may beach city.
Oh ha ha ha.

66
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.080
These were crystal gems shattered into pieces.
They baby together.

67
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.360
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.670
Why are you crying?
Why are we going to make this work?

69
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.843
<v 2>Okay.</v>

70
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.910
<v 0>Cry Bro.</v>

71
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.930
Why did you lie to me?
I did
garden.

72
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.090
That's enough.
Please

73
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.320
pick your not as a bump.
This,
this.
Yes.

74
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.220
It's okay pal.
No wonder.
I don't

75
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.930
honestly think I'm not upset about what happened.
That's so beautiful.

76
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.900
<v 3>Oh,
buddy was,</v>

77
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.810
Dale does get to the end.

78
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.150
<v 0>I'm just a pearl.
I'm useless on my own.</v>

79
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.390
I need someone to tell me what to do.
I understand.

80
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.120
I can't give up anymore.
Ah,

81
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.520
just can't believe my little boys growing up so quickly.

82
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.593
<v 4>Okay.</v>

83
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.260
<v 0>Power means nothing to Stephen's microscopic.</v>

84
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.180
He's reverted back to a Zygote.

85
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.440
You're back to normal roadies work behind the scenes to make all magic on stage

86
00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:44.230
possible.
It's isn't it?

87
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.310
Why can't buy move

88
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.860
both of you.

89
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.730
You know rose,
she did what she wanted.

90
00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.870
I know you both needed,

91
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.890
just wanted the baby together.
Steven,

92
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.210
for your blog.
Cheap beach cities.

93
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.393
What are we going to do?

94
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.780
I'm full of sadness.

95
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.653
Just hold on.

96
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:34.010
I'll come home her.
You know I can't take it when you cry like that.

97
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.060
I'm sorry.
No,
no need to apologize.

98
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.780
This myth,
I can't use this.
I'm sorry business,

99
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.500
but it's not right.
I'm going to tell them.
I'm going to tell them everything

100
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.340
and you really better than her,

101
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.200
<v 1>so stop leaving me out of this as worst gem stick together.</v>

102
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.620
Right.
That's why we're the best

103
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.750
jasper such devotion.
Yes,
of course.

104
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.380
<v 0>Rose Quartz would never do that.
It sure she had to fight,
but</v>

105
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.230
I don't want to hurt you when I see the way you were wondering when I'm coming

106
00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:32.120
back and I could do about anything.
I could even learn.

107
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.490
This will be the last thing I ever see as I expire.

108
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.833
Do,

109
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.290
I'm sorry.
I should know.
It's okay.

110
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.850
It's okay to think about it.

111
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.383
<v 1>No,</v>

112
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.220
<v 0>Steven.
I did.
None of them will be helped them.</v>

113
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.440
I had no choice.
It's okay.
It's not,

114
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.690
don't want to feel this way.
You have to,

115
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.920
you have to be honest about how bad it feels,
so you can move on.

116
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.690
That's how it was for me.

117
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

118
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.860
Yeah.
