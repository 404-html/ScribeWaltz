Have you ever read an article about sexism in the media and then made the

2
00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:08.050
horrible mistake of scrolling down into the comment section because if you have

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.310
then you've seen someone trying to derail that conversation with demands of what

4
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:13.144
about the men.

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.890
Now the last thing the guys who are making that demand really want to do is have

6
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:22.891
a serious discussion about the sometimes harmful ways that media represents

7
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:26.890
masculinity and they especially don't want to have that conversation if it's

8
00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:31.740
inspired by feminism and so that's exactly what this project is going to

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.870
welcome to the pop culture detective agency,

10
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.980
a brand new web series that looks like media through a critical lens with a

11
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:48.420
special emphasis on the depictions of men and masculinity in popular culture.

12
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.290
Hi there.
I'm Jonathan.
I'm a pop culture critic and a video producer.

13
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.310
I've been making online videos about social and political issues for over a

14
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.160
decade now.
You may have seen some of my work a while back.

15
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.440
I made a viral video called Buffy versus Edward.

16
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.580
<v 1>Get Out.
I like watching you sleep,
so</v>

17
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.350
just kind of oil a drop you out head first.

18
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.920
I just want to try one thing

19
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.810
<v 0>and then later another one called Donald duck meets Glenn Beck,</v>

20
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.390
Jana job,

21
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.430
lazy slob that refuses to get off the couch and get a job.

22
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.130
That remix made one of these two cartoon characters very,
very unhappy.

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
<v 2>We're looking into the funding of this gentleman and the incredible propaganda</v>

24
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.340
against me like you've never seen using Disney and Disney cartoons

25
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.470
<v 0>over the past three years.</v>

26
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.550
I've had the honor of working as producer and Co writer on the first season of

27
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:06.750
feminist frequency is influential web series tropes versus women in video games.

28
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.540
<v 3>Both of them is male character and the smurfette principle have been normalized</v>

29
00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:12.760
in gaming and a mass media more broadly,

30
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.320
so much so that the two tropes usually pass under the radar and are often

31
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:18.700
reproduced.
I unconsciously

32
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.810
<v 0>today I'm excited to build on that work with a brand new series.</v>

33
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.640
This one we'll focus on deconstructing the representations of masculinity that

34
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:32.260
we see embedded in movies,
TV shows,
comic books and Video Games.

35
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.240
The messages that pop culture sends to boys and men about masculinity are

36
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.780
consistently both limiting and harmful.
At this point,

37
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:43.030
we're all familiar with the standard media conventions.

38
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.070
Men are typically shown as either stoic heroes who use violence to solve all of

39
00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:53.071
their problems or as bumbling fools who are incapable of nurturing or caregiving

40
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.410
with all the conflicting media messages out there.

41
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.490
It's not surprising that a lot of young men are very about what it means to be a

42
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:02.770
real man.
In the near future.

43
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.660
I'll be looking at how manhood is framed by the jet I order in George Lucas's

44
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.020
six star wars films.

45
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.490
<v 1>You'll insights as well,
no feelings.</v>

46
00:03:13.491 --> 00:03:17.030
Deep down
they knew you credit,

47
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.370
but they could be made

48
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.970
<v 0>and then later I'll be investigating some of the harmful ideas about geek</v>

49
00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:30.570
masculinity that we find on the Big Bang theory.
I'm sorry,

50
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.570
what universe is wonder woman blonde.
Relax.

51
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.040
No one's going to be looking at her hair.
Yeah,

52
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.180
there is a lot to talk about right there,

53
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.150
but this project won't only focus on the negative.

54
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.170
I'll also be producing a series of videos that look at positive examples of

55
00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:49.190
manhood in the media.

56
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.420
The first of those positive episodes explores emotional expression on the

57
00:03:53.421 --> 00:03:55.820
cartoon network series.
Steven universe.

58
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.930
<v 1>You understand?
Yeah.
Okay.</v>

59
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.510
Just be careful.
Oh,
I'm going to run fresh out of family,

60
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.060
stay with everyone and keep them safe.

61
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.760
<v 0>A little further down the line.</v>

62
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.930
I'll also be looking at the remarkable way is that empathy and also fatherhood

63
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.220
are represented on that show.

64
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.080
These episodes will be a long form video essays between 10 and 20 minutes long.

65
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.120
That longer format really allows me the opportunity to delve into how culture is

66
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:28.320
impacted by media and vice versa,
how media is impacted by culture.

67
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.890
I'll also be making some shorter videos to supplement the longer ones.

68
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.760
Some of those will be debunking sexist myths and others will be defining

69
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:37.470
commonly misunderstood terms.

70
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.520
You can also look forward to some fun super cuts that highlight various patterns

71
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:45.300
in the media.
Although masculinity will be the primary focus of this series.

72
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.800
From time to time I'll be creating visual essays about other sociopolitical

73
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:54.030
issues related to popular culture.
You can see examples of all that stuff.

74
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.400
Overall,

75
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.440
my youtube channel and also in my patrion page now there are more than a few

76
00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:02.670
youtube channels that claim to be concerned about men.
Unfortunately,

77
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.630
most of them are aggressively antifeminist and they just spend their time

78
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:11.100
scapegoating and blaming women for everything.
It is a really bad scene.

79
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.060
My new channel will be an alternative to that growing trend.

80
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.110
The critical analysis that I'll be using is very much inspired by feminist

81
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:19.860
theory.

82
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.460
It's through that lens that I'll be looking at the ways that boys and men are

83
00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:26.250
harmed as a byproduct of hypermasculinity.

84
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.930
So my hope is that this video series can help open up conversations about how we

85
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.320
as men can work together to achieve more constructive,

86
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.910
cooperative and empathetic forms of masculinity and this is where you come in.

87
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.000
I'm going to need your support to help keep this project going.

88
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.790
Creating these videos really is a full time job.

89
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.690
They take a tremendous amount of time to research,
write and produce,

90
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.890
especially for just one person.
There'll be no ads on anything I make.

91
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.580
Plus all my videos will be available for free for everyone,

92
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.220
including so the only way this project can continue is if you find it,

93
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.430
you'll find all the details in the text below this video.

94
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.760
I am super excited for this project and I hope you are too,

95
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.240
so please become a patron of the pop culture detective agency.

96
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.380
Yeah.
I just promised to watch both the star wars prequels and did the Big Bang

97
00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:22.320
theory.
That's going to be worth some support right there,

98
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.150
because that's going to be excruciating.
