1
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.123
Okay.

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.380
<v 1>As a cultural critic,</v>

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.120
I watch a lot of movies and I'm always on the lookout for positive Hollywood

4
00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:16.460
representations of masculinity.

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.700
I usually walk out of the theater disappointed,

6
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.180
but occasionally the stars will align and I'll find myself pleasantly surprised

7
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.840
and that's how I felt after seeing the fantastic beasts and where to find them.

8
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:32.940
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.940
<v 1>Newts commander protagonist of this Harry Potter spinoff is an unconventional</v>

10
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.144
male hero.

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.400
The kind of character typically relegated to Sidekiq status.

12
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.960
He performs a refreshing Lee atypical form of masculinity,

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.150
especially for the lead in a fantasy adventure story.
His is a quiet,

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.160
vulnerable,
yet confident form

15
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.103
<v 0>manhood</v>

16
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.440
<v 1>newts character is largely defined by his extraordinary ability to connect with</v>

17
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:11.681
magical creatures and by his relative inability to connect with other human

18
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:17.930
beings.
Newt is,
imagine a zoologist,

19
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.120
essentially,
he's an expert in the care of magical creatures is life.

20
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:27.080
Work is passion,
is studying,
nurturing,

21
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:30.050
and protecting these fantastic beasts.

22
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.650
Then writing textbooks in an effort to foster understanding and compassion where

23
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:38.100
their plight to the loss breeding pair and exists.

24
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.970
If I hadn't managed to rescue them,

25
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.580
that could've been the end of the Grat poons forever.

26
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.840
I should mention that this is not a doctor.
Get a little situation newts.

27
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.890
Bond with an affinity for animals is not supernatural in nature even though that

28
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.050
wouldn't be out of place in this universe.

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.340
Instead,
you simply pays attention to them and their needs when others don't.

30
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.593
He had a cause.

31
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.570
He needed somebody or this is also not an animal.
Good human bad story.

32
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.090
Even though he's painfully shy and socially awkward newts.

33
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:23.091
Empathetic worldview extends to people especially to those discriminated against

34
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640
or marginalized as evidenced by his disgust at the way American wizards treat

35
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:30.330
non magical people.

36
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.690
<v 0>It's just commanded to you know anything about the wizarding community in</v>

37
00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:35.524
America.

38
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.940
<v 1>I do know a few things actually.</v>

39
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.090
I know that you have rather backwards laws about relations with not magic people

40
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.570
that you're not made to befriend them.
You can't marry them,

41
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:45.580
which seems mother live said to me,
just get to marry him.

42
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.703
<v 0>Okay?</v>

43
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.310
<v 1>He's strongly opposed to segregation,
discriminatory laws,</v>

44
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.550
capital punishment and other violence committed in the name of justice newts.

45
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.130
Truly special gift is not his magic.
It's his empathy.

46
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.880
All right,
I'm coming.
Mum's,
yeah.

47
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.460
This type of quiet sensitive masculinity is so out of the ordinary for a leading

48
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:20.410
man that I wasn't terribly surprised to see a number of movie reviewers turned

49
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.640
off by his character.

50
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.020
The New York Post said that newt was not a very engaging lead.

51
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.080
MTV said he lacked depth,
soul and a coherent personality.

52
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.180
The village voice went so far as to say he seemed physically ill much of the

53
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:41.380
time.
Slate felt that he was a little boring.

54
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.430
Both slate and the new republic lamented that the character tamped down Eddie

55
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.353
Redmayne is charisma.

56
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.980
The new republic also expressed shock at his leading man status,

57
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.910
saying that he's so good hearted,
simple and nondescript,

58
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.290
that it's sort of crazy.

59
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.070
He's going to be the centerpiece of a five film franchise.

60
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.670
I was disappointed,
but as I said,
not surprised to see this kind of reaction.

61
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.980
We as movie going,

62
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:16.390
audiences have been conditioned to expect a certain type of masculine

63
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:21.100
performance from male characters in Scifi or fantasy films.

64
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.190
We expect leading men who are or learned to be autonomous,

65
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.200
brazen and physically strong,
or at least men who are witty,

66
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.510
boisterous,
and charismatic,
preferably all of the above.

67
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.910
It's practically required for male heroes.
The hide their vulnerabilities.

68
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.370
We've learned too easily forgive aggression and arrogance and men,

69
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.570
but to take exception at presentations of humility or sensitivity,

70
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.090
we're accustomed to seeing men who are quick to violence and slow to diplomacy.

71
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.430
Newt is a significant departure from this trend.

72
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.820
His version of manhood doesn't stem from physical strength or combat skills or

73
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:14.041
feats of daring do that or even from some preordained mystic destiny,

74
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.870
like so many other male heroes.
He's sincere,
nurturing,

75
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.610
emotional and sensitive,
but that's definitely the lab.

76
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.120
He must be particularly susceptible and critically that sensitivity is framed as

77
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:32.560
a strength rather than a weakness.
Stay still.

78
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.750
That's just not the sweating.

79
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.180
When men in our culture express this kind of vulnerability,

80
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.280
they're often labeled week because nurturing and sensitivity are things that are

81
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:50.281
stereotypically associated with women and with femininity and by framing these

82
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:55.290
attributes as positive and heroic aspects of a male adventure hero,

83
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.770
it goes a long way to challenging regressive gender expectations.

84
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.570
Now,
in order for us to understand just how revolutionary newts performance of

85
00:06:07.571 --> 00:06:08.680
masculinity is,

86
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.690
it's useful to talk a little bit more about all the things he's not

87
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.410
isis and liked to.

88
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.260
Che Newt is a British wizard who attended Hogwarts school of witchcraft and

89
00:06:23.261 --> 00:06:28.090
wizardry,
but new is not Harry Potter.
He's a Hufflepuff.

90
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.880
Actually,
no,
I am.
I'm a proud of puff.

91
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.850
The house characterized by friendship,
hard work and humility.

92
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.920
Hufflepuffs are said to be more down to earth and less competitive than the

93
00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:46.420
other three wizarding houses.
Harry Potter on the other hand,

94
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.770
was sorted into Gryffindor.

95
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.580
The house known for daring nerve chivalry and prone to a fair bit of showing

96
00:06:54.641 --> 00:06:56.920
off.
As such,

97
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.080
Harry fits neatly into the Pantheon of traditional Hollywood heroes is,

98
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.000
is the archetypal hero's journey.

99
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.700
And we all know how these fantasy character arcs are supposed to unfold.

100
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.550
And unsuspecting young man has adventure thrust upon him and it turns out that

101
00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:19.480
he's the only one in the entire universe who can save the world.

102
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.790
Oh,
it was clumsy or random was a blast.

103
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.970
And does he is transformed from shy,

104
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.030
nerdy guy into triumph and bad ass.

105
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.800
It's not uncommon for this evolution to involve fighting with some sort of

106
00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:39.130
flaming Phallus.
By contrast,

107
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.950
newts commander is not the chosen one.

108
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.530
He doesn't have some faded cosmic burden that he alone must shoulder.

109
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.020
Some have compared newt with doctor who because,
well,

110
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.710
where it isshe bow tie and bigger on the inside.

111
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.470
But that's really where the similarities end.

112
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.600
New Does harbor a deep inner pain,
but his personal struggle,

113
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.590
it doesn't manifest as arrogance.
Oh,

114
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.690
he's not interested in showing off his power in grand gestures.

115
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.140
So all of time and space,

116
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:21.700
everything that ever happened or ever will.
Where do you want to stop?

117
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.100
Newt is a humble caregiver who's content with his personal goal,

118
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.380
which let's remember is writing textbooks,
albeit magical textbooks,

119
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.550
but still that's surprisingly unassuming for a fantasy adventure hero.

120
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.130
This means that unlike potter,

121
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.340
Newt doesn't possess superpowers magic,

122
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.750
nor is he plagued with self doubt about his abilities.

123
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.710
It's or his place in the magical world

124
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.510
sit down is just commander.
He's a grownup,

125
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.300
already confident in his wizarding skills.

126
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.860
I can poison you even if he remains uncomfortable around others

127
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.440
and I suspect that this point might be another reason why some critics who

128
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.130
weren't so fond of this new wizarding protagonist.

129
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.440
Can I help you,
sir?

130
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.630
I think there's an argument to be made that new exhibits the characteristics of

131
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:19.830
someone on the autism spectrum.
He's awkward in social settings.

132
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.240
He doesn't like being touched.
He feels intense empathy for others,

133
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.920
but has trouble connecting to people and making friends and careful viewers will

134
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:32.340
also notice his a version to direct eye contact.

135
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.890
The films narrative never confirms this hypothesis one way or the other.

136
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.520
Perhaps this is simply how Eddie Redmayne decided to play the character,

137
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.050
but whatever the case,

138
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.430
it's a testament to both the writing and the acting that newts,

139
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.460
social anxieties are not framed in the stereotypical ways we've come to expect

140
00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:53.604
from Hollywood.

141
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.900
Characters like this tend to fall into a few specific archetypes.

142
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.930
There's the tormented genius and brilliant,

143
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:06.310
but in sufferable character who's intelligent to the point of instability for

144
00:10:06.311 --> 00:10:07.300
mental illness,

145
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.520
which is often framed as the price he must pay for his extraordinary talent.

146
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.740
There's the mad scientist or whimsical or bumbling character who's weird.

147
00:10:19.991 --> 00:10:23.650
Eccentricities are perhaps endearing to a degree.

148
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.210
I'm going to read your thoughts,

149
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.100
but are also played for comedy and then there's the Sherlock Holmes archetype.

150
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.270
A character possessing such a superhuman Iq.

151
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.820
You pass me a pen that it leads to callousness

152
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:44.130
and the inability or perhaps on willingness to feel sympathy for other people.

153
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.520
Shut up.
I'm just saying that you were thinking it's annoying.

154
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.430
<v 0>Okay,</v>

155
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:55.430
<v 1>but newt isn't too lost in his own mind or his own eccentricities to care about</v>

156
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.980
or empathize with other people.
In fact,

157
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:03.000
quite the opposite is sensitivity is where he excels

158
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.740
critically.
Fantastic beasts,
doesn't frame newts.

159
00:11:08.741 --> 00:11:13.741
Social anxiety as an obstacle he must ultimately overcome in order to be a true

160
00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:15.044
hero.

161
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.540
The narrative doesn't require him to toughen up or learn to be more outgoing.

162
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.120
Newt doesn't fundamentally have to change his way of being and the people who

163
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:32.121
become his friends are those who interact and engage with him on his terms.

164
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.053
Come on.

165
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.260
New does learn and grow over the course of this adventure,

166
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.070
but it's a subtle,
more interpersonal growth.

167
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.690
Everybody knows newt only kept me around because he learns to make friends and

168
00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:52.020
he learns to trust them.
What did you keep me around?

169
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.220
<v 0>Because I like it</v>

170
00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.600
<v 1>cause yours my friend.</v>

171
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.893
<v 0>Oh</v>

172
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:09.100
<v 1>and establishing these deep human connections is the core of his character</v>

173
00:12:09.101 --> 00:12:09.934
development.

174
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.460
<v 0>It's been,
hasn't it?</v>

175
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.050
<v 1>The ending of fantastic beasts is rather anticlimactic compared to most other</v>

176
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:27.500
action fantasy movies and even compared to most other films in the Harry Potter,

177
00:12:27.501 --> 00:12:27.600
Right

178
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.433
<v 0>Universe</v>

179
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.870
<v 1>as expected,</v>

180
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:35.920
there's a final showdown with a powerful and destructive magical force.

181
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.150
But even here,
newts actions are guided by his empathy.

182
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.770
I'm here to help you.
Great.

183
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:50.020
Not Hey to her rather than besting his foe in an epic,

184
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:55.021
magical duel nude approaches the conflict with an eye for deescalation.

185
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.420
Of course,
in the end,
the malevolent force is vanquished,

186
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.700
but it's not done by newts hand.
Even more surprising.

187
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.320
This triumph over evil isn't shown to be a cause for celebration.

188
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.010
It is instead framed as a melancholy event,

189
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.530
melancholy because our hero's failed to save the monster.

190
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.450
I feel like I might need to say that again in this movie.

191
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:30.720
If feeding the monster is framed as a tragedy because they couldn't save him a

192
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:37.000
fittingly unconventional conclusion to an unconventional Hollywood fantasy

193
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:37.834
production,

194
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.650
it remains to be seen if Warner brothers has the guts to keep newt as the

195
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:49.390
protagonist throughout all five films in the franchise for her park.

196
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.240
J K Rowling has said that new will remain the star,

197
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.400
at least for the next movie in the series,

198
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.920
but within Hollywood there's no doubt enormous pressure to shift the focus to a

199
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:04.270
character who performs a more traditional and expected type of man.

200
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.380
The studio has even hinted at demoting newts role,

201
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.570
and that would be a shame because we need more movies.
That center a gentle,

202
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.630
empathetic version of heroic masculinity.

203
00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.850
