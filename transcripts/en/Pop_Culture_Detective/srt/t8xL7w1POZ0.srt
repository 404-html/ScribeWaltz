1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,650
The 2016 film passengers was advertised
as a high concept science fiction

2
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,520
blockbuster about a romance in space.

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,060
Based on that,
I was excited to see it.

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,600
Unfortunately, the central premise
doesn't make for a very good love story.

5
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,770
In fact, it has much more in
common with a horror film.

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,700
Jim is a passenger, a board, a star ship,

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,080
making the long journey to another
planet when a malfunction wakes him from

8
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:44,290
hibernation too early and where are we?

9
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,390
We are in transit from Earth to homestead
to we will arrive in approximately 90

10
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:51,020
years.
Wow.

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,410
It seems he's destined to live and die
alone on the ship before anyone else

12
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,760
wakes up trapped by his circumstances.

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,290
Jim starts obsessing over another
sleeping passenger named Aurora

14
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,250
intent on pursuing a
romantic relationship.

15
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,580
Jim Sabotage has her hibernation pod
and makes it look like an accident

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,540
from Aurora's perspective.

17
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,910
This is a story about a strange man who
imprisons her alone with him in space

18
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:28,860
forever. This stranger robs
her of her life, her future,

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,540
and her self determination.

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,760
And yet because this movie is
supposed to be a love story,

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,110
how audiences are meant to
feel sympathetic to Jim and
root for the relationship

22
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:43,944
to work out

23
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,140
the films.

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Science fiction setting tends to obscure
the fact that passengers is an example

25
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:56,490
of a very old and deeply
troubling media convention.

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,700
Abduction as romance.

27
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,200
Abduction is romances, immediate trope
where a man kidnaps were in prisons,

28
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:11,020
a woman, and then she eventually
falls in love with him.

29
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,510
Like a lot of storytelling conventions,
abduction as a romance isn't new.

30
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,950
It can be traced all the way back to
ancient literature and it was a favorite

31
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:22,750
plot device in classic Hollywood.
Yeah,

32
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,570
they must

33
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,750
be terribly in love. I want you to make
me angry. I always knew where you were.

34
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:39,180
A nasty, vulgar role. In
some versions of the trope,

35
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,150
men abduct women for the
purpose of finding love.

36
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,290
Courtship I a little more
strenuous than I like it,

37
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,660
but in most cases the woman is kidnapped
for some other reason and the romance

38
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,680
only blossoms after she's forced
to spend time with her. Abductor.

39
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,890
If you try and move our climb off the bed,

40
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,020
I'll know I'll feel it
and I promise you are

41
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,250
the kidnapping or
hostage situation itself.

42
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,640
Maybe short lived waste,

43
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:13,740
sunny and their romance may
not have a happy ending,

44
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,360
but the abductor is always framed
as a decent guy in the end.

45
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,100
It can be a pretty likable guy and I'm
not pointing a gun at somebody I know.

46
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,240
Don't believe me, but it's
true. You've got to trust me.

47
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,440
The plot device is especially popular
with screenwriters because kidnapping

48
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:36,360
scenarios provide a quick and easy
way to bring two unlikely characters

49
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:37,194
together.

50
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,130
May I just say in advance that I am sorry.
Sorry for walks.

51
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,720
Now, if I'm not mistaken, this means you
have to come with me but make no mistake.

52
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:54,190
These are narratives in which men who
violate women's rights and autonomy are

53
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,710
then rewarded with a romantic relationship

54
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,050
who don't like to be pushed any bread
and last June and drug into buses in the

55
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,630
middle of the night.

56
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,780
Abduction is romance can be
found in all kinds of media

57
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,080
including romance films and
comedies. Well, I'm asking you,

58
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,040
I can't believe this is happening.
This is not a joke anymore.

59
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:23,130
I'm thinking that flute called
kidnapping if you want to be rude.

60
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,760
And even in classic musicals like
seven brides for seven brothers.

61
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,870
Oh,
they acted angry and annoyed,

62
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,960
but secretly they was all her joy
by Oh that when corral and yours,

63
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,540
but it's especially popular
in action adventures, genres,

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis
Star in three separate movies each where

65
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,410
they have romantic relationships
with the women they've kidnapped.

66
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,480
Yeah,

67
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,600
we see this with Swarts and niggers
characters in the running man.

68
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,130
I break your neck like a chicken

69
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,680
and then again in commando getting the
call and then again to his own wife.

70
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,800
In true lies,

71
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,570
Bruce Willis has characters hold their
love interests hostage and bandits in the

72
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,110
critically acclaimed film,

73
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:21,040
12 monkeys and then more recently in red

74
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,250
audiences are meant to view the danger
that these men pose has an essential part

75
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:32,620
of what makes them
exciting and attractive.

76
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,310
These are men of action.

77
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,180
They take control and take
what they want and in the car

78
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,350
with violence if necessary.

79
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,980
Now you'll notice that with
very few exceptions, these
kidnappers are white men.

80
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,000
Ho mainstream western audiences tend to
give violent white guys the benefit of

81
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:06,620
the doubt to keep your hands high Pothier
while rarely extending that same level

82
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:10,970
of sympathy to men of color. In similar
situations, which I know everybody

83
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,880
on the floor don't kill me,

84
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,840
like most media tropes,
there are variations on the theme.

85
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,090
There's the accidental kidnapping that
later becomes a real one. Keep your head,

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,460
turn your legs all the time.

87
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,630
There's the clueless criminal
who doesn't know what he's doing.

88
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,640
You're the worst kidnapper I've ever met.

89
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm trying to do my best it under
really difficult circumstances,

90
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,660
and then there's the Hitman
who falls for his mark.

91
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,410
But the underlying pattern in all of
these abduction as romance narratives

92
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,090
revolves around men exercising
complete control over women.

93
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,410
Come on please.

94
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,100
A theme that's reinforced by the inclusion
of scenes where I'm man forcibly puts

95
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,620
an otherwise independent
woman in her place.

96
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:07,880
I learned a long time ago,

97
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:11,120
my lady never trust a mountain
catch when she stops snowing.

98
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,920
Never Trust a woman when
your back is turned.

99
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,190
Indeed the abducted women are rarely
portrayed as passive. Damsels.

100
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,490
Are you picking me for a ride?

101
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,180
You're not going to move and you're going
to keep your trap shut or I'll let you

102
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,370
have cheap.

103
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,770
I always thought the
day you've got a stupid,

104
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,800
even though these women are
written to be Feisty, oh,

105
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,590
they're often framed as being a little
too feisty for their own good to be a

106
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,080
little too feisty for your own good,

107
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,970
which provides our kidnapper
the opportunity to assert
his power and control.

108
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:48,611
Am I go sound?

109
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:52,470
Do you understand by
aggressively silencing her
by anyone that likes the food

110
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:56,970
when they are not alone? No. Oh. Oh.

111
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,070
Audiences are treated the scene after
scene fetishizing the domination and

112
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:03,330
disempowerment of women.

113
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,410
If she tries to turn the
tables on her abductor,

114
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,650
he remains unfazed and her attempts
to intimidate him don't work.

115
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,340
Okay.

116
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,540
In some cases, when he reasserts
his control by disarming her,

117
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,150
it's framed as an act of seduction.

118
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,300
No kidnapping and false imprisonment
are almost universally understood to be

119
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:31,900
reprehensible crimes.
And because of that,

120
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,930
abduction is widely regarded as an act
of villainy and definitely not something

121
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,040
the good guy would do.

122
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,000
This means that screenwriters need to
find some way to make the kidnapper into a

123
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,920
sympathetic character. Hey, okay.

124
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,250
One way this is done is by giving the
abductor a moment of basic human decency.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,230
It can be as simple as offering his
hostage something to eat or drink, drink,

126
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,860
or maybe allowing her
to go to the bathroom.

127
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,280
I need a little help or not
sexually assaulting her.

128
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,010
We tell you something,
even though I haven't a bit lately,

129
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,720
I'm gonna Force myself on. You. Never
done that in my life. I'm not. No kidding.

130
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:21,910
Come Howard from the calm of just
trying to explain to you that there's no

131
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,890
sexual motives for my actions.

132
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,750
That's an impressively low bar for men
when it comes to being seen as a nice

133
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,810
guy. You seem like a nice guy.
You're not like the others.

134
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,650
You have to do what's right for you.
Another way.

135
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:40,651
The abductor is reframed as heroic is
by juxtaposing his violence against the

136
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:43,330
actions of even more violent men.

137
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,190
Other the bad guys.
Worse guys hold my neck.

138
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,100
Writers also attempt to
justify the kidnapping itself
by framing it as necessary.

139
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,440
No, no problem with it either as
something done for the greater good,

140
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,990
like saving the world or is something
done for the victims owned good,

141
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,860
usually saving her life in some way.
Just let me go

142
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,090
safe not safe.

143
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,180
That variation is so common that there's
a whole sub category of movies in which

144
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,730
a heroic rescue doubles as a kidnapping.

145
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,190
To illustrate how these rescue
slash kidnapping scenarios work,

146
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,020
let's analyze the brief abduction from
the original 1984 terminator movie.

147
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,720
Kyle Reese travels back in time and
save Sarah Connor from the terminator,

148
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,750
but during the getaway, he makes it
aggressively clear that his help is not

149
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,940
optional.
Do exactly what I say exactly.

150
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:51,990
I don't move unless I say, don't
make a sound in this. I say,

151
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,450
do you understand?
Do you understand?

152
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,990
Please do.
You told her.

153
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,230
Notice that in stories like this,
the man typically holds all the cards.

154
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,830
He alone understands the true danger
that she's in and he alone knows how to

155
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:13,790
survive. Then you are from
the future too. Is that right?

156
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,673
Right.

157
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,040
The insidious thing about scenes like
this one is that they're written to twist

158
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:24,270
a man's abusive behavior
into a heroic act of love.

159
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,430
Just listen.

160
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,170
Understand that terminator is out there
and it absolutely will not stop ever

161
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,580
chill.
You are dead.

162
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,350
The narrative is specifically designed
so that we as the audience will view

163
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:47,300
Kyle's aggression towards Sarah as
both a reasonable and necessary.

164
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,950
Can you stop it? The
storytelling trick here, okay.

165
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,900
To set up an elaborate scenario in
which a woman's perfectly reasonable and

166
00:11:55,901 --> 00:12:00,901
rational resistance to male violence seems
like a naive mistake and that framing

167
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,160
is not accidental.

168
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,550
It's a specific kind of male fantasy
where a man taking away a woman's freedom

169
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:13,150
and fundamental rights. He was presented
as something done for her own good,

170
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,860
which results in situations where she
becomes dependent on her abductor for

171
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:23,300
survival. Just so you understand
right now out there on your own.

172
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:25,880
Your life expectancy is like with me,

173
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,650
without me here with me,
without me, with me, without

174
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,110
one of the worst examples of this.

175
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,120
Abduction for her own good framing can
be found in the movie version of V for

176
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:40,954
Victor Data.

177
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,110
Our hero kidnaps Evy,

178
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,820
makes her believe that she's been caught
by the fascist government and proceeds

179
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:54,960
to torture her mercilessly.
It's whenever you want,

180
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,960
just tell us where he is.

181
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,990
These abhorring actions are framed as
necessary because it's only through being

182
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:09,710
tortured for days on end that
Evie learns how to be strong.

183
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,320
Not only does she forgive
him for torturing her,

184
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,390
she thanks him for it and then the to
go on to share a series of romantic

185
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:21,224
moments.

186
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,100
I always sample a bottle
of wine before I buy it.

187
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,270
Let's have a sip if
you're worth taking along.

188
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,120
Let's not mince words here.
Abduction as romance is an abuse trip.

189
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,580
All of the male characters that we've
been discussing engage in what domestic

190
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:44,980
violence prevention organizations
describe as red flag behaviors cures.

191
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,900
So I think it's instructive to quickly
go over a few of them in detail.

192
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,360
Physical force abusers will resort
to the use of force strand conflicts.

193
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,710
This can include restraining
or holding down their partner.

194
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,230
These actions are often accompanied
by demands that the victim

195
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,543
shut your mouth.

196
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Threats of violence abusers will threaten
their partners with violence as a

197
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:22,641
means of coercion rock and bring it down
on your head so hard that a substance

198
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:28,210
resembling guacamole is going to come
out of your ears. Controlling behavior.

199
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,070
Abusers will attempt to control or
restrict their partner's movements and to

200
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:37,290
make decisions for them. Let's go now.

201
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,660
This is usually done under
the guise of protection

202
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,190
and finally the one that's
most central to the abduction.

203
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:50,191
As Romance trope isolation abusers will
try to isolate the victim from friends,

204
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,930
family,
or even the outside world.

205
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,170
This often includes restricting
the use of communication devices.

206
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,510
Each of these actions is considered a
red flag for an abusive relationship.

207
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,730
And most of the male characters
in abduction as romance
movies check off several

208
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:11,660
of these boxes.

209
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,580
Even the less explicitly violent
abductors like Jim from passengers still

210
00:15:24,581 --> 00:15:26,170
isolate and control their vision.

211
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,093
Dennis,

212
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,240
regardless of the
intentions of the writers,

213
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,720
these narratives end up both excusing
and romanticizing the violent behavior of

214
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:43,290
abusive men.

215
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,950
No discussion of abduction as romance
would be complete without mention of

216
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:54,510
beauty and the beast, especially the
two enormously popular Disney movies,

217
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,660
both of which include a
version of this trope.

218
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:03,570
The beast holds the life of Belle's
father in his hands and in order to save

219
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:04,404
him,

220
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,720
Doug Bell trades away her own freedom
and agree is to be in prison forever in

221
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:10,620
the beast's castle.

222
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,080
Now pop criticism of beauty and the
beast often focuses on something called

223
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:17,040
Stockholm syndrome,

224
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,660
which is a psychological phenomenon
where in a kidnapping victim comes to

225
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:24,510
sympathize with their kidnapper.
However,

226
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:27,840
it's not part of how I'm defining
the abduction as romance trope.

227
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,360
And that's because of focus on Stockholm
Syndrome tends to shift the blame away

228
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,640
from the perpetrator and onto the victim,

229
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,840
which then works to undermine the
female character by implying she's been

230
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:40,674
brainwashed.

231
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,970
As I mentioned before,

232
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:49,080
many of the abducted or imprisoned women
in these movies are actually shown to

233
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:52,800
be quite brave, especially
given their perilous situations.

234
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,040
Many of them tried to
escape and some succeed,

235
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,470
but regardless the victim and her
motivations are not the problem with this

236
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:02,304
trope.

237
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,230
The problem stems entirely from
the abductor and his actions.

238
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,620
After all, it's the beast who in
prisons, Bell isolates her verbally,

239
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:14,454
berates her

240
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,320
and even for bids her from eating at month

241
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,770
I tall.

242
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,350
Despite all of this abusive behavior,

243
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,420
the beast is still framed
as a misunderstood nice guy
and he still gets the girl

244
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:39,060
in the end.
Story is like this,

245
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:43,230
carry with them some insidious
messages about men and masculinity.

246
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,480
Chief among them is the idea that abusive
men just need to meet the right woman,

247
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,050
someone so special that the promise of
her love will magically cure him of his

248
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,730
violent ways and make him a better person.

249
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,410
Now it is possible to read these stories
as being about the forgiveness and

250
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:07,040
redemption of troubled men,
which in some ways they are.

251
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,710
Unfortunately,

252
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,690
these redemption arks play out in
ways that end up reinforcing some very

253
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:16,940
pernicious myths about domestic abuse.

254
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,310
Abusive men don't
suddenly change overnight,

255
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,510
especially not after a lifetime of it

256
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,403
being a dick.

257
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,880
Men with a history of violent
behavior don't spare their loved ones.

258
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,530
On the contrary,

259
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,890
domestic violence statistics show that
intimate partners and family members bear

260
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:44,370
the brunt of their tanks.
In the movies.

261
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:49,290
We're usually expected to assume that
these abduction romances we'll end happily

262
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,124
ever after.

263
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:51,870
Yeah,

264
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,920
but in the real world,

265
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,670
love affairs like this would likely
lead to abusive relationships.

266
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,460
This is because the strongest predictor
of domestic violence is previous acts of

267
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:07,170
abuse.
In fact,

268
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,350
men with a history of committing violence
against women are 13 times more likely

269
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,700
to repeat that behavior in the future.

270
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,020
Psychologists refer to these patterns of
repeat behavior as the cycle of abuse.

271
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,140
Once an abusive episodes stops,

272
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,940
it's often followed by a honeymoon phase
where the abuser will show remorse,

273
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,540
promise not to do it again,
and then acting kind,

274
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:37,320
even loving ways for a while at least.

275
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,390
But inevitably that will be followed
by a tension building phase,

276
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,720
which then culminates in
another abusive episode.

277
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,910
She'll keep you more time.

278
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,840
I show keep you on
responding to my patient.

279
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,030
Your hatred will kill Linda
for that day.

280
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,730
Dawns folk shows

281
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,920
and the cycle continues.

282
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,270
The first step in breaking the cycle is
often for the survivor to get away from

283
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:14,280
the abuser.
Now,

284
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,570
it is possible for violent men to
change their pattern of behavior,

285
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,110
although it's an extremely difficult
process requiring years of therapy,

286
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,330
but that's rarely how
it happens in Hollywood.

287
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,150
In the movies we've been talking about,

288
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,310
abusive men are miraculously
transformed by finding true love

289
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,400
and they gain forgiveness for their
crimes through a single act of heroism.

290
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,890
This means they're never really held
accountable for the harm they've inflicted

291
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:47,724
on.

292
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,570
Okay.

293
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,130
Real redemption requires taking
responsibility for your actions.

294
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,350
It requires doing the slow,

295
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,860
often painful work of self transformation.

296
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,130
The bottom line is it's not possible
to fix violent men by loving them in

297
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,450
exactly the right way,

298
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,550
but that's the idea at the heart
of the abduction is romance trope.

299
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,780
It's the kind of twisted Hollywood logic
that can lead people of all genders to

300
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:20,460
remain in abusive relationship.

301
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,360
Yeah.

302
