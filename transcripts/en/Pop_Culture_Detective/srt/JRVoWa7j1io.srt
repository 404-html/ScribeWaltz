1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,890
Welcome to open access.
This is our third is there it is.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,600
This is our third annual open access
week celebration and we have a lot of

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:13,730
exciting things that we're going to
present this week. Lots of events. Uh,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,320
we can have a keynote address today.
Uh,

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,580
that's going to be followed up by hands
on workshop about mashups skills from

6
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:23,220
the renowned Donald duck meets Glenn Beck,

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,080
creator to a panel of experts
about digital textbooks
as digital technology and

8
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:30,990
content. Deliberate questions
about access, copyright,

9
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:33,480
and fair use continue
to come to the surface.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,560
This week's events offer
lots of opportunities to
explore these new areas of

11
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:41,610
creativity, scholarship and technology
and how they're all coming together.

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,780
Let me give you a little preview
of the week to come on Monday.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,700
Today we have hacking pop culture with
remix video by John and Macintosh,

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,710
our keynote speaker for the week.
Tuesday, Rick remixed manifesto,

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,470

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,470

17
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:06,780
Jonathan McIntosh, which will be in room

18
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,430
Wednesday, free and open digital textbooks
perspectives on impossible future.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,490
That would be a panel discussion and
room 1150 at 3:00 PM and on Thursday or

20
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,970
last event we'll be publishing smart how
to make your article visible. Room one

21
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:25,971
thousand9@twopmandifyouwanttogobackandlookatanyofthissoyoucanfinditonourmarriottlibrarydotwordpress.com

22
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,780
site.
I know you all memorize that really fast.

23
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:35,190
So you've got that and there'll be four
our staff announcements and continuing

24
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:37,740
and flash so you can figure out when
you're supposed to come to what end.

25
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:41,760
You're welcome to come to all of these
events this week. So that introduction,

26
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,370
let me turn it over to rob.

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,350
Gail was assistant professor of new
media and the Department of Communication

28
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:47,760
who will introduce our speaker today.

29
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,930
Yes, I'm Rob [inaudible] and the
Department of Communication. Um,

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,290
before I get started,
like to thank Joyce Analysis and Laurie,

31
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,540
the folks in library for making this
possible and also like to thank Bob Avery

32
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,430
who's the chair of the Department of
Communication for helping sponsor, uh,

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,220
Jonathan bringing your manner and those,
speaking of Jonathan Mackintosh,

34
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,230
he's a remix artist,
a self proclaimed pop culture hacker.

35
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,280
And if, I guess if you pressed me
wanting me to explain what that means,

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,370
I think of culture is something
about day to day life.

37
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:28,150
It's the life that we lead. It's kind
of our assumptions, it's what drives us.

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,110
And so a lot of what we get about
day to day life comes from the media.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,280
And therefore if we want to think about
new messages that we want to think about

40
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,300
critiquing our culture, we have to tear
apart media. We have to critique it,

41
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,040
mash it up, dude, interesting
remix things. And that's
exactly what Jonathan does.

42
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,310
He's got a lot of uh,
excellent work out there.

43
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:52,120
I want to highlight a couple
of my favorites. Uh, his video,

44
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:56,950
Buffy versus Edward twilight remixed is
a masterpiece that in his word serves as

45
00:02:56,951 --> 00:03:01,780
a metaphor for the ongoing battle between
opposing visions of gender roles in

46
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:06,130
the 21st century. It mixes Buffy the
vampire slayer of course with twilight.

47
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,140
And if I'm not mistaken,

48
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:12,390
there's a little bit of Harry Potter
in there just to touch yeah. And, uh,

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
in the video Edwards
obsessive stalking behavior,

50
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,080
which apparently is
acceptable and twilight, uh,

51
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,130
grates against and is over ultimately
overcome by the tenacious and self assured

52
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:28,330
Buffy, you know, says Buffy being
stocked isn't really a turn on for girls.

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,500
Buffy ultimately has enough spoiler alert,
cover yours if you must.

54
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,210
Buffy sleighs Edward

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,280
in right wing radio duck Macintosh uses
depression-era Donald Duck cartoons to

56
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,050
try to understand the popularity
of shock jock Glenn Beck,

57
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,590
especially in our current alien
or economy. Donald Duck could,

58
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:52,060
cannot find a job and has
his home foreclosed on
wonders why he's in such dire

59
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:57,040
economic straits. Then on the
radio, we hear three, two, one beck,

60
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,040
Glenn Beck promises to give
Donald all the answers,

61
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:04,330
but only after he shows out the money
for insider extreme. In the end,

62
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:08,770
Donald gets disillusioned
and he eventually overcomes
Beck's racist in divisive

63
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,990
rhetoric.
First part,

64
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:14,740
Glenn Beck has responded to this video
calling a and I think we'll see an

65
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,990
example of that calling
McIntosh's work quote,

66
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:21,860
incredible propaganda if we
follow Glenn Beck's logic. Uh,

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,430
what's your in store for today is a,

68
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,780
a talk from a long haired anti-American
communist Pinko hippie radical with

69
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:33,640
funding from socialists like Obama or
possibly acorn or maybe Mexican narco

70
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:37,600
terrorists. I'm not entirely
sure. Listen, well, dear audience,

71
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,060
that is if you think
the terrorists should,

72
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:44,080
when you like communism and
you hate America, um, no.

73
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,780
In all seriousness,
Jonathan Macintosh is a true artist.

74
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:49,570
He's keyed on what art
can be in the digital age.

75
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,400
Art can critique, art can
inspire, can drive thought.

76
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,740
It can expose the best
and worst of our culture.

77
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,730
You can bring together digital objects
and mash them together to build metaphors

78
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:03,820
and ideas.
Art Can change the world for the better.

79
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,000
Please join me in welcoming
Jonathan McIntosh.

80
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,910
Uh, thank you everyone. Is My
microphone on? Is it working? Um,

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,870
so that was, uh, that was
basically my whole, my whole
talk. I can just go home now.

82
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,140
Um, uh, so this is an html five web page.

83
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,630
Um, what you can find online,
uh, after the talk. Uh,

84
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,600
but it's also a presentation.
You do need the latest,

85
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,210
uh, Firefox or chrome browsers.
It's sort of we'll work in safari,

86
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:47,090
but only if you have like
5.1 0.1. Um, so let me just

87
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,990
start here. Um, like you said, I'm a pop

88
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,120
hold your hacker and to talk about
what that means in a little bit. Um,

89
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,010
I'm also not going to do
a big introduction because
I wanted, have somebody

90
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,810
else do that via video
in a second. Um, but, uh,

91
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:06,620
this is me so you can follow me
on Twitter. It's radical bites.

92
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,670
The hashtag that I'm going to
use for just this room here, um,

93
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,700
is Hashtag remix Utah. If you want to, um,

94
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,760
participate in the larger
discussion around open access week,

95
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:18,590
you can use Hashtag,
uh,

96
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,240
oh a week and that will sort of link you
into a larger conversation on Twitter.

97
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,680
Um, my youtube channel, it was rebellious
pixels and I have two websites.

98
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:31,040
One of them is a rebellious pickles.com.
That's where all my,

99
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,950
my video work and writing is.
Um,

100
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,860
and then I also blog at a website
called political remix, next video,

101
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,610
which is where we take,
um, we take I think,

102
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:45,590
interesting examples of politically
oriented video from around around the web

103
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:47,450
that,
that mashup other content.

104
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,060
And then we sort of write
about it and blog about it. Um,

105
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,420
it started as sort of an archiving
project, um, and it's still largely that,

106
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:56,300
but there's sort of people
engaging with it as well. Um,

107
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,510
and want to say political for this talk.
I'm,

108
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,090
I don't necessarily mean
government or elections, uh,

109
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,130
that sort of big p politics. Um, but I,

110
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:09,950
I actually mean it in a much broader
sense and that is to include race and

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,560
sexuality, gender, economy,
uh, as well as policy.

112
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,810
Um, so that's sort of a
wide ranging, a sampling of,

113
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:23,300
of I think some of the best a
remix videos on the web that,

114
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,810
that deal with remixing,

115
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,160
not just the footage but actually
we mixing the message of,

116
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:31,310
of mass media often too. So, um,

117
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,630
so start with, um, I like to start
with this first quote here. Uh,

118
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,930
the universe is made of
stories not of atoms.

119
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,010
What that means to me is that

120
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,270
the way that we sort of
understand our world,

121
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
the way that we understand
our place in it,

122
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,700
the way that we understand
the relationships between
people and institutions, uh,

123
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,770
between people in governments, between
people in corporations is often, um,

124
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,530
to the stories were told and
the stories we tell, right? Um,

125
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,090
these narratives come in many forms.
Uh,

126
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,690
and often in today's Day and age,
uh,

127
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,370
those narratives, the popular narratives
are, are inside of popular culture, right?

128
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,180
So that's TV, that's movies, that's um,

129
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,000
that is music videos,
that's mainstream news. Um,

130
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,430
and that's where these sort of narratives
are told and then retold a and then

131
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,410
changed and transformed. Um, uh,

132
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,310
now that space, that pop culture
space is of course owned by a very,

133
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:44,120
very small owned and controlled by
a very, very small group of, of,

134
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:49,100
of corporate interests. And one of
the things that means is that the, uh,

135
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,800
majority of, of, of these stories
that we are engaging with have a very,

136
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,430
I think limiting and
limited set of values,

137
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,960
a set of myths,

138
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,190
a set of serve social norms
that they present to us, right?

139
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,900
It's actually a very narrow set
of ideas on race, on gender,

140
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,940
on, on economics, on sexuality. Right? Um,

141
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,560
and so for many people,
they don't get,

142
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,460
they don't get to see themselves
reflected or their lives reflected in mass

143
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,020
media to have to a very large degree.

144
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,970
And so what people have done for the
past several decades actually is they've

145
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:33,370
taken those pop culture stories,
whether it be a TV show or the news, uh,

146
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,170
and they have remixed them or change
them in some way to make them better

147
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:41,100
represent or better reflect where they're
coming from because they might not be,

148
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,290
uh,
they might not be represented.

149
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,740
One of my favorite examples of this
is star Trek, uh, which is, uh,

150
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,440
which is a very popular, uh, uh,
set of stories in our culture,

151
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,890
especially in, in, in the
West. Um, and one of the,

152
00:09:55,891 --> 00:10:00,180
one of the striking things about it is
that there have been a, I think, five,

153
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:04,230
six television series now. Um, some
of them lasting seven years each.

154
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,030
There've been, um, uh, over
a dozen films and not, not,

155
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:11,130
there's not one queer characters,
not one gay character,

156
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,190
major character in that
entire thing. So, um,

157
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,270
so fans of star trek might say,
you know, I really liked star trek,

158
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,170
but it's missing something, right?
It's actually missing quite a,

159
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:21,961
quite a few things.

160
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:25,190
And so people will take fanfiction and
they will rewrite it and they'll, they'll,

161
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,710
they'll add things to that
narrative story that's missing.

162
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,850
So that's just one example. Um, so, uh,

163
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,280
how do people participate in this,
in this,

164
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,190
in this, uh, culture, right?
In this media culture. Uh,

165
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:44,850
and one of the ways they do that is,
is that they remix this quote. Uh,

166
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,320
I actually love this quote,
this quote is, he is from, uh,

167
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,690
the screenwriter for rebel,
rebel without a cause. Um,

168
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:56,910
any film is at the same time and
expression of a writer and that it's an

169
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,580
offering to the audience to
create their own film. Now,

170
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,240
when rebel without a cause came out,
he didn't actually mean this literally.

171
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,160
Uh, but with technology today,
it can be taken literally.

172
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:12,090
And I do take it literally,
you can literally remake the film.

173
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,940
You can literally rewrite the
film. Um, and that is I think,

174
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:21,240
what many mixers are doing.
Um,

175
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,700
and then lastly, uh, I talk about
myself as a pop culture hacker

176
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,410
and there's some confusion about
this word, uh, hacking. Um,

177
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,890
it often sort of brings to
mind a not so nice things. Um,

178
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,880
but I,
I actually liked this definition.

179
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:44,430
This is temperate love with the
chaos computer club in Germany.

180
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,750
And he says a hat that the
hacker approaches the world
breaks it apart to better

181
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:53,010
understand how it works in order to figure
out what can be done with it. Right.

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,730
Um, and that's, that's
the way that hackers as a,

183
00:11:56,731 --> 00:12:00,210
as a subculture have
traditionally approached things.
They have, they have, um,

184
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,630
approached a piece of piece of technology
or computer code, and then they,

185
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:07,240
if they have said, I want to
know how this works. Right?

186
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:10,630
So they take it apart and then
they, then they say, well, you know,

187
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,460
because it's built like this,

188
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,700
it means that it can do these 10 things
that apple or Samsung didn't want you to

189
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:22,480
do with it. Um, but it's possible. And
so with what they'll do is they'll make,

190
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,910
they'll push the technology to its limits,
right?

191
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:29,080
They'll see what else can be done with
it. Um, and so in that, in that sentence,

192
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,810
it's a, it's a deconstruction and
then it's a reconstruction. Right? Um,

193
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,670
and that's sort of what I do when I
approached television or the movies.

194
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,770
Uh,

195
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,770
I think of it in terms of here's this
thing that I'm given on this face value,

196
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,060
um, uh, story, uh, um, a narrative,

197
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,040
a visual representation,
and I can take it apart.

198
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
I can see how it works.
You know, I can literally,

199
00:12:55,901 --> 00:13:00,730
I can literally take it apart as well
as, as, um, as, as sort of deconstructed,

200
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,440
right? Find out what the embedded
myths are, find out what the, um,

201
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,000
what the,
uh,

202
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,470
the embedded messages might be buying it
with the value system of that piece of

203
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:16,280
media is. Um, and then I can, once I have
it broken down into its components, I can,

204
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,630
I can then say, okay, well, because
it works like this because these are,

205
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:22,570
this is the way that it's built. This
is what drives this, this narrative.

206
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,810
I can put it back together in a
different way. I can transform it, right.

207
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,860
And tell a different story
with these parts. Um,

208
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,240
and so that's what ha pop culture
hacking means to me. I mean,

209
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,610
I use that because I think it's a,

210
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:40,611
it's actually a little bit
more descriptive a of a
term then remix or Mashup.

211
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,700
Um, I use those terms as well. Uh,
and I think that those, those, uh,

212
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,840
that work is very important. Um, and
often fantastic. And in terms of,

213
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,190
of adding to a larger debate.
But, um, it's not just about,

214
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:58,030
often the stuff that I find most
interesting and most meaningful and most

215
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:01,060
poignant is not just about taking two
things and sticking them together and to

216
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,130
see what happens.
Sometimes it is that,

217
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,140
but often there's a lot of
thought that goes into it.

218
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:06,710
It's a very intentional process of,

219
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,270
of seeing what it is that's in
the meaning of this message,

220
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:13,090
in this piece of media and what's the
meaning of this message in this piece of

221
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:17,080
media? And then putting them together,
right. Um, uh, removing certain parts,

222
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:19,180
adding certain parts to set,
say something different.

223
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,510
And I think that that actually is
more than just sort of sticking things

224
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:27,730
together to see what happens.
Um, and incidentally,

225
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:32,170
I think that most people who do remix
work actually do a lot more of that

226
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,680
intentional and careful
analytical process.

227
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,360
It's not just taking things as
sticking them together. Um, so,

228
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,090
um, I thought that I was show
you an example of this. Uh,

229
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,380
using my own work. I made this video, um,

230
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,760
right wing radio duck. Uh, it
took about three months. Um,

231
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,180
it's about seven minutes long.
So it's,

232
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,580
it's the same length as
most Disney cartoons,

233
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,160
a classic era cartoons.
Um,

234
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,830
it uses over 50 Donald duck cartoons,
um,

235
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,050
as well as some Mickey mouse and some
goofy that are thrown in there. Um,

236
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,420
it also uses,
uh,

237
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,600
about about 50 episodes of Glen
Beck's radio and TV show. Um,

238
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,780
cut up. Uh, so this is, this
is the version on Youtube,

239
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:23,180
but I'm not going to show you a
different version of this. Um,

240
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:27,680
it's actually the same video,
but, um, it's html five.

241
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,420
And with html five video
becomes an element, uh, in a,

242
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,480
in a web page that can interact
with data. Uh, and so, uh,

243
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:41,380
I find that personally very geeky
and fascinating. Um, so, uh,

244
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,380
the way that that this,

245
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:46,100
this demo works is that you've got the
video playing as an html five video.

246
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,820
What that means is that the video element
and the timecode of that element can

247
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:52,520
be, uh, can be,

248
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,730
can trigger events in this
case is javascript events.

249
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,050
So what I've done is I've inputted,
I've input all of the footage that I used,

250
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:03,140
all of the episodes of, of
uh, of the classic cartoons,

251
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:07,210
all of the episodes of Glenn Beck Show,
um, as well as some footnotes that,

252
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,550
that I have that I was using in
the creation of this process. Uh,

253
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:15,500
and then some Wikipedia articles that
deal with the specific topic that I was

254
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:19,930
trying to get at, right? So it's adding
this sort of layer of metadata on top of,

255
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,260
of, of, of a piece of
video. Um, uh, incidentally,

256
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,630
the red text are links.

257
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,460
So if you want to see either the Donald
Duck cartoon or the Glenn Beck episode

258
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,480
in its original context,

259
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:35,690
you can click on that and you'll take
it to the original source so you can see

260
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:37,940
it. I'm so sorry. I'm
going to show you this.

261
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,020
Yeah. And this is an html five web page
using the video tag, which is a new,

262
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,940
any tag to the village of you
who have already seen this.

263
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,960
You can then watch the, uh, the
metadata that's dynamically appearing.

264
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:58,540
For those of you who haven't seen it, then
you can ignore the metadata or try to,

265
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,374
it's a little bit,

266
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,693
oh,

267
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,800
[inaudible].

268
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,400
Do you feel like you're working harder
and harder these days just to stay

269
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:34,120
financially afloat while fat
cats get richer and richer?

270
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,550
It's not just a feeling
and you're not alone.

271
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,250
The income gap between the
rich and poor in America,

272
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:43,660
is that an eight year high as the
largest differential since the period

273
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,890
immediately proceeding.

274
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,320
Gotcha.
Labs

275
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,970
are getting more while the have
nots are getting less. Meanwhile,

276
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,720
government isn't helping
decades of rising inequality.

277
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,893
Yeah.

278
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,770
Slap Blah, blah, blah.

279
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,263
Oh,

280
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,420
well, I'm going to duck
that beer right out of job.

281
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,973
Gotcha.

282
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,510
Hey.
Wow.

283
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,003
Wow.

284
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,300
Great. Welcome to the program.
My name is Glenn Beck.

285
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,420
The bad news is just multiplying.
Our economy is tanking.

286
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:36,460
It doesn't show signs of
improving their people.

287
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:41,110
Losing jobs are government responds to
the problems with bailouts and when you

288
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:42,430
call them up and say,
what are you doing?

289
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,320
You don't get any response
or not listening to you.

290
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,840
Wall Street owns our government.
What did we get here?

291
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,440
I think a lot of people feel like they're
alone and they just want to give up.

292
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,380
Wow. Wow. I love my country.

293
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,600
It is the shining example of a place
where people work together in peace and

294
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:06,190
friendship and worship God and
make things better together. Well,

295
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:10,620
the idea that built America are
being lost and perverted. Wow.

296
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,940
Wow.
Ask yourself this one question.

297
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
How many Marxist Communist anticapitalist
do you have around you on a daily

298
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,270
basis?

299
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,103
Yup.

300
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,320
The truth is that you are
the defender of liberty.

301
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,720
Our situation is bad.
There are Nazis in America,

302
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,610
Nazis and communists.

303
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,060
You have to think like a German June,
1934

304
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,130
the higher higher.

305
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:07,731
There he is,

306
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:12,731
eight perfect storm formulating and it
is here we are entering a dangerous and

307
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:17,330
scary time. America, the country
will be washed with blood.

308
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,570
These people don't mess around.

309
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,070
They are taking you to a place
to be slaughtered. Death camp.

310
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,050
What planet am I landed on?
It's like the damn planet of the apes.

311
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,280
Did I slip through a worm hole in the
middle of the night and this looks like an

312
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:38,630
error. We're in a dark, dark place.
We've got some dark dudes coming our way.

313
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:43,120
Black Panthers, acorn reparation,
welfare. Jeremiah writes,

314
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,580
jumps on my himself. Alcaide ran
Islamic Jihad lists, Venice, Venezuelan,

315
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:52,340
immigration, Mexicans, refugees,
Hispanic, South America, legal, alien,

316
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:55,220
Mexico, Shiny. Every one is coming.

317
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:01,310
He enemy is not only in the
gates there inside the house

318
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,720
as atmos come up, Leon
pestle. Oh, La Mexican.

319
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:13,610
Erica.
It's like a pack of wild clue.

320
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:16,400
Joe's ripping up the flesh
of the American people,

321
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,980
ruff, ruff, drug lords,

322
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,320
illegal aliens,
Mexico.

323
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,210
They're going to start
getting more and more violent.

324
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,240
We had been tossed into boiling water.

325
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,810
These people are cannibalizing
from Hannibal Lecter. Zinging us.

326
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,440
That's what Barack Obama is
doing to the American people.

327
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,640
I'm hoping the guy with horns
doesn't actually show up.

328
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,120
Everything is about to
change to the extreme,

329
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,010
the insider extreme. We invite
you to join up before 995 a month.

330
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,440
It's going to explain
everything that is going on.

331
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,600
Nope.
Hmm.

332
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,013
Hi.

333
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,890
Yes. Insider extreme is up
and on. Hello? Yes. Sick,

334
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:37,910
twisted freak, and welcome to
the extremists. Who are you?

335
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,820
Why not? Why isn't that a name
of some stupid Disney curt,

336
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,930
you're going to ask any question.

337
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,890
Oh, sucks to be you, doesn't it?

338
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,420
When you bought a house,
you bet that you could pay it,

339
00:23:56,421 --> 00:24:01,400
that nothing would happen. It
happened. You lost, move on.

340
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,920
Boohoo cry me a river. Hey, I
got an idea. Listen to this.

341
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,540
Get a job,

342
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,520
Lazy Slob that refuses to get
off the couch and get a job.

343
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,950
[inaudible]

344
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,850
um, thank you. Uh,

345
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,560
so what I like about a five is it
allows you, it allows me as a, as a,

346
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:03,210
as a filmmaker,
as a remix artist,

347
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,200
to present a very detailed
set of my sort of,

348
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,370
of notes about my process.
Um,

349
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,890
it also allows you to connect back to the
original sources, right? So one of the,

350
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:17,880
one of the principles of fair use, which
I can go over very quickly in a minute,

351
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,430
um, that I always advocate is to
cite your sources, right? So in the,

352
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:24,990
in the same way that you would
quote from, uh, from text, uh,

353
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:29,220
if you're quoting from video
to make a remix, you should
cite that. Um, and so, uh,

354
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:33,480
occasionally on, on, on Youtube or
on Vimeo, you'll see people who have,

355
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:36,870
who have made a remix and they've tried
to cover up that fact because they think

356
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:40,350
that it's maybe the logo that we'll get
them in trouble. So if it's CNN though,

357
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,710
I'll try to cover up the logo or
boiler the logo. Um, but actually, uh,

358
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,920
what I ever pay people to do is I say, you
know, leave that and, and say, you know,

359
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,010
where you got it from, um, what episode it
is. Because one, you're citing a source,

360
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:56,620
you're saying, I'm using this,
it's, it's fair use. Uh, and, uh,

361
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,150
if other people are, the remixers
are people who are watching your, uh,

362
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,650
your video interest in the topic,

363
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,410
they can go there and find and
look at those original sources. Um,

364
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,920
and so this is just sort of, is a way
for me to, to present those upfront.

365
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,350
And I'm just saying, well, you know, if,

366
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:12,060
if you think that I was unfair
to Glenn Beck, you can go into,

367
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:16,170
you can listen to those soundbites, um,
in, in, in their original context. I mean,

368
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,690
one of the things that I tried to do
and one it was very important to me,

369
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,190
was to keep, um, both of these,
uh, cartoon characters, uh,

370
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,890
consistent with their, uh, with
their media persona, right? So, uh,

371
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,860
I wanted to keep Donald Duck Donald Duck.

372
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:33,210
I didn't want Donald Duck to
do things that don't look,
wouldn't do. Um, uh, and so,

373
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,730
uh, obviously I'm actually using
Donald Duck. So that becomes, um,

374
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,540
it's almost seems self evident,

375
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,910
but you can actually make Donald duck
do things that are very and Donald Duck

376
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:45,420
like with remix. Um, but I wanted
to keep Donald Duck as Donald Duck.

377
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:49,290
I wanted him to react in situations in
the way that he might have done, um,

378
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,930
sort of in a very hot headed
and a little bit overblown way,

379
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,900
sort of fall for things very quickly and
then realize that maybe he's been duped.

380
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,070
These are all things that happen over
and over and over again in a, in,

381
00:26:58,071 --> 00:27:02,370
in Donald Duck cartoons. Um, uh, of
which I'm a fan and I have watched,

382
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,780
I watched since I was very young.

383
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:06,900
One of the only things I was allowed to
watch in my very conservative household

384
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:08,430
was, um, was Disney channel.

385
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,920
And so I watched all of these
over and over again to have,

386
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,520
I've had the memorized. And so
when I came to this project, I, uh,

387
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,370
Donald Duck was the natural choice.
Um,

388
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,760
and ultimately to keep Glenn Beck a
relatively consistent with his message,

389
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:24,420
I didn't, I didn't want, you
know, it's very easy to, um,

390
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,570
it's very easy to make him say things
that are sort of totally insane. Uh,

391
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,930
he kind of says things are totally
insane once in a while anyway,

392
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,370
but you can sort of, you can very easily
take them out of context and make them,

393
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,430
make him sound like he's talking about,
you know, aliens from Mars. Right.

394
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,630
And that's not what I wanted to do.

395
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:42,120
I actually wanted to keep his message
relatively consistent and that's,

396
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,930
that's why the, um, uh, the links
are there so you can follow it back.

397
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,270
I just wanted to pick up the
themes of what he was saying,

398
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,810
but keep his message consistent.
Um, and then have the, have the,

399
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:56,040
to sort of interact in a way. So it
technically it's out of context of course,

400
00:27:56,041 --> 00:28:00,900
because it's, you know, I've removed the
media clips and made something new, but,

401
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,480
uh, I tried to keep their, um,
general persona, uh, accurate, um,

402
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,590
and as much as you can. Um, so, uh,

403
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,110
this, I put this up, I, uh,

404
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,310
I premiered this at the opening video
conference in New York City, uh,

405
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,280
and I think I was on Friday
maybe. And by Monday, um,

406
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,230
he had already gone viral and so we'd had,

407
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,780
in the first week it had about
half a million views, um,

408
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,910
and it was on every political blog you'd
think of including Glenn Beck's block.

409
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,120
Um, uh, Roger Ebert tweeted about it
and he said, everyone should watch it.

410
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,440
Um, and uh, and he put a little urgency in
the, in his tweet. He was like, you know,

411
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:42,330
everyone should watch this
before Disney takes it down.

412
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,420
And so everyone went to watch it right
away, which was, I was, I appreciate it.

413
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:47,250
He also blogged about it at the,
at the Sun Times.

414
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,230
And The Washington Post called me and
that was about the half million mark.

415
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,310
And they said, uh, this the
Washington Post, and, uh,

416
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,560
we would like to talk to
you about your little video,

417
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,650
which I thought it was nice of them,
um,

418
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,770
and your times to just
don't worry about it. Uh,

419
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,430
and it sort of ballooned from there.
John Cusak tweeted about it. Um, uh,

420
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,780
for some reason bill O'Reilly also
tweeted about it. He tweeted the video.

421
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:16,290
So I don't know if he'd seen
it at that point or not, but

422
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,950
he didn't say anything about
it as no commentary, just
watch this, uh, which is, uh,

423
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,090
to me, maybe he's not in control of
his own Twitter account. Um, but then,

424
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:29,840
so then on Monday, someone sent me, um,

425
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,830
something like this.
Uh,

426
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,900
and this is a video clip of
Glenn Beck on his radio show.

427
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,280
He has about, he, he did
have five hours of, of, uh,

428
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,560
airtime to fill every day. Uh, now it's
four cause he's not on, on Fox every day.

429
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,250
Um, so it's a lot of time. So I understand
that he needs to fill that time. Uh,

430
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,580
and he decided to fill
that time like this.

431
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,180
Um,
Donald Duck meets Glenn Beck.

432
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,630
Now this took some time, some
talent in some money. Cool.

433
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,790
It's what, eight minutes?
It is. Yeah, it is.

434
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,110
It is some of the best wellmade
propaganda I have ever seen.

435
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,290
Um, but I just want to, I just,

436
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,490
I just want to show you
what was on his website. Hi.

437
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,000
Um, so I'm going to have Glenn Beck
introduced me in a more formal way.

438
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:25,360
I didn't do that earlier. Um, and
since he has so much time to feel,

439
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:27,850
he reads my entire bio,
uh,

440
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,910
which was fantastic for me
because now I don't have to do it.

441
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,400
Aim Is Jonathan McIntosh.
I'm a pop culture hacker,

442
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:38,450
video remix artist,
photographer and new media teacher,

443
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,600
consultant and fair use activist.

444
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,730
I also have worked on numerous media and
social justice related projects in the

445
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:49,760
United States and around the
world in my stairs. Spare time.

446
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:54,560
I helped co edit the blog of political
remix video and I am a member of the open

447
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,470
video alliance political remix video.

448
00:30:57,471 --> 00:31:02,471
My video work remixes and transforms fee
of fragments of mass media pop culture

449
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,830
to tell alternative political,
social and cultural narratives.

450
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,140
Basically I'm a pop culture hacker,

451
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,690
but instead of a computer
code I had television.

452
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,370
My political remix is appear online and
also in film festivals and on community

453
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:19,970
TV stations and new media
conferences globally.

454
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,750
Last year I was a consultant for
remix America Online project.

455
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,650
Last summer also co-taught a two week
intensive workshop called the fair use.

456
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:30,890
Remax Institute was Chicago youth

457
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,440
using remix video as a media
literacy tool if I'm not mistaken.

458
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,260
Um,
some of these remix videos,

459
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,300
um,
it's very interesting,

460
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:51,870
I believe get federal funding.
I believe it was one,

461
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,310
one of these things that he's involved
in was one of the first to receive

462
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:59,660
federal funding to just
understand that culture.

463
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,910
We're looking into the funding of this
gentleman and the incredible propaganda

464
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,420
against me.

465
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,670
Like you've never seen using
Disney and Disney cartoons.

466
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,150
Of course it's all fair
use so they can use Disney.

467
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:23,990
Apparently Disney doesn't
have a problem with, um,

468
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,830
with Donald Duck cartoons
now being remixed,

469
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,020
politicized and politicized
for the progressive left.

470
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,680
I know a lot about Walt Disney.

471
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,600
I know how much he hated the union because
he thought they were communists. What,

472
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,650
um,

473
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:47,650
I know how much Disney hated the enemies
of this country and the constitution,

474
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,790
namely the Communists,

475
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,130
the Socialists,
the union organizers,

476
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,060
dare I say it,
the progressive's,

477
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,720
but apparently they don't
have a problem with this.

478
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:11,780
I guess it's all fair use and we'll
find out if it's been federally funded,

479
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,750
you know,

480
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,750
as part of the stimulus package or one
of those NEA packages of the White House

481
00:33:18,341 --> 00:33:21,720
is simultaneously involved in and,
and an off time volts

482
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,320
to quote Gandhi and play,
um,

483
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,040
Indian music and it's offensive anyway.
Um,

484
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,170
so was fantastic because he proved pretty
much every point that I was trying to

485
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:37,920
make in that little response.
Um, uh, incidentally,

486
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:42,140
I'm still haven't gotten my check
from Obama after all that work. Um,

487
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:47,390
you know, obviously I made this in
my living room in my spare time, uh,

488
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,570
over a period of three
and a half months. Um, uh,

489
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:56,220
I didn't get any funding for it.
I haven't been paid for it since or then.

490
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:01,110
Um, so, you know, uh,

491
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,490
and I, um, as far as I know,

492
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,880
none of the projects I've worked
on have gotten any stimulus money.

493
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:11,660
As much as I would like to
get some stimulus money,
uh, it hasn't happened. Um,

494
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,840
so we sort of, you sort of
proves all my points there.
Um, and so that, um, you know,

495
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:19,850
a bunch of people saw this and it was,
it was sort of talking about a little bit,

496
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,410
but this response didn't go viral in the
way the original video did. Um, however,

497
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,810
um, in the, in the, in the,

498
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:30,380
in the way that this sort of call
and response remix and, and, um, uh,

499
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,280
transformative do dialogue
happens, uh, often, uh,

500
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,320
on the Internet these
days. Um, someone else,

501
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:44,321
another remix her named icat three eight
one took Glen Beck's response and took,

502
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,810
I'm Mickey Mouse Video,
um,

503
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,450
to make another response.
So this is,

504
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,470
this is a remixed response to
going back to response to my remix,

505
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:02,360
which is a remix, which is a response
to going back. Okay. It's follow that.

506
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,050
Um, and I actually think that this is even
better than Glenn Beck responding in a

507
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:06,884
lot of ways.

508
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:13,550
[inaudible]

509
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,470
there is a,
a story on Donald Duck meets Glenn back.

510
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,580
It is some of the best
propaganda against me.

511
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,920
Like you've never seen using
Disney and Disney cartoons,

512
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,460
but I just want to, I
just, if I'm not mistaken,

513
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:53,180
some of these remix videos I
believe get federal funding.

514
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:59,900
The Communists,
socialists,

515
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:06,170
the union organizers, Jonathan
Macintosh, the enemies,

516
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,370
yet another unbelievable attack.

517
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:17,110
But I guess it's all fair use and it's
okay because the truth shall set you

518
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:19,904
free.

519
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,950
[inaudible]

520
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:38,050
so I, you know, I, that is my one,
my favorite things ever. Um, the,

521
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,900
this response also went viral. So
it sort of a, a week later, uh,

522
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,100
this one was also posted it on and
many of those of those blogs and in my,

523
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,220
my remix now has about a million
and a half views, I think. Um,

524
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:54,010
and this one has about
a million. So it's, uh,

525
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,540
it's sort of gained a lot of
popularity. Um, and there's,

526
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,190
I think there's very, very little
that you can do with, with, uh, um,

527
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,000
that amount of sort of hyperbolic rhetoric
that has very little basis in reality

528
00:37:07,001 --> 00:37:11,680
except mix it with a cartoon. It seems
to fit really nicely. And so, okay, so,

529
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:14,370
so let's, let's, that's an example. Um,

530
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,470
I just wanna talk a little bit
about fair use. You know, I, I, I'm,

531
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,840
I'm not going to focus on it a
lot because I feel like it's,

532
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:22,810
it's been covered in, in many places
and there's, there's, you know,

533
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:25,030
there's an enormous amount of,
of,

534
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:29,930
of academic work done on
this topic, um, but it's,

535
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,680
want to go over it very quickly in terms
of some of the questions that I asked

536
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:36,670
myself. Um, so, uh, in terms of fair use,

537
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,410
some of the questions that
I ask that I ask myself,

538
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:40,540
and this is not all that
fair use encompasses,

539
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,550
this is just sort of the things that I,
I, uh, I talked to remixers about, right?

540
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:50,320
So, um, is, is the remix
work transformative, right?

541
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,090
Um,
that is,

542
00:37:52,091 --> 00:37:56,830
does it change and transform the
original into something new? Right.

543
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
And is it distinguishable
as something new? Um,

544
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,890
is the remix work a commentary
at criticism or a parody?

545
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,990
Right now? It doesn't have to be
a negative commentary. It can be,

546
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:12,940
it can be a celebration.
That can be commentary,

547
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:14,530
can be an argument that can be commentary.

548
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,480
There are many ways that you can have
commentary, but does it comment on,

549
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,120
uh, on the source? Um,

550
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,270
and then, uh, one of the questions
that there's often asked in this,

551
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,260
in this list of, of questions about
fair use is how much is borrowed.

552
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,050
There's no set amount.

553
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,650
There's no set amount in terms of words,
letters,

554
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:43,480
there's no set amount in terms of
video footage or sound clips. Um, the,

555
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,500
uh, the doctrine, the fair
use doctrine says that you,

556
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:50,230
you can use as much as you need,
right?

557
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,030
Purposely vague because what if you need,
you know, you might need 10 seconds,

558
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,690
you might need the entire thing, but
you might, but you will. Then of course,

559
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:02,920
we'd have to transform it in a
very significant way. Right? Um,

560
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,610
so there, there, there is no seven
second rule. There's no 32nd rule.

561
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,410
There's no two paragraph rule,
there's no rule at all.

562
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,370
It is how much you need and that you
know, is going to be determined, um,

563
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,530
by anyone who sort of evaluating whether
it's fair use or not. Um, and then the,

564
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:19,690
one of the other things
that, that is often, uh,

565
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,940
is often brought up is what is the effect
on the original works value and that

566
00:39:23,941 --> 00:39:27,660
that's, that's the market value. So, um,
when this is sort of a disgust in the,

567
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:31,200
in the courts, what they mean
by that is, you know, um,

568
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,640
if someone watches my Donald Duck Remix,

569
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:39,210
do they no longer have to buy a or see
any other Donald duck cartoon or have I

570
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:43,300
shown them everything
clearly? I haven't. Um,

571
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:47,950
I've showed them a few seconds of
Volvo, very large body of work. Um,

572
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,230
uh, and so, and that actually
I think is less important,

573
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,020
at least in, in, in the court cases
that I've looked at is less important.

574
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,790
The most important factors.
The first one,

575
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:00,910
which is whether it's transformative or
not, that is the most important thing.

576
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,200
It has to be transformative.
Um, incidentally, a,

577
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,200
there's no rule that says you
can't make money off of it either.

578
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,180
There's no rule that says
it has to be noncommercial.

579
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:15,100
You can do a fair use remix and you can
make a commercial. Um, probably, uh,

580
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,210
then it's transformative.

581
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:19,810
Nis is going to be incredibly
important in that termination. Um,

582
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,630
but there's no rule that says, I mean,
if you, if you have it not noncommercial,

583
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,260
you might get a, um, uh, judges
leeway a little bit. But there's,

584
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:29,040
there's no rule that says you have to.
Um,

585
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,320
I also love this quote from 1839 works
for value only if they give rise to

586
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:38,530
better ones. Um, uh, this actually
he's a, he's a German national,

587
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,820
a naturalist. He was
a, a natural scientist.

588
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,260
Um, and, uh, so there were
sort of working on, um,

589
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,880
working in the, sort of the same
fee fields. Darwin, right? I mean,

590
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:56,290
so he's talking about
scientific work here. Um, but
I think that the quote can be,

591
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,920
can be appropriated to mean
art or media as well. Um,

592
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,300
so that's a very, very brief
overview of, of various,

593
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,270
if you have other questions we can, we can
chat about it. Uh, I'm happy to do that,

594
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,120
but I think there's a more interesting
question that I want to bring up.

595
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,900
And then it's a question about the ethics
of appropriation because I think that

596
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:18,550
has a separate completely
separate question actually
then the legal and fair use

597
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:21,970
question. And it's a question that
gets asked I think a little bit less.

598
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,820
And there's a lot of focus
in, um, especially in,

599
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:29,080
in an open access spaces like this
one, uh, about the legality, right?

600
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:31,360
It's all about the legality. Is
it legal, is it not like, well,

601
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,580
there are lots of things that are
legal that are not necessarily good,

602
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,250
like ethical I think.
Um,

603
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,100
and there are lots of things that are
illegal that might be ethical, right?

604
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:42,020
So I think that there is another
question sort of separate.

605
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:46,260
So I want to separate this question
very clearly from the use question. Um,

606
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,340
so put that aside and we'll talk
about the ethics here for a second.

607
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,750
So the has some of the questions
that I asked when I, when I,

608
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:56,260
when I'm going to Remix, uh, some piece
of media, right? So I asked, uh, you know,

609
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,020
who owns, uh, the source media
and who's depicted in it?

610
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,830
And so for a Disney, right, for instance,
it's, it's owned by Disney, right?

611
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:07,070
One of the largest multinational
corporations are the richest in the world.

612
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,450
And so I, that's who owns that. Um, uh,

613
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,590
in terms of Glenn back, there's
a, there's a variety of owners.

614
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:17,580
Fox News is one owner.
Um,

615
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,980
and then Glenn Beck has a variety of
his own companies that, that, that, uh,

616
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,030
and then there's a radio program as well.
So it's right,

617
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,100
there's about three
different owners there.

618
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:29,480
But all of those are corporate entities.
They're all relatively well to do. Um,

619
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,690
and so they occupy a position
of power. Who's depicted, uh,

620
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,190
obviously Donald duck is a, is a
cartoon. Um, uh, and then in, in,

621
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,740
in Glen Beck's voice, that's, that's
going back. So there's, there's a very,

622
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:43,370
very critical questions. And I sort
of asking a, who is in this media? Um,

623
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:44,910
and then one of the values,

624
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,900
what are the messages he
embedded in that source material?

625
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:52,580
We talked about that in terms of, of um,
of Glenn Beck and Donald Duck, right?

626
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:57,380
There's, I think two separate
sets of values. Um, some
of them are contradictory,

627
00:42:57,381 --> 00:42:59,480
some of them line up very well
in those two pieces of media.

628
00:42:59,481 --> 00:43:01,010
And so I tried to pull out those things,

629
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,550
including some of the racial stereotyping
that was happening both in Glen Beck's

630
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:09,530
program and also, uh, in the, in the
older Disney stuff. Um, and then, uh,

631
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:13,160
I think one of the most important things
is what positions of privilege and

632
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:16,430
power they hold relative to me. Right?
Because when I remixed something,

633
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:20,150
I'm kind of looking in terms of
where do I sit on the, on, on the,

634
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:23,520
on the power scale, right? On
this sort of social, um, uh,

635
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,950
power scales, right? Um,
uh, where, where am I?

636
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:32,090
And then where is this media that I'm
mixing it and my am I looking up and I am,

637
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:35,590
I am remix mixing people who were in the
public sphere, government officials, um,

638
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,490
uh, corporate entities,
right? Celebrities, people
who have a lot of money,

639
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:42,140
or am I looking down in the social sphere,

640
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:45,020
people who were right and I'm mixing
people who are homeless or it makes the

641
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:48,770
people who are, you know, who, who, who,
who might be oppressed in various ways.

642
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,740
And so I was asked those questions when I,
um,

643
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,170
when I remixed and I try to always remix,
especially if I'm being critical,

644
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:01,550
I, I try to remix things that are above
me and in relatively in these sort of

645
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:05,310
social space spaces, right? Um, uh, that's
not true across the board men, everyone,

646
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,810
there's don't do that. Um, it's very easy
to pick on people who are below you in,

647
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:12,930
in, in, in power and privilege levels.
I'm, it gets a quick laugh, uh,

648
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,130
but I feel like it does some damage and
we'll talk about that in a second. Um,

649
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,640
so that's what I keep in mind that
certainly not what everyone does and these

650
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:22,730
aren't, these aren't rules, these are just
sort of things that I keep in mind. Um,

651
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:27,800
uh, right. And this is a fantastic quote
from bell hooks is one of my favorites.

652
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,560
It sort of talks about this.
There's a there, especially
in spaces, but also in, in,

653
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:35,280
in artists spaces and sometimes
in music spaces as well.

654
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,020
There's a tendency to um,
try to be transgressive for
transgressive Sake, right?

655
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:44,970
They try to be, um, uh, to try sort
of a be against the grain or a or a,

656
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,300
because for the sake of being rebellious,
right?

657
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,750
As opposed to thinking about
what it is like, you know,

658
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,460
I want to be rebellious for a purpose.
And what is that purpose? What,

659
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:55,350
what does that new message,

660
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:58,530
right on my remix mixing just the material
because I want to remix something and

661
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,540
it's kind of trend,
a subset of subversive,

662
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,230
what I want to remix the material for
some reasons and have some sort of message

663
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:09,090
behind it. Um, so, uh, some
examples of, of, of that.

664
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:13,640
So I think about it in terms of, you
know, artists or media makers are, um,

665
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,970
are using this tool of remix,
uh, to, to say something. Um,

666
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:21,940
and often when you talking about comedy,
you talk about, you know, you can comedy,

667
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,930
you can, you can, you can adjust your sort
of throwing rocks as a comedian, right?

668
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,470
You're throwing rocks and you've seen him
if it hits and it's, it's, it's funny.

669
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,693
Um,

670
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,530
and so you can either throw rocks up
right at people who are above you in terms

671
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,220
of wealth, in terms of, um,

672
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,820
of various hierarchies or you can
throw rocks that are down, uh,

673
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,590
and throwing rocks down is very
easy. This is, this is an example,

674
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:46,500
people who are throwing rocks up some
of these memes or some of these remixes

675
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:48,690
here, um, at, at, at,

676
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:52,710
at more powerful people and more
and more powerful institutions. Um,

677
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,520
and I think that these challenge those
systems, right? The challenge status quo,

678
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,470
they challenge norms. Um, and I think
often in a very positive way, not always.

679
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:05,820
Um, there are certainly some, uh,
there's some back and forth here,

680
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:08,220
but I feel like they sort
of bs one sort of tend to,

681
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,950
I don't know how many of you
have recognized any of these,

682
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:15,860
any of these images here? Just
a couple of you. Um, so, uh,

683
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,170
just one of them Gaddafi,
he, um, when, when,

684
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:23,820
as the protests began in a,
in February, he gave a speech,

685
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,740
uh, from a little car
with an umbrella, right?

686
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:31,100
And it was a very strange speech, um, one,

687
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:35,000
one of a series of very strange speeches
that he gave at that point. And, uh, uh,

688
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,030
and especially in, in the Arabic
speaking world, this image became a meme,

689
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:39,811
you know,

690
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:42,600
so people would make little youtube
videos of themselves with umbrellas and it

691
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:46,310
was like as a whole umbrella meme
that those are spread. Um, and,

692
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,540
and then he did another one where he
could get another speech where he,

693
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:52,290
where he said, uh, that
the protests for democracy,

694
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:57,291
we're being controlled by the United
States and al Qaeda with hallucinogenics

695
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:00,720
that they had put in people's nest cafe.
Right?

696
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,910
This is like a national speech
that he gave and this is why.

697
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,150
And so that was his reason. So nest cafe
became this big thing like, you know,

698
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:10,200
if you drink last cafe, you'll freak out
and try to overthrow the government. Um,

699
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,600
and so that was, you know,
another sort of mean that, that,

700
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,380
that people picked up on it. And again,
they are there. They're using this,

701
00:47:16,381 --> 00:47:19,740
this remix footage just sort of make fun
of and trying to disempower this very

702
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:24,270
powerful figure. Um, uh, first
world problems is another meme.

703
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:24,751
It's a,

704
00:47:24,751 --> 00:47:28,770
it's an image macro that people will
often use this image or other ones which

705
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:31,000
are then sent. Some of them are
quite good. Uh, not all of them.

706
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:33,460
Obviously there are, there are,
there are gems. Um, this next one,

707
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:37,060
privileged nine dude, I mean, have you
heard of the privilege denying dude? Uh,

708
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,940
it's, I mean it's, it's actually quite
brilliant. Um, sort of, they found these,

709
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:45,090
these, these images are very smug
looking, you know, dot com, uh,

710
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:50,070
a hipster kids and they, uh, uh,
they would just write things that,

711
00:47:50,071 --> 00:47:53,530
that they had heard their male
colleagues say about them, you know, uh,

712
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:57,430
so you know, your, your, or that
they, that they had sort of not said,

713
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:59,410
but sort of meant. Right. So, um,

714
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:03,550
your ideas sound so much better when I
rephrase it. Right. That's a classic one.

715
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:06,970
I think, um, and that got very popular
as well. There was also backlash,

716
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:10,180
I think against it. It was pretty bad.
Um, hype, which was making fun of them.

717
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,090
Obama's award winning PR
campaign to become president.

718
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,660
I'm actually won the marketer
of the year for that campaign.

719
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:21,790
So that was sort of talking
about that, um, Tom Cruise, uh,

720
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:26,370
has, uh, gets no end of, uh, of
being made fun of for various, uh,

721
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:30,010
is I think is the one where he's jumping
on the couch with Oprah. When you that,

722
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,220
um, anonymous, I feel like it's
a bit of a mixed, a mixed bag.

723
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:36,010
Sometimes they go after, um, uh, I think,

724
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:38,790
and it actually more recently
they've been going after, uh,

725
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,490
Dick dictators and systems of power.
They don't always do that,

726
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:46,590
but I feel like they've been sort of
tending in that in that way recently. Um,

727
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,150
they were also have a of an
operation against child pornography,

728
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,010
which they're trying to take down
all of the servers that host it,

729
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:54,340
which I feel like it's a
positive thing. Um, uh,

730
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:58,390
Bill O'Reilly had a brilliant freak out
that people made into a dance remix.

731
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:03,010
Many times you haven't seen it.
It's definitely not say for work,

732
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:05,920
but it's pretty funny. Um,
and then this one is, um, uh,

733
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,430
I think I believe is Sarah Pailin,
constitutional scholar, which

734
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,090
also very funny. Um, uh,

735
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,330
so some of them tend to be a little sexist
and I think you have to kind of sort

736
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:20,140
through it and find the, find
the good ones. Um, so, okay,

737
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:22,270
so those are those throwing rocks up.
You just throwing rocks down.

738
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:26,920
How many you should recognize these,
any of these images are memes, right?

739
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:31,810
If you don't, great. Good, good for you.
Don't, don't go looking for them. Um,

740
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:35,030
uh, they're sort of all, you
know, all things that were,

741
00:49:35,031 --> 00:49:36,730
became very popular or they were,

742
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:41,470
they were sort of remix memes that
tended to make fun of people. Um,

743
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,510
uh, so make fun of Queer kids was a very,
or gay kids will, it was, it was a very,

744
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:48,660
it was a very popular thing to do.
It's,

745
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,950
and you could have easy kick at
people who are lower than you.

746
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:55,600
And the social scale usually. Um, this,
this next one is a show called lazy town.

747
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,560
I mean, you've heard of lazy
town is, there's a Nickelodeon
show, um, for kids. This,

748
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:04,300
this woman, this young girl was 12,
uh, in this, in the shot here. Um,

749
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,980
and she sort of sings and dances
and, uh, um, a shot in Iceland, uh,

750
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,850
she became a meme because they, um,
a bunch of people decided that she,

751
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,520
that they wanted to sexualize her and
so they put her on all kinds of horrible

752
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:20,200
sexual situations. Um, so, uh,

753
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:24,100
uh, you've got the golden voice, which
people sort of, some of them celebrate it,

754
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:28,840
but a lot of them I felt like made fun of.
Um, and then it goes down the line, uh,

755
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:33,170
instantly. Obama is in both of these,
right? He's, he's in both. Uh, because I,

756
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:35,750
I feel like there are, there are different
ways that you can critique power.

757
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,660
One of them is to pick on his, on his
race. One of them just pick on his,

758
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,960
on his political positions. Um, so, uh,

759
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,980
these are the questions that I ask
myself. I ask myself, you know, um,

760
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,750
what are the power relationships
here? All right. Um,

761
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:53,780
and then who's the target
and where do they sit? Um,

762
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,310
and I, I, you know, I
hope that this, you know,

763
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,650
that these become popular
and I hope that these don't,

764
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:04,670
that's not always the case. Um,
so, uh, that's about 45 minutes.

765
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:05,780
I want to leave some time for questions.

766
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:08,890
I want to show you one quick thing
before I go. Uh, this is, um,

767
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,050
a o five remix video, uh, for education.

768
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,860
And so this is a project that I'm working
on called the gendered advertising

769
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,080
remixer.
Uh,

770
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,800
and so this is the website that we
sort of built for their, for their,

771
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:22,570
for the demo.
This is just,

772
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:26,810
you're really a prototype and this is the
flash version that we're working on. A,

773
00:51:26,811 --> 00:51:30,530
and this is the new html five
version without flash silage of five.

774
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:34,700
These are all videos that you can,
that you can play with. Um, uh, and

775
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,300
in, in remix and TV. Whenever I
look at TV, I'm always thinking,

776
00:51:40,301 --> 00:51:42,930
how could this be different? You
know, what are the messages here? Uh,

777
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,430
how could they be mixed up? What can be
different, right? So, you know, when,

778
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,210
when I go see a film, I might be, I
might like certain aspects of the film.

779
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:52,780
I might be disappointed with other
aspects of the film. And so in my mind,

780
00:51:52,781 --> 00:51:55,630
I started mixing things up. All
right? So I might go to a CSC, a film,

781
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,080
and I might like the cinematography
and I like, like the dialogue,

782
00:51:59,081 --> 00:52:03,420
but there is no women in the film.
And so, which happens quite a lot. Uh,

783
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:06,400
and so I will,
I will pretend and all sort of in my mind,

784
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:10,090
switch out the actor for an actress and
just see what that would do in my mind.

785
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,320
Right? What, what, what, what would
that change the story? Um, and so, uh,

786
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:16,120
it's a great way to watch Harry
Potter, by the way. If you,

787
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:19,020
if you switch her money and Harry
in your mind as you watch it,

788
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:23,830
it becomes quite subversive. Um,
anyway, so, uh, this is, uh, you know,

789
00:52:23,831 --> 00:52:27,610
I was watching Nickelodeon and I was
watching a cartoon network and I noticed

790
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:32,200
that the ads, um, that really
something new, but the ads are, uh,

791
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,320
are very segregated in terms of
gender and it sort of, you know,

792
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:38,590
you have one ad directed at boys and
then another ad direct at girls and then

793
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:41,140
boys and the girls sort
of stackers that way. Um,

794
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,440
and they are incredibly
specific in terms of the,

795
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:50,170
uh,
the key skill sets that are being taught,

796
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:54,570
the values that are being taught.
Um, what it says about, you know, uh,

797
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:58,360
about what it, what it means to be female
versus male in a, in, in, in the culture.

798
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:03,320
And if you just look at the types of
skills that are being displayed here, um,

799
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,950
and, and, and the value sets, and
then you ask yourself like, you know,

800
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,980
which kind of, um, what kind of, you know,

801
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:14,060
what kind of careers might come out of
this set of skills versus come up with

802
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:18,980
that set of skills. Right? You, you get
diametrically opposed and very narrow,

803
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,630
uh, um, and stereotyped
gender roles, right? So in,

804
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,490
in, in, in, in the girl's side,
across the board, you know,

805
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,900
there might be veterinarian,

806
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,960
like that might be the most
sort of career oriented thing.

807
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,330
Everything else is being a mom makeup,
finding a husband,

808
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:41,870
you know, um, and the technology is
all about shopping or finding a man,

809
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,770
right? So if there is technology
it shopping, finding man,
uh, over over here, right?

810
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,650
So you, but you also have some,
some positive stuff, right?

811
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:51,370
So when I talked to middle schoolers about
the stuff, I, you know, I say, you know,

812
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,350
what are the positive things? While
there's cooperation, there's compassion,

813
00:53:54,351 --> 00:53:57,060
there's caregiving is lots of things
that are, that are positive here. Um,

814
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,750
not just negative. And then there were
lots of things that are positive here,

815
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,560
you know, um, confidence being, uh,

816
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,840
being in control of your environment
and building and creating, right?

817
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,710
But there's also a lot of aggression,
um,

818
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,390
an enormous amount of competition and
almost no cooperation whatsoever. Right?

819
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:15,950
And so what happens if you kind
of explain that to, to youth, uh,

820
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,960
and you can kind of have
a discussion about it,

821
00:54:17,961 --> 00:54:20,330
but I find it much more effective if
you can let them do the deconstructing

822
00:54:20,331 --> 00:54:23,870
themselves and actually do it literally.
And so for instance, in this case,

823
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,080
you can take a Polly pocket
airplane for instance,

824
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:30,710
and you can take the Gi Joe Command base,
um,

825
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:35,360
and depending on how fast the connection
is here, you can create your own mashup.

826
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:42,060
It's a great thing. Yes. The runway,

827
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,650
fashion
jumbo jet,

828
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,410
you put it together or they
don't think sold separately.

829
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:56,410
Uh, that's so not only is it
sort of fun to play with, uh,

830
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,490
any sort of gets a lot of people's laugh,
but you can,

831
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,340
but it becomes really apparent, right?
So you can swap them and you can,

832
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,720
so Gi Joe, pimp mobile headquarters
converts it to a massive battle station.

833
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,400
Always ready for action. Gi Joe
are you in? You can join today.

834
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,190
Got Gi joe.com the place that they get
the vehicles, all separate batteries,

835
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:17,400
not included adults simply
required as we're going along.

836
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,640
Um, yeah, they're just some
of my favorites. And you know,

837
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:28,530
there's about 400 possibilities
here just with this. Um, let's see.

838
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:30,960
Audio and then, uh, let's see. Video.

839
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,540
Let's do my little pony.

840
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:35,410
Yeah.

841
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:36,460
Oh No.
You know what we're going to do?

842
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:41,320
We're going to do video of Betty
Spaghetti. That's very good.

843
00:55:41,321 --> 00:55:43,090
And then we'll do talk at the TACO trucks

844
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,800
and we'll hope that our internet can

845
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,760
new from the Taco garage,
not machines, three sizes,

846
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:56,300
one system you can build up and
customize your heavy duty truck.

847
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,430
All right, so this is, this
is, this is a little bit slow,

848
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:04,600
but I am going to show you this. So
this is, this is the flash version, um,

849
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,500
which we built as well.
Uh, for people who can't,

850
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,780
who is systems can't handle a Ishma five.

851
00:56:09,781 --> 00:56:13,230
So we'll try to build it in
flash and see what happens. Uh,

852
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,290
we're spreading spaghetti.

853
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,320
Here's spaghetti video
and then talk a truck's.

854
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,650
Here we go, yes. Audio and we'll see

855
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,440
if this will work. I'm so, I'm sorry.

856
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,540
Starting to build a curriculum around
this, right? It's all fair use.

857
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:36,520
It's all transformative. Um,
education in all purposes is another,

858
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:39,250
is another fair use.
Well,

859
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,970
it seems like our Internet
here is a little slow anyway.

860
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,360
You can go play with this cause
it's online. See if you go to a,

861
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,710
if you were to gender remixer a.com,

862
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,390
you can play with it and
you can make your own.

863
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,400
I'm the cool thing about this one.
Let's see if it works

864
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:56,120
from the top
three sizes.

865
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:59,680
One system you can build up and
customize your heavy duty truck.

866
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,460
Tons of parts get drop the motor
into any modern machine, Tonka mom,

867
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,793
that's a top.

868
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:10,290
Um,
and so with the flash version right now,

869
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:13,800
we had it set up so you can download
that to your desktop or you can send it

870
00:57:13,801 --> 00:57:16,860
directly to youtube. You can put on
your own youtube channel. And so when,

871
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:21,000
when you, um, are, are building things
and, um, I think about this in terms of,

872
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,930
you know,
in terms of Remix,

873
00:57:21,931 --> 00:57:24,900
in terms of seeing the world as not
just something that you're given,

874
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:27,450
but something that you can
make something out of. Um,

875
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,180
and you can sort of talk
back to this is this is,

876
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:33,270
this is the one on one of
the first stages, right? It
sort of a gateway, right?

877
00:57:33,271 --> 00:57:33,630
So you,

878
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:36,900
you start by making something in one
of these applications and then you can

879
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:41,160
learn the tools to go and make things, um,
uh, on your own. Even if you, you know,

880
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:43,230
went when I,
when I've done this workshop before,

881
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,500
even when a young people go home and
don't necessarily make another remix their

882
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,510
thinking in that way, or they've
already, they, they're, they're going in,

883
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:54,300
they're watching television and then
not watching him the same way, right?

884
00:57:54,301 --> 00:57:55,880
They're watching it in terms of what they,

885
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,130
what's behind it and how it's built and
what maybe they could do with it. Um,

886
00:57:59,131 --> 00:58:01,670
and so even if they don't actually
make something, again, that the,

887
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,070
in terms of critical media
literacy skills, um, they're
starting to see that, that,

888
00:58:05,071 --> 00:58:07,240
that process and what's behind
a lot of it out that made you,

889
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:11,700
so I think I'll stop here and we'll
can do questions. Um, and, uh,

890
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:14,850
I'm willing to stay for
however long people want. Um,

891
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:21,260
[inaudible]

892
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,660
you don't have questions?
I'll just keep talking forever.

893
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:35,960
Right now. I'll say rewrite blowing
line with the Obama White House.

894
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,660
Great. Um, do you have any inkling
as to how that will change beer use?

895
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,980
Um,
given his track record of not hopeful,

896
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,830
um,
uh,

897
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,310
the Obama White House has been,

898
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,760
we talked a good talk and
then when they got in there,

899
00:58:58,761 --> 00:59:03,610
they have been pretty much doing
whatever the, um, in a way,

900
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:08,130
whenever the big media companies
want, uh, tried to spin it. Um,

901
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:13,660
the way that a lot of the sort of fair
use stuff is one and defended his bike by

902
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:19,060
a makers and the lawyers and remixers who
get together and challenged and stuff.

903
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:21,423
Um,
and,

904
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,860
uh, just last year there's
something called the DMC I right.

905
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,210
The digital Millennium Copyright Act.
Um,

906
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:32,480
there's an exception for fair use
for educational purposes and for, um,

907
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:36,130
uh, for critical commentary, right. Uh,

908
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,580
and every year or every time it comes
up for review with the industry,

909
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:41,840
uh,

910
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,840
immediate district tries to get those
exemptions are projected and reduce or

911
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:51,210
reject fair use. Um, and they
come up with these ridiculous, uh,

912
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:56,290
schemes, you know, like you
will, you can use a DVD if you,

913
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:57,050
you know,

914
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:01,500
if you film it with a digital camera
off a screen in a dark room for 30 cm,

915
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:04,520
like all this stuff, right, which is not
what fair you says, but they're there.

916
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:06,370
They're trying to, to limited. Um,

917
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:11,270
and there've been some fantastic
organizations like organisation called the

918
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,340
Organization for transformative works
who has been trying to change that.

919
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:15,550
And last year they actually
want a great exception, um,

920
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:20,270
which is sort of already in fair
news, but it wasn't, it wasn't, uh,

921
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:25,190
it wasn't, uh, in the DMC A and it's,
it basically says that you're a Latin,

922
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:27,870
you are now allowed to rip
DVDs for fair use purposes.

923
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,310
Before you weren't allowed to do that,
which is a little ridiculous.

924
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:35,990
You would actually have to pirate to
the media to be legal. Right. Because,

925
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:39,380
because, you know, even though you could
use the media in a free and fair use,

926
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,860
the active decrypting,
the DVD was illegal.

927
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,880
And so he couldn't get the footage to use
in your classroom because you couldn't

928
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:47,241
do it through.

929
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:50,300
So what people would do is they would
download off the internet because someone

930
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:52,500
else had decrypted it. They had
done the illegal thing. Right.

931
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,990
That obviously ridiculous. And, and,
and, and, and the court found that,

932
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:59,510
that they made an exception to the DMC
I last year saying, well, you know,

933
01:00:59,511 --> 01:01:02,210
if you're doing it for a fair use,
you've hit now decrypt the DVD.

934
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:03,880
And that's also fair.
Um,

935
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,930
so I feel like the fights that are
happening are happening on, on the, on,

936
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,630
on the advocacy. We that, but,
and I think that's where, yeah,

937
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,810
that's where I have faith
that things can change.

938
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,110
I hope that's helpful.

939
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:29,680
Oh, go for it. Do you see videos
and those educational media

940
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:35,150
interactive for, for what purpose?

941
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,660
Just educating the mass public.

942
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:43,800
It certainly is a very popular one.
I feel like I'm, you know, when I,

943
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,570
when I remixed things,
um,

944
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:53,300
I do it because I want people to see it
and I want a, I want a large audience.

945
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,670
I don't necessarily just want an audience
that agrees with me already or is in

946
01:01:56,671 --> 01:02:00,420
my specific field. Right? Um, and
that's why he's popular culture,

947
01:02:00,421 --> 01:02:03,410
because popular culture is this
sort of shared language, right? Um,

948
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:06,450
it sort of a common point that we
can come together and say, okay,

949
01:02:06,451 --> 01:02:10,020
well we all understand this
reference point. Now we can
talk about what it means.

950
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:14,730
Um, uh, traditionally fine art video
for instance, hasn't done that.

951
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:19,080
Everybody who has been, um, created, uh,

952
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:24,300
for the most part for other artists and
for galleries and for academics. Right?

953
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:28,650
And so, um, what would I like about video,

954
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,010
especially pop culture video,
is that it creates this, this,

955
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:35,100
this space to have conversation
about some sort of very serious,

956
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:39,780
and I think deep issues.
Um, you know, uh, I, uh,

957
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,600
I also use video formats.

958
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:46,620
I think most people do video formats
that are also understandable, right?

959
01:02:46,621 --> 01:02:48,450
So we all know what a trailer is,
right?

960
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:51,110
The trailer is actually a very
abstract thing, right? It's a,

961
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,260
in terms of filmmaking, it's not a
narrative really. It's sort of a, it's,

962
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:58,770
it's meant to give you the essence of
what something might be right in order to

963
01:02:58,771 --> 01:03:01,380
see if you want to watch the entire thing.
Maybe that's an abstract concept.

964
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:04,860
There's, and you might get like hints
of narrative, but it's not a narrative.

965
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:08,190
It's a, it isn't, it's abstract. Um,
and the same way with tea, with TV ads,

966
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:11,720
TV ads are meant to give you an impression
of a feeling that associates with,

967
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:15,750
with a brand usually. Yeah. They're
usually not, this is cheap at this price.

968
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:17,160
Buy It. It's been, it, it's
cheaper than over here.

969
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:20,030
Like that's not actually what
most ads are. They're about there.

970
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:24,740
They're there about, uh, making
a brand emotional. And so, um,

971
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:27,540
a lot of remixers we'll then
use ads because ads are, again,

972
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:31,650
in abstract form that people
understand. Right? And music video,

973
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,330
we all understand what it means.
The video is right.

974
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:37,020
Even though it's actually a very
abstract thing. Um, uh, and so, uh,

975
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:41,410
if you're using those vehicles, you know,
like trailers and ads, right. That's,

976
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:44,670
that's, that's another way to,
to reach people that, that,

977
01:03:44,671 --> 01:03:48,360
that maybe haven't been to,
um,

978
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,070
I mean he criticism class,

979
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,800
but do you know where trailers and
now they know where the trailer,

980
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:54,460
it looks like when it's,
you know,

981
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,940
when it's said Richard Dreyfus
falling in love with jaws. Right.

982
01:03:56,941 --> 01:03:58,770
Which is a whole different
thing, but it's anyway, it's,

983
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:03,210
he gets inside of that those
Frank's right, that, that,

984
01:04:03,211 --> 01:04:06,240
that vehicle frame and the
abstract frame. But it's, it,

985
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:10,220
it's a way to communicate
those ideas to people. Um, um,

986
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:14,100
I think in a much more
populist way. Right. Um,

987
01:04:14,570 --> 01:04:17,260
so does that sort of answer that
question? I mean, I think that,

988
01:04:17,261 --> 01:04:21,660
I think the educators are sort of lagging
behind in this field. I think that,

989
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:24,450
um, uh, certainly, you know,

990
01:04:24,451 --> 01:04:27,150
half the students in this building or on
youtube right now and looking at video,

991
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:31,140
either learning or
laughing or both. And, uh,

992
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,140
and I feel like once you come into
this end, to the end of the classroom,

993
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:34,591
that should,

994
01:04:34,591 --> 01:04:37,530
that should carry over video should become
an integral part because it's part of

995
01:04:37,531 --> 01:04:39,580
the way people engage with the world.
Um,

996
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,240
and it's increasingly the way that
people engage with the Internet as well.

997
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:47,510
Videos,
Ada compliant.

998
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:53,800
That's a good question. Um,
well, so here's what I do. Um,

999
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:59,590
and it depends actually,
it actually,

1000
01:04:59,591 --> 01:05:03,340
that kind of means a lot of things. Um,
what I subtitle everything first of all.

1001
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:08,290
So, um, and I use a universal sub
subtitles, which is a free sub title tool,

1002
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:13,360
um, to give captions, um, as the,
those captions are in that program.

1003
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,090
Um,
uh,

1004
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:21,850
then I use translation tools
to let other people translate.

1005
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:25,050
So it sort of broadens the reach,
um,

1006
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:30,130
in as much as youtube is then yes. As
much as youtube isn't there. No. Right.

1007
01:05:30,131 --> 01:05:31,150
So,
um,

1008
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:36,930
the infrastructure that people are using
for a lot of this video work right now

1009
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:42,340
is, uh, is sort of based on what these
corporations have made available.

1010
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,360
Right. Um, Youtube, uh, is working on it.

1011
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:49,360
So they say we're going to a
lot of things. So they say,

1012
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:53,040
and they're trying to make it better. Um,
they did that. They, you know, they have,

1013
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:56,820
they have, um, they have, uh,

1014
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,090
their voice to text tools.
I don't know if he's ever used them.

1015
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:05,740
They're not very good yet. Um, I
find that, uh, that one of the,

1016
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:09,700
one of the easiest things to
do is to read a transcript.

1017
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:12,190
And this is something
that, that I, um, that I,

1018
01:06:12,191 --> 01:06:16,210
that I advocate for it with all my videos
and with other people who do videos,

1019
01:06:16,211 --> 01:06:20,140
you know, just making it make an English
transcript, uh, if, if it's an English,

1020
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:23,140
upload it to Youtube,
uh,

1021
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:27,700
upload it to wherever the video is so that
at least that option is available. Um,

1022
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,030
and then, uh, with html
five or it's, I mean,

1023
01:06:31,031 --> 01:06:35,440
these are each trying to five
videos that are embedded, um, here.

1024
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:39,160
Uh, and there's a whole bunch of, of, of,

1025
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:42,070
of add ons that you can work with,
right.

1026
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:45,280
And so those are sort of very slowly
being developed. I mean, for instance,

1027
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:49,150
this presentation will only work in a, in
two browsers, right? Right. Now there's,

1028
01:06:49,151 --> 01:06:53,020
you know, it's not quite there yet,
but the possibility for, for, for,

1029
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:58,000
for having video be integrated in I think
a much more accessible way does exist

1030
01:06:58,001 --> 01:07:00,180
with Asian or five where it
didn't exist. Right? You're,

1031
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:03,910
you were stuck in youtube before.
Um, and like you saw with the,

1032
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,330
with the dynamic and the
annotations happening, right?

1033
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,530
[inaudible] you can imagine
that being done, um, uh,

1034
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:15,860
with accessibility in mind. Right? And
building a whole app around that. Um,

1035
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,310
and so because this is all
very experimental, you know,

1036
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:22,690
people are sort of just beginning
to, uh, to, to, to play with that.

1037
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:23,920
But I mean accessibility is,

1038
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:27,610
I think for me crit critical and is
going to be critical for the web.

1039
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:30,230
And I know that youtube,
at least Google is,

1040
01:07:30,231 --> 01:07:34,370
is it at least says it's
important to them. So

1041
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:45,330
you said yesterday when we were
talking about loving the sores,

1042
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:49,770
talk a little bit more about that. For
example, the dog gone thing versus, Hey,

1043
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,400
I'm struck by is that music takes me
back to when I was like eight cause I

1044
01:07:53,401 --> 01:07:55,200
watched the same things
on the Disney channel.

1045
01:07:56,130 --> 01:07:57,630
There's somebody installed a trip there,

1046
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,490
but you have to stare at these things
for days. How do you do months?

1047
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:08,170
How do you do it? Well, so it's, it's um,

1048
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:12,650
they're shipped to traditions, I
feel like, and this is a home top,

1049
01:08:12,651 --> 01:08:17,240
but there's two, two, two, two traditions
of sort of subversive remix video.

1050
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,730
One of them and they both go
back to the mid seventies. Um,

1051
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,740
one of them is called a
jammy or meaty, jammy. Uh,

1052
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:29,030
and that is a pro practice of sort of
ridiculing media through remix video,

1053
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:35,240
right? So we can go back to, uh, the
emergency broadcast network or Ebn, right?

1054
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:36,350
Um,
uh,

1055
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:39,260
we can go back to a whole bunch of
groups that were doing that kinda stuff.

1056
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:43,030
The video scratchers in the
early eighties in, in the UK. Um,

1057
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:48,220
often the relationship that those meaty
jammers have with media is entirely,

1058
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:53,690
um, is entirely negative, right?

1059
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:58,850
They are looking at media as a, as a, as a
brainwashing tool, Matt, mass mass media,

1060
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,900
right? And that and that, therefore
they're going to ridicule it. Right?

1061
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:04,370
And I'm not saying that that work.
Um,

1062
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,310
there's a lot of fascinating
stuff that goes on with that work,

1063
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:10,730
but that's one type of relationship
that is not necessarily the relationship

1064
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:14,870
that I'd had with all media. There's
another tradition called the [inaudible],

1065
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:19,280
which goes back to 1975, which
is fans per primarily, um,

1066
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:22,690
doing what is essentially fan
fiction with video. Um, you know,

1067
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:27,320
I'm using music and
using, um, and using, uh,

1068
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:30,080
uh,
clips from mostly TV shows,

1069
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:35,081
but increasingly some movies as well to
create using the lyrics to change the

1070
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:37,390
meaning of the, of the
visuals. Visuals are changed,

1071
01:09:37,391 --> 01:09:41,570
the meaning of the lyrics and create a
new sort of fanfiction style story that

1072
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:44,090
makes an argument or celebrates a
character or does a character study or

1073
01:09:44,091 --> 01:09:48,410
whatever. Um, and that, and
their relationship with their
source is very different.

1074
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:48,800
Um,

1075
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,130
they are also transforming and appropriate
in media and they have something to

1076
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:52,941
say about that media,

1077
01:09:52,941 --> 01:09:57,941
but it's often a sort of very
sympathetic relationship with their,

1078
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,940
with their, with their source. Um,

1079
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,870
the way that I approach it as I take
a little bit from both. Right. So,

1080
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,160
typically one of my sources will
be something I really enjoy. Um,

1081
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,830
I feel like if you're gonna spend between
three and six months on a project at

1082
01:10:11,831 --> 01:10:13,670
watching this floor storage every day,

1083
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:18,200
you probably don't want to
hate every minute of it,
right. Unless you're, you know,

1084
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:23,030
you're enjoy pain, you
know. Um, and so, you know,

1085
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:24,980
so I did a remix where I remixed the show.

1086
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:29,981
So you think you can dance with the
presidential debates from 2008 and let me

1087
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:33,960
tell you, I did not enjoy the time I
spent with the presidential debates. Uh,

1088
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:37,460
it was excruciating and
painful and every minute of it,

1089
01:10:37,461 --> 01:10:40,280
I know I spent as much time with the
transcript as I could because I didn't

1090
01:10:40,281 --> 01:10:45,020
actually want to watch the video again.
Um, but, uh, but then I mixed it with,

1091
01:10:45,021 --> 01:10:48,800
so we think and dance, which I actually
is a show that I, that I enjoy. Um,

1092
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:51,980
I feel there's a lot of constructive
criticism, sort of constructive criticism,

1093
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:56,450
reality TV show model as opposed to
the ridiculous and making everyone cry

1094
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:00,860
model, which is the more the x
factor kind of thing. So, um, uh,

1095
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:05,060
so be at the auditions
are a little bit sketchy,

1096
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:06,560
but after the auditions I feel like,
you know,

1097
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:10,100
so I think in dance is actually
gets to a lot of sort of feels very,

1098
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:12,170
it feels very different.
And so I liked that show.

1099
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:17,320
I Oxford like the dances and so I could
like stop with Mccain and Obama and go

1100
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:22,130
to, so wash them dances and
you know, really, um, and
enjoy my, my, my process with,

1101
01:11:22,131 --> 01:11:25,320
with, with that source. And I was kind of
a fan of that source. And so now for me,

1102
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:29,850
I really love aspects of one thing and
I really dislike aspects of something

1103
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:33,660
else. Um, but I think what
that gets back to is to,

1104
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:37,310
is this idea that in the United States
especially, we have this idea that you're,

1105
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,890
you, you either love something or hate
something, right? It's sort of like this,

1106
01:11:40,891 --> 01:11:45,090
this, this rigid, dogmatic binary. Um,

1107
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,810
but I, I feel like when you're engaging
with media and when a lot of people are

1108
01:11:48,811 --> 01:11:51,210
engaging with media that isn't
made specifically for them. Like,

1109
01:11:51,211 --> 01:11:54,690
I'm very lucky because most media is
made specifically for me. Like literally,

1110
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:59,450
they have a picture of me in mind,
right? A white, straight middleclass,

1111
01:12:00,410 --> 01:12:04,560
uh, English speaking
American, you know, um, uh,

1112
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:08,430
and so they're making it for me. I,
Star Wars was made specifically for me,

1113
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:13,260
mostly because most of the people
who were making these things are me.

1114
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,670
Right? I mean, there, there
have been exactly my age and
exactly my, and everything.

1115
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:21,690
So, um, uh, so I sort of expect
everything to be made for me.

1116
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:25,990
And so when it's not made for
me, I get all annoyed. Right.
Um, uh, or I used to, uh,

1117
01:12:25,991 --> 01:12:30,130
and, but if it's not made
for you specifically, like
if, if I happen to be a,

1118
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:35,060
if I happen to be queer, then I will
notice that this not made for me. Um,

1119
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:38,730
I, I can still enjoy it. Right?
Probably we'll probably do, but, uh,

1120
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,950
find something missing. Right.
Um, and so, you know, and if
you're coming from, um, uh,

1121
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:47,130
from various other ethnic
communities in the United States,

1122
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:50,790
you notice that media is not made
for you. Um, and so often people,

1123
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:52,150
what we'll do when they watch media is,

1124
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:54,590
is that that they'll have a
critical engagement, right?

1125
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:56,850
Just in sort of a casual
curriculum and engagement,

1126
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,630
which is that you can like some aspects
of it and be critical of other aspects

1127
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:05,430
of it. Um, and what fans and fan fiction
often does. It says, well, you know what,

1128
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,800
I really love the story.
I really love the concept.

1129
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:09,420
I really love being on
the spaceship or whatever.

1130
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:12,060
But it would be nice if there were
some people who kind of were like me,

1131
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:16,620
I'm on a ship or, or people that I know.
Um, and so, uh, that's that relationship,

1132
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:16,741
right?

1133
01:13:16,741 --> 01:13:20,040
It says loving something but being
critical at the same time and not having

1134
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:24,870
those things contradict. And I
feel like, um, when I approach my,

1135
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,180
my work,
I try to come from that perspective.

1136
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:29,303
Yeah.

1137
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,900
Well, software do you use, uh,

1138
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:40,540
well that's a good question.
I have a small list here.

1139
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:45,190
Assuming the Internet still works.
Um, it might be, yeah. Oh No,

1140
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,310
it's fair. It's just, it's just slow. Uh,

1141
01:13:48,311 --> 01:13:51,520
so I have some of the tools up
here on platform makes video. Um,

1142
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:53,680
so I use these,

1143
01:13:53,681 --> 01:13:58,681
these are mostly the free tools right
now in terms of like actual editing a,

1144
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:01,770
I'm using a falcon pro.
Um,

1145
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:06,220
but that is because there's no open
source alternative. Uh, there will be,

1146
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:11,380
as of December 19th, December 19th,
I will no longer be using, uh,

1147
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:15,820
I've, I'm gonna be using pocket probe
using light works and let works as an open

1148
01:14:15,821 --> 01:14:18,730
source professional video
editor. Um, uh, for instance,

1149
01:14:18,731 --> 01:14:22,060
detecting things that the king's speech
which won the academy award was edited.

1150
01:14:22,061 --> 01:14:23,260
Using light works.
Um,

1151
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:28,500
the Beta is available for a
PC and on December 19th basis,

1152
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:33,460
they promise it will be available
for Linux and Mac. Um, and so, uh,

1153
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,460
I'll, I'll move to that.
Um, uh, I use these,

1154
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:39,800
these various tools to
acquire media as well. Um,

1155
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,950
I mean I get money from everywhere
and I get the, any from,

1156
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:46,970
from youtube and I get media
from, uh, from bittorrent.
I get media from me. I mean,

1157
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,840
depending on where I can get it. Uh,
I ripped DVDs, you know, all, all the,

1158
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:54,400
all anywhere. You can kind of get it. Um,
uh, in some cases you have to, you know,

1159
01:14:54,401 --> 01:14:56,290
the crew though the Donald Duck one,
there was one clip,

1160
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,480
there's a clip of the
Ajax employment agency.

1161
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,530
And so if you don't know a lot about
Disney does Disney, and you're like acme,

1162
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,860
the Acme company, the Acme
Corporation is this big looney tunes.

1163
01:15:05,861 --> 01:15:08,830
Like it literally is the only
company and all of Linton's. Well,

1164
01:15:08,831 --> 01:15:12,890
in Disney it's called Ajax. So it's the
same concept. There's one company. Um,

1165
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,970
and so there's this, there's this
great scene where, you know, there's a,

1166
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:17,500
the Ajax employment agency,

1167
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:20,890
and that was a piece of footage that
I really wanted to use. However,

1168
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,080
that piece of footage only exists as
filler footage between other cartoons,

1169
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:31,360
uh, on the wonderful world of Disney
television show aired in the 1970s,

1170
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:36,240
eighties. So if you don't have that and
no DVD, so if you don't have that, uh,

1171
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:37,511
can I do it?

1172
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:42,100
So I had to find someone who was a
collector and who was like a obsessive

1173
01:15:42,101 --> 01:15:47,101
compulsive collector of Disney material
who had a recording at when the show

1174
01:15:48,491 --> 01:15:50,950
aired in the mid eighties, I think on, um,

1175
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,550
on the BBC in Manchester in the UK.

1176
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,770
And he had a video tape of it and it was
able to trade with him via a very long

1177
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:04,120
process. Something else that he didn't
have there was also very rare, uh,

1178
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:08,020
so that he would then make a DVD rip
of that fee videotape. And then, right.

1179
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:11,320
So there's a lot of software
involved in all that stuff. Um, uh,

1180
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:13,720
but this is the main stuff that I use
and I'm going to, I'm out with my, on my,

1181
01:16:13,721 --> 01:16:16,750
on my workshop tomorrow. I'll
talk about it, we'll go over it

1182
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:22,350
on your, on your list of topics. I
say you have a negative one in there.

1183
01:16:22,351 --> 01:16:26,410
And a negative, as I recall,
was about 10 years ago.

1184
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:30,370
Got to a massive copy, right?
Metals, yes. A bad name to. Yes. And,

1185
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:31,600
um,

1186
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:35,680
my question is when you're talking
about about locking higher cars,

1187
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,690
directors were risking that richer,

1188
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:43,710
more powerful kind of shut
you down. Um, and why do you,

1189
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:48,060
why? The question is how have you, I
mean obviously you're here at tech.

1190
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,610
That's what'd,
which,

1191
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,290
which is the corporation that is
basically written the cover. It was,

1192
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:55,600
was it just the United
States right now? Um, so,

1193
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:59,650
so when you're advocating the
use of this up was remission, um,

1194
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,970
are you not also suggesting
that people are not

1195
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:09,800
completely aware of all the power sectors?
Maybe asking for a lot of troubles?

1196
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:10,130
I mean,

1197
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,370
you could get into a lot of
trouble this. Yeah. I mean,

1198
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,700
yes,
yes and no.

1199
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:24,530
I feel like, um, some of the
reasons why I say yes and no,

1200
01:17:24,531 --> 01:17:28,370
it's because of the provisions in
the DMC. Yay. Um, so for instance,

1201
01:17:28,371 --> 01:17:32,390
I was to Remix Disney. First
of all, Disney's didn't care
so much about copyright,

1202
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:37,760
how strangely, they care a lot
about trademark. Uh, and so,

1203
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:38,000
uh,

1204
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,390
what they care about is whether I sell
a tee shirt with Mickey mouse on it and

1205
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:43,220
they don't get the profits.
That's what they care about.

1206
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:45,950
Or that I put Disney on the side
of my daycare center or something.

1207
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,470
That's what they care
about, what they, they,

1208
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:52,400
but you can watch every single Disney
cartoon from the golden era on Youtube.

1209
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:56,960
They have been uploaded by whoever for
free. And because I think that they're,

1210
01:17:56,990 --> 01:18:00,260
their reasoning in that is that this has
just sort of more brand recognition and

1211
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:02,530
that's good. Um, so, uh,

1212
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:05,630
I wasn't actually afraid of being
sued by them for that reason. Uh,

1213
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,730
this is not commercial projects, so I
thought that was okay. I also have, um,

1214
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:13,810
a lot of friends who are fair use
lawyers, so I have that in my corner. Um,

1215
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,640
but even if I didn't,
uh,

1216
01:18:16,641 --> 01:18:20,420
what's the worst that could happen is
that I'm not hosting the video or most

1217
01:18:20,421 --> 01:18:22,760
people are not hosting the video. I
mean, I, I'm actually hosting the video,

1218
01:18:22,761 --> 01:18:27,120
but most people aren't. Most
people getting Google to
host the video. Right. Um,

1219
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:30,830
and in the DMC Aa,
the way that it's that it's worded,

1220
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:35,750
is it something called the
safe harbor provision, which,
uh, basically protects, um,

1221
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:38,420
youtube or Vimeo or whatever the,

1222
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:42,500
the middleman is right from lawsuits.

1223
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:47,890
And so what will happen is
if they uploaded something
that Nike or Disney didn't

1224
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:52,370
like or Mattel didn't like me to tell,
notorious actually, um, didn't like,

1225
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:56,620
uh, they would send a new sort of
all happened inside of Youtube,

1226
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:59,670
extra judicial process inside of the
DMC, a safe harbor, which is like,

1227
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,450
which is that I would upload something,
uh,

1228
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:06,830
Disney would send a takedown message,
not a notice because it's not legal,

1229
01:19:06,831 --> 01:19:10,880
it's extra legal to Google Youtube.

1230
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,780
They would then remove it under the safe
harbor harbor version with no questions

1231
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:17,270
asked.
If I wanted to get it back,

1232
01:19:17,271 --> 01:19:20,300
I would have to fill out
a form that said this. No,

1233
01:19:20,301 --> 01:19:22,700
I think this is a fair use in hand.
Here's why. And it might come back,

1234
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:25,970
but I again, I'm not ever
being contacted, right.

1235
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:30,200
Unless I actually file a counterclaim
with Disney. Right. Which is,

1236
01:19:30,201 --> 01:19:33,470
which is a whole different thing. It's
all youtube and youtube system. That's,

1237
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:36,590
that's, that's working. So I'm not
actually going to be sued, right.

1238
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:40,820
Unless I took it and put it the actual
video file on my thing on my site,

1239
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:44,210
which people couldn't share you, you
know, it'd be be be, be a weird thing.

1240
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:47,860
It has happened. I think
it's becoming, it's be,

1241
01:19:47,861 --> 01:19:50,810
it's pretty rare and often it blows up
in the face of the, of the media company.

1242
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:54,880
Right. So it's, um, I feel like,
you know, in terms of this one, uh,

1243
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:58,140
they just felt like, well,
if we say if we take it down,

1244
01:19:58,141 --> 01:20:01,820
that's just going to make it more
popular and you know, we won't do that.

1245
01:20:01,821 --> 01:20:05,640
So I feel like most media companies
are pretty smart about it. Um,

1246
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:10,920
if it was a, a project, it would still
be fair use, but that, that, that,

1247
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:14,870
that might earth than a little
bit. I, you know, um, but I'm,

1248
01:20:14,871 --> 01:20:17,170
I'm actually not concerned. I think
there's very, you know, people,

1249
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,410
the worst that's going to happen to
most people is everybody is going to get

1250
01:20:19,411 --> 01:20:23,820
taken down by youtube and
with no legal action taken.

1251
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:25,873
Oh,

1252
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:33,260
you give an example of how you might
describe as a student assignment in a

1253
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:35,850
course where you wanted to

1254
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,240
introduce them to new media,

1255
01:20:39,241 --> 01:20:42,130
get them thinking about it
and actually doing some B,

1256
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:44,930
what that assignment would look like.

1257
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,110
Uh,
I can I,

1258
01:20:48,111 --> 01:20:51,320
can I come to tell you about assignments
that I've given and that could be

1259
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:54,950
helpful? Maybe. Um, so one of
the things that I've found,

1260
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:57,560
and this is this true for,
um,

1261
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:01,370
for organizations that are trying to get
people to engage with social media as

1262
01:21:01,371 --> 01:21:04,250
well. I mean, if you're talking
about remix specifically,

1263
01:21:04,251 --> 01:21:06,420
which is mostly what I do,
um,

1264
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:11,390
it's often really important to set
the parameters for what you expect,

1265
01:21:11,391 --> 01:21:13,670
right?
It's so sort of the last thing you,

1266
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:17,380
the I think you want to do
is say go make a remix, uh,

1267
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:22,520
anything using anything. Um, because often
that, that's just so overwhelming, right?

1268
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:25,490
Um, I, what would I often
advocate for is to say, you know,

1269
01:21:25,491 --> 01:21:29,300
here's a piece of media or
here, two pieces of media,
or here's a series of ads,

1270
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:31,420
Bucko Cola or whatever it is.
Um,

1271
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:34,340
and I want you to use them in some way
to make a comment on them, but you,

1272
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,400
you keep, you know, you, you,

1273
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:39,940
you want to allow enough creativity
for there to be a lot of, um,

1274
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,510
all of diversity in the response.

1275
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:45,380
But you also don't want to sort of allow
for anything because that will be a

1276
01:21:45,381 --> 01:21:48,380
really overwhelming I think. Um, and
so often what I'll do like, you know,

1277
01:21:48,381 --> 01:21:52,040
in terms of the, of of the
re mixing tool, right? Um,

1278
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:53,653
there's,

1279
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:58,100
there's 800 possibilities and
they're all different possibilities,

1280
01:21:58,101 --> 01:22:01,670
but it's within a very
specific set of assignments.
So it's like saying, you know,

1281
01:22:01,671 --> 01:22:06,260
it's just saying swapped the audio and
the video from these two sets of sources

1282
01:22:06,261 --> 01:22:11,000
and see what you get. Um, um, and
so, you know, I, you can do this on,

1283
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:15,620
you know, on the web or you could, you
could do a similar project you're using,

1284
01:22:15,621 --> 01:22:20,590
you know, ads for cleaning products and
tools and household, adult, you know,

1285
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:25,460
gendered stuff. And you could say, swap
the audio in the video. Um, there are, uh,

1286
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,020
image macros is another thing
that I then I often will use. Um,

1287
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:32,150
so they're all these sites that will allow
you to top load a photograph and then

1288
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:37,430
each person can type a different
sentence onto that, onto that. Right.

1289
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:41,930
Um, and so it might be depending on what
your image is and what your, what your,

1290
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:45,620
what your, what your topic is like the
privilege denying dude was about, um,

1291
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:49,640
was what was sort of about
highlighting in a funny way,

1292
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:53,330
a male privilege and the way that it
sort of manifests in the tech field

1293
01:22:53,331 --> 01:22:56,650
especially, but it sort of, you know,
went and talk kinds of directions. I mean,

1294
01:22:56,860 --> 01:23:01,500
there, there was a,
after, um, uh, after, uh,

1295
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,710
the video monster came out, which is
a very sort of misogynist, um, uh,

1296
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:11,190
video for, uh, Mr. West Song. Um, it,

1297
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:15,790
it, someone made a privilege in nine dude
of him and do sort of like swapped out,

1298
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:20,980
you know. All right, so you're, you're
then commenting on, you're using this,

1299
01:23:20,981 --> 01:23:25,590
this larger meme to comment on a
specific artist and a specific song. Um,

1300
01:23:25,591 --> 01:23:29,980
and so, um, often that kind of thing can
be, can be, can be cool. It can be like,

1301
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:33,010
well, here's a, here's an
image macro where you can
type text on top of something.

1302
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,630
It's about this sort of theme,

1303
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,710
but then find other other characters
that might work. So whether it's Tucker,

1304
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:43,940
Tucker, Tucker Carlson was one of them
that people used. Um, uh, there was,

1305
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:47,110
there was a thing that happened with
the Keith Olbermann where he said some

1306
01:23:47,111 --> 01:23:50,000
pretty sexist stuff and then refuse to
apologize for it. People may want of him,

1307
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:53,290
you know, for that, that was up for a
couple months. And so, you know, the,

1308
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:56,860
the privilege of dude mean became more
than just, you know, it's, it's very,

1309
01:23:56,861 --> 01:24:00,640
it's very, very simple. It's, it's
one image and two sentences, right?

1310
01:24:00,641 --> 01:24:03,520
And in infinite combinations,
but that's it. And then you can,

1311
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:07,990
you can swap out another image on the
same theme with two sentences, right?

1312
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:11,620
So it's just sort of
constricting the possibilities,

1313
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:16,621
but in that construction of possibilities
to creativity can become even more,

1314
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:20,830
uh, even more exciting, I think.
So those are just some quick stuff.

1315
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:38,870
You mean my life story?
You want to know how old

1316
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:46,830
field or, um, so yeah. So, um,

1317
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:51,810
so it's a, it's a long story.
Uh, I want to try to condense it.

1318
01:24:51,811 --> 01:24:55,380
I tend to go on and on. So, um, I, uh,

1319
01:24:56,050 --> 01:25:00,720
I was homeschooled. Um, and so, um,
for religious and military reasons,

1320
01:25:01,290 --> 01:25:05,160
um, my family's very
conservative and, and uh,

1321
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,090
which I'm not, but uh, they are. And, um,

1322
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,430
until I spent a lot of time
playing has education. So my,

1323
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,380
in a very odd way,

1324
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,950
the reason I was being kept
home was because of very,

1325
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,380
very fundamentalist religious beliefs.

1326
01:25:22,381 --> 01:25:25,830
But the educational philosophy
is that my parents had,

1327
01:25:25,831 --> 01:25:30,720
was actually very progressive. Um,
so it sort of an unschooling process.

1328
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,800
And so,
um,

1329
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:35,940
a lot of that was sort of a
facilitated or directed play,

1330
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:40,110
right? So a lot of Legos and a lot of
audio books and a lot of, you know,

1331
01:25:40,111 --> 01:25:41,490
a lot of projects that I could,

1332
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,860
that I could sort of follow me out of
my interests. Um, and so, uh, you know,

1333
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:51,930
in that process of, of, um, of learning,

1334
01:25:51,931 --> 01:25:52,980
learning was always fun for me.

1335
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:56,100
It always about finding things out and
figuring things out. And, you know, like,

1336
01:25:56,101 --> 01:25:58,860
I mean for me, researching
the history of, of, of,

1337
01:25:58,861 --> 01:26:02,040
of the Disney animators at the studio
was really kind of fun because, you know,

1338
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:05,210
I wanna know what's happening. Each thing
I learned, I feel like it's, it's, it's,

1339
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:06,680
it's a fun game,
right?

1340
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:11,420
But I feel like that a little bit
unique to a very specific kind of

1341
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:15,740
homeschooling. Oh, philosophy.
And, um, and so when I went,

1342
01:26:15,741 --> 01:26:19,250
when I did go to high school, I went to
a magnet art school in Baltimore City.

1343
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,380
And, um, and it was, it was sort of a, it
was a very, uh, it was very structured,

1344
01:26:24,381 --> 01:26:26,390
but it was also a, you know,
it was it an art school.

1345
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,620
So I was doing picker painting
and drawing, and I was doing,

1346
01:26:28,621 --> 01:26:32,870
I was really interested in, in, in, in,
in artistic creation. Um, I went to,

1347
01:26:32,871 --> 01:26:36,290
I went to college, I went to school. I
had no grades, no attendance records,

1348
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:41,360
you know, um, uh, there
was no required courses.

1349
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:44,930
I mean, you could literally
not go the entire semester,

1350
01:26:44,931 --> 01:26:46,700
but then you wouldn't get any credits.
I mean,

1351
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,400
the way that you got credits was
that you presented your work,

1352
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:54,790
everything you'd done in every field that
you were interested in for that entire

1353
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:57,680
year, and they gave you
credit space on that or not.

1354
01:26:57,681 --> 01:27:02,120
So 15 credits or zero credits,
you still have to pay for it either way.

1355
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:05,690
Um, but you, um, that was, that
was sort of very hovers it,

1356
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:08,330
it's very high pressure and a lot of ways,
but it sort of let you self direct.

1357
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:11,700
And so that was what I was interested in,
in, in, in doing and figuring out. Um,

1358
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,920
there's also no majors at that school,

1359
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,950
the museum school in Boston
Museum School in Boston, um,

1360
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:22,330
no major. So you could bounce between
disciplines. I mean, and the, I,

1361
01:27:22,331 --> 01:27:26,150
the idea being that if you're being, if
you're a creative or sort of artistic, uh,

1362
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,680
in, in, in, in your work,

1363
01:27:27,681 --> 01:27:31,970
then you will just find whatever medium
it is that best represents the idea that

1364
01:27:31,971 --> 01:27:34,670
you're trying to get across. And so that's
what we do. I'd be like, Oh, you know,

1365
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,040
this,
this idea would best work in animation,

1366
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:41,440
so I'll go and learn that next
semester, you know, or whatever. Um, um,

1367
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:44,780
but he allowed me to learn technology
in a way that I wouldn't have otherwise,

1368
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:45,880
which is that,
you know,

1369
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:50,330
most of the time I just camped out in
the Mac lab and eventually they gave me a

1370
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:54,740
job there. And then, uh, cause I was just
there all the time and then, uh, and,

1371
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:59,630
and learned and taught applications
that way, um, including video editing.

1372
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:03,890
Um, and then when the, when the war in
Iraq started, I was very upset and, uh,

1373
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:08,870
I took the, just recorded the TV ads
and all and put them together into,

1374
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:12,130
into remixes and that sort of how
that process happened. And, and,

1375
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:16,660
and in that process of, of, of,
of doing and learning, you know,

1376
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:20,830
I mean certainly there was no class on
remix. Um, but doing and learning, um,

1377
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:23,600
and figuring out, well, I want to put this
on the Internet, but there's no youtube,

1378
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:25,900
no, 2003. What do you do? A,

1379
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,930
I guess you have to find the Kodak and
then you'd have to find some software

1380
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:31,740
somewhere that we'll put it up.
And then you have to, you know,

1381
01:28:31,741 --> 01:28:34,850
like get a server and like all that stuff.
And so I did all that stuff. And, um,

1382
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:40,130
and that's sort of how I've learned over
time is by doing that, is that helpful?

1383
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:43,670
Is that kind of what you meant? And
then, then he invited me to come here. So

1384
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,460
that's the short version

1385
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:52,713
five.

1386
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,020
Yeah. I mean, all of them
to leave by the way I look

1387
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,030
or talk or ask questions.
I mean,

1388
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:24,250
sure.
