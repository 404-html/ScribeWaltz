1
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,030
Uh,
my name is Jonathan Macintosh and I do,

2
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,470
I do video remixes and I call
myself a pop culture hacker. Uh,

3
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,770
which basically means that I
pull apart fragments of TV,

4
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,490
movies, hop music. Um, I pulled them
apart and look for their deeper meanings,

5
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,170
um, look for the social and
cultural context and implication is,

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,070
and then put them back together to
create a new and alternative narratives.

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,590
Um, so it's really mixing
footage and mixing music,

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,950
but it's also real mixing
the message of that media.

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,160
I began remixing in 2003.
Um,

10
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,950
I was watching the US invasion of Iraq.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
I was very upset about it.
Uh,

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,430
I was very angry about it and I was
watching the news every day, you know,

13
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,910
24 hours a day, pretty much,
you know, watching, watching,
and recording and also, um,

14
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,840
and after the first few days, they start
to put the commercials back in, you know,

15
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:19,090
that they had, this is what I have
the news report, the commercial,

16
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:22,510
the news report, the commercial.
Right. Um, and to me it became,

17
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,970
they started to become the same thing.
You know,

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,650
because many of the companies that make
the weapons also on the new station,

19
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,750
you know, um, and uh,

20
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:34,340
and so I started mixing those two together
and I made very short ads and they

21
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:37,930
were about the war and they were about
the US involvement in the war. And, uh,

22
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,130
the corporatization of war and the profit
that people were making off of that,

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,100
when you cross into the blue,
everything is different and important,

24
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,210
especially you.

25
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,960
I was being critical.

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,140
And then I also was very upset about the
way that the u s media covered the war

27
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:06,330
too. You know, they wouldn't
show anyone who was dead.

28
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,410
There was no impact really
in terms of, uh, of humanity.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,630
And it was all about how
cool the weapons were.

30
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,983
Yeah.

31
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,190
For me, that was distasteful, but
it was also, I think the moral,

32
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,810
and so a lot of the remixes that I
made was to put those images back in.

33
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,900
So it's that, you know, mixing the ads
for, for cars or, or, um, you know,

34
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,210
toothpaste or whatever
with the news footage.

35
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:37,510
But then also bringing in some of the
documentary footage that we didn't see in

36
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:41,020
the u s um, of, of, of
people who had been killed.

37
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,590
Would you like to do with your life?

38
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,220
You want to be like the good guys
riding around? No, to be honest,

39
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,930
I want to be the bad guy.
Real bad guys.

40
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,690
Bad guys at tie people up.

41
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,443
Trump

42
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,380
cares about the good guys,
bad guys.

43
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,240
They're the ones you may
go back to class now, Gary,

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,020
get strength for now. Strength
for later. Learn more@goarmy.com

45
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,870
TV, movies, news, right?
A politician's speeches.

46
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,260
They're part of the popular culture
and they're part of the way the,

47
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,180
the language we use to talk to each other.
You know,

48
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,270
we might meet for a coffee and say,
what did you see that on TV last night?

49
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:42,610
And you say, Oh yeah, yeah, I saw
that. And we talk about it, right?

50
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,900
It's a common language.

51
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,770
The common ground through which we can
talk about larger issues, you know, race,

52
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:50,260
gender, class, a war, right?

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,990
And we can do it in a
language that's audio visual.

54
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,110
We don't have to speak the words
so we don't have to use text,

55
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,030
but we can also use the videos
themselves or the audio itself. Um,

56
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,280
as a way of communicating.

57
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,860
One of the projects that I've been doing
with, um, young people, Middle School,

58
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:12,820
so like 11, 12 years old, um, uh, I've,

59
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:17,080
I've recorded a bunch of TV ads
directed at kids for Gi Joe, for Barbie,

60
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:21,560
for Polly pocket, you know, all these
toys and brought them into the classroom.

61
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,570
And, and, and we,

62
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:26,140
and these workshops and the young people
look at them and then we talk about

63
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:30,170
them. What are the boys doing? What are
the girls doing? The boys though are,

64
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:33,010
are creating and they're building
and they're making things,

65
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,910
but they're also being quite violent. You
know, a lot of, a lot of military stuff.

66
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,680
Um, a lot of competition,
a lot of aggression, right?
Whereas on the other side,

67
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,260
the young,

68
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,910
young women in those ads are being caring
and nurturing and some positive stuff

69
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,620
too.
So we talk about all that.

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,210
And then I have the kids remix the ads.
You know,

71
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:56,410
just take the audio from the girls' ads
and put it on the video of the boys ads

72
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,860
for five years,

73
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,630
it's suddenly become incredibly
apparent. You know, it's just,

74
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:14,080
it's really obvious to everyone and
everyone sort of laughing and, right.

75
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,410
But you're also seeing it,
you're seeing what they're doing,

76
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,880
what they're telling you about gender,

77
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,870
you're seeing those gender stereotypes
and you're breaking them down and

78
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:27,280
creating something new right
now, a different vision. Um,

79
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,370
and so I find that is a very
powerful tool, uh, with, with youth.

80
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,360
And then when they,
when they go home,

81
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,490
hopefully when they go
home and watch TV again,

82
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,490
they can't watch it the same way
because they're always thinking, oh,

83
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,770
wouldn't that be interesting if these
two things are, what about that?

84
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,320
What does the message messaging
and what if I mixed it with this?

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,370
And wouldn't that be funny or interesting?
You know? Um, and so it's, it's creating,

86
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,630
um,
hopefully it's,

87
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,050
it's creating in the minds of young
people and more critical way of watching

88
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:54,010
television. We're in a dark, dark place.

89
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,410
We've got some dark dudes coming our way.
Alcaide ran Islamic Jihad

90

Mexico, China. Everyone is coming.

92
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,360
The enemy is not only in the
gates there inside the house,

93
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,130
again,
be at most come up Liam pestle.

94
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,190
Oh La Mex.
