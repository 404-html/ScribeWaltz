1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,030
The last jedi is a movie that's designed
to subvert audience expectations.

2
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,740
Nowhere is this more evident
than in the way the film handles.

3
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:23,360
It's three male heroes,

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,050
x wing pilot Po Damron
when the gates to him,

5
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:31,220
Trooper Finn and legendary Jedi Knight,
Luke Skywalker.

6
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,080
Initially,

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,400
all three characters seem like they
should fit neatly into familiar archetypes

8
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,380
for men in action adventure films
in Po,

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,470
we expect the hot shot fighter pilot who
celebrated for blowing up the bad guys

10
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:49,693
in Finn,

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,790
we expect the noble defector who is
determined to take down an unjust system.

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,030
And in Luke we expect the wise warrior
who wields tremendous power in the name

13
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:02,990
of fighting evil,

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,610
but in each case the last jet,

15
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:12,200
I doesn't deliver on those expectations,
at least not immediately.

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,453
Instead,

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,690
director Ryan Johnson throws
fans a series of curve balls

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,990
over the course of the first act.

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,500
Fin reveals his self centered
and defeatist attitude.

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Po proves that he's reckless and arrogant
and Luke is so consumed by paralyzing

21
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:34,040
guilt that he's renounced the
Jetta I and become a hermit.

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,360
These unexpected character twists are
part of the reason why some star wars fans

23
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,670
left the theater in a state of shock,

24
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,840
which rapidly mutated into
fits of rage on the Internet.

25
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,900
Now to be clear,

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,200
we're not talking about people who just
happen to dislike the last Jetta media

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,290
is after all, not a perfect
piece of cinema. No.

28
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:05,291
We're talking about the subset of mostly
male super fans who felt betrayed and

29
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,440
personally disrespected by
this movie or anything else.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,270
The objections from that
particular group are wide ranging.

31
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:15,770
The two were accompanied by a girl,

32
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,450
but they often involve an obsessive
level of scrutiny when it comes to female

33
00:02:20,451 --> 00:02:21,284
characters.

34
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,580
On the more extreme end of the spectrum,

35
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,670
band complaints have a tendency to devolve
into wild conspiracy theories about

36
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:36,731
the Disney corporation pushing an
agenda of forced diversity or feminist

37
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:37,934
propaganda,

38
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,430
but there is a common thread
running through much of
the backlash that speaks to

39
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:48,431
an underlying anxiety and anxiety
rooted in deep seated insecurities about

40
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:50,174
masculinity.

41
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,560
Let me briefly explain
what I mean by that.

42
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:01,120
Leading men in action adventure
movies are expected to be decisive,

43
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,440
righteous, respected, and to take charge.

44
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,910
In most situations,

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,960
men are expected to achieve success by
becoming progressively more and more

46
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:15,940
powerful as the story unfolds.

47
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,390
This expectation is part of a long
running tradition in Hollywood and the

48
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:27,391
formula is so entrenched in mass media
that many fans feel aggressively entitled

49
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,070
to seeing that particular version of
manhood reproduced on the big screen,

50
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,240
but as the last gen I begins,

51
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,340
it quickly becomes apparent that this
movie is an interested in catering to a

52
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,350
simple vicarious power fantasy.

53
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,270
All three male heroes are presented as
vulnerable in their fallibility with each

54
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:58,171
displaying their own set of
rather significant character
flaws and inadequacies.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,620
Now, flawed heroes in and of themselves
aren't all that unusual in speculative

56
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,210
fiction.
In fact,

57
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,390
failure and then learning to overcome
that failure is just the standard recipe

58
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,400
for structuring a basic character arc.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,980
I'd argue the intense fan hate surrounding
the last Jedi has a lot more to do

60
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:28,150
with the fact that the male heroes in
this movie are directly challenged on

61
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:30,070
their failures by women.

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,300
This is not something
that's supposed to happen.

63
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,700
The space cowboys or space
wizards in Hollywood blockbusters.

64
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,050
Women aren't supposed to interfere
with a man's heroic journey.

65
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,530
So let's dig a little deeper into
the unexpected ways that men are held

66
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:56,530
accountable for their behavior
in each of the movies.

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,540
Three intersecting storylines,

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,470
as many critics noted when the
last jet I first hit theaters.

69
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,650
The theme of Women Challenging
Male Bravado is most
evident in the character arc

70
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,860
of Poe.
Damron Po is a hot shot fighter pilot.

71
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,350
He's impulsive,
he is arrogant,

72
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,100
no come back.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,800
And he cares more about being a big
damn hero than he does about effective

74
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:27,920
strategy or even the
lives of his compatriots.

75
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,650
The Gung Ho rebel pilot is a familiar
archetype and star wars media.

76
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,430
And as a result, we think we
know how it's going to play out.

77
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,820
Audiences expect the good guys to bring
down the enemy death machine in a giant

78
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:44,654
ball of fire.

79
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,490
And we expect to revel in
the joyful spectacle of
impossible explosions in outer

80
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:54,490
space.
Dread not down,

81
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,050
but instead of framing pose,

82
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,770
raid on the dreadnought
as cause for celebration,

83
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,580
the movie suddenly pulls
the rug out from under us.

84
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,370
You're demoted, what weight?
We took down, a dread not cost.

85
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,520
There are things that you
cannot solve like Joffrey,

86
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,530
excellent and blowing something up.
We'll learn.

87
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,590
Po is rebuked for his apparent victory
and by extension the audience has rebuked

88
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:25,250
for enjoying the fireworks.

89
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,200
Those explosions that we were taking
such pleasure in just moments ago are

90
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:35,201
abruptly reframed as cause
for self reflection and
sadness and we find ourselves

91
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,270
suddenly confronted with a
narrative about consequences

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,500
for some star wars fans.

93
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,390
It must've felt as if Princess Leia had
just reached out of the movie screen and

94
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,430
personally slapped them across the face.

95
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,373
Yes.

96
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Now it's noteworthy that blowing up the
space fascist death ray isn't framed as

97
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:01,710
morally wrong.

98
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:08,020
Instead we're asked to consider
the tactical and human cost of that

99
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,923
violence.

100
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,800
If ever a beloved leader is incapacitated,

101
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,020
we expect our brash hero to
suddenly find themselves in command,

102
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,330
but that doesn't happen either.

103
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,870
The chain of command is clear
as to who should take her place.

104
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,530
Vice Admiral Hodo off the cruise and
then Vice Admiral Geraldo is even less

105
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:39,280
sympathetic to pose attitude.
Then general layer.

106
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,380
I've dealt with plenty of trigger happy
fly boys like you. You're impulsive,

107
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,300
dangerous,
and the last thing we need right now,

108
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,930
she harshly chastises Po
for his recklessness and
rightly dismisses his antics

109
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,220
as a liability to their mission.

110
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,260
And this is really what's at the heart
of why so many angry fans tend to hate

111
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,180
vice admiral holdovers characters so much.
That's what's got,

112
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
that's what you brought us too.

113
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,190
Get this man off Matt Rich Po Damron

114
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,260
story is that of a cocky,
headstrong,

115
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,210
never tell me the odd style male
hero who is repeatedly reprimanded.

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,800
You have bet the survival
of the resistance on bad
odds and put us all at risk

117
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,600
until he finally learns to listen to
and trust women in positions of power.

118
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,333
Okay,

119
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,800
as episode eight begins,
Finn is a man obsessed.

120
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,660
He wants nothing more than find his friend
Ray and then get as far away from the

121
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:46,280
war as he possibly can.

122
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,230
Fins intentions are selfish
and driven by a lack of faith.

123
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,220
He's convinced that the fight against
the first order is a lost cause.

124
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,130
Sorry if this fleet is doom did. If my
friend comes back to what she's doing too.

125
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,250
Enter rose Tyco,

126
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,150
a low ranking maintenance
worker who's a fan of fins,

127
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:11,450
exploits from the force awakens.
Got To get back to what I was doing.

128
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:16,080
So what were you doing when she
realizes he's not really the commitment

129
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,950
resistance hero that she's heard stories
about her disappointment is palpable.

130
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,150
Rose takes on the role of fins,
guide and mentor.

131
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,010
Hold on, come on. Look at this whole
place is beautiful. I need, come on.

132
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,760
Why do you hate it so much?
Look closer.

133
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,760
She is the one who pulls back the curtain
to expose the oppression festering

134
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:42,650
just below the surface of the galaxy.

135
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,680
And who do you think these people are?

136
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,310
There's only one business in the
galaxy that'll get you this rich

137
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,460
unlike layer and Holdco.
Rose holds no formal position of power,

138
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,970
but she does speak from a
position of moral authority.

139
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,830
I wish I could put my fist through
this whole lousy, beautiful town.

140
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,280
She articulates the political and moral
reasons why the resistance is necessary.

141
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,390
And in doing so,

142
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,540
she inspires Finn to finally
identify as a rebel voice.

143
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,790
God
rebel scope.

144
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,370
And it's her role as moral compass to
both Finn and to the audience that's

145
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:37,041
responsible for a good portion of the
rage directed at Rose's character from the

146
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:39,510
more toxic side of star wars fandom.

147
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,840
Many of these guys can't help but view
a woman who is serving as teacher to a

148
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:48,840
male hero as anything other than preachy,

149
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,050
annoying or emasculating.
Are you kidding me?

150
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,320
The fact that rose also happens to
be played by an actress of color only

151
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:59,850
magnifies their anger.

152
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,500
The other reason for the backlash against
rose is because she interrupts fins.

153
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:11,550
Big heroic sacrifice during
the film's final battle,

154
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,320
Faena embarks on a self
destructive charge.

155
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,150
His heart is finally in the right place,

156
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,710
but his judgment is clouded by his
eagerness to act on his new found

157
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:26,760
convictions.
Has the movie,

158
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:31,761
makes clear fins a suicide attack
is doomed to fail hotels him.

159
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,793
So

160
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,430
it's a suicide rose tells him so.

161
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,513
And we see

162
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,910
Hanes rickety air speeder
falling apart around him.

163
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,950
But Finn is so focused on striking a blow
against the first order that he can't

164
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:52,930
see how ineffective this strategy,

165
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,980
understanding that his
action amounts to a noble.

166
00:11:56,981 --> 00:12:01,570
But senseless sacrifice rose steps
in to save Finn from himself.

167
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,750
The heroic sacrifice is part
of a long tradition in media.

168
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,980
We're in death is framed as a way
for men to prove their bravery,

169
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,030
their convictions.
They are love and even their manhood

170
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,320
and movies tend to romanticize images
of men going out in a blaze of glory.

171
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,543
Yeah.

172
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,740
Even when their sacrifice is senseless,

173
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,260
ineffective or unnecessary.

174
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,700
This notion that death and
violent death in particular,

175
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,120
his redemptive or restorative for men is
so deeply ingrained in media that many

176
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:05,091
angry fans are adamant that fins misguided
kamikaze attack would have succeeded

177
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,340
despite the film explicitly
telling us otherwise.

178
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:13,910
These fans are incensed that a woman got
the big damn hero moment and she got it

179
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,390
in their view by robbing a male
hero of his chance at martyrdom.

180
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,120
Why would you stop me?
I saved you

181
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,690
when ray finally meets her hero.

182
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,900
The legendary did I night
isn't at all what she expected.

183
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,250
Luke Skywalker has become
a cynical old hermit,

184
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,820
a man so consumed by fear and guilt that
he's turned his back on the resistance

185
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,020
and closed himself off to the force.
Needless to say,

186
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,820
this comes as a tremendous shock
both to ray and to the audience.

187
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,300
Go Away.
Like Ray,

188
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,190
many star wars fans were expecting loop
to appear as a triumph and bad ass.

189
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,690
The one they remember or rather
misremember from the original trilogy.

190
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,500
The thing is, Luke was never really
depicted as a great [inaudible].

191
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,330
Hod Did you read my light saber?
Yeah.

192
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,400
When Luke says this,
seek what?

193
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,030
I'm going to walk out with a laser sword
and face down the whole first quarter.

194
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,170
His words are a reaction
to raise assumptions,

195
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,640
but those lines can also be read
as a response to fan expectations.

196
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,520
As I mentioned earlier, it's assumed
that Hollywood heroes, especially men,

197
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,700
will grow exponentially
more powerful over time.

198
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,280
The expectation is that once a
man has conquered his demons,

199
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,100
those demons will stay forever.

200
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,310
But even though Luke rejected the
dark side back in return of the Jedi,

201
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,010
I'll never turned to the dark side.

202
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,400
His struggle to resist the temptation
of absolute power isn't over for the

203
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,240
briefest moment of pure instinct.

204
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,510
All I could stop it and he's still scared
of the darkness hiding inside himself

205
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,580
just as he was as a young
man back on Diggaba.

206
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,270
Although this older version of Luke
Skywalker is consistent with his

207
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:30,340
characterization from
the original trilogy,

208
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,880
angry fans still believe that the last
Jedi represents a downgrading of his

209
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:37,840
power and his status.

210
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,870
I didn't see you.

211
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,350
The fan fury is exacerbated
by the fact that it's a young,

212
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,340
untrained female Jedi [inaudible].

213
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,740
I just feel so full from the fools
who challenges this mythic hero on his

214
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:54,574
failures.

215
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,610
Not only does this young woman
reprimand the Great Luke Skywalker,

216
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,560
I sent me here with a hope. If she
was wrong, she deserves to know why

217
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,253
we will do.

218
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:14,120
She directly confronts him and inspires
him to reconnect with the force

219
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,590
later on.
Yoda offers guidance too,

220
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,900
but it's a ray who opens the door for
Luke to overcome his paralyzing self

221
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:25,734
doubt.

222
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,770
Now
reach out.

223
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,110
So instead of seeing the old Jedi master
teaching ray how to wield the awesome

224
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,310
power of the force,

225
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,150
I feel something audiences are treated
to scenes in which ray reminds Luke what

226
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:48,650
it means to be a Jedi galaxy
may need a legend. Of course,

227
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:53,420
ray isn't a more powerful Jedi than Luke
and she ends up being wrong about her

228
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:55,010
ability to fix Kylo Ren,

229
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,640
but she does possess
something that he's lost.

230
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,810
Ray still has hope.
She still has conviction,

231
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,330
and she's still has clarity of purpose.

232
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,240
The idea that a young woman like ray
would have something important to teach an

233
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,270
older mythic male hero like Luke Skywalker
is a Roni Asley viewed by some male

234
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:18,680
fans as emasculating.

235
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,630
Yeah,

236
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,430
it's worth pointing out that angry fan
defensiveness isn't necessarily just a

237
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:31,300
reaction to women existing in
popular science fiction stories.

238
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,000
If women are included alongside male
heroes in a way that doesn't overshadow

239
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,230
upstage or interfere with traditional
expressions of masculinity,

240
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,280
let's get one thing straight.

241
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:46,540
I'm in charge out here and
you do everything I say
exactly as I say, just relax.

242
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,540
Then we don't see these same kind
of temper tantrums for male fans,

243
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,250
especially if the female characters
in question are cast as young,

244
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,470
white and conventionally attractive.

245
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,740
The last Jed, I isn't satisfied
with simply including women.

246
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,400
It goes much further and puts female
characters in positions of institutional

247
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:14,370
power or moral authority over male heroes.

248
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,350
The movie then has those women leverage
that power to challenge and ultimately

249
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:23,730
forced change in men's behavior

250
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,740
and that is almost unheard of in a major
blockbuster film in the end are three

251
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:36,840
male heroes face up to their
mistakes and overcome their failures.

252
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,540
Ho learns from Leah and Holdco to put
aside his desire for heroic short term

253
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:46,350
gains. Let's go wait, wait, and
instead consider the bigger picture.

254
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,830
It's only through Rose's moral insights
that fin comes to believe in something

255
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:57,831
bigger than himself and ray succeeds in
inspiring Luke to be the best version of

256
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:03,951
himself again and ultimately to do the
exact thing he mocked her for earlier in

257
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:05,514
the film.

258
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,680
Luke does indeed end up walking out with
a laser sword and facing down the whole

259
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:11,514
first order.

260
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,390
Yeah.

261
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,660
Despite what the reactionary
conspiracy theorists claim.

262
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,080
This is not an agenda of
masculine inferiority.

263
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,290
Women in the last Jedi hold their
male counterparts accountable,

264
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:31,450
not out of animosity, but because
they genuinely care about them.

265
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,053
I like it.

266
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,810
Male heroes are not being diminished
or erased in this movie. In fact,

267
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:45,040
a lot of time and effort is devoted
to giving men transformative arcs.

268
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,200
The last Gen I is a story about men
learning to trust women's ideas and

269
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:57,241
decisions and then becoming better
people and better heroes because of it.

270
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,320
And while that might be an unexpected
message for a star wars story,

271
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,990
it's a vital lesson that men need to learn
if we are to achieve gender equality.

272
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,640
Thanks for watching these video essays.

273
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:19,030
Take a ridiculous amount of time
to write, edit, and produce.

274
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,920
So if you'd like to see more of them,

275
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,850
please consider going over to Patrion
and helping to fund my project there.

276
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,530
There's also a link to paypal in the
description below. In the coming months,

277
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:33,820
I'll be working on a few new video essays,
one of them on gun culture,

278
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,230
media and masculinity,

279
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,000
and another one on the ways that sexual
assault against men is often played for

280
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,970
comedy in Hollywood.
So until then,

281
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,340
thank you all so much for
your continued support.
