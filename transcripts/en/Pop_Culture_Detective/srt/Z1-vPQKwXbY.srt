1
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,030
Pixar is 2008 animated film.

2
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:10,940
Wally is a critically
acclaimed masterpiece,

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,190
about two adorable robots
falling in love. The, I'd argue,

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,750
it also serves as an excellent
example of sociological storytelling

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,650
like most of the best science fiction.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,540
This movie uses imaginative visions of
the future as a lens through which to

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:33,470
interrogate the social systems of today.
Now,

8
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:35,900
in order to explore how
well he accomplishes this,

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,790
we need to start with something that
makes this movie relatively unique and

10
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,400
that's the fact that it
doesn't have a villain,

11
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,350
at least not the kind we've come to
expect from a Disney owned a studio.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,640
This is how he handled things down.

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,410
Hollywood loves its larger
than life cartoonish billings.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,910
The villainous characters that appear on
the big screen are typically framed as

15
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,200
bad apples.

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,970
They do bad things because of their
personal deficiencies and nefarious

17
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,400
intention by

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,080
this formula makes for a simple
easy to understand plotlines,

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,490
but it also tends to reinforce
an individualistic worldview.

20
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,270
The individualistic worldview is a false
but widespread way of thinking in which

21
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:31,311
society is reduced to a
bunch of individuals home
making their own independent

22
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:34,680
choices.
The central idea.

23
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,830
Underpinning the individualistic model
of the world is that people do what they

24
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:40,704
are.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,330
People do bad things
because they are bad people.

26
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,300
According to this reductive framework,

27
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,630
injustice is a result of the
isolated actions of a few bad apples,

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,920
how day,
but that worldview,

29
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,300
like the Hollywood narratives that
are constructed around it minimizes or

30
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:08,301
completely ignores the important role
that social systems and institutions play

31
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:09,160
in our world

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,993
world.

33
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,100
Just build an economy.

34
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,230
Since Wally's narrative isn't built
around that traditional villain formula,

35
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,300
the movie presents us with a very
different worldview, a sociological one.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,540
It's not that this story doesn't have
antagonists or central conflicts.

37
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,280
It has both.

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,410
They just don't take the forms were
used to seeing in popular entertainment,

39
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,680
kosher ro robots.

40
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,600
The antagonist of Wally is the
film setting itself, the axiom,

41
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,523
starlight,

42
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,160
or more specifically the automated
systems that run the ship in words.

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,330
The villain of this movie is not a person.
It's an institution.

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,120
I should briefly mentioned that
the axioms, AI is named audit,

45
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,900
but unlike how 9,000 or other AI
villains auto is not sentient,

46
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,730
nor are his actions the result of a
malfunction auto can't make independent

47
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,564
choices.

48
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,820
All he can do is follow his preprogrammed
directives and in that sense,

49
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,030
auto isn't a traditional Disney villain.
Instead,

50
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,360
he functions as the voice of
the ship as an institution.

51
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,600
Okay. Let's quickly recap the plot
for those who haven't seen this movie.

52
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:41,434
Recently,

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,460
humans have abandoned earth
after polluting the planet
to the point where it's

54
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:46,750
no longer inhabitable.

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,480
The surviving population lives aboard
massive luxury star liners that are

56
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,920
drifting through space.

57
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,820
These automated galaxy cruisers are run
entirely by robots on behalf of the buy

58
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,750
in large corporation.
By and large,

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,180
by in large is essentially a
combination of Walmart, Mcdonald's,

60
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,860
Disney,
Ge,

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,870
and Starbucks all rolled into one time.

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,570
The company promised the
original passengers that
they would all be returned to

63
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,950
Earth once the planet

64
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,330
made little girl again.
There's plenty of space.

65
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,270
We'll clean up the mess while you're away.

66
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,050
That was over 700 years ago.
The jewel of the VNL fleet.

67
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,750
Over several generations.

68
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,850
The human passengers have
become so complacent in their
over indulgent lifestyle

69
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,560
that they've even forgotten how to walk
under their own power remains stationary.

70
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,370
The film's core conflict revolves
around individuals of both the human and

71
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:02,790
robotic variety,

72
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,920
realizing they're all participating in
a system larger than themselves and then

73
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:10,560
working together to break
free from that system.

74
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,870
And that premise that we as individuals
are always participating in something

75
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:23,181
larger than ourselves is the core concept
underpinning the field of sociology.

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,220
Those larger things that we're all
participating in are referred to as social

77
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:33,270
systems. Social systems are
interconnected arrangements,

78
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:38,271
structures and relationships that combine
to form a coherent hole as individual

79
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:40,470
members of society.

80
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,140
We are all always participating in
a range of different social systems.

81
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,220
So for example,

82
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,400
the family unit is a social system as
our schools and police departments and

83
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:56,850
corporations and whole

84
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,490
patriarchy and white supremacy are also
examples of complex interlocking social

85
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:08,090
systems. To paraphrase
sociologists, Alan G. Johnson,

86
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,480
it's the dynamic relationship between us
as individuals and these larger social

87
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:16,760
systems that makes social life happen

88
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,520
because the axiom Starliner functions
as a self contained social system.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,610
Let's use it to help illustrate
how all of this works.

90
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,400
Like all social systems.

91
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,550
The axiom includes sets of rules or social
norms which participants are expected

92
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:38,150
to adhere to in order to ensure
that the system functions smoothly.

93
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,310
In sociological terms,

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,020
these socially enforced expectations
are referred to as paths of least

95
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,290
resistance
in the movie.

96
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:52,820
We can see this process play out in the
directives that each of the robots must

97
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:57,821
follow and it's represented by literal
lines along which both the passengers and

98
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,860
the crew travel around the ship.

99
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,450
It's important to note that paths of
least resistance do not determine the

100
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:11,060
behavior of all individual human beings.

101
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,610
We are not robots after all,

102
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,150
and that means that we all have a choice
in how we participate in these social

103
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:23,930
systems. We can, if we choose,

104
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,660
step off the path of least resistance,

105
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,820
but doing so will likely lead to pressure
from others to get us back in line.

106
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,140
Let your timeline with
an important message.

107
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,940
The most succinct description of how paths
of least resistance operate that I've

108
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,520
ever seen uses the board game monopoly.

109
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,290
The monopoly example along with many of
the other concepts we've been discussing

110
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,060
can be found in the excellent book,
the forest and the trees by a sociologist,

111
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,140
Allen g Johnson.

112
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,800
He points out that monopoly functions
as a mini social system like all social

113
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:03,734
systems.

114
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,660
The game includes paths of least
resistance which can be found in the rules

115
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,860
inside the box.

116
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,790
All we really have to do is glance at
those rules and we can predict exactly how

117
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:18,140
people's behavior will be impacted.

118
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,770
Why don't we play me the path of least
resistance for players is to simply

119
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:25,130
follow the rules.

120
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,190
Refusing to adhere to the rules will
lead to push back from other players and

121
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:35,090
likely get you kicked out of the game
whenever the rules of the game are

122
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:39,470
followed and antagonistic.
Pattern of behavior will always emerge.

123
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,470
Guidance and that pattern
is one of a ruthless greed.

124
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,190
You're a little light here, dad. I'm
good for the rest. You know, I am.

125
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,050
Remember the game of monopoly is over
when one player has taken everything of

126
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:55,620
value from everyone else

127
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,190
to three way you little

128
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,270
laughter
as Johnson reminds us,

129
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,770
if we use an individualistic lens
to explain this pattern of behavior,

130
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,470
it leads to one explanation.
People are greedy.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,990
Remember that the core idea underpinning
the individualistic worldview is that

132
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:23,740
people do what they are.
So according to that,

133
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,270
people playing monopoly behave ingredient
ways because people are greedy.

134
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,730
Now the problem with that as
Johnson points out is that
most people don't behave

135
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:38,350
in ruthlessly greedy ways when
they're not playing monopoly. Sure,

136
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:41,410
all people have the capacity
for selfishness to some degree,

137
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,790
but the rules of monopoly not
only encouraged Gri behavior,

138
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,330
the rules actually make greedy behavior,

139
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,160
a necessary condition of participation.

140
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,270
The personal values of the players are
irrelevant to describing the game and its

141
00:09:57,611 --> 00:10:01,960
rules. It doesn't matter if you're a
Buddhist monk or a Wall Street banker.

142
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,170
If you play monopoly as
it's meant to be played,

143
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,080
you'll end up acting
like an absolute monster.

144
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,600
Yeah.

145
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,490
Paths of least resistance and their
outcomes vary greatly depending on which

146
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:17,610
social system we're talking about.
So in monopoly,

147
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,780
the outcome is greed on the axiom.
However,

148
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,800
the path of least resistance
for the passengers is to
be passive super consumers.

149
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,150
Many film reviewers noted that Wally
functions as a critique of consumer

150
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:40,350
capitalism, which it
undoubtedly does. However,

151
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,800
the film doesn't take the easy
route by vilifying individual,

152
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:47,910
by and large consumers.
In that way,

153
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,550
it's the opposite of
a film like idiocracy,

154
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,670
which is a movie I absolutely despise.

155
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,940
Idiocracy is also meant as
a critique of consumerism,

156
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,430
but it traffics in a brand of cynical,

157
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:05,520
elitist humor that ends
up blaming individuals,

158
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,320
often the most powerless and poorest of
people for the destructive actions of

159
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:14,610
corporations and governments.
To its credit,

160
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,150
that's not how Wally frames the
humans living aboard the axiom.

161
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:22,860
Starliner yes, they're complicit
in their situation and yes,

162
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,290
they enjoy the privileges
the system affords them.

163
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,460
If we were to use an individualistic
lens to explain their behavior,

164
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,290
we would be forced to conclude that the
captain and all the passengers acting

165
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,880
lazy, stupid, and apathetic ways
because they are naturally lazy,

166
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:40,890
stupid,
and apathetic people.

167
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,530
But since Wally is an example
of sociological storytelling,

168
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,900
it frames the passengers and the captain
as initially acting in the ways they do

169
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,050
because that's what the axioms
social systems expect from them.

170
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,970
Even the passengers,

171
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:02,971
physical appearance is a direct result
of the ship's systems and not a result of

172
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,050
their personal failings.

173
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,270
They are simply following the paths of
least resistance that are laid out for

174
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,104
them,

175
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,970
and that means the passengers are not
defined by their complicit role in that

176
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:19,900
system. They have the capacity
to grow and break free,

177
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,670
and I'd argue that that idea that people
can change how we engage with social

178
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:32,671
systems and in so doing transform or even
abolish those systems isn't incredibly

179
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:34,470
hopeful.
Message

180
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:42,000
paths of least resistance in the real
world are rarely as well defined as the

181
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:45,150
directives aboard the axiom
or the rules of a board game.

182
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,670
The social expectations in our daily
lives are often unwritten and we can form

183
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:54,230
to their norms unconsciously.
For example,

184
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,950
imagine you hear someone tell a
sexist joke, we saw your boobs,

185
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,050
we saw your boots. The Path least
resistance is typically to laugh.

186
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,790
Imagine shouldn't being confronted with
sexual harassment in the workplace.

187
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,510
The path of least resistance
there might be to stay silent.

188
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,110
The issue of men speaking out has been
a big talking point with this scandal

189
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:19,690
with many who have worked with Weinstein.
Remaining quiet,

190
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,020
predatory sexual behavior is not just
the result of a few very rotten apples.

191
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,050
It's part of a much
larger systemic problem.

192
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,890
Social Systems of male entitlement work
to reinforce excuse and enable that type

193
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:36,934
of behavior.

194
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,330
Social Systems are one of
the most important and one
of the most misunderstood

195
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:46,420
concepts in my work around
media and masculinity.

196
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,690
From time to time I'll
use terms like misogyny,

197
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,880
patriarchy and male privilege or male
entitlement and that tends to elicit a

198
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,230
very defensive reaction,

199
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,790
especially from guys who feel they're
being personally condemned as villains.

200
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,040
However, these terms are not meant as
an indictment of every individual man.

201
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,440
They're simply ways of
describing the larger social
systems that were all part of

202
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,380
one of LNG Johnson's key insights from
the monopoly example is that we can

203
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:22,330
describe the game of monopoly and
its outcome without describing the

204
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:25,120
personalities of each individual player.

205
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,340
This also means that we can describe the
framework of real world social systems

206
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,510
without necessarily saying anything
about the personalities of the people

207
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:36,340
participating in those systems.

208
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,070
The passengers and rebellious robots
aboard the axiom all eventually step off

209
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:44,710
the path of least resistance,
and as a result,

210
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,740
change the fate of humanity and we as
people in the real world can collectively

211
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,970
step off our own paths of least
resistance and refuse to be complicit in

212
00:14:55,971 --> 00:15:00,170
oppressive social systems.
Thanks for watching.
