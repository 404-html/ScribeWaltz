1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,400
In 1993 comedy Groundhog Day starring
Bill Murray has always been a favorite of

2
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:12,334
mine.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,390
If you'd asked a younger version of me
what the movie was about and I would've

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,420
said groundhog day is a movie about a
cynical's selfish man who must relive the

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,860
same day over and over again

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,040
until he learns to care for the people
around him and in so doing becomes a

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:33,790
better person.
It's hard down there at the bottom today.

8
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,430
I think I described the
plot somewhat differently.

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,930
I'd say groundhog day is a movie about a
cynical selfish man who must relive the

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,280
same day over and over again until he's
able to learn everything there is to

11
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:52,840
know about his coworker and
despite her repeated rejections,

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,340
use that information to eventually
make her fall in love with him.

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,630
Well, both plot summaries
are technically accurate.

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,280
What I missed as a younger man was an
understanding of how movies often presents

15
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:14,230
stalker like behavior as a harmless or
endearing part of romantic courtship.

16
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,460
How did you do that?
I know your face so well.

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,290
I could have done it with my eyes closed.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,200
One Popular Romance Trope in particular
provides the foundation for the plot of

19
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:32,470
groundhog day.
I call that trope stocking for love.

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,340
I would really appreciate it
if you would just go away.

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,440
If you've spent any time at all going
to the movies or watching television,

22
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,940
then you're probably already familiar with
this romance formula and how it works.

23
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,250
Excuse me. Have you seen the Feminine
Mystique? I've lost my coffee.

24
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,170
What are you doing here? I heard
there was a poetry. You're so Jami.

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,210
Wholesome,
unwelcome.

26
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:03,370
Our hero is typically a nice guy who
doesn't quite fit the Hollywood ideal of

27
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:08,070
manhood and who for a variety of reasons,
hasn't found love.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,480
One day he happens upon a very special
woman and instantly becomes infatuated

29
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:17,760
with her.
Time slows down,

30
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,270
the music swells and the camera zooms in.

31
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,290
These audio visual cues are designed to
communicate to us the audience that this

32
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,330
is true love,
but wait,

33
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,450
there's just one small problem.

34
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,510
I always wondered if I could a snag your
cell phone number or your email before

35
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:42,360
you left. I don't think so, Mike.

36
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,730
She doesn't return his feelings.
Maybe she's dating someone else.

37
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,820
Maybe she's already rejected him.

38
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Maybe she doesn't even know he exists
or maybe she's just not interested.

39
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,790
What's a nice guy to do when
faced with such a dilemma? Well,

40
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,320
he's certainly not going to give
up. No, he'll do whatever it takes.

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,040
This is true love after all or it will
be once he convinces this woman to love

42
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,460
him back
and so to that end,

43
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,650
our hero proceeds to spy on her pastor
her and otherwise manipulate her until he

44
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:30,020
finally manages to wear down her defenses
and she agrees to go out with him.

45
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,190
Yes. Will you leave? This is
my job. 8:00 PM tomorrow. Fine,

46
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,740
fine,
fine.

47
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,310
As a media convention, stocking for
love can be traced all the way back.

48
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,620
The classic Hollywood
got this cabinet one

49
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,340
and it's a mainstay of both
Bollywood and European cinema.

50
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,550
Even though stocking for love
is most commonly associated
with romantic comedies,

51
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,690
what's often overlooked is the
tropes prominence in other genres.

52
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,350
Have you been following me,
especially superhero stories.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,290
I knew it
just once a day.

54
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,540
Sometimes
sometimes more.

55
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,420
In these narratives,

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,600
a man's obsessive coercive or stalker
like behavior is framed as an expression

57
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:30,230
of his love and devotion.
If I really have it saw it,

58
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,320
I'll ride by her house,
my bike, I'll do it like,

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,940
like a hundred times in a day.
It's really, it's intense.

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,640
And even if the woman in
question is initially upset
or annoyed by his obsessive

61
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:51,120
attention, his actions are
inevitably framed as a compliment.

62
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,320
I don't really know you that well,

63
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,160
but you seem like a fine person and I
want you to know that I'm flattered by all

64
00:04:59,161 --> 00:04:59,994
this.

65
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,340
The trend in more recent media is
to lamp shade, romantic stalking,

66
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,130
lamb shading is when writers directly
acknowledge immediate trope were cliche in

67
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,000
the dialogue itself.

68
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,000
Hi, Max. I'm Dustin and Lucas. Yeah,

69
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,690
I know the stalkers.

70
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,710
But remember that acknowledgement alone
isn't the same thing as criticism or

71
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:28,390
subversion. So for example, in the
popular Netflix series, stranger things,

72
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,510
Max calls out Lucas's
stalker like behavior.

73
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,830
What is the shift? Stalker?
Sorry, I just needed a safe place,

74
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,320
a safe place to what?
Be Creepy.

75
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,770
But in the end, Lucas still gets
the girl even after he stalks her,

76
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,700
tricks her and traps her
alone in a room with him.

77
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,640
No. On one level, the popularity
of this trope is understandable.

78
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,730
Most people want to
feel like we're special,

79
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,740
like we're worthy of romantic
attention from someone we like.

80
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,690
And most people really want to believe
in the idea of love at first sight.

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,820
But while it may be nice to imagine
sweeping your crush off their feet,

82
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,400
the truth is that much of the behavior
we see in these movies could very easily

83
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:18,480
land you in jail.

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,000
Did you get in here? I
like watching you sleep. So

85
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,700
it's kind of fascinating to me.

86
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,250
In the real world, stalking
isn't romantic. In fact,

87
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,300
it's a crime.
And beyond the legal implications,

88
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,740
stocking can also have a serious
emotional effect on the victims

89
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,650
leading to anxiety,
paranoia, depression. Yes,

90
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:48,840
me or even PTSD.

91
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,460
I'm sorry, did I scare you?
I'm just a little on it.

92
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,690
Stalking encompasses a
wide range of behaviors,

93
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,960
including following someone
repeated unwelcomed communication,

94
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,400
showing up at a person's workplace,
residents or school uninvited.

95
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,530
Are you sure about this, sir? We might
have some constitutional issues here.

96
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,113
Patriot Act,

97
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,190
as well as spying on tracking
or monitoring an individual,

98
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,290
either online or offline.
Vr have these amazing Isaiah.

99
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,530
This is the type of conduct that we
expect from the villain in a horror movie,

100
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,701
but pop culture,

101
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:36,230
media consistently frames each and every
one of these behaviors as something

102
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:40,130
romantic, curvy. How are you?

103
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm obsessed.
Thank you very much.

104
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,310
Now I should say that occasionally the
roles are reversed and we see a woman's

105
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:51,230
stocking a man,
and we'll talk about that in a minute,

106
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,030
but since men are most often the ones
who perpetrate this kind of behavior,

107
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,980
I want to focus on what this
trope communicates about
men, masculinity and love.

108
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,840
The specific circumstances and severity
of the stalking behavior will vary from

109
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:08,800
story to story.

110
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,923
What are you doing here?

111
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,390
Well, I tried to call, but
how did you get my address?

112
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,743
The library.

113
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,410
But the bottom line here is that these
male characters all refuse to respect

114
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:29,120
women's boundaries,
women's personal space or women's privacy.

115
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,160
I have a boyfriend.
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,400
Make it have a boyfriend so you
can get rid of me. No, I'm not.

117
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,210
What's his name?
Then they don't listen to women's words.

118
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,470
I brought you flowers and they ignore
all signals of disinterest or rejection.

119
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,430
Why don't I just put these
in the same water? In short,

120
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,260
they refuse to take no for an answer.

121
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Stocking for love usually culminates
in some sort of grand romantic gesture.

122
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,840
These are public spectacles that are
designed to demonstrate the depth and

123
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,930
intensity of our heroes,
feelings for the woman of his dreams.

124
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,923
Right.

125
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,083
Bye.

126
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,420
Now, of course, romantic gestures
are not always troubling.

127
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,190
If two people are already
in a relationship or if
their feelings have been

128
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,100
openly communicated,
then it can be really sweet.

129
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,240
I thought this was a good
idea and it feels kind of,

130
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,650
it feels a little stupid and
depending on the context,

131
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,510
it might be okay to humbly and
privately ask for a second chance.

132
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,700
As we saw in the recent Romcom, the
big sick, what do you take me back?

133
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,380
But that's not how it typically
happens in Hollywood. In most movies,

134
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,650
grand romantic gestures are designed to
be elaborate and bushes and bushes that

135
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,770
put women on the spot in
a very public way. Yo,

136
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,730
just too good to be true.

137
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,030
Can't take my eyes off of you.

138
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,540
There's an undercurrent of coersion
running through these schemes because they

139
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,470
set up situations where the woman
in question will appear callous.

140
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:41,640
We're heartless if she rejects the guy
again after he's gone through all the

141
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,890
trouble of pulling off
his elaborate stunt.

142
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,450
Since these are movies
we're talking about,

143
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,530
filmmakers usually give us a window into
the hidden feelings of each character.

144
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,810
This means that we as the audience have
access to information that the male

145
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:01,644
suitor doesn't.

146
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,750
Information that makes us more willing
to overlook his intrusive behavior.

147
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,450
So for instance, in the classic
1989 Teen Romance, say anything,

148
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,890
we know that Diane broke up with Lloyd
because of pressure from her father.

149
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,960
Hello, but we also know that
she secretly wants him back.

150
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,060
That piece of insight or information
makes this iconic scene seemed like a

151
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,080
touching gesture.

152
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,910
The problem is that Lloyd doesn't
know how she's feeling at this point.

153
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,990
He only knows two things.

154
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,790
First that she explicitly told him
she didn't want to see or talk to him.

155
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,960
And second that she's ignored his
many phone calls after the breakup.

156
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,230
Given these two pieces of information,

157
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,190
Lloyd decides it's a good idea to show
up at her father's house and blast Peter

158
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,500
Gabriel's in your eyes
through her bedroom window.

159
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,320
A song that has significance because it
was what they listened to when they were

160
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,760
having sex for the first time.

161
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,100
Imagine an ex lover pulling a stunt like
that after you've broken up with them

162
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,540
and told them to stay away from you.
Nothing about it would be romantic.

163
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,220
It would be creepy in the extreme and
probably cause for calling the cops.

164
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,690
Oh,
hi.

165
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,780
The now infamous sign guy from love.
Actually

166
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,070
it's Carol saying is

167
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,960
professors his love for the woman.
He's been obsessive.

168
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:38,850
Lee videotaping and who also happens
to be the new wife of his best friend.

169
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,190
Yeah,

170
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,190
inexplicably sign guy is rewarded for
his creepy and deeply inappropriate

171
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:47,210
behavior with a kiss.

172
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,250
Romantic stocking at its core
isn't really about love at all.

173
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,430
It's extremely selfish behavior because
it's all about the stalkers own personal

174
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:03,820
feelings. Any potential discomfort, fear,

175
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:08,560
or embarrassment on the part of the
stockers target is rarely ever considered.

176
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,960
Behold, Jessica Riley,
you are my soul mate.

177
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,200
The love of my life.
I have marked myself for the scarlet Jae,

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,070
Jessica Ravi gets out from there.

179
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,650
The notebook offers an added
layer of emotional manipulation.

180
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,000
It's the romantic gesture.

181
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,853
What

182
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,810
will you leave me?
No choice then

183
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,370
Ryan Gosling's character not only refuses
to take no for an answer when I ask

184
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,890
you one more time,
he threatens to kill himself.

185
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,170
If his love interest
doesn't agree to a date,

186
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,400
they'll in the head slipper. Okay.
Okay, fine. I'll go out with you.

187
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,650
I'll do me any favors.

188
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,560
In the critically acclaimed dead poet's
society knocks overstreets decision to

189
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:07,730
persistently pursue a young woman from
a different school who he doesn't know

190
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:12,731
and who already has a boyfriend is framed
by the film as his car pay DM moment,

191
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,690
Tom Tom.
Yet

192
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,040
when he kisses her while
she's passed out at a party,

193
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,330
it's not depicted as assault.
Instead,

194
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:28,331
his actions are represented as overcoming
his self doubt and learning to live

195
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:29,630
life to the fullest

196
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,700
knocks his character.

197
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:39,240
Arc is part of a pattern in
Hollywood coming of age stories,

198
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,940
a pattern where confidence building
for boys often comes at the expense of

199
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:47,610
women's boundaries and
women's personal autonomy.

200
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,040
Movies have taught us

201
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,030
that never giving up is one of
the most admirable traits of all,

202
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,110
especially for men. I know how I can
get to her. What I know how I can get.

203
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,460
Declare, John, you got to drop this thing.
I can't do this anymore with you. Okay.

204
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:07,620
It's been several months and you
haven't heard anything from her.

205
00:15:07,621 --> 00:15:09,210
She hasn't returned your phone calls.

206
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,040
She's never responded
to one of your letters.

207
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,110
She didn't respond to the candy gram.
Right.

208
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,560
I think it's very obvious at this juncture
that she just flat out does not want

209
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:21,030
to see. Yeah, I disagree.

210
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,450
Well, it's certainly true
that determination can
be a very positive thing.

211
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,860
That's only the case when it doesn't
ignore the desires of other people or end

212
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:31,810
up violating someone else's privacy.

213
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,770
How are you now she's in here some
costumes. Stocking the Fox stuff.

214
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,370
Sometimes writers attempt to justify
stocking behavior by framing it as

215
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:48,371
necessary to keep women safe from the
dangers posed by other men in these kinds

216
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:50,150
of stories,

217
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,960
protecting women from attacks by strangers
is depicted as a selfless gesture.

218
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,640
Get in the car

219
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,880
a gesture that proves a man's
love as well as his manhood.

220
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,450
Did you follow me?

221
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,950
Oh,

222
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,480
I feel very protective of you.

223
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,630
Stocking for protection. Storylines are
troubling for a whole host of reasons,

224
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,950
but chief among them is the fact that
regardless of the intentions behind it,

225
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,860
stocking does not make women feel safer.

226
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,440
You know, being stocked isn't
really a big turn on for girls

227
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,090
counter to what television
has led us to believe.

228
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,560
Women are far more likely to be assaulted
by men they already know then by

229
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,210
strangers in dark alleys.

230
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,650
Stocking for love isn't framed as
something worthy of genuine concern.

231
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,230
It's depicted as just a temporary
lapse in judgment fueled by passionate

232
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:00,064
feelings.

233
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,940
How could you do that,
ted?

234
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,690
How could you have some guy
you don't even know spy on me?

235
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,650
In some instances the romantic stocker
might confess or apologize once he's

236
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:11,484
caught,

237
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,750
but rarely are there any lasting
negative impacts or meaningful forms of

238
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:20,280
atonement. I did it because I
never stopped thinking about you.

239
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,380
You are so infuriating.
If he comes clean,

240
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,460
his transgressions are quickly
forgiven and in most cases,

241
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:33,870
his manipulative ploys to spend time with
her under false pretenses have already

242
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:36,750
worked their magic and
proven that he's Mr. Right?

243
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,960
The message is clear.

244
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,460
Anything can be overlooked as long
as it's done in the name of love.

245
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,610
A man's deception is lies.

246
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,700
His trickery is none of that disqualifies
him from a romantic relationship and

247
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,940
even if the two don't
get together in the end,

248
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,390
he's still shown to be a nice guy and
he's often given a consolation prize.

249
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,580
Maybe it's a kiss,

250
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,540
maybe it's naked photos or
maybe it's a different woman.

251
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,070
In reality,
of course,

252
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,180
the willingness to flagrantly violate
someone else's space and someone else's

253
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,550
privacy is a major red flag.

254
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:27,050
It's behavior connected to deep seated
issues of control and extreme levels of

255
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:28,014
entitlement.

256
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,710
When the gender roles are reversed and
we see a female character stocking a man,

257
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,110
her actions are typically portrayed as
manic or unbalanced instead of endearing.

258
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,060
I did not move here because of Josh
because that would be crazy and I am not

259
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:44,894
crazy.

260
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,880
This is basically the premise for the
TV show. Crazy ex girlfriend. Oh my God.

261
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,550
I mean it's right there in the

262
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,910
title. Oh my God. No, I'm
not crazy. I'm not crazy.

263
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,380
Not Crazy. I'm not crazy. Oh
my God. Oh my God. I'm crazy.

264
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,850
You hear me? You're not
crazy. You're in love

265
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,070
stories in which women stock men are
part of a double standard in Hollywood.

266
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,030
This guy here, oh, you know what?

267
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,700
She just left because straight male
characters almost never find unwanted

268
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,850
affections. Charming or romantic. Sorry.

269
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,753
Okay.

270
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,600
Oh God,
I made eye contact.

271
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,580
I'm in no way suggesting that stocking
behavior is okay when it's done by a

272
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:38,650
woman.
It's absolutely not.

273
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,910
But I do think it's important to note
that the social and cultural implications

274
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:45,880
are different.
When media shows women stocking men,

275
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,720
statistics show that women are more likely
to be the victims of stalking and men

276
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:54,640
are more likely to be the perpetrators.

277
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,740
That coupled with the fact that women are
also far more likely to be the targets

278
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:04,510
of sexual violence or domestic abuse
means that women have good reason to be

279
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:07,180
fearful of men who intrude on their lives.

280
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,430
Media employing the stocking for love
trope has been shown to have negative

281
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:16,540
effects on people's attitudes and
expectations when it comes to courtship,

282
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,640
Romance,
and love in the real world.

283
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,410
There you go again, putting your
hand in places it doesn't belong.

284
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,200
Movies like those we've been discussing
in this video served to reinforce a

285
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:32,660
variety of harmful myths about romance.

286
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,280
You want to get back together.
Is that it?

287
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,210
These include the idea that women
don't really know what they want.

288
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,490
That stocking like behaviors are
justified when love is on the line

289
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,860
and that stalking victims
are just playing hard to get.

290
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,790
Studies have also found that watching
media where stalkers are depicted as

291
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,260
dangerous or terrifying,

292
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,180
has the opposite effect and can decrease
people's belief in myths about romantic

293
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:04,014
stalking.

294
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:13,050
Contrary to what movies tell us,
attraction is not the same thing as love.

295
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,250
You don't know me,
but my name is Edward Blum and I love you.

296
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,250
Neither is infatuation or obsession,

297
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,030
both of which Hollywood
consistently confuses for true love.

298
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,303
Oh,

299
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,490
romantic love is mutual and reciprocal.

300
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,870
It's an exchange between people and
unless your partner develops a form of

301
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:35,704
dementia,

302
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,510
romantic love is not something that only
one person can feel towards another.

303
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,550
There's no reason why Hollywood can't
tell love stories where all parties

304
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,890
involved treat each other with respect.

305
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,360
Even within the realm of mutual fact,

306
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:56,120
there are countless possibilities for
quirky or humorous scenarios. Well,

307
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,010
she had a boyfriend in the house.

308
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,790
Nice boy. Oh No, no.

309
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,200
The obstacles to romance can
come in any number of forms.

310
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,830
Things like family disapproval or
illness or geographic location,

311
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,850
just to name a few.

312
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,160
There's no reason why the central conflict
in a romance story needs to involve

313
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:27,690
stalking behavior
and honestly,

314
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,810
making people feel unsafe is a terrible,

315
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:35,560
terrible way to show you care about them.
Valley,

316
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,840
you want to ride the Ferris wheel. If you
ask someone out and they're interested,

317
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,690
great, right? But if they
say they're not interested,

318
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:47,400
it's not your job to test them on or to
try to figure out if maybe they're just

319
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:48,810
playing hard to get,

320
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,570
and rejection is not an invitation to
try to coerce them into changing their

321
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,404
minds.

322
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,970
What do you take me back?

323
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,650
Sure.
Rejection doesn't feel good.

324
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,180
It just feels totally different
now and I can't do that again.

325
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,390
But the respectful thing to do is to
gracefully accept no for an answer.

326
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,120
Do you understand? Okay. Okay.

327
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,730
Thanks for watching these videos take
an enormous amount of time to produce,

328
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,850
especially for just one person.
So if you'd like to see more,

329
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,450
please consider going over to Patrion
and helping to fund the project there.

330
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,630
There's also a link to paypal
in the description below.

331
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,890
Over the next several months, we'll be
talking more about masculinity, love,

332
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:42,724
and the media,

333
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,230
including a disturbingly popular action
movie trope called abduction for love.

334
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:47,930
Wow.
