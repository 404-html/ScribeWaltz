1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,900
That's a weird a man.
So where do men fit into all of this?

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,410
Can we just go to the beach and
wait for women to fix it? No. No.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,600
Up at the end.
And that word is patriarchy

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,400
lightening and actually do an
air guitar. Yeah. They catch you.

5
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:24,490
Your hands get it. Okay.
Yep. Now it's just a lute.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,003
It's not as fun.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,610
Is that weird?
Not something people do.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,030
Look a tad to your left.
That's your good side.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,280
This is my good side. That's
your good side. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,990
Oh No.
No.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,290
Men shouldn't expect a reward
for deciding not to participate.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,670
Any horrible system,
depression and do

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,060
horrible system of doom

14
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,030
kitten in feminism and it,
the text says, don't do it.

15
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,520
I don't think that'll work. Doom, doom,
doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom,

16
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:19,650
doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom,
doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom,

17
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:27,310
exaggerated. I can just do this whole
time. How's that? That's beautiful.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,940
Know Great. Is that says, feels good.
Yeah. I like this. Yeah, that's perfect.

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,880
I am secretly a muppet inside of a
human spot. This is what's happening.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,473
Okay.

21
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,463
Okay.

22
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,660
How has goes that was from
Greg Kinnear on Taco soup,

23
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:50,110
which I used to watch all the time.
Okay.

24
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,930
But remember to be compassionate and
patient with yourself and keep working at

25
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:59,570
it. That was good. Yeah.

26
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,550
You might've, you might've
gotten that. Yeah. Yeah. Do
you want to do it once more?

27
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,590
No. Okay. Let's move on.

28
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,610
I think you got it.
You had a mouthful of dirt.

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,200
Do you want to get another
mouth folder? No. No, I don't.

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,850
This guy is awesome.

31
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,320
He just responded to every single
one of my tweets with laugh out loud.

32
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,040
If I just, I've just rant. I
shouldn't try to read anything.

33
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,300
That's what's the web point does.
That's what,

34
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,560
that's what we'll get so many more views.
Clearly. That actually probably will.

35
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,290
That's the sad part.
Oh,

36
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,320
start the video over again and
Washington a loop until you get it.

37
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,700
I don't think that tactic would work.
Okay. Okay. All right. Now, nevermind.

38
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,310
We'll start with this.
