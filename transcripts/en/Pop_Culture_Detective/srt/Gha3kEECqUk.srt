1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,980
During your travels around the Internet,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,460
you may have bumped into
the term toxic masculinity.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,730
It usually shows up in connection with
particularly abusive male behavior.

4
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:14,520
So things like harassment, homophobia,
sexism or violent outbursts.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,150
But what does it really
mean? Well, let's find out

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,150
now since there tends to be so much
confusion and defensiveness surrounding

7
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:35,350
these two words, I think we might need
to start off with a really clear example.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,580
You know, something that we
can all agree on. Okay. Yeah,

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,420
but honestly, I think he needs his
own video. So maybe something else.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,140
What do you think you're doing?
Okay, that's going to work.

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,830
This charming fellow is biff from
the back of the future series.

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,380
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello.

13
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:59,070
Anybody home? Hello? Hello. Anybody home?

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,200
Okay, so let's start with the word
masculinity itself. Very broadly speaking,

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,760
masculinity is a set of behaviors and
practices that have traditionally been

16
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,220
associated with men and
manhood in our culture,

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,370
and that includes both
positive and negative things.

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,930
Toxic masculinity on the other hand is
a loose term that's used to refer to a

19
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:24,170
subset of those behaviors,
which are harmful or destructive.

20
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,620
It's often used as a sort of shorthand
to describe behaviors linked to

21
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:30,050
domination,
humiliation and control.

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,100
It's marked by things like emotional
detachment and hyper competitiveness.

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,290
Fifth, somebody already asked
me to dance. Well, George Mcfly,

24
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,750
I'm going with Calvin Klein. Okay.
Calvin Klein. Nope, it's not okay.

25
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,500
You're going with me. Understand,
get your focus off of me.

26
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,130
When are you going to get it through your
thick skull? Lorraine, you're my girl.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,120
It's also connected to the sexual
objectification of women as well as other

28
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,920
predatory sexual behaviors.

29
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,090
You know, you want me to give it
to you? I'm not that kind of girl.

30
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,150
You are and you just don't know.

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,400
It's also linked very closely with
aggression, intimidation and violence.

32
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,030
You want to take a poke at me?
Damn it.

33
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,930
Modifier toxic is used to highlight the
fact that these kinds of behaviors carry

34
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:29,560
with them some potentially serious
and even deadly consequences.

35
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,360
Much of this type of masculinity
is relational and as such,

36
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,100
it's mostly defined in opposition to
anything culturally associated with women,

37
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,930
which is why toxic masculinity is
driven by this overwhelming fear of

38
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:48,760
emasculation. That is to say the fear of
being perceived by others as feminine.

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,260
And therefore unmanly.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,850
Many of the most popular male heroes and
movies are depicted as engaging in at

41
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:56,950
least a few of these toxic behaviors.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Well,
it's both play

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,320
cause they're the good guys.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,970
They're actions are framed as admirable
displays of strength, power and manhood.

45
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,450
Thank meet Felix lighter. It
looks, say hello to Dan. Hi Dan.

46
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,990
Didn't say goodbye to Phoenix Madden talk.

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,090
It's like doc said. I know, I
know. If you put your mind to it,

48
00:03:33,091 --> 00:03:36,630
you can accomplish anything. And even
when those behaviors are not celebrated,

49
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,310
it's often framed as acceptable or normal.
And then excused.

50
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:42,930
It's just guys being
guys or boys being boys.

51
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,400
Just to make sure there's
no misunderstanding.

52
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,920
I want to make something absolutely clear.

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,020
This term is not a condemnation
of men wore manhood because again,

54
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,230
toxic masculinity only refers to a
particular set of harmful actions and

55
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:01,530
cultural practices.

56
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,090
And none of those behaviors are
inherent or biological traits of men.

57
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,180
There's nothing toxic
about just being a man,

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,440
but some men do act in toxic
ways. So, in other words,

59
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,220
toxic masculinity is not
something that men are rather,

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,230
it's something that some men do.
All right,

61
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:24,640
so let's return to our friend biff here.
Now, biff is an obvious buffoon. I mean,

62
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,370
he's a school yard bully.
He's like a cartoon villain.

63
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,410
His actions are easy to
spot and understand is
damaging because really toxic

64
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,620
masculinity is what
defines him as a character.

65
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,760
You heard girls party zone

66
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,220
at every point in back to the future.

67
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,330
There might as well be a giant neon sign
hanging over biffs head that says, Hey,

68
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,510
this is the bad guy.
So that's really easy.

69
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,990
But things are rarely so
clear cuts in the real world.

70
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,260
All kinds of men can participate
in toxic masculinity,

71
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,210
including seemingly normal guys who might
also be nerdy or charming or witty or

72
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,044
intelligent.

73
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,970
Since toxic masculinity is a set of
behaviors and not a biological trait.

74
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,380
The real man who participate or not really
one dimensional character archetypes

75
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:16,070
like biff, and they usually don't
do all of the things on the list.

76
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,280
Okay,

77
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,610
okay. Well, sometimes they do,
but usually that's not the case.

78
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,083
Yeah,

79
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,580
there's a mistaken impression out
there that toxic masculinity means that

80
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:35,500
everything about masculinity is somehow
toxic, but that is not the case. In fact,

81
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,620
the term toxic masculinity is used to
very deliberately to try to differentiate

82
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,190
the more damaging or destructive male
behaviors from more positive male

83
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,320
behaviors.
When it comes to this term,

84
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,480
it's really important to understand that
it's used to reinforce the fact that

85
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:57,440
there are many different
types and formulations of
masculinity or as rw Connell

86
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,780
puts it different masculinities,

87
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,110
and since there are many
ways to practice masculinity,

88
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,350
we as men can choose not to engage in
the more toxic behaviors and instead

89
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:12,680
choose to pursue more positive, empathetic
and cooperative forms of masculinity.

90
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,800
Now,
we only just scratched the surface here,

91
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,250
but I'll leave some links and resources
in the box below if you want to learn

92
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,060
more.

93
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,810
I hope this video did give you a better
understanding of this term and maybe

94
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,940
help clear up some of the
misunderstandings about it.

95
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,720
