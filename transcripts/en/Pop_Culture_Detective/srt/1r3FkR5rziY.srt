1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,930
Yeah. I don't want to sound too
much like the shelving this,

2
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:08,040
but when I come home and dinner's not
ready, I go through the roof. Okay.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,760
Donald Trump's misogyny is obvious.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,650
It's part of his brand.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,550
It's one of the reasons why he's
so famous in the first place.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,900
And I'd argue that nearly
everybody already knows it,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,300
but while some perceived Trump's
sexism as horrifying or dangerous,

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,740
millions of others don't really
think it's that big of a deal.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,430
It's the difference between seeing Trump
like this versus something more like

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:43,230
this. Fire her and don't ever make
me talk to a woman that old again.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,150
And that rather stark difference in
perspective is I think at the heart of why

12
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:53,151
Trump's sexism didn't derail his bid
for the White House in the way that most

13
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:56,610
political pundits predicted that it would.

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,660
Now we'll return to our friend
Jack from 30 rock in a moment.

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,640
We have a chance to make
this country great again,

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,770
but first we have to talk about how
the next president of the United States

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,310
views women treat women with respect.

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,960
Uh,
I can't say that again.

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,883
All right, good. All right.

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,060
It's not an exaggeration to say that
Donald Trump sees women as pieces of meat

21
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:23,061
who primarily exist for male pleasure
or as trophies to elevate men's social

22
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:27,330
status. This mentality even
extends to his own daughter.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,630
I've said that if Ivanka warm my daughter,
perhaps I'd be dating her.

24
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,830
He projects a casual disregard
for the idea of consent.

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,810
I'll go backstage before a
show and everyone's getting
dressed and ready and I'm

26
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,300
allowed to go in because I'm the
owner of the pageant and therefore I'm

27
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,980
inspecting it. Is everyone
okay? You know that they did.

28
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,710
They would know is everybody okay?

29
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:53,700
And you see these incredible looking women
and so I sort of get away with things

30
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:56,370
like that. She was one of the most
beautiful women I had ever seen.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,031
It was incredible.

32
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:01,200
This is a man who incessantly links
the inherent worth of women to their

33
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:04,410
physical appearance and to little else.
All of a sudden she's gained,

34
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:08,130
I mean literally she went up from
about 118 to about 170 pounds.

35
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:11,160
It was incredible. Well, obviously
it's great outer beauty. I mean,

36
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:14,280
we could say politically correct that
to look, doesn't matter, but the look,

37
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:17,610
obviously it matters. Like you wouldn't
have your job if you weren't beautiful.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,860
All of this is again,
obvious and uncontroversial.

39
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,420
So what's going on in our culture?
When a man can say things like this,

40
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,670
you know, I'm automatically attracted
to beautiful, I just start kissing them.

41
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,750
It's like a magnet. You just, I don't
even wait. And when you're a star,

42
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:37,990
they let you do it. You can do
anything. Grab 'em by the Pussy.

43
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,443
I can do any of that.

44
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,790
And then millions of Americans,

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,020
both men and women just shrug
it off and support him anyway.

46
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,390
Now I don't think the 60 million people
who voted for Donald Trump did so

47
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,160
because they agree with his sexist
behavior, at least not consciously.

48
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,180
Sure. Some certainly. But
the vast majority don't.

49
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,360
Most people are not Internet trolls.

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,510
During the 2016 election cycle,

51
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,810
we saw dozens of republican leaders
trying to distance themselves from Trump's

52
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:17,740
misogyny. Yet for most of them,
it still wasn't a deal breaker.

53
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,560
So we have to ask why.
Why wasn't such blatant and unashamed?

54
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,660
Misogyny a deal breaker.

55
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,630
The answer I'd argue has a lot to do
with the ways that our culture normalizes

56
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,270
sexism in the sociological sense.

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,140
Normalization is the process
by which a particular attitude,

58
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,760
ideology or behavior becomes established
and entrenched in social life.

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,120
It's the cultural process through which
we come to expect and accept something

60
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:51,430
as natural and as well normal.

61
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,410
The cultural process of normalization
is of course multifaceted.

62
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,600
It operates within many different
institutions simultaneously in families,

63
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:06,250
in schools, in workplaces, in churches,
in government and entertainment.

64
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,930
What does a gentleman,
but it's

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,520
that last one and your team that I want
to focus on here on the ways in which

66
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:20,480
mass media, friends, misogyny, and
sexism, because as bell hook says,

67
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,190
pop culture is where the pedagogy is.
It's where the learning is happening.

68
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,580
Donald Trump is a reality TV star.

69
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,150
He is first and foremost and entertain.

70
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,340
He revels in making a spectacle of
himself in a society that rewards him with

71
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,960
endless,
yeah,

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,970
media attention instead of hair.
I'll say it

73
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,930
well.
His outlandish behavior,

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,890
it's clear to me that Donald
Trump is always performing,

75
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,930
always putting on a show.

76
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:52,931
For an audience and his overt sexism is
an important part of that performance.

77
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,850
We get along very well and there's not
a lot of disagreement because ultimately

78
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:59,750
Ivana does exactly as I tell her.

79
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,760
I see. Wait a minute, right?

80
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,780
Right. Men, is that right?
Trump's right. Brand

81
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,780
of misogyny is so unapologetically over
the top that it feels very much like a

82
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,980
television caricature.

83
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,380
Maybe I could help her realize some other
life goal to become a doctor's nurse

84
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,410
or a lawyer.

85
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:29,330
It's mistress or even the president of
the United States shopping association.

86
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,440
I want you to get better because,
and I mean this,

87
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,750
I'm tired of talking this much tool,
a woman.

88
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:40,751
I'm not having sex with this
lovable misogynist archetype
is found everywhere in

89
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:44,690
pop culture. That's right. Barney
Stinson is back on the market.

90
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,460
Mothers lock up your daughters.

91
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,330
The only reason to wait a month
for sex is if the girl is 17 years,

92
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:53,000
11 months old.
You have been sexually harassing me.

93
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,530
He says the very first day of
class, sexually harassing. What

94
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,700
makes no sense to me. Why would I
harass somebody who turns me on?

95
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,330
There's the house.
I found America's top models

96
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,300
looked on the roof on ice and
Gisella sunbathing European style.

97
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,750
You can recognize people on Google Earth.

98
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,800
Of course not. I got a buddy of mine
at norad to have a spy drone fly over.

99
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,480
The thing about Jack Donaghy from 30
rock and the many other characters just

100
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:29,050
like him,
is that everybody knows they're sexist.

101
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,690
The characters know it,
the show knows it.

102
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,900
The audience knows across the board,

103
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:37,270
these characters engage in outlandishly,

104
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:41,530
sexist and sometimes downright massage
in his behaviors. What did I do?

105
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,530
You don't know. Oh, you poor dear.

106
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,470
Your ovaries are squirting so
much goofy juice into your brains.

107
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:48,490
You don't even know which way is up.

108
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,320
Something going with one of the girls
here and maybe it's that Russian dancer

109
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:56,820
with the tattoos,
which is the crazy sex drive fender

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,750
wide eyed farm girl would get off
the bus with big dreams of Broadway.

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,740
No idea what a casting director
could legally ask her to do,

112
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:08,430
hold or lick during an audition,
but at the end of the day,

113
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,230
there's still framed as lovable,
well-meaning guys, amazing guy.

114
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,960
He's fun.

115
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,080
One of my best friends
and he landed this hobby.

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,730
He's a good guy. By the end of each
episode, all has been forgiven again,

117
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,390
but no life lessons have really
been learned and it is on

118
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,973
these characters.

119
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,760
Sexism is never presented as serious
enough to permanently jeopardize their

120
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:42,630
friendships or their
relationships or their jobs.

121
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,220
In other words, no,
it's not a deal breaker.

122
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,530
This is one of the ways that our culture
works to normalize sexist behavior.

123
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,560
Not by denying that it's sexist,

124
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,450
but by acknowledging it and then
framing it as mostly harmless.

125
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:03,360
For the record, what do you guys are
doing is really creepy? You know what?

126
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,760
If it's creepy,
do use the internet,

127
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,990
military satellites and robot aircraft
to find a house full of gorgeous young

128
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:14,160
models so that I can drop in on them
unexpectedly, then fine. I'm creepy.

129
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,790
It's a younger man's game.
I can't say that I don't miss it.

130
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,200
You'd be in your office late at night.

131
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,250
The new girl would come in with
some flimsy excuse to be there. Oh,

132
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:27,560
Mr O'hare forgot to give you the factory.

133
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:32,000
We'll cook death rates and she laughed
at your lame joke touch on the arm.

134
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,390
Can you take your reward?

135
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,561
Now to be clear,

136
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:40,580
I don't believe the writers and producers
of this media or intending to help

137
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:44,990
normalize sexism. I think they
clearly intend to satirize it,

138
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,070
but when misogyny is consistently
framed as a lighthearted joke,

139
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,640
it's signals to viewers that sexism
isn't something all that serious.

140
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,310
I'd argue that this provides us with a
clue as to why Donald Trump's misogyny

141
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,440
isn't taken seriously either.

142
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,820
If we add a laugh track for
Trump's statements about women,

143
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,610
he becomes virtually indistinguishable
from another TV series. Calm carry.

144
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:12,170
I don't want to sound too
much like a chauvinist,

145
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,440
but when I come home and
dinner's not ready, I go through,

146
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,690
but in all honesty,

147
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,960
we don't need to add a laugh track because
Trump's audience provides one for him

148
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,940
ready and he referred to my hands.
If they're small,

149
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,660
something else must be spoiled.
I guarantee you there's no problem.

150
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,283
Okay.

151
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,400
Just like a TV show.

152
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,270
I think we have to face the hard
truth that for millions of people,

153
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,510
Donald Trump's sexism is not seen as
harmful because it's seen as just more

154
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:47,444
entertaining.

155
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,390
Trump excels at exploiting the media
landscape where misogyny is framed as just

156
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,160
guys being guys and it's something that
doesn't make those guys dangerous or

157
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:03,161
scary when Trump or his surrogates are
occasionally forced to respond to his

158
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:07,550
most egregious sexism.
They do it like this,

159
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,290
but this was locker room talk.

160
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Notice that statements about locker room
talk or not a denial of sexism there,

161
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:17,690
an excuse for it.
They're an acknowledgement that yes,

162
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,520
Trump's statements may be sexist,
but it's mostly harmless.

163
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,070
It's just not that big of a deal,

164
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,410
but of course misogyny is that big
of a deal. Misogyny is dangerous,

165
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,330
especially to women on
both an interpersonal and
a public policy level and

166
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:39,650
Trump's presidency promises to bring
with it an attack on women's reproductive

167
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:43,730
rights and a dismantling of protections
against gender based discrimination.

168
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,830
Do you believe in punishment for abortion?
Yes or no.

169
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:50,831
Is a principal at the answer is that it
has to be some form of punishment for

170
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:51,914
the woman.
Yeah.

171
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,270
The important thing to understand
is that Trump and his brand of toxic

172
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:59,120
masculinity,
do you know how to exist in a vacuum?

173
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,020
He doesn't exist separate and apart
from the world that you and I inhabit,

174
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:11,450
his rise comes in part because we have
failed to challenge a culture that

175
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:16,451
tolerates sexist behaviors even
while acknowledging that they exist.

176
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,930
Donald J.
Trump be a misogynist,

177
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,500
but in a society that reduces sexism to
a joke he's widely seen as a level of.

178
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,270
