00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,090
Think of this as a game. You
got players, you got opponents,

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,510
you got management who don't
always play by the rules.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,610
This game takes strategy

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,770
and the ability to move that metaphor
for fall with more money on the line in

5
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:24,150
any other game that's ever been played is

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:29,990
rolling.
Here we go.
