1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,180
The force awakens does something that
fundamentally changes how we understand

2
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:19,181
star wars or rather it should
fundamentally change how
we understand star wars.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,861
Strangely,

4
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:26,861
the filmmakers seem unaware of the
rather profound implications this new

5
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:32,180
narrative has for the rest of
their cinematic universe. In fact,

6
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:37,181
one of the major plot points in episode
seven inadvertently sets up something of

7
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,930
a storm trooper paradox.

8
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,760
Can you explain what I mean by that?

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,290
I want to focus in on two scenes near
the very beginning of force awakens that

10
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,350
signal.
This shift in the star wars myths.

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,770
First we see a storm trooper bleeding

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,580
or a franchise about intergalactic war.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,860
Very little blood is ever shown on screen
and when it is,

14
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,050
it holds a special significance.

15
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,470
I know

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,340
in this case the bloody fingerprints mark,
this particular soldier,

17
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,693
Portland

18
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,460
Second,
a short time later,

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,670
we see that same storm trooper take off
his helmet to reveal a human face and

20
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:37,580
one clearly disturbed by recent events.

21
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,360
The removal of a mask to expose someone's
true humanity is a recurring motif in

22
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,080
the star wars series.

23
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,890
And we've seen hundreds if not
thousands of storm troopers before,

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,710
but we've never seen one with a face.

25
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,610
Both of these scenes communicate that
under their iconic Armour storm troopers

26
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,623
are people,

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,490
people with feelings and who feel
pain both physically and emotionally.

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,820
The result is that the force
awakens does something.

29
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:16,780
No other movie in this long running
franchise has ever done before.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,750
It humanizes storm troopers.

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,280
Do you understand why this revelation
is so important and how it impacts the

32
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:27,910
rest of the star wars mythology?
We're going to need a quick history lesson

33
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,420
in the star wars cinematic universe.

34
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,510
Stormtroopers are the army
of the galactic empire.

35
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,740
They're an intergalactic military force,
synonymous with space,

36
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:42,550
imperialism and oppression.
They're said to be brutal, precise,

37
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:47,551
and loyal soldiers who have undergone
extensive military training on these last

38
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:51,440
points to lack good at
presenting to people.

39
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,430
Only imperial storm troopers are so
precise now despite their role as foot

40
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:01,860
soldiers of authoritarianism.
Star

41
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,040
ahead,

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,660
there's happy, calm, some of the most
recognizable pop culture icons on her.

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:12,831
The name.

44
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:16,850
Storm trooper is borrowed for special
divisions of German soldiers during World

45
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:20,300
War One translated from the original
German. These soldiers. Yeah,

46
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,530
we're known as storm that
they were aggressive and
heavily armed assault troops

47
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,010
organized into companies
known as storm troopers.

48
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,790
Store man would later
become a paramilitary rank
in the Nazi ss under Adolf

49
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,230
Hitler
in George Lucas is much maligned prequels.

50
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,220
The predecessors to storm troopers are
introduced in the fall of the republics.

51
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,063
Clone Army

52
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,120
soldiers were made to order fighting
machines all sharing the same genes in the

53
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:49,954
same face.

54
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,270
They are totally taking

55
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,390
by the time the original
trilogy rolls around,

56
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,620
clone soldiers have been phased out in
the ranks of the new imperial storm.

57
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:07,930
Troopers are made up of
conscripts and volunteers are now.

58
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,990
Fast forward to episode seven and the
first order also uses regiments of storm

59
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:12,824
troopers.

60
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,520
Here we're told that many of them were
kidnapped his children and brainwashed

61
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,630
into loyal fighters.

62
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,150
I'm a storm trooper.
I call him.

63
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,230
I was taken from a family I'll never know

64
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,800
raised to do one thing.
Essentially their child soldiers,

65
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,930
which I think is especially noteworthy
considering the only storm trooper face

66
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:36,780
we've ever seen belongs
to a young black man.

67
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,320
Every other storm trooper has no
face, no name, and no individuality.

68
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,430
They are completely dehumanize
across eight feature films.

69
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,430
They're portrayed as little
more than disposable grunt.

70
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:53,900
Yes,

71
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,900
ten two one eight seven or Finn as he's
eventually known in episode seven is the

72
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,810
only exception. Finn is an imperial
defector who joins the resistance,

73
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,410
obviously. Yes, I am with.
There's just as, yeah, I am.

74
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,760
What's the resistance?

75
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,550
He's funny. He's emotional.
He's brimming with personality.

76
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,330
You're a pilot. You can fly
anywhere. Weigel back. Got a family.

77
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,690
I've got a boyfriend to boyfriend.
None of your business. That's why

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,200
not exactly the characteristics you'd
expect from someone kidnapped and

79
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:28,680
brainwashed from an early age,
but setting that aside,

80
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,960
Finn is the only storm trooper out of
presumably millions who we see develop a

81
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:34,794
conscience.

82
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,490
Are we to believe he's the only one
with the ability to resist first order

83
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:40,050
programming? Well, no.

84
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:43,470
It's possible for other soldiers to
reject their conditioning. In fact,

85
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,190
the first order has a protocol for
exactly this kind of noncompliance.

86
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,140
N Two one eight seven proportion to
my division was evaluated and central

87
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:54,840
reconditioning.
No prior signs of nonconformity.

88
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,150
This was his first offense

89
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,050
and yet fin rebels.
Anyway,

90
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,880
pins very existence stands in contrast
to the rest of the storm troopers in the

91
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,750
force awakens.

92
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,400
I mean on the one hand we have a likable
humanized storm trooper who switches

93
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:14,820
sides and on the other hand we have
all his fellow storm troopers who the

94
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,580
resistance kill without a second

95
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,900
and this is why it feels like the film
has a confused dissonant relationship to

96
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,190
one of its own plot point.

97
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,900
Why it feels like it doesn't really buy
into it's own premise because if Finn

98
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:38,310
can remain so very human despite
years of programming and conditioning,

99
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,990
then that must mean the same could
be true for all other storm troopers.

100
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,611
Unfortunately,

101
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:48,360
the writer's responsible for this movie
don't seem at all interested in pursuing

102
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,570
any of the morally complex questions
that arise from this fact preferring

103
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:58,671
instead to indulge in more action scenes
built around blasting more mindless

104
00:06:58,741 --> 00:06:59,610
automatons.

105
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,870
Can I try that?
In fact,

106
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:08,890
blasting stormtroopers has become so
mundane that it's an end universe.

107
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:13,140
Jokes often played for laughs.
I like this thing.

108
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,150
Stormtroopers are framed as easy to kill,

109
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,570
both literally and figuratively
and they are killed

110
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,993
a lot

111
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,310
over the course of the force awakens
two hour and 15 minute runtime.

112
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,050
We see a total of 68 storm
troopers, shot, stabbed, vaporized,

113
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,080
and those are just the ones
that we can see die on screen.

114
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,420
Again, these are child soldiers
that we're talking about here,

115
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,010
which is even more reason for the film
to at least acknowledge the underlying

116
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:13,970
tragedy, but there are
circumstances but it never does.

117
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,190
I mean it's easy to imagine a more
emotionally complex plotline perhaps

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,450
something that focuses on a group of
disillusion storm troopers who organize a

119
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:26,850
resistance sell to subvert the
first order, but from the insomnia.

120
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,970
Remember the fins awakening is triggered
not by the death of some innocent

121
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,660
villager but by the death of his
friend. A fellow, a storm trooper.

122
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,640
Yeah.

123
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,150
This is the event that quite
literally leaves a mark on him

124
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,410
and yet the film quickly forgets
this key transformative moment

125
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,980
because minutes later we see
Finn Who's being an laughing,

126
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:58,020
what blasting his former teammates.

127
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,380
Now you might say that Finn and the rest
of the resistance are acting in self

128
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,010
defense and you'd be right.

129
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,070
I mean star wars is after all a story
about resistance and when faced with an

130
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:17,330
oppressive police or military force,

131
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,100
sometimes violence may be
necessary to achieve liberation,

132
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,680
but having to hurt one group of people
in order to help another is always a

133
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:31,920
tragic trade off even if it's necessary.

134
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,530
If there's a core message to fins,

135
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:38,790
Redemption Story in the force awakens
something that the film really wants us to

136
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,624
believe in,

137
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,010
it's that people can change
and if we accept that,

138
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,440
then the possibility must also exist
other storm troopers to change as well.

139
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,530
Now perhaps their transformation,

140
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,430
it's unlikely but not any more
unlikely than fins own awakening.

141
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,400
And isn't that the idea at the heart
of the original star wars trilogy,

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,740
I know there is good in you. The emperor
hasn't driven it from you fully at,

143
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:10,730
they're still exist. Good. Even
someone as evil as Darth Vader,

144
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,130
because if that's the case,
and I think it is,

145
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,360
and that means the fall of every storm
trooper represents the death of the

146
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:27,350
possibility of redemption,
the possibility of another fan.

147
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,340
If you'd like to see more long form video
essays that focus on the intersections

148
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:38,840
of entertainment and politics,

149
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,440
head over to my patrion page and help
fund the pop culture detective agency.

150
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:43,970
Yeah.
