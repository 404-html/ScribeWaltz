1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,170
So once again,

2
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:05,040
it's David Levinson reminding you and
anybody else that's listening don't mess

3
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:05,874
with art

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,860
SQL to the 1996 and make a
blockbuster independence day.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,200
Hit theaters this summer.
Independence Day,

6
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:24,650
resurgence is built on the same
premise that made the original famous,

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,160
a potent combination of alien
Killen and patriotic pandering.

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,960
Shouldn't we be nervous?

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,973
Yeah,

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,140
please get gonna kick some
serious som some fireworks

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,250
after the claim date of July.

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,030
According to most reviews, the
movie itself was unremarkable.
What was remarkable,

13
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:52,920
however,
was the marketing for the film.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,150
Some of you might remember something a
little strange about the trailers and I

15
00:00:57,151 --> 00:01:01,410
mean in addition to Jeff Goldbloom
doing his whole Jeff Goldbloom thing,

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,460
when the world was brought to its knees,
the army was there to fight back,

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,250
promised us that this
would never happen again.

18
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,990
They have been the driving force in United
Nations around the world to form the

19
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:17,280
most powerful weapon against another.
Attack your space defense.

20
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,440
Brave men and women of the ESD or making
sure that the war of 96 will never

21
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:46,980
happen again.
Join Earth space defense.

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,990
Next time we will be prepared.

23
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,510
So we see the stars, the film's
speaking directly to the camera,

24
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,430
praising the u s army and then asking
fans to join something called Earth space

25
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:00,860
defense.
Then at the end of the trailer,

26
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,010
we see a URL join esd.com once
fans arrive at that website,

27
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,590
they're asked to enlist in the ESD to
help fight off future alien invasions and

28
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,110
quote,

29
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,820
defend Earth's independence at
all cost by clicking enlist.

30
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,420
Visitors are notified that they're
now a soldier with a rank of private.

31
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,580
Now in order to determine your role
in this fantasy military organization,

32
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,030
fans are instructed to complete
a series of gamified missions.

33
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,450
Mini Games include simulations where
players learn how to pilot an unmanned

34
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:39,110
military drone or crack
secret alien codes.

35
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,620
Completing each mission races your rank
and unlocks exclusive independence day.

36
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:46,454
Movie Con.
Yeah,

37
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,370
we've taken fighter jets that the US
military would have been accustomed to and

38
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,140
we've incorporated alien technology.

39
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,600
You'd be forgiven for thinking that
this is just a clever marketing stunt

40
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,040
designed to drum up more
interest in the film,

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,200
but there's something a
little more insidious going
on here in order to compete

42
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:09,790
to unlock those movie extras. Fans are
instructed to sign in with Facebook,

43
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,380
but by doing so,

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,390
it allows the U s army access to your
Facebook page and your personal data along

45
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,224
with it.

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,820
That's because this whole Earth
space defense campaign is actually a

47
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:26,220
surreptitious recruiting
tool for the u s army.

48
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,690
It's part of a multimillion dollar
joint advertising venture between 20th

49
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:35,070
Century Fox and the United States
military. If you look carefully,

50
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,690
you'll notice a small unassuming US army
logo in the corner of the page right

51
00:03:39,691 --> 00:03:43,950
across from the Independence Day movie
logo. If you look even more closely,

52
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,220
you'll notice that when linking over to
join esd.com you're quietly redirected

53
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:54,621
to go army.com or the site's hosted go
army.com for those who don't know is the

54
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:57,570
official website for us army recruitment.

55
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,783
Surprise.

56
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
Not at all.
She's a born leader.

57
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,980
I know I've been taking orders from
her since she was five years old.

58
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,300
See,
you don't worry about her.

59
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,070
Of course,
I worry about her.

60
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,390
I fought in the war in [inaudible] 96 I
know what those things are capable of,

61
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,520
but I know what my daughter is capable
of and I know this planet is safer

62
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,700
because she's defending it

63
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,780
now. That trailer is almost
indistinguishable from
real us army television

64
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:32,614
commercials,

65
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,430
at least up into the point where the
kindly father figure in the u s army cap

66
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,670
starts reminiscing about the war of 1996
you remember that's the fictional one

67
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:46,030
that didn't actually happen with the u
s military defeated the extraterrestrial

68
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,680
invasion with the help of will Smith.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,833
Wow.

70
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,760
No Earth crossbred promotions
are now ubiquitous in Hollywood.

71
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,440
You've probably seen commercials for
Audi or Doritos or coke that double his

72
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,060
trailers for superhero films.

73
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,470
These movie Tie ins are meant to trigger
an emotional connection and viewers and

74
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:14,760
increase what's referred to as positive
brand association by connecting a

75
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:17,320
product with something that
people already liked it.

76
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,343
Okay.

77
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,550
The idea is that if
you already think that,

78
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:27,940
say the hulk is cool and you're already
really excited to see the hawks smash

79
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,930
stuff in the latest marvel movie,
then seeing the hulk,

80
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,800
enjoying a can of coke will
link those preexisting happy,

81
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,920
fanish feelings in your mind
to the product on the screen,

82
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,650
even if that's just on
an unconscious level

83
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,970
and the uncomfortable truth is that this
kind of marketing actually works really,

84
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:52,230
really well, which is why corporations
spend billions every year doing it,

85
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,090
but here's the thing. Convincing people
to eat a bag of street taco flavored,

86
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,070
convincing people to eat a bag of Doritos
and convincing people to sign away

87
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,850
eight years of their lives to the u
s army are not exactly comparable.

88
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,430
While arguably both might be unhealthy.

89
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,230
Life in the military presents
significantly more risk
to your mental, emotional,

90
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:18,700
and physical wellbeing. Then having
a little junk food now and then.

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,540
Now I've cross branded advertising.
Sounds manipulative. That's because it is,

92
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,710
which is why it's not exactly surprising
that the US military is jumping on the

93
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:28,544
bandwagon.

94
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,730
The U s army now spends in excess of $200
million per year of taxpayer money on

95
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,714
advertising.

96
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,920
The U S Army contracted advertising firm
responsible for the Earth space defense

97
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:44,060
campaign. He's upfront about
what they're doing, saying quote.

98
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,330
It allows us to tell the U s army
recruitment story in a very new and very

99
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,300
relevant way.

100
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,060
The thing is that recruitment story
they're selling is pure fantasy. Now,

101
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:56,894
to be clear,

102
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,370
many people do initially want to join
the military for altruistic reasons.

103
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,900
Unfortunately,

104
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,490
US army recruiters are notorious
for extremely deceptive tactics.

105
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,370
You look like you're really into this.
You guys want a real challenge.

106
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,820
You'll find out what you really
made us explore over 150 careers.

107
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,290
Help pay for college and learn a few.

108
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:28,291
Qualify for an m three nine five now for
a free copy of the America's army gains

109
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,910
and this new interactive DVD

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,860
promises of large cash bonuses and money
for college are commonly used to entice

111
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,540
poor students into enlistment.

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,080
But the fine print on those contracts
makes it so only about 15% of recruits end

113
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:48,640
up getting a college degree out of
the deal and 65% received no money for

114
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:49,750
college at all.

115
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,680
Recruiters also routinely hide the
dangers that go along with life in the

116
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,680
military,
even outside of combat scenarios.

117
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,390
Potential soldiers are not told that
the levels of sexual assault and sexual

118
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:04,090
harassment in the military
are alarmingly high.

119
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,980
Recruiters don't mention that one in
four women and about one in 14 men,

120
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,840
they severe and persistent
sexual harassment and
discrimination while serving.

121
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,070
They don't mention the fact that suicide
rates among veterans are extremely high

122
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:19,180
compared to civilians,

123
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,190
and they certainly don't tell you that a
third of all homeless men in the United

124
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,810
States are military veterans. For the
record, that's over 200,000 people.

125
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,423
Let's be frank.

126
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,690
If you enlist in the army does a darn
good chance you're going to have a bad

127
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:36,820
time and the military knows it.

128
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,330
This reality presents
something of a PR nightmare,

129
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,370
which is why the military has longterm
to Hollywood to help clean up their image

130
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,380
and sell the idea of enlistment.

131
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,540
Every branch of the US
military has offices in Los
Angeles which are tasked with

132
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:56,970
collaborating on Hollywood movies and
video game productions now for decades

133
00:08:56,971 --> 00:09:00,050
they wouldn't touch anything
involving UFOS. In fact,

134
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:04,380
a military famously refused to assist
on the original independence day because

135
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,980
the script referenced area 51
but that's no longer the case.

136
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,570
The military has recently collaborated
on science fiction movies like battleship

137
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,510
man of steel,
iron man and transformers.

138
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,560
We're using all the real crew from the
ship right now and these guys are acting

139
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:34,130
out scenes and fighting their ship
and I think that having a lot of fun

140
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,210
right behind us is the five inch gun.

141
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,000
Now in exchange for granting filmmakers
assistance and access to both equipment

142
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,440
and personnel, the military
just demands one little thing.

143
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,600
Return final script approval

144
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,830
[inaudible]

145
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,270
you have to thank her.
Now she said the navy again.

146
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,180
This arrangement ensures that Hollywood
depictions of the military are always

147
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:20,010
positive and uncritical, even when the
story involves dinosaurs are a killer.

148
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,050
Robots are aliens from outer space.

149
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,910
This cozy relationship is sometimes
referred to as militate meant because it

150
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:31,830
produces media that glorifies military
institutions, combat and warfare,

151
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,880
so there's a long history of military
involvement in Hollywood still.

152
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,820
I'd argue that this independence
day movie collaboration,

153
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,470
it's especially insidious now beyond the
covert collection of personal data via

154
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:44,880
Facebook,
which is bad enough.

155
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,530
What's so unsettling about it is that
the u s army is leaning heavily on the

156
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:54,450
fantasy of alien invasions as a way to
convince young people to become soldiers

157
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:55,530
in real life.

158
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,450
When the soldiers in the movie rise up

159
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,690
and they adapt to a new threat facing
the world and they find a way to win,

160
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,950
no matter what.
Remember where Hollywood gets set from.

161
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,480
The U S Army has been defending American
independence for more than 241 years.

162
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,680
Go to go army.com/independence to
learn how you can join their ranks,

163
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,340
independence day, resurgence
in theaters. June 24th

164
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,470
problem is where Hollywood gets that from
his from fiction or at least a heavily

165
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:33,090
sanitized version of the U s military.

166
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:38,610
Now this cross branded Earth space
defense campaign does fit very neatly with

167
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:42,360
the u army's Pr Tagline
defending America's independence.

168
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,220
There's just one small problem with that.
It's not exactly true anymore.

169
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,290
The majority of modern US military
operations look a whole lot more like

170
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:57,130
intervention than independence and those
operations are certainly not designed

171
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:01,580
to beat back any invasion of the
heartland either from foreign or extra

172
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:02,830
terrestrial origin.

173
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,510
The long and short of it is
the US government has been
in a near constant state

174
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,760
of war for over a century.
In fact,

175
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,880
it's overthrown or invaded
over 50 countries just since
the end of World War II.

176
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,590
In an incredibly strange coincidence,

177
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,180
most of those military interventions
have somehow ended up benefiting or

178
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:26,320
protecting the economic interests of
American big business and under the

179
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:28,240
umbrella of the so called war on terror.

180
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,680
The U s military is currently raining
destruction down on countries all across

181
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:35,860
the Middle East and North Africa.
That's the grim,

182
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,260
messy and often bloody reality of it.

183
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,970
And that unpleasant reality is one
of the reasons why the U s army is

184
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,870
increasingly turning to science
fiction stories as a recruiting tool

185
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:54,770
who discovered they can do extraordinary
things with unique talents and

186
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,280
strengths.
As an elite class,

187
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,230
it's more than a uniform.

188
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,100
It's a chance to be part of something
bigger than you ever imagined.

June 3rd they're strong.

191
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,920
And then there's army strong

192
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,520
science fiction can provide a
simple good versus evil narrative,

193
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,840
one that appeals to patriotism and a
desire to save the world without any

194
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:28,470
association with those real life
military operations and atrocities.

195
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,560
In addition to leaning on
science fictional conflicts,

196
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,080
the u s army is also leveraging science,

197
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:38,940
fictional technology and science fictional
weaponry as an exciting pop culture

198
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:41,170
lore to hook young people into it.

199
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,270
Let's not come on.
Come on.

200
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,160
Fighting imagined enemies avoids the
uncomfortable associations with us.

201
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:55,600
Foreign policy, so killer robots
or zombies or alien invasions.

202
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,400
These are all dehumanized
conflicts without any messy
moral questions attached.

203
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,070
There are no real human beings
with feelings or families
or grievances with us.

204
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,390
Imperial, yeah, invading
space. Aliens are easy to kill.

205
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,870
There's no guilt, remorse or
critical thinking that's required.

206
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,080
Unlike the real world
where killing other people,

207
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,950
no matter how vile they may be is never
something you should feel particularly

208
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:22,500
good about. Independence Day, resurgence.

209
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,970
It didn't do so well at the box office
so we probably won't be subjected to

210
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:28,320
another movie in the series,

211
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:33,090
unfortunately will definitely be seeing
the u s military using this type of

212
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,500
advertising tactic.
Again,

213
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,790
that's because both the US military
and the advertising industry understand

214
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:44,791
something that many people still want to
deny and that is that fiction can be a

215
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:49,800
very powerful and very effective way to
influence people's actions and attitudes.

216
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,350
The military has a tradition
of intentionally blurring
the lines between fiction

217
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,184
and reality,

218
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,750
but this latest movie tion represents
a shift to a more insidious form of

219
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:03,230
product placement and we have a word for
when the government does this kind of

220
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:05,690
thing and that word is propaganda.

221
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,240
I hope you found this video useful.

222
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,830
If you'd like to see more long form video
essays that focus on the intersections

223
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,270
of entertainment and politics,

224
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,840
head over to my patrion page and help
fund the pop culture detective agency.

225
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:18,980
Yeah.
