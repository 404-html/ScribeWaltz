1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,140
Giant robot.

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,561
Steven universe.

3
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:19,800
It's an adventure show about a boy with
superpowers derived from an interstellar

4
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,030
gemstone in his belly,

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,010
but in many ways it's also a coming of
age story about a young man growing up

6
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,360
and trying to find his place in the room.

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,620
Some of your weapon.

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,070
Calm down, Steven, breathe.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,380
Oh,
it was really close to that time.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,450
Coming of age. Narratives for boys
usually involve in education, in sex,

11
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,340
sports,
hunting or fighting.

12
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,643
Yeah.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,160
These activities are framed as a sort of
rite of passage in stories set in Scifi

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,210
fantasy or superhero genre is combat
is almost always the mechanism through

15
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,670
which young men must
prove their worthiness.

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,760
This is usually not framed as outright
aggression on the heroes part.

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,763
What is it

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,960
instead?
Justified as the ability to fight back.

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,880
There are accompanying characteristics
like wit, determination,

20
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,410
cleverness or confidence,

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,760
but learning how to be tough and
proficient in dealing out violence is

22
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:32,990
consistently framed as a necessary

23
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,533
okay

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,960
boys to complete their journey
into manhood. As the series begins,

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,910
Steven Universe appears to be following
in the footsteps of these well-worn

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,783
conventions.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,960
Steven wants his own gym powered weapon
to help fight off monsters like the

28
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:49,890
other crystal gems.

29
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,780
But when he finally
does Chondra his weapon,

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,090
yeah,

31
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,730
it isn't a weapon,
Steven,

32
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,600
and this is where the series begins to
depart from classic genre expectations.

33
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,830
Rather than being disappointed and not
getting an offensive or aggressive skill.

34
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,280
Steven wholeheartedly embraces
his new defensive superpower.

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,760
I'll get a shoe

36
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,173
this way.

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,130
The show continues.
It's a version of boy hero tropes.

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,410
When we find out that Stephen is a healer,

39
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,370
what do you see without my glasses?
Did I heal your eyes?

40
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,160
But how

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,600
his mother had healing tears,
whereas Steven has

42
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,300
who sparks?
I don't have healing tears.

43
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,570
Yeah, maybe little gross,
but when you think about it,

44
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,040
that essentially means that
Steven possesses healing
kisses, healing, affection.

45
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,180
Yeah.

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,303
Okay.

47
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,680
There's something new and exciting.

48
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,410
Okay,
you should be better now.

49
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,030
So Steven's a healer and his Jim power
is centered around shielding others from

50
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:29,740
harm. Now that's especially interesting
because in many fantasy stories and video

51
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:33,250
games, those were both considered
to be secondary or support skills.

52
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,730
Medics and other protective spell casters
have often been gendered roles are

53
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:43,600
roles that have been filled by women
who stand back and supplement the other

54
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,410
warrior classes who have
traditionally been myth.

55
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,530
This convention has begun to change in
recent years, which is a really good sign,

56
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,850
but the gendering of these types of roles
still remains a pervasive pattern in

57
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:59,620
media giving these kinds of support
powers to the male protagonist.

58
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,320
He's a fun if pretty
straight forward in version,

59
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,410
but I'd argue that Steven
has another superpower,

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,490
something that's even more important and
even more fundamental to his character

61
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,420
and to the show's values as a
whole. You see, Steven is in Papic.

62
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,040
You might even say he's super empathic.

63
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,350
Steven, your mother had Hayden
tears flowed from my gym.

64
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,070
She felt real love for those around her.
She felt real sorrow when they were hot.

65
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,630
You have the rose quartz damn.
Now I know that power is in youtube.

66
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,990
Empathy is the ability to understand
and share the feelings or emotions of

67
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:38,370
another person, but empathy is not
just feeling bad for someone else.

68
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,540
It's actually feeling what they feel
and that's an important distinction.

69
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,300
It's what separates sympathy from empathy,

70
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,380
spirits, sugar, so it's called,

71
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,140
I can feel it.
It's hurting and obsess.

72
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,650
Wait, how do you know? I don't,
but I could just feel it.

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,940
She was yelling and she was really
freaked out as season one begins.

74
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,530
The show's structure seems to be following
a fairly standard monster of the week

75
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:08,640
adventure show formula.

76
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,680
Right Ben?

77
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,190
In episode 23 which is appropriately
titled Monster Buddies,

78
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,000
we start to get the sense that this
is not just a show about going on fun

79
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:26,380
adventures and fighting baddies like a
lot of other shows in the same genre tend

80
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:29,170
to be at the beginning of that episode.

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,220
We see the gems fighting a monster
just like they have many times before.

82
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,450
One more attached to it. This time
Stephen reacts a little differently.

83
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,320
Did you see it? No. Okay. Let's
rewind it and watch it again.

84
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,580
Okay, so notice that the creatures arm
is damaged during the season calendar.

85
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,440
Seeing

86
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,050
this, Steven expresses for her
wellbeing while grabbing at his own arm.

87
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,590
Essentially Stephen is
super sensitive to others.

88
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,890
He possesses the capacity to vicariously
experience other people's feelings.

89
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,050
When someone else is hurting,
Steven hurts.

90
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,840
He feels their pain as if it were his own.

91
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,120
This kind of super sensitivity
is especially rare for
boy heroes because in our

92
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:20,870
culture,

93
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,870
emotional intuition is still
stereotypically associated
with women and as such,

94
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,510
media often frames.
It is overly sensitive girl stuff,

95
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,220
but on this show, things
work very differently. Well,

96
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,920
I think you're pretty
great in this universe.

97
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,010
It's common for male characters to act
in carrying an emotionally sensitive way.

98
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,920
You can watch my full episode
about that right here.

99
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,460
Later, Steven makes friends with
another monster and names her sentence

100
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,473
speed.

101
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,270
At first,
they're both afraid of each other,

102
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,220
but remember from my last video that
being afraid is not a negative trait on

103
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:07,710
this show
and Steven's fear is reasonable.

104
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,810
The monster is indeed dangerous,

105
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,000
but Steven is resolute in his conviction
that monsters are not all bad,

106
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,530
that there is still good in them.

107
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,770
It looks so scary. Oh, hi.

108
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,260
It's okay. Hello. Please
don't be scared of me. See,

109
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,460
I'm not going to hurt you

110
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,010
now. Critically, Stephen's belief that
his new monster buddy can be redeemed.

111
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,330
It's not framed by the show
is childish idealism. Instead,

112
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,880
it's looked upon as
honorable and commendable.

113
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,190
You don't need to fight.
This isn't new.

114
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,300
You're not amongst already more.
You're more than that.

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,500
The larger lore of this universe also
works to validate Steven's empathetic

116
00:07:58,501 --> 00:07:59,334
convictions.

117
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,470
Recall that the crystal gems all have
extra terrestrial superpowers because of

118
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:07,440
their gemstones in the episode ocean gym,

119
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,700
we learned that all the monsters are
heroes have been fighting each week are

120
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:16,530
actually gems themselves or more
accurately. They once were gems,

121
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,483
but they've been,
huh?

122
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,580
I can't believe lapis would do this.
Jim shouldn't fight each other.

123
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,010
We're always fighting.
Chems actually what? Oh,

124
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,300
how do I put this?

125
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,430
All gyms aren't necessarily good.
They're all those monsters.

126
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:36,370
We've got used to be just like
acid, right, for all, yes,

127
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,330
but they've become corrupted and broken.
We have to take care of them.

128
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,100
Do contain them.

129
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,520
It's the best we can do for them for now.

130
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,960
This also illustrates one of
the core values of the show,

131
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,310
which is the belief in the possibility
of transformative redemption.

132
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,070
The truth is, rose, I tried to use

133
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,150
her powers to save these months just too,
but she was never able to heal them.

134
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,680
Never. But if she
couldn't do it, who knows?

135
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,110
Maybe when you have better
control of your powers,

136
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,040
you might help them in ways even
your mother couldn't even this one.

137
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,410
I'll keep it safe

138
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,501
and Steven,

139
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:18,280
along with his supercharged empathy
are often the voice of that message.

140
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,370
Wow. Wait for me, centripetal,

141
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,830
I promise you, you up Sunday he sees

142
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,360
Daptiv possibility in
everyone and everything,

143
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,610
even when the much more experienced gems,
maybe a little skeptical for Steven.

144
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,990
No one is unworthy of compassion
or empathy, even monsters.

145
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:52,040
Steven, be careful. This just
happened. Maybe I can do something,

146
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,310
Jasper, it's okay. I'm here.

147
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,460
I just want to try and heal you.

148
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,770
It's uncommon to see this
kind of empathy on television,

149
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,650
especially when expressed
for the bad guys. Well,

150
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:10,760
it's true that most good guys in media
do demonstrate some empathy for their

151
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,770
friends,
their family and their allies.

152
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,100
Those feelings are very rarely
extended to their enemies.

153
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,010
And it's almost unheard of in
programming aimed at children,

154
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,630
which tends more than most to break
narratives down and just simplistic,

155
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,000
good versus evil,
easy to digest lesson.

156
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,563
Damn

157
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,760
in most animated shows,
the bad guys simply can't be reformed.

158
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,990
If you look at everything from say
duck tails to the Batman Universe,

159
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,120
you'll notice that the villains are
by and large framed as evil by nature.

160
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,650
Villainy is not just something they do.
Villainy is what they are.

161
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,200
Prisoner will stand.

162
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,610
So any attempt at rehabilitation
is ultimately doomed to fail.

163
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,060
And the belief in the possibility of
redemption is therefore often framed as

164
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,220
foolish or naive or worse,

165
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,130
something that can actually
endanger society itself.

166
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,580
But on Steven Universe,
things are more nuanced. Here.

167
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,180
The bad guys don't just do bad things
because they're intrinsically or

168
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:17,260
inherently evil.

169
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,950
They do bad things because of their
history and their circumstances. Now,

170
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:25,060
the bad guys are no less dangerous,
but it does mean they're always exists.

171
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,310
At least the possibility for redemption.

172
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,050
And that possibility is what guides
and shapes Steven's action. Yeah.

173
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,900
Wait,
let me turn this off.

174
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,900
Hey, how's it going? Can you hear me?

175
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,850
Are you in there somewhere?

176
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,950
And this brings us to the final
point I want to make in this video.

177
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,570
A critical part of Steven super
empathy is that it's always actionable.

178
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,950
The actionable part is key.
Not only does he feel for others,

179
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,550
oh, she's coming back. He
also does something about it.

180
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,830
Alright,
everyone be supportive.

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,660
Steven consistently intervenes to
deescalate and resolve conflicts.

182
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,700
I don't want to fight anymore.
I said Hi.

183
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,540
In the episode ocean gem,

184
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,890
we get to see Steven using all of his
superpowers to de escalate a potentially

185
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:24,270
cataclysmic situation.

186
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,970
He ends the fight and ultimately resolves
the conflict by talking it out with

187
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:30,804
the antagonist.

188
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,310
Lapis,
I'm coming up to see you.

189
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,680
Lapis. What are you
doing here, Steven? What?

190
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,390
I know, what are you
doing here? This thing,

191
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,170
the ocean.
This is crazy.

192
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,530
Can we work this out with Joe?
Should be friends.

193
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,880
Steven talks with her.

194
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,450
He listens to her and he treats
her with empathy and kindness.

195
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,050
I just want to go home.

196
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,450
In the end.

197
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,430
He even uses his healing powers to mend
her broken gym even after she's tried to

198
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:12,620
hurt him,
his friends and his family.

199
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,360
Thank you,
Steven.

200
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,600
Now it's not all Kumbaya in beach city.
The crystal gems are not pacifists.

201
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,920
Our heroes are often forced into battle,
but when that happens,

202
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,190
Stephen's still expresses his discomfort.
Even when he's under attack. By muting,

203
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,880
they're attacking the drought.
What do we do?

204
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,960
So win or lose,

205
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,830
the specter of violence and
confrontation weighs heavy on his heart.

206
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,240
Something doesn't feel right about
this. Then use the d pad. No,

207
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:59,010
it's just these things.
We can't just leave their gems out there.

208
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,460
They're going to form again later.
If I could just bundle them,

209
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:07,230
then they'd be saying, come
on. We've got to help them.

210
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,000
And of course there's tension and
discord among friends from time to time,

211
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,990
sometimes even leading to physical fights,
but on this show,

212
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,770
those issues are ultimately resolved
through means other than violence and

213
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:22,040
domination, often at the
insistence of Stephen himself.

214
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,520
So it was all my fault.
Ha.

215
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,420
You totally weren't even
trying to sync with my dancing.

216
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,370
You know how I danced by now.
Come on guys.

217
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,040
Please stop fighting.
Why don't you

218
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,720
admit it? I'm just in him. Ferris meals.

219
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,400
Amethyst please. No more.
I know you're upset,

220
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:50,190
but I can't bear to watch
you two already each other.

221
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,250
It's Steven's faith

222
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,360
in the possibility of redemptive
transformation that drives his efforts to

223
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:59,710
prevent fights.
You listen to me now.

224
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,070
You were talking about things that
you do not understand. Garnet,

225
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,570
stop please. It's not
worth it. We're done here.

226
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:14,340
Let's just go home.
Come on,

227
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:18,420
baby melon. We have to stop this.
It's staffing hearts you so help me.

228
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:20,520
I alone it didn't do anything.

229
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,070
Don't hurt it.
I accidentally let it out of its bubble,

230
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,910
but it didn't even try to hurt me.
It's not like the other monsters.

231
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,830
It's just scared and confused.

232
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,680
Everything that we've talked about in
this episode is extremely rare for boy

233
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:37,930
heroes on TV,
but it really shouldn't be.

234
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,550
The world could use a whole
lot more of Steven superpowers.

235
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,390
We need more role models for boys where
empathy and deescalation and diplomacy

236
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,000
are framed as brave and heroic behaviors.

237
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,640
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

238
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,670
You get that much need to
counterpoint to a cynical worldview.

239
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,330
The good news is that unlike a
magical shield or healing saliva,

240
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,950
you don't need an interstellar gemstone
to practice empathetic behaviors. Now,

241
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,830
it may take us some time to learn
how to wield them effectively,

242
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,190
but we all have access to
those very human superpowers.

243
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,710
I hope you enjoyed this in
depth exploration of themes
and messages on Steven

244
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,250
Universe. If you'd like to see more

detective agency over on our Patriot page.

246
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:22,570
Yeah.
