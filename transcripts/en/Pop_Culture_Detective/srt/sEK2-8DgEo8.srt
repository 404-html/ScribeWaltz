1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,070
Tonight at six talk show hosts.
Glenn Beck has just been Donald duct.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,380
How a bay area man used a cartoon
to mock the media star. That's next.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,180
Well,
it's not a campaign ad,

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,660
but you can't tell us a lot about the
changing world of politics alongside the

5
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:19,220
dancing babies and yawning.

6
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:23,750
Panders one very pointed political
satire is getting huge hits on Youtube.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,400
Mike Sugarman shows us how one guy in a
San Francisco apartment can change the

8
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:30,170
discussion all across the country

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,900
in a nondescript mission district
apartment building in a tiny room lives at

10
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:37,940
David who has taken on a Goliath.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,593
Awesome.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,400
This is the center of the, uh,
vast conspiracy against Glenn Beck.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,300
Jonathan McIntosh didn't use a
sling shot instead of computer,

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,770
he took aim at one of America's most
controversial talk show hosts who he

15
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,680
despises and goosed him with a duck.

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,860
How many Marxist Communist
anticapitalist you have around you?

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,480
He worked three months,

18
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:08,481
sometimes 10 hours a day on a video mashup
of Glenn Beck mixed with Donald Duck.

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,200
It's gone viral.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,730
At least half a million hits since it's
released Saturday among them, Glenn Beck,

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,830
Donald Duck meets Glenn back.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,090
It is some of the best wellmade
propaganda I have ever seen.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,510
This is where it gets
crazy if I'm not mistaken.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,750
Some of these remix videos I
believe get federal funding.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,240
We're looking into the funding of
this gentleman fairly funded. No,

26
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:39,210
I have no funding at all.
This is just me and my computer in my,

27
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:41,880
in my living room. Uh, in fact,
I, you know, I, I just, uh,

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,920
I just lost my job and last last month,

29
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,980
which gave me some free time and
that's the reason that I was able to,

30
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,810
to put this together in the video.

31
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,590
Donald Duck loses his job and starts
listening to the BEC radio show.

32
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,890
The depression era cartoon and Beck's
musings seem to pair well out of context.

33
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:03,030
Of course, there are Nazis in
America, Nazis and communists.

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,570
You have to think like a German.
June,

35
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,860
1934 at Walt Disney was very conservative,
isn't lost on Macintosh either.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,060
He revels in the satire.
Liberals are loving and Beck
is hating. I like that. I'm,

37
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:18,940
I'm able to speak back to him and that,
um,

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,370
people using remix or I'm using
youtube, you know, are, are,

39
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,600
are able to speak back and that,

40
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:27,450
that there can be a larger voice for
those of us who don't have a radio station

41
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,284
and a TV station,

42
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,830
because now the people who do
less worry about getting shot.

43
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,640
So again, this came out
Saturday and how did it spread?

44
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:42,750
Will Roger Ebert Sot he tweeted
it. John Cusack, the actor side,

45
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:44,280
he tweeted it and it would,

46
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:47,730
it really goes to show is just
how in this media environment,

47
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:52,731
one person can throw open the can of
worms to the entire political world.

48
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,140
Has Disney weighed in on this? Well,
it's fair use from what I understand.

49
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,220
Mr Mackintosh says,
um,

50
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,560
but I don't know mean that's what he
says. It's a lot of Disney material. Yeah.

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,840
He's going to get a job and
a good one. Well, you know,

52
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,170
he worked very hard on
this. Yeah. Good for him.
