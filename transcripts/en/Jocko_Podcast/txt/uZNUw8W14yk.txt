Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number one 61 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:00:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:13       I do the wrong. And first begin to brawl the secret mischiefs that I said, a brooch I lay unto the grievous charge of others, Clarence, whom I indeed have cast in darkness. I do bu weep to many simple goals, namely to Derby Hustings Buckingham and tell them tis the queen and her allies that stirred the king against the Duke. My brother now they believe it and with all wet me to be revenged on rivers, Dorset Gray. But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that God bids us do good for evil. And thus I close my naked villainy with odd old end stolen out of holy writ and seen a saint when most I play the devil. And that right there is a few lines from the play, Richard, the third written by good old William Shakespeare, the Bard and clearly Richard. The third is uh, made out in this play to be an evil like a hundred percent evil political maneuverer. That's what he's made out to be. Sort of the ultimate archetype of the Mac of Alien Machiavellian leader. And there's people that say what and it's, it's actually, it's see, certainly seems that Shakespeare intentionally wrote him that way. And there's a bunch of things, I guess at some point we'll go over the whole play of Richard the third, but

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       let's take a look at the lines that debt, you know, cause because Machiavellian what we've, what we think of it when we hear it now is we think that it means someone that is just completely devious and completely dishonest and completely deceitful in their quest for power. Yeah. Right. That's what people think of when they think of Machiavellian. And definitely I think Richard, the third is made to be and was written to be sort of the, the quintessential machiavellian character. Let's look at these lines a little bit. Um, because as I said, when we did Henry the fifth on podcast number 15, you're not gunna know exactly what Shakespeare is talking about because he's writing in an almost in another language. So not quite, you can still understand it. It doesn't take much. But there's some things going on in there. So it starts off, I do the wrong and first begin to brawl. So was he saying there I am the one that is doing something that is wrong. I'm the one that's starting the fights. Yeah, that's what's going on here. I'm starting to fights and then he says the secret mischiefs that I set a brooch, I lay unto the grievous charge of others. So these bad behaviors that he's undertaking that he's secretly undertaking,

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       he is blaming them on other people. He then goes on to say Clarence, whom I indeed have cast in darkness and you wouldn't quite understand this but unless you read it, but his brother clearance, he put his brother Clarence into prison

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       and then he says, I do blue weep to many simple goals. So he in front of other people, he cries and bemoans that Oh poor clearance. But he thinks these people are fools, namely Derby, hustings and Buckingham, which is what he says in the next line. And then he says that he tells those same people, he tells those people that it's the queen and her allies. And tell them, tis the queen and her allies. He's, he's saying like, look, this is, this isn't about me. It's about the queen. She's the one that's doing all this. She's the one that stir the king against the Duke, my brother. So it's not, it's not my fault. It's the queen. And then he says, now they believe it in with all whipped me, meaning they believe it. And then they're egging him on like you need. You can't let that stand. Imagine that. And then you pick it out, twist it right there. Like you're setting this up. But then you've got these people actually egging you to take vengeance on the situation, which is what they're egging him on to do. Back to the book to be revenged on rivers, Dorset Gray.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       But then, but then here's where, here's where it takes a little, a little switch. But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture, so he's going to say, ah, and then he's going to quote the Bible. He says, he tells them that God bids us do good for evil. You know, hey, the Bible says we should do good instead of evil. That's what's going on here. And then he says, and thus I clothed my naked villainy. That's a good line. You kind of be Shakespeare, right? That one right clove, my naked villainy. This is how I dress up. My evil plans with odd old ends stolen out of holy writ. So He dresses up as naked villain, he covers his evil plans with little parts of scripture from the Bible.

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       Then he closes it and seem a saint when most I play the devil. So like I said, that's, that's Richard the third and things don't really work out that well in the play for Richard the third and they don't want, they didn't work out for him in real life either. He was actually hacked to death, which we generally consider to be a bad ending. He was hacked to death at the end of the battle of Bosworth after he fell off of his horse. Legit. And there's a famous line, which I'm sure everyone's heard, a horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse, which is he, he, he was losing everything. Cause it, he fell off his horse and needed one. And like I said, perhaps at some point we'll, we'll cover the whole play. But today what I wanted to dig into a little bit is this term of Machiavellian.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       And we covered his art of war book, which I had an interesting, um, I think it was a youtube comment cause I said, you know, art of war, Machiavelli, Niccolo Machiavelli and someone's like a top was written by Sun Su Idiot. And then some trooper came on and was like, actually he's not talking about that argue for, he covered that one here and covered this. Oh and this, by the way, there's a bunch of different art awards and here's one of them that was indeed written by Machiavelli. So we covered that. But that's not really a Machiavelli's most famous work. His most famous work is this book, which we mentioned there, the prince and the prince was thought to have been written around a 15, 13 not really widely published until 1532 which was five years after Machiavelli's death. And it's, it's basically the fore runner of kind of leadership bunks, right, is the fore runner of self improvement books and it's telling leaders how to lead their principalities and it, and one thing, and I don't dive too, I don't dive too many of these.

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       We're not going to cover too many things, but it gives real world instruction. So it's kind of like extreme ownership of the dichotomy of leadership. It gives real situations that happen. It gives the principal and then it's like here's a situation where this actually unfolded this way. So it's, it's a very thorough in that respect and it's considered to be one of the first works of modern political philosophy and it, this is the thing, it has the reputation of advising people to do whatever it takes to gain and hold power. That's sort of the, that's when you hear, and in fact the word, like I said, the word has really negative connotations. When someone says, oh, that guy's, I'm back of alien leader. You don't think, oh that's, that's cool. No, you think, oh, he's under handed and he's going to stab people in the back to get, get where he wants.

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       And there's definitely some parts and we'll get to it, but the, it's not that, and the approach is much more balanced than people than people. Then he has the then then people generally consider, it's just a much more balanced perspective and like anything that talks about leadership and human nature, we can learn from it. So let's go to the book. The prince by Machiavelli starts off here. Those who strive to this is, this is an interesting, he's doing a little, he does some salesy stuff in here too. There's a couple of times where I have to, I had to call it, I'm going to call him out, all of them, but he does some Staley's salesy type stuff in here. So here's how he starts it off. Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most precious on which they see him to take.

Speaker 1:          00:10:06       Most delight whence one often sees horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones. And similar ornaments presented to princes worthy of their greatness. So are we saying, hey, if you want to get good, you know, good graces with a prince, you bring him stuff, horses and gold and whatever. Then he says, desiring therefore to present myself to your magnificent, with some testimony of my devotion towards you. I have not found among my possessions anything which I hold more deer than or value so much as the knowledge of the actions of great men acquired by long experience in contemporary affairs and to continual study of antiquity, which having reflected upon and which having a reflected upon it with great and prolonged diligence, I now send digested into a little volume to your magnificence. That's pretty, that's pretty cool. He says, look, I, I could give you gold, but that's not really what's valuable to me.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       What I will do, the most valuable thing I can give you is the knowledge that I have, the knowledge that I've had from studying and living through these things. And he continues. And although I may consider this work unworthy of your countenance, nevertheless, I trust much to you're a benign city, that it may be acceptable. Seeing that it is not possible for me to make a better gift than to offer you the opportunity under of understanding in the shortest time. All that I have learnt in so many years and with so many troubles and dangers, which work I have not embellished with swelling or magnificent words, nor stuffed with rounded periods. So he comes out of the gate, right? He's pretty arrogant dude. These saying, listen, you are so lucky that I went through all this stuff and I'm just gonna give it to you. I'm going to give you this little nice little volume, very plainly written, which is almost like an excuse, right?

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       Like there's no, no, there's no fancy words here. I'm just giving it to you straight. You know, I am no Shakespeare while Shakespeare wasn't even around yet, but he's saying it's very plainly written and then he goes into it. So I think that's a pretty salesy opening. But Hey, good, good on him. He's trying to make it happen. He starts off talking about the difficulties that it occur in a new principality and principalities. You used that word. That's the what the what the book is about. It's when you take over land from people. Um, here we go. Cool. Although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province, one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       That's a great statement and you think about that statement. Think about it from a military perspective. Think about it from a business perspective, and this is something that the u s military should always pay attention to. Hey, you can be strong in your armed forces can be strong, but you need the goodwill of the natives. Boom. There you go. Let's think about, let's remember that one in the world. You, you and we, we know we do our best to do that. America does its best to do that, but we don't always do a good job. Hmm. And then the other thing is, when you think about it from a business perspective, when you get an acquisition taking place, like it's cool, you go in there and you've got all the money to buy some little company, but if they all hate you, nay. If you don't have the goodwill of the people that you just bought, you're going to have some issues. I promise you you're gonna have some issues. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:36       Next up, those dominions, which when acquired are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them are either of the same country and language or they are not. So he's saying, look, when you take someone over there, either with the same language or they don't have the same language when they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self government. So if you take someone over and they speak your language and they've, you know, you took them over from someone else that was controlling them, there'll be okay with that because they're not used to controlling themselves anyways. And then he goes on. But when states acquired in a country differing language, customs or laws, there are difficulties and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them. And one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go reside there.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       So if they don't speak your language, if it's different culture, guess what? You got to go there and you got to stay there. Otherwise it's going to be a problem. So they're going to move there to so they can gain more understanding, gain more understanding and learn the language and stuff like that. And also be there because you've gotta, you gotta be able to pay attention to when rebellion is going to form against it. If you're not, and they speak a different language, they have a different culture and you're not in the game blind. So has some issues. Yeah, you're going to get blindsided. So you've got to go in there, got to get deep. You got to occupy that territory.

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       Continuing on men, odd either to be well treated or crushed. We read that one again. Men ought either B to be well treated or crushed because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries of more serious ones. They cannot, therefore, the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such kind. That one does not stand in fear of revenge. So there's kind of classic Mackey of alien fought. If you're going to hurt someone, just completely annihilate them to the best of your ability. Don't give them the ability to come back at you again. Yeah. And then on the other hand, treat them super good. Right. So the Tia, treat her, treat them good, or you crush them. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       It's,

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       it's, it's a, it's a good statement, right? Yeah. And it takes, this is something that it takes, uh, uh, you know, the will to completely destroy someone. It takes a lot of gall, right. You have to have the stomach to be able to do that. Yeah. And a lot of people don't have the stomach to do that. So that's why I would say in most cases it's better to treat people well and have them come on board. And he had actually, he says that too, but we'll get there. And back to the book, in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies, one spends much more having to consume on the garrison, all of the income from the state so that the whole acquisition turns into a loss and many more are exasperated because the whole state is injured. That's what he's saying. So when you do have to go in and you'd have to smash it and you have to keep people there to keep smashing, guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       You're spending all this money, you're investing all these people and it's so hard to keep it under control that it's not even worth it made the acquisition turns into a loss. So from a, from a business perspective, you go into a company, you buy them, but then they're rebellious. So you've got to fire everyone. They've got to bring people in and retrain them and you've got to retake territory. You lost customers because you cause you didn't support during that time and so you invest all this money and guess what your acquisition ends up becoming a loss. Whereas if you had a good relationship with these people and you went in there and you, they were able to kind of come on board with your culture and the way you were doing things, all of a sudden you move into a good scenario. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:17:34       keep it in. Keep, keep it. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       Friendly. If you can

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       back to the book what all prudent Prince's ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles but also future for which they must prepare with every energy because when foreseen it is easy to remedy them, but if you wait until they approach the medicine is no longer in time because the maladies become incurable. There some good stuff in this book and this is one of them. This is kind of obvious, but hey, you need to look to the future and when there's a problem coming, cut it off early. The earlier you solve the problem, the easier it's going to be. He continues for, it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever. Then in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure, but difficult to detect. But in the course of time, not having been either detected or treating an in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect, but difficult to cure.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       It's like getting caught in our mock, right? If you see it coming, it's easy. You just move your shoulder, you move your hips a little bit, whatever you're out. Yeah. The further it goes down that path, the worse the situation gets. Yes, and it's the same thing also, you know when I've talked about having hard conversations with people, the earlier you have that hard conversation, the easier the hard conversation is to have. The longer you let it go. Not only is it a harder conversation, but it's a conversation that's going to disrupt and cause more problems. It's going to interfere with our relationship. If, if I'm, if I have to have a hard conversation with you, are really are our relationship and isn't getting better, right? It's getting worse. So the ease, the earlier you could solve these problems, the better off you're going to be.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       It continues this, it happens in affairs of state for when the evils that arise have been foreseen, which it is only given to a wise man to see. They can be quickly redressed, but when through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that everyone can see them. There is no longer a remedy. Keep your ears to the ground so you've got to hear what's coming. Therefore, the Romans for seeing troubles dealt with them at once and even to avoid a war would not let them come to a head for, they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others. So every time you delay in getting that problem solved, you're not helping yourself. Hmm. That's a good way to think about that. I haven't really thought about that way before. You know, I, I talk about the hard conversations have earlier. They're going to be easier. The only, if you're putting those those wars off, you're only helping the other person. You're always putting yourself in a worse situation. Okay. So the other person meaning the enemy. Yeah. Yeah. You're only helping the enemy. Hm.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       So attack those problems. Look, well, I think the first thing is pay attention, right? You've got to pay attention to these problems that could be arising hard to detect, hard to you and yeah, and then I like he says it when everyone can see them, it's too late. Yeah. So you gotta be gathering intelligence. You gotta be paying attention back to the book because one can easily entered there by gaining over some barren of the kingdom for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. So he's talking about when you're taking someone, when you're taking over like a kingdom, you, you can always find some people in the kingdom that are of not happy with the situation. Like you can go into a company and you can say, it seems like your, the way your processes work is a real hard on you guys.

Speaker 1:          00:21:22       It seems like they're not really in vet. You can always find some people that are mad inside of a kingdom. That's what he's saying. He's saying to find them. Yeah, he, well, he, here's what he goes on. He says such men for the reasons given can open the way into a state and render victory easy. But if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with infinite difficulties, both from those you have assisted and those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prints because the Lord's that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you. And as you are unable to either satisfy or exterminate them, the state is lost whenever the time brings the opportunity. What you're dealing with there, if you're entering, if you find some people that are disloyal inside of a company and then you go and become friends with them and then you go in and take the company over, there is a chance. And what he's saying is like that disloyalty is, is a trait and they're going to be disloyal to you. So you need to, and you can't, you can't crush them. You can't exterminate them because the, you've developed a relationship with them and at the same time you can't trust them. So be careful with that.

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       Back to the book, whenever those states which have been oc had been acquired as stated above, have been accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three courses for those who wished to hold them. So obviously I'm skipping big chunks of the book, but what he's talking about is when you've taken over somewhere that is used to having their own laws and used to living in freedom, there's three different, three different methods or approaches you can take if you want to hang onto him. Here we go. The first is to ruin them.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       The next is to reside there in person. The third is to permit them to live under their own laws, drawing attribute and establishing within it an oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Very clever, very clever, very smart too. And I see the, again, I keep going back to business a lot because when you, when you're dealing with a company that acquires other companies, like this is very real. If you've got a company, let's say you acquire, if you acquire part of, let's say you acquire part of a company that's been run by some, uh, senior company, like a parent company, they're not used to making their own decisions. So when you come in and say, Hey, now we're not going to help you out and we're gonna, you know, you're going to be kind of going along with us. Now you're under our command.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       If they're used to being commanded, they're like, okay, new boss, but we will deal with it. But if they're, if they've been, if they were their own company, they were, they were on their own and they were doing whatever they wanted and they were living in total freedom and now you come in and see you and now you got start listening to my rules. Yeah. It's going to be a problem. Yes. I don't agree with the fact that you have to crush them. I would prefer that you go in and form a relationship with him. But what he's saying is, look, if you go in there, so let's Say I took over echoes company and you are used to freedom and I was just like, hey echo, here's what's going on. Hey, here's some broad guidance, but I really like what you're doing. Keep doing it, man.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       Keep doing it. And then you know, here's what you're gonna pay me because I'm giving you some support. And you'd be like, okay. Now what I will say, which he doesn't go into is over time I can start to get, first of all, build a relationship with you. Once I build a relationship with you, then I can start saying, hey, echo, have you thought about doing this a little bit different over here and hey, echo, what do you about this? And Hey, echo, this other company that we own does it this way and it's really efficient. Would you consider maybe seeing how that would work inside your, with your team? Yeah. And so I would slowly move, but for me to come in and say, okay, Aca, we just closed the deal. Here's the new yes, that's when you go, hey, you go to your troops and see, I don't know if this was a good call and I don't know what these guys think.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       They know everything. And now listen, we got a rebellion on our hands. So now I might have to crush it. My credit, the whole idea of crushing seems pretty old school. Yeah, yeah. Well, and, and as he said, when once you crush something, well then you've got to invest all kinds of things in it too. Like, Hey, so let's say, let's say I bought your company and then you, you know, you rebelled against me, so I fired you. Well now I've got to bring someone on. I've got to find someone that understands your business and the intricacies of your business. And guess what? That's not easy. And it, guess what? Now I've got to invest all this time and myself and I've got to bring some, some contractors in there to help out. Um, next thing you know, I'm upside down. Whereas if I had just done a good deal with you and you know, kind of let you run things for awhile and let build a relationship so that you actually would want to listen to me, that's different.

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       That's better. Yeah. So yes, the idea of crushing people, generally it's your, it's, it's not the preferred method. It's not ideal. Generally. Sometimes is required. Yes. Sometimes people need to get destroyed. That's, that's the way it is. And when that's the way, cool. That's a lock and load destroyed. Did you used to watch football or do you watch football? I don't watch much football. Ronnie Lott is, he's old school. Yes I do. A lot. Is 40 niners packaged then? I Dunno if this is true, but it's a rumor. I Dunno. This is what I heard when I was

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       young, where he would like, he broke his finger, pinky or I don't know, one of his fingers. He broke it. And you know, he's trying to, you know, play, you gotta play as a professional football player, so you can't just be out because of your finger. So he play, you tape it up and it kept just getting jammed up so he just cut it off. So it's kind of one of those deals, you know where you know, yeah get rid of the finger but you don't have a finger. But if the thing is like, you know, jamming you up too much by being there, then you got to crush it. I heard a story, similar story about village village Ismail do you know crazy Jujitsu player. Great Jujitsu player. But he had crazy a cauliflower ears. Yeah. They just look like to bring to the half tennis half baseball's on either side of his head.

Speaker 3:          00:27:31       And I heard a story about him that he was just asking the doctor just caught them off, cut off, cut them off, just get rid of them. No use. All they do is causing me problems. Just get rid of them. Yeah. So is that considered a hardcore kind of yeah, cause I'm sure that, well then again I guess it depends on the problems, right? I mean cause that's, what are your ears do for you? And I guess, I guess they catch some sound and bring it into your ears. Yes. But if you're not hunting right and you don't necessarily need to hear super well, and by the way, once you have calling photos and it starts going into your ear a little bit, that's not good either for your, for your hearing. So his hearing might improve. Just get rid of those things. Yeah. I guess it depends how bad is coming.

Speaker 3:          00:28:17       You know what I'm saying? I didn't know what you're saying. Yeah. You know, cutting off your years, it's a lot more that goes into that then a finger, I think, because you know, I don't know. I mean on a social level, you know, you get a guy who was, his ears cut off on purpose, by the way. It's kind of like, okay, let's say you're a girl and you're like, Hey mom, dad, boyfriend. Have you never thought about like when if you've read a cauliflower ear? No. Okay. Sometimes when you get cauliflower ear and it's preventing you from trading, there's, there's no doubt that the thought goes through your mind like, you know what? Hey, I'm in the game. You know, these things aren't doing me much good. Let me just get rid of these. Yes, I could see how that could be, I guess, but sorry man, I can't get there.

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       Not with the ears. Maybe the fingers. I dig the fingers for sure. So you can't, there's certain things you can't do if you lose your fingers. I he play guitar. Yeah. You're going to be a problem in gym. So I keep, I keep the fingers more than the ears. The choice. Here's your fingers. I don't mind. You know what, you're, you're more sensitive to your appearance I think than I am aesthetically conscious. Yeah, I would agree with that, sir. Yes, I think so. So you get your ears. I'm keeping my fingers. Yes. Like a hammer on that gift box deal. Well that went off the rails a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:29:39       All right. Going back to the, a wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men and to imitate those who have been supreme so that if his ability to does not equal, there's at least it will savor of it. Let him act like the clever archers who, this is a good little statement, let him act like the clever archers who designed to hit the mark, which yet appears too far distant. And knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow attains tank take aim much higher than the mark. Not to reach them by their strengths or Arrow to so great a height, but to be able to with the aid of so high and aim hit the mark they which they wish to reach. That's a very clever way of putting it. Yeah. Hey look, if I don't think I can hit this mark, I'm just going to aim a little bit higher and then even though I might not reach the highest mark, I'll at least hit the mark.

Speaker 3:          00:30:40       I was, I'll get where I want to be and yeah. Yeah. Fully. That's a good way to go through life. Yeah. There's a lot of that. I mean that's, you know, that's a tactic, technique, whatever and like a lot of things like negotiation and they say they'd do the same thing. Right. Okay. I want to get, you know, I don't know, you go job interview, whatever. I want to make 100,000 so I'm going to ask for like one 20 he's going to negotiate it down and I get my hundred. No, that's true. Where this thing, I think sometimes people get this out of hand is it'll be like a sales organization and they'll say, you know, they want to bring in, they want to do $5 million worth of sales in the next month. And so they say, okay guys, this is what we're gonna do 10 million. And they set an unrealistic goal.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       When you set an unrealistic goal that's not achievable. It's basically a meaningless goal. So you have to, you have to aim a little bit high, but it's gotta be realistic. Yeah. Yeah. I would think you knew, I'm just going off how I felt right there when you said that, uh, if someone sets an unrealistic goal, especially for you, that includes you, you know, where like the failure of reaching that goal is kind of partly or failure. I think you'd kind of decrease my enthusiasm for those deals to, that's why people need to be very careful in how they set their goals, that they set them high enough that it, it, it, you try and get to it and maybe you don't quite get there because let's face it, if you set a goal and you just easily make it, you should have set your goal a little bit higher. You know, if you set a goal and is not even close, no one even tries. Yeah. So you've got to set a realistic goal. Yeah. Yeah. It was not going to work well. Yeah. And like people will be like salt especially at work when people start setting goals all crazy like crazy. That's what I was talking to me. Yeah. Well I was just watching the movie major league. Remember that on the old, the first one I tried to remember what it was about and they were like, baseball is this where they,

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       the owner was trying to like sell the team or something. But for her to do that they had to like lose a games or something like that. And if they didn't lose in, she would just replace the players with other players who would lose, you know, kind of thing. So it was a, so everyone knows all down about it in the garbage truck. Well, there's only one thing to do when the whole thing, you know, like that, right, which is, I dig it. Right. Um, but at like a regular job, well, it was for the movie to obviously, so you've got to tap in inspirational storyline. But anyway, at your job, you know, let's say there's numbers week and then it's like, okay, Dang, you're making me meet these crazy numbers. And they're unrealistic. They're above a normal good goal. They're way above. So it's like, okay, what does this mean now? Now like probably get, can't spend time with my family. Okay, now you're going to freaking dryness into the ground working and do all this stuff or whatever. Going against my interests, you know, as a human being. So I'm gonna feel junk about that. I'm not going to like that. No, no one does. That's my point. Does even no one likes in the business world and no one liked it. It made your leisure either as well. That was, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:33:45       they did like it. Check. All right, moving on. Now as the fact of becoming a prince from private station presupposes either ability or fortunate and he uses the f word fortunate lot to mean like pretty much luck. It is clear that one or the other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties. Nevertheless, he was relied least on fortune is established the strongest. Make sense? So when you, when you're in a leadership position, if you've got there, cause you're lucky, it's going to be harder for you to maintain a good position as a leader. You've got there because of your skill and what does it, what's the other thing he says? Because your ability, if you get there, cause your ability, people are gonna respect you more. It just, you just got there by luck. Those who buy valorous ways become princes acquire a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease.

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       The difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules. And method methods, which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security. So when you have a hard time getting into power and you do it by boldness, once you're there, it's going to be easier for you to do it because you had to make all these maneuvers. You're to figure things out in order to get their continuing, and it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult. This is a good one. There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. So there's nothing harder than trying to come in and introduce a new order of things. Nothing harder than that. And here's the reasons, because the innovator has for enemies, all those who have done well under the old conditions and Luke warm defenders in those who may do well under the new.

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       So you got people that are entrenched that like, hey man, we've been doing this for 20 years. I'm not changing it. And he got someone else saying, well it could work better. That's like, it's not a good comparison. It's not a, it's not a fair fight. Yeah. Cause those people that are already know it works. They know it works. Yeah. You got someone that I think the new thing will work. It's a mismatch. Continuing on. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents who have the laws on their side and partly from the incredulous incredulous of men who do not readily believe in new things until they have had long experience of them. So you got people that have been doing this forever. Like I just said, you've got someone that's hasn't really figured out if there's new things going to work and it's just a mismatch. So they're skeptical.

Speaker 2:          00:36:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       Continuing those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising but much trouble in keeping a top. They have not had any d any difficulties on the way up because they fly. But they have many, when they reached the summit, this is a good one. The people that kind of get lucky and ended up in a, in a senior position, in a leadership position, they got lucky. And so there's no trouble getting there. They got lucky. They flew there. Yeah. But then he says they have trouble when they reached the summit. Continue on. Such are those to whom some state is given either for money or by favor of him, of Him who bestows it. So

Speaker 1:          00:37:20       you know, you see this going through buds actually there's some people that were like incredible athletes and they never failed anything before in their life and all of a sudden they show up and they start failing things and it breaks them. Yeah. Or they're great athletes going through buds. And it's because if you're a great athlete, will and buds is kind of easy. And then you show up at a seal team. Things aren't easy because it's not just athletics in the seal teams and it's not an athletic game. And the Sealer, as a matter of fact, I was just talking about this the other day, the athletic capability of, of a seal or have a special operations. It's like, sure, you get some great athletes in there, but you put on a rucksack and Hump, you know, 10 kilometers, that's not an athletically gifted. You, you as an athletic, there's not an athletic skill test.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       Yeah. You know, it's, it's not like, yeah, you gotta be in good shape for sure. But whether this guy played college football and this guy didn't, where you put on that rucksack and start start humping, you can't tell who's who. Yeah. You know, occasionally you might be able to, you got to you, you can make some assumptions that the have to get the a football player, you know, he's an athletic person but it's not an athletic game. Yeah. The uh, the same with like shooting. Okay. You get someone that's got great hand eye coordination, they're probably going to be a pretty good shot. Not necessarily though. I knew some guys that were great athletes weren't good shots. Yeah. And vice versa. Newsome guys that were great athletes and they were great shots. They'd great hand eye coordination. So it's not really, there's not really this athletic challenge.

Speaker 1:          00:39:00       So my point is you get someone that's sales through buds because they're a great athlete cause cause buds is more of an athletic pursuit. I mean it's like, okay you gotta run, you got to do pull, you got to do the opposite course. There's more athleticism involved in getting through buds. Once you get through buds then it's like, oh you have to think and you have to gut through hard things a while you're thinking. So there's some guys that I went through with, it got a little tripped up when they got to the teams, even though they did not have a hard time at all with buds, they got to the teams, they get tripped up on things because they just, they just kind of gotten their own way. You know? Unfortunately. Good, good guys, hard guys. But you just think man, just you need to think a little bit more dealing with certain mental anguish while you do other things. Dealing with it. Yeah, you got to make decisions when you're tired, you got to stay awake when you're tired. You got to, yeah, like all those things. Oh there's stress going on. And you're freaking out. Well, guess what? You still got to decide that you've got to make something happen and you've got to go do it. Yeah. Where it's easy to just go curl up in a ball, take a nap. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       Continuing such and he's talking about these people that were kind of given luck or or bought their way into the position. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated them to most inconsistent and unstable things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position because unless they are men of great worth and ability does not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command. Having always lived in private condition. So you get somebody that gets thrown into a, to a leadership position and they haven't done anything to earn their position here. They're going to be an experience going to be hard for him. Yeah. Same thing with the, I mean you maybe see it now, maybe you don't, but are injured you to where you know the, you know, a young guy or whatever,

Speaker 4:          00:41:01       he'll, he'll, or he'll have a certain body type or audit or whatever. He'll develop like this certain move that'll be kind of new to everyone. Like no one's ever seen these, this system or this new move or whatever. And they'll get guys get guys in and win tournaments and start winning tournaments and the instructor's like, Dang, this guy's killing these tournaments. Hey, let's give him his blue belt, Brown belt. You know, all the way up. He gets his like brown belt, black belt because he wins tournament more so then because of like his whole rounded skill set and knowledge. So kind of makes

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       sense. Right? I mean shoot, if a man, if he's willing, if he's tapping everyone out in the tournament in, you know, all the lower belts, of course we can get you to spell it. Makes Sense. But later on, you know, as time goes on and one of the things it's like, okay, they'll just figure out the move, figured out that the answer to that move, what else is left? Nothing crazy. That if you know the move, like isn't it crazy and you first of all, but if you don't how to defend something, you can stop. If you don't know it, you get tapped. If you know it, you can get out. Yes. That's so crazy. Yeah. And, and what's really crazy is that's the way life is. That's the way leadership is. Like when I talked to companies and I'll be talking to some leader and I'm like, Hey, here's what you need to say in a situation like this.

Speaker 3:          00:42:16       And it's, it's like they can now escape this position that they're in. Yes. Cause they can, oh, oh yeah, here's what you should say. Yeah. And they say, ah, you can see it. Look in their eyes. And then they'll call me and say, dude, I did that team turned around and said, oh yeah. Big shocker man. There's moves that you can make. There's tactical maneuvers that you can make and if you know them, you will, you'll escape the position. If you don't know them, you'll get destroyed. Yeah. And so to, to where you're going with this is sometimes somebody develops something where they get really good at something and as soon as soon as some people know it's coming, you know, they can just stop it and then all of a sudden they start losing tournaments. They get to purple belt, they start losing journalists because of how I was going to say, see, it's unrealistic in my opinion, that someone would be really good at a move and go all the way to black belt based on that move.

Speaker 3:          00:43:10       That's not realistic. Yeah. They'll get somebody will, people will figure it out and they'll have to round out their game before they get brown belt. Black belt. You were getting a little crazy there. Yeah, no, for the example. But there is this one, and I don't know the girl's name, but it was um, it was, I dunno, like I was saying, but she was a brown belt, but she had been a brown belt. Like she, it took her like two years or so. It's something super fast to get to Brown. We get to brown belt because of, I, if I'm not mistaken, she would do like a reverse triangle all the time. Maybe a regular triangle. I'm not sure. And then um, I dunno then I think I could be getting the names wrong, but I think it was penny Thomas and she ended up fighting for Bennie Thompson.

Speaker 3:          00:43:52       Bennie Thompson beat her and you know, you know, the new hotness, the new girl coming up or whatever. And um, I think it was Joel who mentioned like this exact thing that he's talking about where it's like, yeah, like to be a real brown belt and compete at the top level, you got to have a well rounded game essentially. You know, because you can't just, you can't just like what you said, like you make it up the Brown and black for a reason. Brown and black belt. You can't just do it with one move cause that's not what a brown belt. And that's when you get someone that's really good. They know about all the different moves. You know, it's, it always surprises me dean will be able to answer a question about moves that he doesn't actually do in a normal basis. Yeah, yeah. He knows exactly how to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:44:34       He knows how to defend it. He knows how to set it up, but he doesn't actually do that move and, and that's, that's how good you got to be. The other weird thing is you get, you catch someone like dean in a position that's totally new, you know, just some random and he actually knows like a thing to do to get out of it, you know, and you think, how do you, how do you know that, you know, some weird like leg ride position. He's like, Oh, if you turn your knee outward and then you pinch your ankles, you'll, you'll, it'll make them adjust lead. You can come up on the arm and you can get out and you're like, wait, how do you know that? I've never been in this position. I've been doing Jujitsu for 25 years and I've never been this position before.

Speaker 3:          00:45:13       And now you're telling me that this is just you, you know this and he probably, some of these positions he's probably never been in. It's like codes like writing code where if you kind of know the certain like general rules to things, you can start figuring it out, figuring it out. You know, like, and someone like Dean who was like, that's optional, Dude. No, but that's a thing. There's a difference between what I'm talking about because what I'm talking about is he actually knows specifically, he's not like, hey, here's what would work based on the general rules of grappling. It's like, no, here's what you do in this specific situation. That is weird. Yeah. But that's just completely well rounded. Yeah. That's just completely well rounded. You're saying at some point he has had that experience with that move. Yes. He's done it some way or another and he said, oh, or he's done a much narrower approach of what you're talking about.

Speaker 3:          00:46:06       Like he, he's not, maybe not that exact thing, but it's so close to it. He's like, here's what happens. Here's what's going on. Yeah. Yeah. Similar but not the same. Like he goes beyond just having the principles. It's like principals coupled with experience coupled with knowledge and dean's mind for that is, it's really, it's crazy uncanny with that as far as like kids' knowledge and what he can sort of figure it out or whatever. It's almost like while you're doing what you do during the day, he's like in a room just thinking about it. You would think you will think that you would think that he's sitting around with like four screens, like youtube screens and he's watching different things at once and then he has some sort of like weird, uh, uh, control where he can view different angles and comprehend them. But no, he has a weird, because I know he doesn't do that.

Speaker 3:          00:46:57       Yeah. He used to do it though, but he has a weird, um, he, he's got his mind. It's just made to do that. His mind is just, has a greater understanding of it than a normal person and even an abnormal person. Yeah. But yeah, that makes sense. Like, you know, if you're, if you're thorough or thoroughly trained or have a lot of experience and you've been through the pitfalls ups, downs, you know, you kinda that that light is kind of on for you. But if you just sorta lock out, well yeah. You know, we work with companies who work with like startup companies where it's not that the people haven't scrapped to get where they are, but you know, you get funded and you got 12 people on your team and then all of a sudden you get a massive funding and you're expecting to roll into production of something and, and you look up and you got 180 people, you don't have any experience as a leader and you're expected to lead.

Speaker 3:          00:47:51       And that's, you know, a situation that echelon front gets involved in because the investors will come and say, hey look, we got these guys over here. They're awesome guys. They're working hard. Guess what? They got propelled in this position. They're awesome at their job. They don't know how to lead yet. Can you help them? Yes. That's what we do Roland, and make it happen. Make sense? You can't expect someone to know how to lead if they've never been in a leadership position before. Can some people pull it off? Yes. It's not a big number though. It's not a big number. Continuing. Ooh, this is a good one. He who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. So lay a good foundation.

Speaker 3:          00:48:42       This is another, another thing that's important when it comes to Jujitsu, don't be learning the Gogo Blada day four, but they're just so fun. I know people want to learn that Gogo Plata and they don't know how to do a straight arm lock. Yeah, that's a problem. And that's why though, right? I mean even like this, that's why like people won't focus on the foundation because it's like, that part's not as like fun short term payoff types of Richard area. It's more fun. It's go, go, go. Plata is more fun. Whoa, look at that. It looks fancy. It looks cool. It's like, um, I think it was dean with, he was teaching a class and he was teaching them how to fall or something like that. Not for a long time, just a little bit. And then, uh, he was teaching like a position and whatever. This is actually a while ago.

Speaker 3:          00:49:24       Uh, and then towards the end he was like, all right. All right. All right. Nope. The kind of like no one said anything like, Hey, when are we going to learn blah, blah, blah. And no one said anything. He but dean said it as if people were saying, well when are we gonna learn something fun kind of thing. So Tina was like, all right, all right, I'll teach you a submission. You kind of like, cause he knew, he knows like the submission hold is the fun part to learn in Jujitsu. I mean as far as the spectrum, when you start yes. When you start. Yeah, yeah. Fully, fully. Cause you just, you know, you think, oh I don't understand why it's good for me to lay this way on some other or shrimp across the room. Like what the heck is that? That's laying a good foundation. That's what that is. Otherwise you've got to do it in. It's going to be hard to do. The same thing with businesses. When you start a business, start it with a good foundation so you don't have to go back in there afterwards and perform surgery on something that's already been constructed. All right, now this is Mackey of alien in a pretty serious way. The name of this one is

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       called, or this is, I would say this is kind of what stems some of you, the reputation concerning those who have obtained a principality by wickedness, but, and I say this establishes, but this actually goes against sort of that standard machiavellian attitude. So here we go. This is one of the historical examples that he gives that I'm actually gonna read because it's pretty, pretty cool. A gaff Achilles. The Sicilian became king of Syracuse, not only from a private, but from a low, an abject position. This man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamous with so much ability of mind and body, having devoted himself to the military profession. He rose through the ranks to be prayed or of Syracuse being established in that position and having deliberately resolved to make himself prince and to seize by violence without obligation to others, that which had been conceited to him by a cent.

Speaker 1:          00:51:40       He came to an understanding for this purpose with the, with Ama car, the car theny Jin, who with his army was fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the Senate of Syracuse as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the republic and at a given signal, the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people, these dead. He seized and held the Princeton of that city without any civil commotion. And although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians, he ultimately and ultimately besieged. Yet not only was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for its defense with others, he attacked Africa and in a short time raised the siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians reduced to extreme necessity. We're compelled to come to terms with a golf Achilles and leaving Sicily to him had to be content with the possession of Africa.

Speaker 1:          00:52:43       So this guy is, is just gets after it and destroys people and kills people in order to get into a good position. Now, you might think that Machiavelli would say, hey, that's great. Here's what it actually says back to the book. Yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow citizens to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion. Such methods may gain empire, but not glory. Still. If the courage of a gothic please in entering into the end and extricated himself from the dangers be considered together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it can not be seen. Why? He should be less esteemed than the most notable captain. Oh, there he is, giving him more credit, but then he goes back again. Nevertheless has barbarous, cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickedness. Do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men. What he had treated can, what do you achieved? CanNot be attributed to either fortune or genius.

Speaker 2:          00:53:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       So, and I'll go one step further because this is what I think. I think that when you behave in that manner, it'll come back to you. Yeah. It'll come back to you tonight. I'm not saying there's going to come back to the karmic way, dude. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying when you, when you inflict damage on people, they remember it. And there will be a time in some point when they will have the opportunity to be rain down. Vengeance upon you. Yeah. So if you act that way, you're gonna, you're gonna get yours. And so if you treat people with respect and you treat people as you would like to be treated, then it's fine. And when the opportunity arises for them to cross you, they'll remember how you treated them and you treat them well and they say, okay, you know what? We're going to give this guy a pass. But when you screw people over, they're going to screw you back. Yeah. At some point. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:44       Continuing on. It has to be remarked that in seizing a state, the usurper ought to examine closely all those injuries, which it is necessary for him to inflict and do them all at one stroke so as to not have to repeat them daily. And thus by not unsettling men, he will be able to reassure them and win them to himself by benefits. This is a good one. If you're gonna, if you got to cause damage, rip the bandaid off. That's what he's saying it all at once. So if you're going into a business and you're like, okay, we're going to have to eliminate some people. Don't eliminate two guys today and then two guys in a week and then three days, three guys in a month, and then three people in two weeks in and you just, everyone now everyone's walking around, they're scared of getting destroyed, they're scared of getting fired.

Speaker 1:          00:55:30       They don't trust you. You go in, you go, okay, hey, here's, sorry. Hey, there's some changes. There's some reductions we've got to make. Here it is. There's 28 people. They're going away. What's left? We're going to go forward. Or when you conquer. Yeah. He who does otherwise either from Tim [inaudible] or evil advice is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand. Right. Neither can he rely on his subjects, nor can they attach themselves to him owing to their continued and repeated wrongs. So you keep stabbing people every once in a while. Every two, three days I cut someone's head off. Yeah. These guys are just, you know, first of all, I got to walk around with a knife all the time and they're thinking, oh, I see what he's all about. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:19       Continuing for injuries ought to be done all at one time. That being tasted less, they offend less benefits ought to be given little by little so that the flavors of them may last longer. Oh, so you don't go and give everyone a yearly bonus at the beginning of the year. Hey, here's all this money. No. You Go, hey look, there's a good quarter or good month last month. Coddle something for you. Yup. That tastes last long. If it does, uh, I recommend that with children, by the way. Okay, good to know what I'm saying. Yes. You don't give them the big reward, you make them. You got to earn it to get it. Earn it. Yeah. Keep it going. Keep it going. Yeah. Continuing and above all things, a print art to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil shall make him change.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:19       Because if the necessity for this comes in troubled times, you are too late for harsh measures and mild ones will not help you for, they will be considered as forced from you and no one will be under any obligation to you for them. So what are you saying? There's stay balanced. So if you, if things are going well in your company and you're like, Hey, bonuses all around and then all of a sudden things get lean. I knew I a no more bonuses or the other hand is like, oh, things are going rough and like we're not giving anyone anything. Hmm. What you need to do is stay balanced. Hey, here's the budget. Here's our projected budget. Here's what we're going to give out. Here's what we're planning to give out. It may vary a little bit on, you know, up or down from there depending on the market and depending on how we're doing it, depending on what the future look like, you want to be balanced. Don't go hardcore in one extreme or the other. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:58:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:19       Next we're a leading citizen, becomes the prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence, but by the favor of his fellow citizens. This may be called a civil principality, nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain it, but rather a happy shrewdness. And this seems to be the most positive thing that he, this happy shoot. It's like, oh, you're making good decisions, shrewd decisions. And that's how you come into power and people aren't happy with it. Like that seems like the best possible way to take over a cool according to this continuing one, cannot buy fair dealing and without injury to others. Satisfy the nobles. But if you can satisfy the people for their object as more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress and the former only desire not to be oppressed. So who's more important?

Speaker 1:          00:59:15       The nobles or the people. The people, yeah, that's not very machiavellian or it's not the tradition machiavellian. Thank you. Consideration. It is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people because of there being too many. Whilst from Noble's he can secure himself as they are few in number make a connection with your people continuing. The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them but from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment but also that they will rise against him for they being in these affairs more far. Seeing in a student always come forward in a time to save themselves and to obtain favors from him whom they expect to prevail and he goes on about these nobles a little bit more. Nobles ought to be looked at mainly in two ways. They either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune or they don't. So there's two D, Two different kinds of people you'll have with you. People that just get on board or don't they get off? They get on board or they don't.

Speaker 1:          01:00:27       And then he says when for their own ambitious ends, they shun binding themselves. It is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you and to prince ought to guard against such and to fear them as if they were open enemies. Because in adversity they will always help to ruin you. Someone that's not on board, someone that's looking out for themselves, someone that's looking out for themselves and not looking out for you. It's a problem. Real problem. It's an you treat them like an open enemy or view them. Fear them as if they're are an open enemy.

Speaker 2:          01:01:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       And then he continues. But one who in opposition to the people becomes a prince by the favor of nobles ought above everything seek to win the people over to himself. And this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection

Speaker 1:          01:01:31       because men, when they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil are more bound, are bound more closely than to their benefactor. Thus people quickly become more devoted to him. So, well, he, again, he's all about connecting with the troops, connecting with the troops. And if they think you're going to treat them like crap and then you treat them well, they're like doubly devoted to you. It feels better. That's the expectation thing. See, and I can explain that to you too, with the, with comfort, you know, like, you know, you can, if you're in bed

Speaker 2:          01:02:07       and then

Speaker 1:          01:02:08       you know, you hear, I don't know, chicken outside or something or like a chain saw like a block away or something, you're like, ah, I can't relax with that noise or whatever because you expect to be real comfortable, your bed kind

Speaker 4:          01:02:19       of thing. But you go land some chair or sit on a chair in and it's surprisingly comfortable bra, you'll fall asleep real quick. So it's Kinda the same deal with the people though. Mackey Villian naps, Bro. That's what I'm talking about. Just saying when you, when you get all, yeah, like, oh, this guy's going to be a Dick, you know, and then even then you can look just on a normal social level, you know, oh, he's going to be dating. And you meet him up like, uh, like, you know, movie stars, right? Let's say they always play a bad guy or something like that. And this goes both ways too. Um, and you know, you meet the movie star in person and they're all nice, you know, but you see them playing the bad guy. So you have this weird subconscious expectation that you just love that guy or whatever

Speaker 1:          01:03:01       they play there. That's how they are. Yeah. It's like subconscious. What do you think that those people that play a bad guy all the time when in real life they feel like everyone views me like I'm a jerk, so I'm going to be super nice. Maybe. Maybe. But

Speaker 4:          01:03:15       actually, you know what? I actually hear more about the opposite where it's like it's the good guy, you know, he's all, he's playing the good guy or maybe on some show or something like that guy's a jerk. Yeah. You know, you meet them in real life. He's not like

Speaker 1:          01:03:28       that anyway. Same deal. Yeah. Expectations mean a lot is what you're getting at. Yup. Including leadership perspective and napping perspective. Yes. And meeting movie stars or whatever. Yes. Here we go. A prince who can command and is a man of courage. Undismayed an advert in, in adversity who does not fail in other qualifications and who by his resolution and energy keeps the whole people encourage such a one we'll never find himself deceived in them and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well. Again, this is not what people think Mackey Machiavelli was talking about. It's not what they think he's saying. Build relationship. Be Strong. Give to your people.

Speaker 1:          01:04:24       Continuing a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and have him and then he will always find them faithful. Oh, that one's a little bit. That one's a little bit, hey mom, you know you need, you need me here. Yeah. That one's a little bit machiavellian tradition. Mack. Yeah. Continuing whoever shall fortify his town and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects well and to be often repeated will never be attacked without. Great caution for men are always adverse to enterprises, were difficulties can be seen and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack. One Who has his town well fortified and is not hated by his people. Again, try build relationships with your people. That's what he's saying.

Speaker 1:          01:05:22       A Prince who has a strong city and has not made himself odious will not be attacked or if anyone should attack, he will only be driven off with disgrace. So same thing like if you've got a good, if your people support you so you can get attacked and you're going to drive that person off, that attacks you drive off in disgrace. Quick one here that the arms with which a prince defenses state are either his own or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries or mixed. And we says auxiliaries. He's talking about how if you have an ally, you can use their troops, right? So if you and I are allies and I'm like, Hey, echo and be an attack over here, you can send me some troops. Those are my exhilarate troops. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous. And if one holds a state based on these arms, he will stand neither for from north safe for they are disunited ambitious, ambitious and without discipline.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       Unfaithful Valeant before friends, cowardly before enemies they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is foreign piece one is robbed by them and in war by the enemy. The fact is they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of a stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are already enough. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war. But if war comes they take themselves off or run from the Pho.

Speaker 1:          01:07:01       Yeah, I ain't got a friend that does like high level security and they were going, he was going through like a high level briefing plan if in in like a serious disaster scenario with a high paying client and he was basically head incorporated into the plan, his own family. So okay. Echoes the High Plan Con Client. You come to me and say, Hey, I want, if there's a, if there's a tr a complete catastrophe, we're talking chem, bio, breakout, Zombie apocalypse, what's the plan? And he goes, okay, here's the plan. He came up with a plan and he put, I said, okay, echo, here's the plan. Here's what's going to happen. Here's where my family is going to be. And the guy's like, what do you mean? You're like, Whoa, your family, I'm not worried about your family. The security guys, security guys said, Hey, I'm not you guys started guys.

Speaker 1:          01:07:57       Yes I will be bringing my family. And the guy's like, wait, why am, why are you bringing your family? He says, cause if I'm not bringing my family, I'm not going to be there to help you survive. And the guy says, okay, fair enough, right? Yes. Hey, we've got a bunker to go to. I'll get you to the bunker, but I'm not going to get, I'm not to leave my family. And then you think I'm going to defend your bunker when my family's out with the zombies. No. The best thing you could possibly do is let me bring my family in the bunker because then I will die before I give up the bunker. If it's just you, I love you. I appreciate your giving me money, but I'm going to take care of my family first. Yeah. So think about that. It's a squared away plan, right? Yeah. You actually embed yourself inside my family and you're going to be safe. Yeah. I'll use some of your money to, to prepare for the situation, but then we'll be ready. Yeah. We're all one team now. Yeah, so that turns someone from a mercenary into, you know, it's just part of the team.

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       Continuing on. The mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not. If they are, you cannot trust them because they always aspire to their own greatness. Either by oppressing you who are their master or others. Contrary to your intentions. But if the captain is not skillful, you are ruined. The usual way. Don't. Yeah, just the usual way of being ruined. You know what that is? That means you just get hacked to death on the battlefield. That's what it means. Yeah. Lose, lose with the mercenaries. Mercenaries. A loose, loose scenario. Yeah. Continuing a print ought to have no. Ah, let's get in the zone for this one. Uh, a prince ought to have no other aim or fought nor select anything else for his study. Then war and its rules and discipline.

Speaker 2:          01:09:50       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       For this is the soul art that belongs to him who rules and it is of such force that it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease then of arms, they have lost their states. And the first cause of you're losing it is to neglect this art. And what enables you to acquire a state is to be the master of the art. So there you go. That's general rules for everyone. Study nothing but war didn't discipline. Yes. Cool. Yeah. Yes it is. It is interesting, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          01:10:50       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:10:51       me, you don't have to go back that far to where did the way things are going to be is settled by war a hundred percent and you could still say that's true today. I mean, when diplomacy fails, you go to war. Yeah. That's the way it works. You and I can have a conversation if that conversation fails, what's gonna Happen? Accreted disagree. No, I'm not agreeing to that turns into a scrap, so I better study. Yeah. Now, if, if one of us knows that the other one is going to win on the field of battle, that's going to make that person a little bit more apt to agree, right? Yes. You know what I mean? Yeah. Or agree to disagree, which ever, no. Well, the one person might have to agree otherwise they're getting choked.

Speaker 1:          01:11:38       All right, so now he talks about how how you continuing on a prince who does not understand the art of war over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore to have his thoughts, this to have out of his thoughts, this subject of war and in peace, he should addict himself more to its exercise. Then in war, this he can do in two ways. The one by action nearby by study. So he's saying that in peace time you can actually addict yourself more to exercising war then you can and war itself. So when it's time to prepare, you prepare even when no one will not war going on. That's when you get ready. You don't wait until you're getting attacked to start training. Jiujitsu you start now. Yeah. I've had that argument with people that said it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:35       Well, the thing is it takes really tall, long time to get good at Jujitsu. When are you going to be attacked? Well, I don't know. If you get a attack tomorrow, that's a bummer, but you're probably not going to get attacked. To me, you're getting attacked in six months. You might get attacked in a year. You might get attacked in four years. Yeah, you can be really good by that time. Yeah. Yeah. There was an article, I think you even came across it, you might even have commented on it online and in the article it was like some things that you shouldn't focus on or whatever as a man or something like this. And uh, I thought it was a fake article and I still think, I mean, I don't know if it was real or not, but whatever. Let's just say it was real and it was like fighting said that's the most wrong thing of her.

Speaker 1:          01:13:21       And I actually agree that, oh, I actually think that this is so high up. I kind of agree that this, with this statement, like you should focus on this as being really high in your, in your focus in life. And it really comes down to a safety thing really. And look, yeah, it definitely comes down to a safe thing. I'm not, I'm not saying like, Hey, just studied Jujitsu, just study MMA. I, I'm not saying that right, because those shouldn't be your primary interest unless you're a fighter. Right. And there's some people that are so into whatever, they get sown digit Jujitsu that the rest of their life falls apart. I'm not recommending that. Right. Want you to have a good, well balanced life, but if you make Jujitsu a part of it, it's going to be better. Yes, it's going to be better. It's going to adapt to everything else. It's going to teach you about other things. Yeah. Yeah. And that's not to mention you can fight a few on, not to mention Peter to, he's like a,

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       he mentioned something about what was it, it was something to do with golf. Like basically he was saying, you have to put all this effort in and it's too frustrating. And I said, wait till you tried to Jitsu and then someone else said and he said, that's why I'm not doing it. Or something like that. Yeah. Well he said something along those lines and then I said something like, oh no, someone else chimed in. Hey Golf. It doesn't teach you anything like golf has what? Transferable skills to life does golf have? Hey, I'm not hating on golf. If you like golf, cool. More power to you as far as I'm concerned, but you're not going to be able to take the skills of a putt and bring them to now. Okay, well let's, let's reach here. I guess you will, cause you know, you're gonna be able to relax.

Speaker 3:          01:14:59       You're going to learn how to get to mental focus. So that's good. Yeah. Good. In that perspective we'll give credit, but direct transferable physical techniques, very limited. Limited. Especially when you start comparing them to g to, yeah, golf can give you some of the same things that, that like when I talk about shooting, like when you get good at shooting, it gives golf can give you some of those same things cause you're, you're under pressure, you've got to focus, you've got to put the last shot out of your mind. You've got to focus on what you're actually doing. You can't worry about the next shock cause there's a lot of things that it can help there. There's some motor skills, some sports stuff for sure. But I cut you off. What were you saying? What was the thing? But I don't know. I was, I was super hyped on whatever I was about to say the article.

Speaker 3:          01:15:41       Oh yeah. So it was like fighting, you shouldn't, you know, fight or whatever. And what made it even worse? A lot worse is the explanation as to why. What was the reason why, if I remember correctly, it was because you shouldn't be fighting. That's why you only play it if you lose your temper, you know, like, no, you should own it in a nutshell you say because you shouldn't be fighting, so you shouldn't focus on, on, on learning how to fight or whatever. Here's, here's the, the ultimate dichotomy in this situation. The more, the better you can fight, the less you're going to have to find. Exactly right. And most of us, in fact, I would, I'm almost tempted to say all of us, everybody who is a trained fighter, unless you're talking about competition, you don't train to fight. So you can go get into fights with meat.

Speaker 3:          01:16:27       No, that's not the way, the reason. Not even like a little bit of the region. Okay. I can't think of anyone that I've known in training Jujitsu that their goal is like, Hey, I'm doing this so I can go, uh, antagonize people and actually get in to get myself into fights. There's no one that you're right. There's no change. I haven't, I mean, I'm sure there's a couple complete jerks somewhere out there that have done that, but I haven't done any yet. And even thinking about that, it'd be like, that'd be weird seeing, I'm going to be different when someone's like a bouncer. Right? Oh, you were a bouncer. Right. And it's like, oh, I want to know how to handle myself if I get into a fight. Yeah. But you'd rather just be polite to people until it was be polite. Right. Until then.

Speaker 3:          01:17:16       Be Nice until it's time to not be nice. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about the way we used to do it right there. Exactly right. Even then, by no means, it's literally the opposite direction. It's not so I know how to go fight guys. You know? It's more so you know what to do in the event of a fight. Now, I will say this, I have to look at this from a perspective. When I was younger, like before I joined the military, there was times when we were getting in fights just to get into fights and if Jujitsu would have been a thing, I probably would have been doing it. Ah, I was just young and stupid. So were all my friends. Right. So here and here's, here's kind of the, I call it a dichotomy, but I think it's more like, uh, sure. I'll call it a dichotomy.

Speaker 3:          01:18:07       It's like a catch 22, so like when you don't know how to fight, like before you take Jujitsu. Oh yeah. Um, same, same boat where it's like getting in a fight seems more appealing when you learned you do too. And here's the proof. By the way, when you learned you to, you don't really want to do it maybe at first, maybe at first your white belt or whatever. Sure. But think about this blue belt, purple belt, Brown belt, that, and this goes up and up. The more you advanced get your black belt, you've been a black belt for like what, 1314 years or something like this one. A brand new white belt comes in. Do you want to roll with him or you want to roll with Andy? Andy, why Andy's good. Exactly right. So you want to, you don't want to go test your skills against some guy weird on the street.

Speaker 3:          01:18:51       You know you want to go practice and learn and prove that you're like good with other good people. You know other people who are trained. So it's like it, it makes no sense that want to get where you're going with that is when you're good or no. Like let's say Amen to go learn how to fight the your first Jujitsu class. You're like, okay, I'm not going to get any fights. You know what I'm saying? Which is I think a very realistic thing and I think if I was a 15 year olds old again and Jujitsu exist and I was like all, I'm going to go learn how to fight. I would have gone in there one class and I'd be like, I'm not getting any fights. This stuff, cause you never know who knows this stuff because you're going to judge glass and you get choked out by someone that is half years or maybe three quarters your size.

Speaker 3:          01:19:33       Yeah. That's a scary thing. Sunstar looking around going, wait, who knows this? I'm not. Your confidence goes way down when you, well let's put your yeah, I guess is your coffee. It's yeah, it's absolutely true. And I was in the, Oh man, I felt that it was overwhelmed because I was in like, like you said, I was a bouncer. So even at like when you get your blue belt, it's like that's when you're kind of the most fiery, I think in certain ways. And so I'm looking around and I'm like, yeah, you know, I could do this. I could take that guy. He's bigger, but I could take them like I know I can. But then you're like, wait, what up bro? What? Y'All don't know who that guy is, you know, kind of be one wrestler, Bro. What if you caught yourself or you found yourself in a rear naked choke in a real fight, bro, you're, you're kind of done man.

Speaker 3:          01:20:19       You'd be in big, big trouble for that. Yeah. So when you think about that and you're like, man, yeah, just like are you said, Bro, I'm not getting any into any fights there is that this goes even further. So this article that you're talking about that said you shouldn't learn how to fight because you shouldn't be fighting. Yeah. Shitting, get into fight the actual, if you feel the urge to fight, the best thing you can do to quell that urge to go learn how to fight. Yeah. I think he said the best thing is to go learn meditation. No, Sam Harris, where are you at? We're not, that's not going to help us. I'm not against meditation, but as a, as a replacement for learning how to fight and negative. Sorry man. And, and you know what? I've had Tim Ferris and Peter, and I don't know if we talk about this with Sam yet, that they think they, they, they impose meditation onto my Jujitsu for me right there like that.

Speaker 3:          01:21:10       Is there like, hey joc would, the things that people are trying to get from meditation is what you get when you go and you do Jujitsu. Yeah. Like your mind gets emptied, your focused but not focused. There's all these things and I'm sure I'm, you know, people that are in the meditation will say, no, you're missing it and I'm fine. That's fine. I know I am. Whatever. But what I'm saying is there are some similarities. There has to be, because Tim and Sam all, you know, they both did. You just do and do meditation and there's crossover there somewhere. Tim for sure has told me that. Tim, for sure, it's taught me that even like weightlifting, you know, even when you're trying to do a movement, right? You're trying to do a snatch, you're trying to do some movement that you have to focus on that puts you, I mean, you know what it's like when you go to Jujitsu, you come home, you feel so good, but you don't feel good because of the physical workout.

Speaker 3:          01:22:03       You feel good because your brain got emptied. You know? And I think that's part of what meditation is. I don't know, but yeah. Well, yeah, I would think so too. Yet. It's like an overlap. Yeah. There's a bunch of overlap there. So just sum this up. Learn how to fight, right. Learn not to bake bread. Don't listen to that Weirdo article, man. The thing is that there's a good chance that it was like a one of those parody, whatever. I, I forget what even it was on. Yeah, but it wasn't on like a parody website. I don't, I didn't recognize it as a parody rep website, but I don't remember the website, to be honest with you. I just saw these weird things. To me it was, it was the kind of where all of the items on his little list or like we're wrong. Fighting was just the one that I felt song as a mouth and it was just wrong. This is joke, joke, joke. Okay. So as I was wrapping up that one, he says that

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       that you can study war, you can ask yourself, it's exercise yourself in war two different ways. He says one by action, the other by study. Here we go. Here's the action part. As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled to follow incessantly. The chase, which is like hunting and patrolling by which he accustomed his body to hardships and learn something of the nature of the localities and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the valley's open out, how the planes lie to end to understand the nature of rivers and marshes and in all of this to take the greatest care which knowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his country and is better able to undertake its defense afterwards by means of knowledge and observation of that locality. He understands the ease.

Speaker 1:          01:24:02       Any AC understands with ease, any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter because the hills, valleys and planes and rivers and marshes that are for instance in Tuscany have a certain resemblance to those of other countries. So that with the knowledge of the aspect of one country, one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the prince that lacks this skill, the essential which is desirable, that a captain should possess for a, teaches him to surprises enemy to select quarters to lead armies to array the battle to besiege towns to his advantage.

Speaker 2:          01:24:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:24:40       So boom, go out train. Yeah, train incessantly, train incessantly, get out there. That's what you have to do. And now, so that's the action part and the other part, now here, now we get to the study part to exercise the intellect. The prince should read histories and study the actions of illustrious men to see how they have borne themselves in war to examine the cause of their victories and defeat so as to avoid the ladder and imitate the former.

Speaker 2:          01:25:17       Oh Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:25:19       Listen to this podcast. This is what we're saying. Yeah. Read. If you don't got time to read, press play. Boom. Yeah. Get some. All right. I wish I had this podcast. Yeah. I wish I had this podcast to listen to when I was 17 years old when I was 19 years old, when I was 23 years old when I was 33 years old when I was 37 years old. Yeah. Are you kidding me? Yeah. That practice part is, it seems like, oh yeah, that makes sense. You know, but I think that, I'm not sure if you've read the whole thing, but it seems kind of even understated. Cause like even when you study something, right, you're like, okay, I know what to do. Part seems to understated the study part or the action. The action part.

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       Yeah. He says incessantly. He says Dick to yourself to exercise before. I don't know if that's understated or not. I didn't read it. Well, none at all. Yeah, maybe you know, maybe it was just me. Maybe. I think it's just so important that that should be the whole book. I Dunno. Okay. Whatever. But either way. Either way then regardless of how, but training is so important to you is what you're saying. I think that actually doing it is because without it you just lose. I think you lose more than half. If you consider study action and you don't do the action part, I think action is more than half where it feels like it anyway. Because like if you, let's say you haven't done, did you to school in a long time or eight or anything, you are correct when it comes to sports, but he's talking about actual going to war and you can't take a nation to war.

Speaker 3:          01:26:54       You can't even take a platoon to war. You can't take a company to war without going to war. So yes, you can do the training exercises in the field, but there is absolutely a massive benefit to studying what has happened in the past. And I'll tell you from a leadership perspective, like if I was a business person, I'd be reading about business business, not so much business leadership books that this is how to lead, but this is what happened in this situation. And the perfect example for me of that from the war perspective is about face by Hackworth. That book is not a leadership book, but when you read it from a leadership through a leadership lens, it's all about leadership. It's all about leadership. And so you can take books that are about business, not about like, hey, this is a leadership instructional manual, but hey, this is what happened in this.

Speaker 3:          01:27:47       As this company fell apart or this like you study those books, read those books. Then it gives you a little bit more of an advantage. But in both fees, what you really should be looking for is the dynamics of human nature. And you can figure out like, okay, when people, when this happened inside this company or this happened in this battle, people act this way. People acted that way and now I understand them better. Yeah. If you're seeing it for the first time, just like we talked earlier about, if you see, if you know an our lock is coming, if you, if you know how to defend an arm lock or you know what's coming, you at least know to pull your elbow in, right? If you read a book that explains what happened in a battle or in a business scenario and you go, okay, here's what happened right here, I recognize it.

Speaker 3:          01:28:25       Maybe not exactly, but it's close enough and I can expect this response from the enemy or from the competitor or from my people. I can make an adjustment and at least not blind. Yeah, and that's kind of the part I was talking about. Where were the, yeah, that's right. And I think that's right. Even the, the, the inverse where it's like, okay, you can, let's say you study this, I know this, you know, I know that this is how it works, but you've never been in the situation to recognize how it feels, you know, in, in, uh, you know, so like training for war or whatever. Like let's say in your guys' case where, how you would always, you say you try your best to make the training

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       as realistic as possible. So that's the actual action kind of stuff. Even just something as simple as roll roll plate, you know, where it's like you're trying to simulate, you're trying to introduce the action part of it more so than Jay, it's study. Sure. Got It. You know, so yeah. So when you find yourself in the real situations, I'll give you a case in point. You can read extreme ownership. You can read the dichotomy of leadership. I'll have someone that's read and read and studied both those books, listen to every podcast and roll in and be like, Hey, let's role play this right here. Yeah. And be like, you know, put them in a scenario where, where the right answer would be to say, hey like that's my fault, here's what I'm gonna do. Crew. And they'll, they'll say, well the team needs to do this and you just think yourself so you're, you are correct.

Speaker 1:          01:29:48       You have to put people in the action as much as you can because the observation of a situation is not as effective a learning tool as the being involved in the situation. Yeah. I do actually agree with you. Yeah. Cause just like in yours, in that scenario you just kind of painted, it's usually, well I would imagine you could tell me is it because their feelings almost kind of blocked their knowledge at that point in a way. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So if you're in the situation, you are now kind of familiar with the feelings that come along with and for instance, you have to learn how to detach. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Too. If you don't know how to detach and I throw something at you, you don't know how you'd detach cause you know what the right answer is, but you don't do it. You can't do it.

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       You don't do it. So that's, that's an, that's a problem. So yes, put yourself, put people, put your team, put yourself, not just study it. Okay, here's the, here's the, here's what you do. You study it. And then from the study you try and formulate a simulation that you can put yourself into. There you go. There's the answer. Here's the answer. Last little section about this. A wise prince ought never in peaceful times stand idle, but increases resources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity so that if fortune chances, it may find him prepared to resist her blows, he's really into in the peace time, you work harder and know what I'm going to agree with them.

Speaker 1:          01:31:29       Next. Every prince ought to desire to be considered Clement and not cruel. That's, again, this is not tradition Machiavelli, but then he says, nevertheless, he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. So show mercy, but don't get crazy beat. There's a dichotomy. Don't get crazy with the mercy. Does the economy be very merciful but don't be overly merciful? You got to be balanced. Can be a softy. Softy, a prince, so long as he keeps his subject United in loyal not to mind the reproach of cruelty because with a few examples, so he's an hey, you should, if you're considered cruel sometimes that's okay. This is, this is tradition because with a few examples, he will be more and more soulful than those who threw too much. Mercy allowed disorders to arise from which follow murders or robberies for these are want to injure the whole people. Whilst those executions which originate with the prince, offend the individual. So every once in a while if somebody gets out of line, you got to, you got to kill him, he got to execute and that is actually going to keep the people more under control more so they'll discipline gives you more freedom, a little discipline and freedom there on that one. I think that's the old making eggs, an example. Sure. It's making an example, but what he's saying is, hey, the example and the hurts one person.

Speaker 1:          01:33:01       Well that's cool. Here's the famous section when I'll read a pretty big chunk of it. Upon this, a question arises whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved. It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved when of the two either must be dispensed with. So he's saying the best thing you could do is balanced her dichotomy. That's the best thing to do because this is to be asserted in general of men, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous. And as long as you succeed, they are yours entirely. So he's saying, look, people are kind of dastardly, but as long as you're doing good, as long as you're successful, you're, you'll be fine. But, and then he says, when you're, when you're being successful, he says they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant.

Speaker 1:          01:34:02       So as long as I'm doing good, goes like, hey, yeah, I'll be there for you bro. But when and approaches they turn against you and that prince who relying entirely on their promises has neglected other precautions is ruined because friendship, this is a big critical, a differentiation because friendships that are obtained by payments and not by greatness or nobility of mind may indeed be earned, but they are not secured and in time of need, they cannot be relied upon. And men have less scruple and offending one who is beloved and one who's feared for love is preserved by the link of obligation, which owing to the basis of man is broken at every opportunity for their advantage. But fear preserves, you buy a dread of punishment, which never fails. So I think one of the differences he's talking about that when I, when I give you money, when I treat you well, when I, you know, Eh, em, em, generous to you. You love me. But that's, that's different. That's different. That's not like a respectful though.

Speaker 2:          01:35:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:35:10       But then, and then he says this as well. Nevertheless, a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way if he does not win love. He avoids hatred because he can endure very well being feared. Whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects from their weapon. So he said, look, you can't just run rough shot over people and take the women and take their property.

Speaker 2:          01:35:39       Hm.

Speaker 1:          01:35:41       But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause. But above all things, he must keep his hands off the property of others because men more quickly forget the death of their father, the loss of their patrimony. Cheap. So yeah. Firm but fair then he's seen be firm but fair. Yeah. Yeah. Overly from east saint from when you have to be. Yeah. But fair is just as important. It's a dichotomy that you have to balance. That's what he's saying. He just didn't write it as cleverly.

Speaker 1:          01:36:20       Uh, when a prince with his army and under and has under his control a multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty again. So he again, he's saying, well, you gotta be cool. You've got to be cool for without it. He would never hold his army, United or dispose to its duties among the wonderful deeds Hannibal of Hannibal. This one is a numerated that having led an enormous army composed of various races of men to fight in foreign lands. No dissensions arose either among them or against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This arose from nothing else than is inhuman cruelty, which with boundless, which with his boundless Fowler made him very revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers. Revered and terrible. There is a dichotomy. He was revered and terrible, but without that cruelty, his virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect.

Speaker 1:          01:37:20       Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I've come to the conclusion that men loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of a prince, a wise print should establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others. He must endeavor only to avoid hatred as is noted, so be balanced and he said over and over again before this that you know, having the connection with the people and if the people are loyal, like that's the most important thing. If they hate you or if they don't like you or if they're just afraid to you, they don't have that, then you think about it when you're afraid of somebody and you have the chance to to rise up and smash them down. You don't want to live live in fear. No, you do. So next section, everyone admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith and to live with integrity and not with Kraft. And he used that word craft meaning like guile and sort of, yeah. Nevertheless, our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have had good faith of little account and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft. And if in the end overcome those who relied on their work. You must know there are two ways of contesting one by law, the other by force, the first Methodist proper demand, the second to beasts, but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second.

Speaker 5:          01:38:53       So look,

Speaker 1:          01:38:55       we want to do things that are a nice way, but if we have to got to get a little savage, there is therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man. Again, this is a dichotomy. You got to know that sometimes you got to get Chris get nuts and sometimes you got to not. Yeah, it is necessary for prince know how to make use of both natures and that one without the other is not as durable a prince. Therefore being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast ought to choose the Fox and the lion because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the Fox can not defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and Elian to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lie and do not understand what they are about.

Speaker 5:          01:39:48       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:39:49       he who has known best how to employ the Fox has succeeded the best. No, there you go. You know, can't just be the brick brute. You've got to have a little bit of that, but it is necessary to know of this is it, this is where you get, this is going traditional machiavellian attitude. It is necessary to know how well to know well how to disguise this characteristic and to be a great pretender and dissembler and men are so simple and so subject to present necessities that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. There's a sucker born every minute. So he's saying you got to act these ways, but you've got to cover it up, which is going back to Richard the third, Hey, I'm going to cover this stuff and make it up. Make it look like I'm a saint, but really I'm the devil. A prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed being often forced in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity, friendship, humanity, and religion. So he's saying,

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       look, those are the, those are the nice ways to act, but sometimes you can't. You can't keep it. Yeah. Therefore, it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds in variations of fortune's force it yet, as I've said above, do not deserve diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so. But if compelled then to know how to set it about, so, hey, if you can, you gotta be, you maintain your fidelity and friendship and humanity and religion if you can. If you can't, you gotta know how to get after it the other way. That's what he's saying. And again, my personal belief is if you do that, it's going to come back. It's going to come back. And I'm not again, like I'm not talking about a spiritual Karma that's going to come back. I'm talking about real life.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       We'll come back and you screw someone over, their time will come. When you screw enough people over, everyone's time is going to come. Yeah. And that, I mean doesn't, maybe I got it wrong, but so Jordan Peterson for example, he'll talk about this too, right? Like where you have to be a good person with the capability of being a bad person. That's optimum. The optimum thing is, hey you, you can get, you can, you can bring the funder if you have too, but you shouldn't, you shouldn't have to. This is not quite that. This is saying sometimes you got to do some underhanded stuff. That's what he's saying. He's saying sometimes you've got to do some underhanded stuff and I'll tell you back in these days, I mean, think about how much more communication there is today. You do something that's out aligned. Everyone's going to know it was not going to take them very long to know it yet.

Speaker 3:          01:42:29       Weird men, like when you see, you know, some people they're just sorta like that, you know and know, you know, it's almost like they can't see very far ahead of themselves or something like that. Like they'll like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, they're just shortsighted and they just screw this guy over and screwed that person over. And next thing you know, they look up and they wonder why they didn't get hired. Or they wonder why they didn't get the contract. Or they wonder why they didn't get promoted. It's like, oh, guess what you did? And it's so, it's almost like a thought, like, well shoot, I didn't like, I didn't screw you over you like, why are you acting like this kind of thing? Or why are you treating me like this? Like I'm some, uh, you know, Fox or clever, what craft person or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:43:09       Um, but meanwhile everyone's seen what you're doing now just because you didn't do it to me. No, Bro. We know what kind of person. One of the, one of the hardest things for some people is they think that they're a fox. They think that they can get one over on you and, and, and they just, they just, it's so obvious. Like you said, it's so obvious you're looking at them going, hey man, everyone, not just me. Everyone can see. And you know what, sometimes people, not everyone can see what they're doing and if you're, and they think they're getting away with something and you're looking at him going, man, I can see right through what you're doing. Why are you doing this? Yeah. Cause I can see exactly what you're doing. Yeah. And the fact that you're doing it and I, I you don't think I can see that you're doing it.

Speaker 3:          01:43:59       It proves two things. Number one, you don't think I'm very smart and number two, you're underhanded. Neither one of those is going to work out for you because this is not my first Rodeo and I'm watching what you're doing and this is going to come back in a very hard way on you don't do that. Don't do that. There's varying levels of that too. Like he can be like real devious stuff, you know? It can be that, but it can be like Ooh, no harmful things to and the, and the point there is semi harm. You meant to say harmless. A semi harmless things. Yeah. Some are homeless, homeless things, but there's, but also sometimes, and I always try and get people to pay attention. This, if you're under handed with me, if you try and sneak one by me, it's a trust violation. That's a problem.

Speaker 3:          01:44:46       That's a problem. And you know what, I'm not going to confront you but I know you and it's even worse. It would be better off for you if I just came and said, hey, echo, you know you tried to slide this one under on the expense account and you bought, you know, whatever. You took your family out for dinner on the company credit card and I saw that and you shouldn't do that. That would be better than me. You mean it'd be better for you? Yeah. Forget a little plants than me not saying anything and just noting it and now I'm tracking you. Yeah, because it's like all my knowledge of that kind of gives me a foot to stand on so I can kind of maneuver so it can continue to maneuver. I didn't say anything and I won't say anything. I'll let you, I'll let you continue to reveal your dark arts. My cards. Yes. Reveal your reveal, your nature, your nature's cheating, your nature's stealing from me. You're all looking at me like, like I actually did that. I'm trying to think. Shoot. Did I do that right now?

Speaker 3:          01:45:49       But I'm just saying think about it, but the point of what you're saying, like whenever we all this year on this discombobulated right now, going through that expense report in your head, boy, when people can see you, but they can't see themselves, you know, even with like small stuff, big stuff, small stuff and one can see what you're doing. My point is though, not every not, it's not always that everyone can see sometimes not everyone can see and that actually encourages a person to continue their little crafty ways that they think they're so good at. And it's so, when I see that happening, it's just so disappointing. It's so disappointing because you're not even in a situation where you're with me because like, oh, I bet you know, I brought you into my house. Basically. If someone's going to be able to do that to me, they're in my house.

Speaker 3:          01:46:45       If you're in my house and you're trying to, you know, steal some milk from the drawer when I'm not looking sure. Without permission. Yeah. Yeah. Like you're trying to sneak that thing in your bag. You can, if you would ask me, you'd had, you'd had a case in milk, but you didn't ask what you thought is, I'm going to try and get this. That's a whole different way things shake out. Yeah. And I'm not even gonna say anything to you. He's gonna live, I'm not gonna say anything to you. You can have that milk, that milk. It was worth it because now I know your nature. Yup. So the torment is kind of not punish snow, but okay. So no, there won't be any punishment. Right. But, but, but in a year you're going to look up and be like, Hey, I know that we got this opportunity.

Speaker 3:          01:47:27       I'm saying, Oh yeah, yeah, I took the opportunity. Unfortunately I don't have room for you. And the opportunity, there you go. That's what happens. But when you're surprised when I say people can do to you and say, well, you know what they say harmless ways or semi harmless ways, of course, the teeny, teeny, tiny things. And we said this before, like name dropping, right? And that goes a, that's not, it doesn't go into dvs. That's not necessarily a devious a crafty thing or nothing like that, but I'm just saying the concept of someone doing something where we all see what you're doing kind of thing, you know? So he name drop someone and it's like, well, most was part of the story, but it's like probably we all see what you're doing right there, you know? But it's, I think it's hard for us sometimes.

Speaker 3:          01:48:11       Like I just named dropped a Sam Harrison, Tim Ferris. No, it didn't feel like you did, you know? Then again, you did say their first and last name, so that's kind of a symptom. No names. I think the opposite. If I would have said, oh well, you know, I was talking to Tim week, me and Sam were having a quick conversation. That's true. Yeah. I think you told me that before too. And you're right. Yeah, it seems more, I guess it depends, but yes. Yes Tim. And then you're hoping in the back of your mind that asked him who, so you get to say, oh, just Tim Ferriss, you no big deal. So maybe, but the point is people see what you're doing, but sometimes it's hard for us to see that they can see that, you know? Yes, they're unaware. So you get to stop and it's a sad thing.

Speaker 3:          01:48:54       Assume that people can see what you're doing. There's a good lesson for the day. Assume that the little maneuvers that you think are all clandestine, assume that people can actually see, assume that people are a little bit smarter than you think. Assume that you're maybe not as smart as you think you are. Yeah, because there's little crafty moves that you think are fooling people. They don't, and they reveal you. Your nature as being underhanded and people don't like underhanded people, especially me. Well, you should. It's a common thing. Yeah. Jack. All right, moving on for this reason. Again, we're talking about how sometimes you have to, you have to violate, you have to, according to this, sometimes people have to act a little underhanded. You have to act devious or whatever. And here's what he says about that.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       For this reason to prince ought to take care of that. He never lets anything slip from his lips that does not replete with the above named five qualities that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether. Merciful, Faithful, humane, upright, and religious. So again, this is Richard the third and there's a whole backstory. I'll give them Richard the third on why Shakespeare wrote it that way, but he definitely wrote it that way and it clearly from that opening, he's literally doing what it says in this book. Men judge generally more by the eye then by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come to touch with you. Everyone sees what you appear to be. Few really know what you are. And those few do not dare oppose themselves to the opinion of many. So how you look is how you're going to be judged.

Speaker 1:          01:50:40       The prince must consider how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible. This is not traditional machiavellian thought. It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, a feminine, mean spirited irresolute from all of which a print should guard himself as from a rock. And he should endeavor to show his actions, greatness, or showing his actions, greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude. And in his private dealings with his subjects, let him show that his judgments are irrevocable and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive or get around him. Good advice. And I guess one of my points is everything that's, so check this out. Everything that we're saying about how people can see what you're doing, he's recommending that you act this way, but no one will know. And you just have to pretend like you're actually a good person.

Speaker 1:          01:51:41       And what we're both saying is that doesn't work. And I agree that doesn't work. Yeah. So the idea that you're going to be all behind the scenes, you're going to be, you're going to be all crafty behind the scenes, and no one's going to catch you. And you're just going to act with greatness and courage and act with gravity and fortitude. And that's how you're gonna Act, but you're not really not that way. My point is that it doesn't work because people can see through it and they will see through it and they might not see through it today or tomorrow, but they'll see through it in a week or two weeks or a month or a year. And then you're going to be, you're going to be undone. That's a good word.

Speaker 1:          01:52:17       A prince ought to rec and conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem. But when it's hostile to him and bears hatred toward him, he ought to have fear. He ought to fear everything and everybody. So if you're people support you, don't worry about conspiracies. If your people are hostile towards you, you better be. You better take note and well ordered. States and wise princes have ever, I've taken every care to drive the nobles to desperation and keep the people satisfied and contented for this is one of the most important objects, uh, prince can have, is to keep people, keep your troops, keep the people in the game.

Speaker 1:          01:52:58       There was never a new prince who is disarmed his subjects rather when he has found them disarmed, he's always armed them because by arming them, those arms become yours. Those men who were distrusted become faithful and those who are faithful are kept. So, and your subjects become Ed Harris. Now I think we're, this really plays into from a leadership perspective is when you get, when you, when you are in a leadership position and you empower people, you give them power, it builds faith that builds trust, it builds it and, and the power that they, that you give to them becomes yours. We, the more powerful you make your subordinates, the more powerful you become. Yeah. If you have the ego that you can put in checks so that you don't mind giving some of that power away because it'll come back to you 10 fold. And here's what happens on the other end of spectrum when you disarmed them at once, you offend them by showing that you distrust them either for cowardice or for want of loyalty.

Speaker 1:          01:53:56       And either of these opinions breeds hatred against you, and because you cannot remain on armed, it follows that you turned to mercenaries, which are a character which aren't of a character already shown. So once again, if I take your power from you, then that's offensive. Yeah. So be careful. Give, try and give people power. Don't take it away from them. It takes a high level of lead security and confidence with your own leadership that you can give it away. The more you're more confident you are, the more you can give it away. The more paranoid you think people are going to be better than you. The harder it is. Give it away. The worst leader you are, the worst leader. You become the worst situation, the less power you have. Just trying to hold it off for yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:54:42       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:54:47       Continuing the best possible fortress is not to be hated by the people, not traditional machiavellian fought. The best possible fortress is not to be hated by the people.

Speaker 2:          01:55:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:55:03       Yeah, it seems like a good start. It's a great start because although you may hold the fortress yet, they will not save you if the people hate you. The fortress isn't gonna. If people hate you, the fortress isn't gonna help. Don't even bother. Oh, you built up a great fortress. Cool. We're gonna go. We're gonna seed you. Yeah. Cause we ain't no water, no food. Huck and fire over the walls continuing. Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and setting a fine example.

Speaker 1:          01:55:39       Set a good example, not traditional machiavellian. Ooh, good one. The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince and the first opinion which one forms of a prince and of his understanding is by observing the men he has around him. And when they are capable and faithful, he may always be considered wise because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are otherwise, one cannot form a good opinion of him for the prime error which he made wasn't choosing them. So people, your team, people look at you and they judge you by what your team is like. And if you surround yourself with people that are incompetent and incapable, that's what people are going to think you. So use caution. Next when you see the servant, uh, when you see the servant thinking more of his own interests then of yours and seeking inwardly his own profit and everything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you ever be able to trust him because he who has the state of another in his hands ought never think of himself, but always have his prints and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned.

Speaker 1:          01:57:04       So if you got someone that's thinking of themselves, you cannot trust them. Yeah. On the other hand, to keep his servant honest, the prince ought to study him, honoring him, enriching him, doing him kindness, sharing with him the honors and cares. And at the same time, let him see that he cannot stand alone. So that many honors may not make him desire more many riches, making wish for more. And that many cares may make him dread chances, so what's the best way to have loyalty with someone get treat them really, really well. You enrich them. You on rum, you share the honors that you get with that person and then he throw it has to throw in a little dig which is you got to make sure they understand that they're not going to get that by themselves. He always throws a little dig in there a little bit. He distrust people, you know, he says it a bunch of times. People are scoundrels basically.

Speaker 1:          01:58:03       Oh important section. How flatterers should be avoided. I did not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject for it is danger for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved unless they are carefully, unless they are careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers of those of whom courts are full because men are so self complacent in their own affairs and in a way so deceived in them that they are preserved with difficulty from the past and if they wish to defend themselves, they run the danger of falling into contempt because there is no other way of guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that to tell you the truth does not offend you.

Speaker 1:          01:58:50       You gotta make sure people understand that. If you tell me the truth, I'm not going to be offended. But when everyone may tell you the truth, respect for you, a Bates, then he throws him the little slumped and little counter, right? He doesn't want people talking smack to him, but he wants me to tell the truth. Therefore, a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the wise men in the state and giving them only the liberty of speaking the truth to him and then only of those things which he inquires and have none others. So you can talk the truth as long as I ask you before, but he ought to question them upon everything. But even though I say, Hey, well you only to echo, you only tell me the truth when I asked you, but I'm going to ask you everything and listen to their opinions and afterwards for form his own conclusions with these counselors separately and collectively, he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should know that the more freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred. The more you tell me the truth, the more I'm going to like it. The Mormon alike you outside of the east, he should listen to no one pursue the thing resolved on and be steadfast in his resolutions. He who does not otherwise is either overthrown by flatterers are so often changed by varying his opinions that he falls into contempt.

Speaker 1:          02:00:10       He continues on to this thought, a prince therefore on always to take counsel, but only when he wishes and not when others wish. He ought to rather discourage everyone from offering advice unless he asks it. But however he ought to be a constant inquirer and afterwards a patient listener concerning the things which he has inquired also on learning that anyone or on any consideration has not told him the truth. He should let his hangar is anger be felt.

Speaker 1:          02:00:41       And if there is someone who thinks that a prince who conveys an impression of his wisdom is not through his own ability but through good advisors that he has around him beyond doubt, they are deceived because this is an axiom which never fails, that a prince who is not wise himself will never take good advice. So if you look at someone and say, Oh oh that that CEO is doing a good job, but that's because he's got these guys with them, that's actually wrong. The CEO's got that good personal with them, those good people brought them in and then listens to them. They get credit. He gives him credit for that. And you know what's funny? That's good salesmanship. Listen to this. Therefore it must be inferred that good councils whatsoever they come are born. Of the wisdom of the prince and not the wisdom of the prints from good counsel.

Speaker 1:          02:01:28       So he's saying, if you're listening to what I'm saying right now, that makes you good. If you listen to this book or you listen to the words I'm saying and you obey him, that makes you great. It you're not giving credit to me. You're great if you do. Yeah. What? Like you're smart because you're so smart to listen to the good stuff that you taking this advice proves that you're brilliant you. It's like, Hey, if you read this book, it proves that you're smart. Just the only a smart person would be this book. Smart person would take the advice of someone else. That's how smart you are. That's like good salesmanship of the book. Do not let, do not let her prints is accused fortune for the loss of the principalities after so many years. Possession. Okay, so he's saying don't let, don't blame luck. Don't blame bad luck when you lose your principality.

Speaker 1:          02:02:20       Don't blame bad luck, but rather their own slaw off because in quiet times they never thought there could be a change. It is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest. So it's common that people, when things aren't going bad, they just kicked back the cruise cruise, they crews and instead of working and when afterwards the bad times came, they fought of flight and not of defending themselves. And they hope that the people disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors. Conquerors would recall them. That's a good plan. Hey, if I get run over run, I'll just hope that the conquerors are so bad that the people rebel and bring me back. And here he talks about what fortunate again, he uses fortune like luck. What fortune can effect in human affairs and how to withstand her.

Speaker 1:          02:03:16       I will hold it to be true. That fortune is the arbiter of about one half of our actions, but that she still leaves us to direct the other half, perhaps a little less. So he's saying, look, luck has 50% 50% that's a big number. Yeah, and you might go, well, if it's 50% man, why even try? Well that's, it leaves you 50% in control. That's actually a lot. He goes on, I compare her and he's hers, yet he's talking about is fortunate. I compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when the F in flood overflows the planes sweeping away trees and buildings bearing away the soil from place to place. Everything flies before it all yield to it's violence without being able in any way to withstand it. And yet though it's nature be such, it does not follow. Therefore, that man, when the weather becomes fair shall not make provision both with the fences and barriers in such a manner that rising again, the waters may pass away by canal and they're forced be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous. So floods are real bad and they'll wipe you out. But when there's no flood and you can build walls, you can build barriers, you can build canals, and then you can control that, that danger, that flood continuing on. So what happens with fortune, who shows her power, where valor has not prepared to resist her and thither she turns her forces where she knows that barriers and defenses have not been raised to constrainer. So that bad luck, if you don't work that bad luck's coming at you. Yeah. It's common at you.

Speaker 3:          02:05:02       Kind of like the weather, right? Remember like how you were saying yes. Like it kind of like extreme ownership almost situation where it's not Kinda, it is a straight up, straight up. Yeah. Like yeah. You know, but let's say I put a TV outside right outside, it'd be cool. Um, you know, it doesn't really rain much here, so I don't really need to put on a cover every day, you know, kind of thing. And then sure enough, the one day out of the year it rains on your TV, no more TV scene was saying, but if you would have prepared properly. Yeah. Even though it's sunny, you just keep the cover on anyway, you know, just in case it rains. Good one. Yeah. Yeah. That's, you know, to me that was the perfect example. You know, I think there's a majority of people will find that. Perfect example,

Speaker 1:          02:05:47       one last, last little thing to close this out and he goes into some, um, some more kind of historical documentation and examples, but this was a good one. So I just wanted to close it out with this. A prince may be seen happy today and ruined tomorrow without having shown any change of disposition or character. And what that's saying is normal face, you just need to keep like regardless, things are going great, things are going bad, guess what? We're sticking with normal. No, that's how we're sticking. Hmm. And that wraps up the book again a ton to think about. A ton that does. There's, there's definitely parts of it that match kind of the traditional Mackey and valley machiavellian.

Speaker 2:          02:06:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:06:42       Common perception. And there's plenty of it that goes against it. And I believe the right answer is balance and it's more balanced than people think it is. Yeah. But speaking of, you know, bolstering up our defenses against the whims of fortune or misfortune, you know, do you have any maybe suggestions on how we could

Speaker 3:          02:07:09       sure bolster and prepare for that a yeah. Yeah, a few ways. Uh, well, back to the book real quick in, so let's say, to sort of sum up what, what is a way to sum up

Speaker 1:          02:07:24       Macchia Vallian ways? Well, like I said, the, the, the traditional understanding and meaning of the word Machiavellian is a negative. It means, hey, this person's under handed. They're going to deceive. They're not going to care what kind of destruction they leave in their path. That's what people think of it. Like I said, if, if you say, hey, this person's a machiavellian leader. Everyone thinks, okay, they're going to be merciless. They're going to just run rough shot over everyone. They don't care who they step on to get to rise to power. That's the truth. That's the truth. That's what the word actually means. But we just gave example after example. It's not that cut and dry and he definitely introduces many dichotomies to to that idea that you're just going to do whatever it takes to get to the top. He talks a lot about these other more moderate and important things that you need to do as a leader to get, not only to get in a position to but to stay in position.

Speaker 1:          02:08:23       So being, having good relationships with your people, making sure they understand where you're coming from. Like these things are not considered when you hear the word, when you don't know any better and you just take the word for what the word has become, demean what the word means. Now machiavellian is like, Hey, I will stop at nothing to rise to the top. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to cover this, because even with that, even though he definitely leans in that direction and he, he, what he's saying is, look, sometimes you gotta, sometimes you gotta stab or somebody in the back occasionally and then you've got to cover it up to the best of your ability. That's what he says. I don't believe that. I believe in, when you stab someone in the back, that person, they may die, but they got a, they got a friend, they got a brother, they got someone else.

Speaker 1:          02:09:04       I got someone else's you don't know, you don't recognize and at some point they're going to come and get you. So you have to, you know, you have to try and balance these dichotomies. You have to try and, and that's not even balancing a dichotomy that's just straight up like, hey, you got to take, you've got to treat people, you got to respect people and you've got to not always look out for your own good. And what I will tell you and what I know, the more you look out for your own good, and this is where, this is probably the biggest dichotomy, dichotomy with this machiavellian attitude. The more you look out for your own good, the worst off you're going to be. And the more you look out for the good of others and the more you look out for your team and the more you put the mission and your, and your people ahead of yourself, the better off you'll end up in the long run.

Speaker 1:          02:09:50       So that's in complete contrast to what the Makaveli and the common thought about being machiavellian. And I, and I will tell you, when I work with companies, the leaders that put their people ahead of them, the leaders that put there that put the mission ahead of themselves, they're always respected. They're always, they're always loved by the troops. They always have support of the troops and they always go forward and do a good job. The people that screw the people over, screw the team over, put themselves ahead, their egos, those people, those leaders never end up doing well in the long run. Sometimes you can do some short term stuff, right? Hey, I'm going to screw echo over them to get promoted because I'm going to,

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       you know, fill out a report that he didn't, you know, the government to rat him out on this thing. Okay, cool. I rat you out. But what I don't realize is that you have another friend that's with us. That's that you'd, that's your peer. Yeah. And now he's watching me and there's going to be competency for him to rat me out cause I miss something or I didn't do something. So if you form good relationships, if you put your team and your mission and you put others above yourself, you're going to end up in a much better position than you will stabbing people in the back and stepping on people to try and rise to the top. And not only that, when you get to the top, you will be much more comfortable, not only when you look yourself in the mirror, but also when you get to the top and you know that the people below you in the chain of command actually want you there and actually will do anything to defend your position up there.

Speaker 3:          02:11:26       That's a lot more comfortable than having to constantly look behind your back and see who's sneaking up behind you. So do the right thing for the right thing. Be Good leader. Yeah, keyword is good. So kind of in a way it kind of goes along well. Really does go along with kind of what you say were like, so okay, machiavellian way traditionally whatever could be put simply maybe over simply but simply, you know, looking out for yourself. Totally. You know, kind of thing. Look out from what you say and what he ends up saying is the best way to look out for yourself to look up for the piece. Always talking about the people and people don't get the people. So man, it's kind of brings it full circle in a way. It does bring it full circle and the full circle answer is take care of your people, take care of your team, look out for other people.

Speaker 3:          02:12:14       Don't put yourself first. Yeah. If you do that, you're going to end up, you might, like I said, you might end up stepping up for a moment, but in the long run things aren't going to go your way. And even when you are on the top, you're going to be waiting to get stabbed in the back. Not Fun always in. The more, more I think of a new kind of turned me on to the whole idea of the long game. The more I kind of opened my eyes to like look at things. It kind of seems like playing the short game isn't the smart game. It's totally ignorant. Yeah. The short game. So when you figure it and you can see it to where it's so obvious when people are playing the short game. We, yeah. With everything. With everything. Yeah. In fact, if you identify any one of your failures or the failures of others, whatever, but try your own.

Speaker 3:          02:13:02       If you identify any one of them, you'll probably trace it down to your playing the short game in regards to that. Many times you're overweight or whatever you're playing the short game as far as like what you eat, what you're doing physically or whatever you playing short during. You can go to the short term payoff rather than the big long term. Big. Yeah. So if you can maintain that in your mind, I think play the long game, he'd be doing some good stuff. Yeah. My opinion, it's a, it's a weird dichotomy that if you really want to do well yourself and the best thing you can do is take care of, you know, you're being someone who's not yourself. Yeah, exactly. It's a dichotomy, but it's the reality. It's, it's a, it's a nice little blessing that you get at the end of the day for, for trying to take care of people.

Speaker 3:          02:13:44       They'll take care of you, you take care of people, they'll take care of you. Then to go one step further, if you take care of yourself and give yourself the capability of the Kate, take care of more people seem to saying so. It's like this never ending. Well, if you take care of, if you looked at this, this is the, no, this is the opposite of what I just said. The opposite of what I just said is if you take care of yourself as the primary right, you will end up being in a worse position than if you try and take care of other people. Yeah. That's the, that's the reality. So if I'm, if I'm always looking out for me, if I, if I act in the traditional machiavellian way, sure I might get a head right now I might step on am I get a short term win here and their longterm I will not be in a better position long term. I will be in a worse position. Yeah. That's the way it is. Yeah. I was thinking more, you know, the oxygen mask in the plane, you know, put it on yourself before your kids kind of thing. But you know, it's a tall thing, nevermind. But every once in a while, every once in a while you can find something that has both a short term and a long term payoff. Jujitsu is one of those things.

Speaker 2:          02:14:52       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:14:52       Short term, longterm indeed big time. Are there sacrifices? Why wouldn't you take Jujitsu? And I'm not saying like, Oh you know you, I'm just saying what are, what are. So in general I don't have time, number one. Number two, there's all, then we want you, once you get past that one, it's just a whole array of reasons I might get hurt. I don't like, I feel claustrophobic, which by the way is an even more reason to do it because you should be trying to overcome that. Um, what, what other yeah, she uses general intimidation, intimidation or whatever. Yeah. I don't try something new. That's kind of like a big thing. Scary. Yeah. It's scary. I'm scared. Need to read Mikey and the dragons, but go ahead. Nonetheless, if when we see fit to start Jujitsu, if we haven't started already, you're going to need a g and a rash card.

Speaker 3:          02:15:52       Maybe some other stuff. No. G and a rash guard. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. The school and then, yeah, the academy or, or at least some mats and a friend or at least a friend at these. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Better than nothing for sure. But when you get the g and people, yes. People still ask what kind of, Gee, should I get? Just started. What kind of origin? G from origin, origin, main.com. This is where you can browse as many Giza as you want. Get more than one. Um, best keys. Factually. The best keys made in America from beginning to made in America. Getting to the end of the whole process designed by people that do Jujitsu. Yup. Not by a random person that doesn't train, not by a person that looked an Ikea Yogi and said, oh yeah, well that's no Ughi. That's a person that says, oh shit, I do Jujitsu daily and I need to make the best possibility.

Speaker 3:          02:16:51       I compete in Jujitsu and I'm going to make the best possible gay. That's where you get there. That's where you get the origin. Geetha boom. There you go. You're welcome. And then we're going to make it in America. Yeah. I wish I knew that before I bought my first, my first Gig I bought from the academy. Did I buy it from the get it? Yeah. How about it from the Academy of the boxing club? Yeah. It was the worst guy ever had ever. And here's the thing, and that's what these are like. Yes, no, I didn't know. So then I bought like I went and I saw one from a guy, a guy had one on and I was like, oh, that looks cool. The logo look school. Even when I felt that, I was like, Ooh, that looks, feels beefy. I went and got mine and it was like it shrunk a little bit too much and it was like it didn't fit that good.

Speaker 3:          02:17:35       He was like, uh. There were some scenarios where it felt like a straight jacket and which you know, it depends on who you are, whatever, but it was just so thick and maybe might've been too small. I don't know. But nonetheless, no one pointed me in the right direction. That's the point. Yes. Now you're being told, so now, now you are telling, telling some don't want to be in a straight jacket. No, you don't want to be in a very comfortable, comfortable, which you are highly skilled at assessing. Coming from lionizing is big time, but here's the thing. In Jujitsu, if the g is comfortable, that's a good thing. I mean, hey, if you're some weirdo savage who's like, you know what? That's going to be part of my training to put on an uncomfortable gete and hardened my mind. There was this whole fish to train with a wetsuit under.

Speaker 3:          02:18:23       His gig was for discomfort level. Dar Tanium. He's still a Jujitsu guy is out there. He was like Higgs Higgs. His training partners. Birkin. Yeah, but he's still out there. So is that Kinda like the the guys who were the restrict oxygen mask? Well, you don't put on a wetsuit very often, but ever wetsuits are slightly, especially this is, this is 20 years ago that that this guy was putting on a wetsuit and training and wetsuits have come a long way. They're much more comfortable now and much more pliable, but back in the day we would put on a three millimeter wetsuit. It was, it was, it was restricting your mobility. So just do that and train and be hot and sweaty and uncomfortable. That's next level. Put a wetsuit on underneath your origin. Want more discomfort. There's your, there's your answer. Oh, right. If you're training for that, I say 100% don't do that.

Speaker 3:          02:19:16       That's what I would recommend. No, I know you wouldn't recommend that, but it is kind of hardcore. It is hardcore. I, there's a certain legitimate level of respect I have for [inaudible] or doing that thing. That's Kinda, he's out there man in Jujitsu. Just strong as hell. Just wearing a wetsuit. Good. Amen. Legit league. There's other stuff at origin to, yeah, like t shirts and sweatshirts and, and by the way, we're going to have jeans. We have jeans right now while we do well I do, cause I, I last time I looked, I don't know. You don't have a break. You will get some soon. But anyways, just like the Biggie is awesome. Here's the problem with a g, you can't wear a geek to the store. You can't wear a Geeky to the restaurant when you can't technically, but you wouldn't do that. So, you know, talking to Pete, I'm like, Pete, I love, I love my origin.

Guess what you can do in jeans. We're up to the restaurant. You can wear them anywhere. You can swing a hammer. When you're wearing jeans, you can pour concrete. When you're wearing jeans, you can go to a restaurant when you're wearing jeans or Jean jeans, origin genes coming very soon. We will have them available on the website to preorder where I think we're going to be like a preorder thing just cause we want to know how many to make. But yeah. Then we'll just start making them as fast as we can. So made in America, uh, what the denim without compromise, the buttons. American. Wait, what are those things called that you, that you fastened at the top of the genes buttons.

Speaker 3:          02:21:07       The buttons. They will, the bras are made in America. Everything's made in America and they're sewn up in Maine by serious craftsmen. Legit crafts, crafts people. Yeah. American denim. Then straight up bringing it back, bringing it back or gin main origin may doll supplements because you're on the program right now. Back on the program. My art, like come back in Jujitsu. My arm is healed but it's like really susceptible to tendonitis, you know, like this kind of, especially with a twisting stuff. I don't know if I'm ready for like any kind of legitimate d situation. But, so after training you get stiff by just pound joint warfare, Krill oil, whatever. Next day I'm like, cool. But the day after that good to go man. It's like, it's amazing nonetheless. But yes, joint warfare, joint warfare is what it is for your joints. Keeps it together. Krill oil, same deal discipline.

Speaker 3:          02:22:11       Just I've been on the discipline. You drew a little bit, you said to me like, cause yesterday I turned kind of and that Jujitsu and you said you were asking me what kind of Jujitsu training feels best and then you named a couple times a couple different types and then one them you said was like a three scoop of discipline day level. Like the highest level. That was the highest level of good Jujitsu Day. It was three scoops of discipline. Yeah. Which by the way, you can get in tropic thunder flavor now. Yeah, I'm on that. We're waiting for a cease and desist level letter from uh, from Jack Black who is in tropic thunder. Robert Downey Jr and Robert Downey Jr. Yeah. And bench still stiller. Well until then, until then, we're just going to make it tropic thunder. It's good. I actually liked that flavor very much and I like the uh, you know, the cognitive enhancement. Some star, I'm just do the three. I'm going to try the three and back on the program and do the three Oh three scoops of disagree. Scoop two scoops the other day. It's good. Liked it. What day? Paid off Wednesday. Okay. What about Sunday? Yeah, Sunday. Sunday. So the other day, Sunday a little bit.

Speaker 3:          02:23:25       I sensed a little bit of urgency. Yes. He made me move. I was pretty impressed. It's actually the best I can hope for right now. But Hey, we're doing it one step at a time. You know, we're moving forward. Also, if you want some additional protein in addition to your steak, steak or Sushi, whatever, whatever your Gig is, drink milk, drink it every day if you have to. Okay. I have, I have talked about this before, but I stepped it up. Okay. So you can also get warrior kid milk, which is for kids. It's got, it's, it's the best possible thing you can feed a kid. They edited this out when a tie was down doing the the the week in the life of Jocko. Sure. I was like I said something along the lines of, hey, when you're feeding your kids, when you're feeding your kids a soda, that's child abuse.

Speaker 3:          02:24:20       I was going off but so that's why I made work at some warrior couldn't walk because I have a bunch of kids myself and it's really hard to get kids to eat good food because either you don't have time to prepare it or you're running late or you whatever or so we made warrior kid mark. Yeah. Here's the thing, it tastes delicious. Here's what I did yesterday. My daughter, she was making her dessert strawberries. I said, here, let me, cause she usually takes strawberries. She puts a whipped cream on it and then she sprinkles wore your kid mark on the top, like a little dusting. It's really good. We had no whip cream yesterday. So I said, hey, we got some heavy whipping cream and I've done this before, but I actually got the tool out. The proper mixing tool that spins real fast. What's it called?

Speaker 3:          02:25:11       Well there's a bunch of them, but the one that I am familiar with is called the magic wand. Okay. Mine wasn't that or no, this is like an oil that's electric. It wasn't gas powered, but it just like the traditional thing that you saw in the 50s a little two little things that spin together and yeah, like an egg. Okay. So I'm sitting there with the egg beater. So I put in heavy whipping cream and then I put two scoops of Strawberry Warrior kid milk. Whipped it, dude. It's ridiculous. It's completely ridiculous. And then, and then put that on strawberry jam. It's like a whipped cream. It's like whip cream, whip cream. So this is a whole nother thing. This might start a whole nother sort of cultural revolution in this nation from our children when they are eating warrior kid and whipped milk cream. It's amazing.

Speaker 3:          02:26:04       So anyways, give that a try. Interesting that. Yeah, the egg beater. Well the man, you know what the magic wand is? It's, it's not, it's like maybe from the 80s. It's like a, it looks like, Oh yeah, you just stick it in your drink. You can make like mail or whatever. But from what I understand, I dunno. Nonetheless, it would have been interesting to imagine you with one of those cause it is kind of a dainty apparatus. So get some of that and get some of that milk for your self or your children both fall on origin main.com. Also Jocko has a store, it's called Jocko store, Jocko store.com. So this is where he can get more rash guard rash guards that represent the path and put a new rash guard on there. Kind of obvious ones saying, uh, stand by to get some because it applies to Jujitsu anyway, some new stuff.

Speaker 3:          02:26:58       I was wearing a rash guard when I was working out this morning when I was, when I do, uh, when I do a lot of ring work, when I'm using the rings, sometimes you know, you get the chafe going on, right? There's the straps on sometimes on this particular day and I did have a rash guard on this morning. Good. Also t shirts, shirts on there represent truckers, hats and flex fit by the way or beanies. Sure. Check patches on there. I know we were out of patches. We were, oh, okay. Sorry. I should have done a better job of paying attention to that. Yeah, no, no, no, no. It was my fault in not enough completely my fault. This is what I'm going to do to rectify or did more patches. We got more patches in at this time. Also some women's stuff on there, some hoodies on there.

Speaker 3:          02:27:51       It's basically if you want to represent the path that you're on that we're on. Boom. That's where you can do it. Clothing wise, chocolate store.com that's how I see it. That's all I see it as a whole. That's what it is and subtle representation of the path can also be done. Yes. On that store you can check it out for yourself and see some subtle representation of a, yeah, deep. How should I say? D representation. You know chuck? Yeah. Chocolate Store Corp Com and Jocko white tea. What up with it? Tastes delicious is completely good for you. Isn't it weird that people would make foods that are not completely good for you? But yet most people make foods that are not completely good for you. Yes. Jocko white tea is completely good. Real well, it goes beyond accidents. Yeah. Tastes delicious. Got a little caffeine. A little hitter is not going to get you crazy.

Speaker 3:          02:28:53       Is Not a, it's not an energy drink that makes you psychopath, makes you addicted to caffeine. No, it's not that. It gives you a nice little hitter, a little caffeine hit her Theo. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, I wouldn't even say this. The caffeine is significant. It's not nothing. No, it's 60 milligrams. That's, that's, that's lower than a cup of coffee. Two thirds of a cup of coffee. Yeah. That's solid. Good. Yeah. You feel it, but it's actually good for you. And that's the thing, going back to, uh, you know, the short term, long term or long game. Short game. Yeah. That's the reason people sell food, drinks, whatever, that are not good for you because they're selling to the short game players. Yeah, he's good with all the the sugars and whatnot. Don't get on that path. No, no, we're not playing that game anymore.

Don't forget about youtube. We have a youtube channel. It's called Jocko podcast. Yes, yes. Called Jocko podcast. This is where echo puts all these videos. He puts them on there, including these full podcasts and including excerpts and including enhanced excerpts that he goes oh crazy with his old digital CGI stuff and to make things explode. Sure. Sometimes also psychological warfare. He didn't know what that is. I know. We all know what that is. We're waiting for a psychological warfare too, but in the unlikely event that you don't know what it is, this is what is, it's an album with tracks. Jocko tracks Jocko talking to you, telling you, telling us really how to get past these moments, a weakness.

Speaker 3:          02:31:31       Cool. In our journey on the pole, lifting, waking or whatever we got to do. I gave you let you talk about that. Why now and you know what? You don't want to rely. I figured this out. This is why you're like, yeah. He's like, yeah, that's what it is. Boom. Move on. Kind of kind of attitude. You know why? Why? Because you don't use that. You're not going to put, you're not going to play the MP three of yourself telling yourself, well I don't know, maybe do, but I don't think you do. You already had that MP3 embedded in your brain or anything. In fact, that's what it is. It's literally what it is. But I do, so I know that. Yeah. You know more than me. Cause it's weird because sometimes I do and it's sort of like, it's Sorta like the, the discipline goes freedom field manual.

Speaker 3:          02:32:14       I did write that book, but sometimes I have to refer to it. Yeah. Sometimes I have to refer to it and I'll tell you what, it's good. It's good to be able to refer to something that actually states in no uncertain terms, the direction of the path and where you need to walk. We need to move. It's very, it is very, there's a lot of clarity in it and that's powerful to be able to refer to something back like that, you know? Yeah. So fully. Yeah. So psychological warfare, same thing. When I listened to it, it definitely has an impact. There's no doubt about it. When you get psychological warfare and you click it, it's going to get through to you. It almost like, and I'm trying to imagine this right now, like let's say, okay, you know how the night before you might have this problem might not on and off, but the end of the night before you're like, Hey, I know you probably don't actually, hey, this is what I'm going to do tomorrow I'm going to take care of, take care of business.

Speaker 3:          02:33:15       I'm gonna work out this at this time and I'm doing something to do this. And then tomorrow comes and you're like, Dang, I'm kind of not in the mood for that. So I'm just going to, I won't do that today. I'll, I'll skip that. I'll opt out of that today cause I'm not in the mood or whatever. But what if you, if you have like an audio file of yourself telling you, hey, this is why you should do this. Yeah, it would bring you back. I think even if it's yourself know, huh? Interesting. Interesting little phenomena. Never explored that. Nonetheless. Good psychologic warfare. It's called psychological warfare. It's on Amazon. Itunes. Where we can get the artist is Jocko Willink. The artists psychological where warfare two is going to be released to, to be, to be decided DVD. First track is going to be, don't hesitate in making psychological warfare to her ass.

Speaker 1:          02:34:44       Speaking of stuff, forgot Mikey and the dragons book for kids all ages between three and 300 so you can get that. You can get where the warrior kid and Mark's mission. Two books teaching kids how to be on the path. You've got discipline equals freedom. Which I just talked about teaching adults how to go on the path and stay on the path. The audio that is on iTunes. I'm Amazon music, Google play, extreme ownership. The first book that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin, it's about leadership and that is followed up by the dichotomy of leadership, which actually goes granular on the nuances of extreme ownership. So check that one out and we'll real quick back to Mikey and the dragons. This what's good about this book and I was talking about life, talking with life about it this morning, eight applies it to everything for a kid because kids have to think about it when you're a kid, what are you when you're a kid facing the world, everything is hard.

Speaker 1:          02:35:55       Everything is scary. Yeah. And so you have all these fears to overcome and miking the dragons, lace leaf throws that at his son says, Hey, got to face these dragons and fire it up. You know? And that's what you do. You learn these lessons and it's a life lesson. So Mike and the dragons get some of that. What else? Echelon Front. Speaking of life.

Go to extreme ownership.com if you want to come to one of those events, they have all sold out and these are gonna sell it. The last one we did in San Francisco, they've all sold out, but the one we just did in San Francisco, I had people calling me 10 days out, personal friends that were like, hey, just want to bring three people from my team. And I'm like, oh, that's cool. No, you can't come. We have a fire code. We cannot bring you into the building. Stop. Don't, don't come. Because you know, you know some people just figure you're like, oh, you can just squeeze me in there. I actually can't do that. They're all, they all have sold out.

Speaker 1:          02:37:41       They are all going to sell out. So go there and register as quick as you can. Eff Online is live is launched. What is that? I'll tell you what, if you can't make it to a muster or you can't afford to go to the muster or you can't afford to bring 12 people from your team to the muster f online, that's what e f online is. We the original intent of f online was to be able to train people without having them have to come to the muster. Give them the same experience, give them the same knowledge about having to come to the muster. So we did it. And Eff, online.com interactive. You get the briefs, you get to go through scenarios. It's, it's powerful. It's way more powerful than I thought it was going to be. And I thought it was going to be good, but it's better than I thought it was going to be.

Speaker 1:          02:38:32       Yeah, it's, it's interesting too, because I went through, I went through it, you know, it was like, oh yeah, you know, like cool. This is like, just like when we talk about at the muster or what you guys, what I listened to. And then it's cool because at sort of at the end of, of the sections or whatever, there's like a little quiz. I think the way the thing came out and we're continuing to work on it and work, continue to upload new modules. So like, oh, and what's, and the other. So one of the reasons that we made it was to, was to help people that weren't coming, that couldn't have come to the roster, whether they were overseas and they couldn't afford it. I didn't, couldn't get time off. The other major demand signal was we work with giant companies that have 100,000 employees and one particular company with over a hundred thousand employees said to me, Hey, well we want you to train every employee we have.

Speaker 1:          02:39:21       And this was two years ago and I didn't have a good answer for him and I don't like having to not having a good answer. Right? Yeah. Oh, you want me to travel globally for the next six months to all your different factories? And it wasn't six months. It was probably gonna take three and a half months or something like that. That's not feasible. Like I can't just go off the grid everywhere else. Not Recording podcasts, be traveling the world, training people. Right. That's not going to happen. So what are we going to do? You have online? Yeah. And so we've got an enterprise with it to where you can have your whole company training and it's awesome. It's awesome. So good. Get your people in line. That's the half online and of course one last thing. Do you have Overwatch? This is us connecting proven lead combat leaders from special operations and from combat aviation and we're bringing them into companies that need leadership in their organization to get problems solved.

Speaker 1:          02:40:15       Go to e f overwatch.com you want people that know and understand extreme ownership, no one understand the laws of combat.
