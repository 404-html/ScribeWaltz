Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 20 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. So it's been a while since Q. And. A. Yeah. So we have some Q and a from the interwebs. Yeah, go first question Jocko. More than once on the podcast, you've mentioned how the teams were so competitive that no one wanted to admit when they were cold. Being too too cold puts you at a tactical disadvantage in hindsight, was that a failure to control your ego so your ego doesn't control you? I didn't ask this question. Out of idle curiosity. A lot of folks that an active duty, listen to the podcast and I'm concerned they might put themselves their teammates and their mission in jeopardy because of their egos won't let them admit they're too hot or too cold. All right, so

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       good question. Good point. And there's definitely a big difference between between being uncomfortably cold, right? Like on like you're just uncomfortably cold or uncomfortably hot or we thirsty or hungry or whatever. And being in an actual state where you're putting the mission in jeopardy because you're too cold or hot or thirsty or whatever. So I just needed to say this. In the teams you are 95% of the time you are cold, too cold, too hot, too wet, too thirsty, too miserable, something. There's no time. When you're in the field, you put on a hundred pounds worth of gear worth of gear. You're uncomfortable from the word go from the word go and you're cold. You know, you come in over the beach, you're in wet cammies. It doesn't matter who will come out with great technology and we've got a dry suit or this, we got a wet suit that no, you're, you're miserable.

Speaker 2:          00:01:54       It's not. You're going to be cold. You're gonna be uncomfortable. You ride in a Zodiac first, you, you ride in a, in a big ribbon, which is like a 10 meter boat and you have your Zodiacs on that boat, so you're in that boat, you're getting sprayed with water, you're getting bounced up and down. You do that for three hours and then you launch your little boats into the water. Well there, while you're doing that, you fall in the water, you slip, you get sprayed more, you're covered in water. By the way, the water is not warm and then you got to, cause you're going to travel then 15 knots, so you've got to fear facing a 15 not headwind for another two hours in a Zodiac, and then you're going to get in the water and swim. It would be deeply, you're going to be cold.

Speaker 2:          00:02:35       That's just the way it is and you can't complain about that. So, and you don't complain about it in the teams, you just keep your mouth shut. That's what you do. Keep your mouth shut. Now the big distinction here is, this is correct. If you're going to get hypothermia or you're going to get a heat stroke or you're going to go down from dehydration, then yeah, you got to speak up and be, you know you to say, Hey, guess what? I got an issue here. I'm, I'm starting. You know, I'm starting to get dizzy or starting to get light headed or whatever. Yeah. If you cross the line to where it goes from discomfort to actual problem, then you definitely need to speak up. Um, and it does happen. It happens a lot actually. You know, when we, when we do our land warfare training in the desert in the summertime, it's 120 degree heat.

Speaker 2:          00:03:22       Got Your, you're going to take heat casualties. You know, when I was running training, we used to just have premeditated heat casualty evacuation cause we knew someone was going to go down. That's just the way it's going to happen because you got 40 guys that are all turning and burning and they're all running on three or four hours of sleep and then they're going out in the field and they just got back from the field and there's no time to rehydrate. You know, the, okay there's time, but some guys might forget to rehydrate and next thing you know, you've got a guy going down. So the stuff does happen and yeah, you got to let your team know what's going on. I've the, the closest call I had, I was on a long patrol training patrol in the Ozark mountains of Arkansas. It was summertime, it was hot.

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       We were planning to pump water. Meaning you bring a little water filtration system into the field and you get to a stream and you can feel your canteens and it's great. And it seems like you have water forever cause their streams, well we, the way the patrol went, we started off in pairs and then we linked up with fire team and they need like a couple of squad and you look up with a platoon. Well while we were in the squad linkup we for whatever reason, the course that I was on, I didn't hit water. We had a couple of streams that were supposed to be there and they weren't because they're intermittent streams. So sometimes dreams are running year round and the time of year it was, the streams weren't running. So the first one I was like okay, I'll be okay. Gotcha. So you go up over a mountain, come back down the other side, get to this where the stream is marked, intermittent stream is marked on a map.

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       Guess what? No stream. So now, and then by that time I was out of water. So now coming the next day I said to myself, you know, if there's not water on this next stream, I'm going to, I'm going to have issues and there wasn't water for the next day. So yeah, that's, but I started to feel the dehydration coming on me. That's why I hate being thirsty. I, Hey, I always carry as much water as I can. You, you gotta be paranoid about being thirsty and once you start going down from a dehydration, it's really a bad situation. You went the whole day. No, it was two days. Yeah. I'm now, I had water going in, but I didn't really feel, I didn't have a ton of water. I should have had it. I should've had one. Oh, I should have maybe two more liters of water as a, as a just in case, but I didn't think need got to carry.

Speaker 2:          00:05:40       Yeah. Yeah. Cause you know you've got to carry it. Now you're heavier, now you're sweating more. So there's a little balance. You've got to figure it out there. But yeah, can it be a problem? Yes, I have seen it become a problem where we're guys, ego's too big, they don't want to admit it for sure. So yes, this is a good warning. Don't your ego get you in real trouble and that's going to hurt your platoon even more. So don't let that happen. Don't let your ego prevent you from telling the truth about what's happening. And this happens in, this can happen in the business world too, where, Oh, you know what? Oh, I don't really know how to operate this piece of equipment, but I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just going to try and do it. Well, that's how someone gets hurt. So again, that's an ego problem.

Speaker 2:          00:06:23       When you have an issue, when you know you can't do something or you've never done something before, step up and, and raise your hand. Now of course you should have done the research. You should just, you know, you should have figured some stuff out on your own, but if you failed to do that, don't dig the hole deeper. Raise your hand. Say what the problem was. There you go. Good question. Yeah, makes sense. Cause that especially the thirst thing, like the dehydration thing a yeah. You don't want to be the guy saying, oh I'm thirsty. But here's the thing. I think nowadays though, like teams and coaches, here's the thing, in football case they'll pop Warner football. They'd be like, yeah, no water. You know we have a water break, you drink water at the water break, otherwise you're practicing, you know kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       It's like a toughen you up thing. But man, that can jam your health up. Yeah. But let's face it. I mean it would be pretty rare if you gave people the, if you're doing a practice, what, how long has the practice last? Two hours. Two hours. Okay Bro, you can make it two hours if you're properly hydrated. Now if a person is not properly hydrated going into the practice, sure that can, that can be a problem when if someone is properly hydrated going into this situation, it should not be a problem. And I'll tell you what, if you are in the military and you're going in the field, man pre hydrate like crazy. That used to save me so much from caring so much water and just drink so much water. Now I'll tell you where the problem comes in. You're in a helicopter ride for an hour and a half that you got to Piss so bad.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       It's awful. Well you know what, bring a little, bring a little plastic bottle with you so you can piss him the bottle. That's the way less of an issue I think. Like finding a place to drink versus fee for sure. But yeah, if you pre hydrate properly, no matter how hard you're working, you can go like 12 hours without any water, which is pretty legit for you. You know, kind of an average seal mission. 12 hours get you probably have plenty of time. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I'm talking pop Warner here so you know, we're not talking about, but here's the weird thing, like when you went to high school, College, they'd have water right there, right there on the sideline, and they, you know, they're really aware of, hey, you need good, you need lots of drink more water. You don't think that was also the time.

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       Yeah. That's actually the point. The era, the era when we were kids, no one ever, ever one single time in my old, from the time I was zero until I was 18 no one ever said to me, hey, make sure you drink water. Never, never heard anyone say that. It was like, oh, you're thirsty. Drink a coke. Well, you know, it's just the way it. Yup. So that changed for you in that time period. When I got to, when I got to seal training, when I got a buds, that's when they were saying, oh, you got to stay hydrated. Yeah. I thought it was kind of a joke. I thought they were kidding at first. Like, what are you talking about? Hydrogen? Me Drink water. What do you, what do you mean? Why would you call it something else hydrated? We're Thursday this naive will, you should, cause you can go down from like heat this for, there's heat exhaustion, heat stroke, heat exhaustion.

Speaker 2:          00:09:25       Yet there's all kinds of heat injuries you can get. Yeah. And you get heat stroke by, you can straight up die. Oh yeah. So that's not, you know, it's not a matter of like, oh yeah, tough it out. Right. You can't tough it out. You're shutting down kind of thing. That's for sure. So, you know, that is important. It's sort of the heat thing. And I guess that is, you know, going back to this question, that is probably why we would see he casualties in training. Because guys do not want to say anything. They're like, man, I'm not gonna say anything. I'm not going to get an IUD and look even worse. Cause that's what happens. You get stuck with an ivy. Now you're laying in the field. Everyone else, by the way, it continues on doing another tip kilometer hump to a target and you're sitting there laid up in the ambulance like a little baby. No one wants that, but pre high if you pre hydrate properly, you won't be in that situation. Yeah, but if you are going to get that situation, you need to say something. Yeah. We're talking about your life essentially and more important and we're talking about the mission.

Speaker 1:          00:10:23       Yeah. Yeah. I'm still thinking about the pot. We're in a situation, but yeah, man, I dig it and you are correct. I can't help but agree with you. 100% net question Jocko. Dear Jocko, my chosen community has lost and continues to lose members due to suicide. One reason is that they don't ask for help. I think one reason they don't ask for help is that they're afraid of being or being seen as weak. I'm aware that this takes strength and discipline to be able to purse, perceive when you need help and to ask for it. I don't know how to convey that to them. Could you address how one can gather support from their team without losing face?

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       So there's an obvious reason why I paired these two questions together because they're both very, very similar. And it's the same thing. And if we don't, if a member of your team won't come forward and admit they have an issue, then the issue is not going to get addressed. And this is the same exact thing that you have to explain to your team. Like, Hey, if you start going down because you're dehydrated or your start getting d, uh, getting frostbite and you need to get warmed up, you need to say something. If you don't say something that's going to hurt the whole team, that's what's bad. So, so I think that's important. I think that's important to make sure everyone understands that this part of being a good operator is knowing your limitations. And when you reach your limitations, raising your hand and saying, Hey, this is a problem.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       And believe me, there's, there's guys that might complain about little things and they're eventually going to be labeled as a little complainer, right? And they don't really have issues. So there's a fine line, right? There's a fine line. But for this one, you know, for someone that's having some kind of mental stress, well again, we got to recognize what's going on. We've got to recognize that it's impacting us negatively at work. So that means you got to raise your hand. If it's having a negative impact on the way you're performing, then you got to raise your hand. And I think it's important to explain to people that this is something that something that happens to can happen to anybody. And it's not a negative thing. It's just a reality. It's, it's kind of like, it reminds me of being afraid. Right? And if, if, if you're, let's say you got a new guy that's never done anything before and he doesn't know that he's going to be afraid going on an operation, then he's going to wonder why his stomach is upset or why he's second guessing themselves or why he can't sleep.

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       Like, Oh, you can't sleep. Guess what? That's normal. You're going on a hardcore combat operation tomorrow. The fact that you can't sleep as completely normal, the fact that you feel sick to your stomach is completely normal. The fact that you're, you're, you're shaking, those things are normal. Like you're going to feel those. That's okay. It's not that big of a deal. And those things are, are just fear. That's what they are. And if you know what they are and you know that fear is okay and it's acceptable and it's actually kind of good, right? Because if, if you're not feeling any fear whatsoever all, then you know you've got some, well you should be feeling afraid. You should be, should feel fear that should, that should propel you. It should get you on edge. Those, all those things are actually happening for a reason. So there's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       And I think that's the same thing that you got explained to people with stress. Like, Oh okay that you can have too much fear. You keep someone at that heightened state for an extended period of time. Well that's called combat stress and it's real and it can happen. It can happen to anyone. And you know, how many books have we talked about on this podcast where you can see stress, combat stress taking its toll on people and and when it does, you know we've talked about it many times. P if you, if you get to that point you need a break and and Dick winters from band of brothers, you know, he would give gloves, guys breaks without them even knowing that he was giving them a break and saying, Oh hey echo, you've got to go back and do a little logistics run for four days and just make sure we have more supplies coming our way.

Speaker 2:          00:14:30       Get you off the front line, get you a breather. So that way, again, the same metaphor I've used before is if you have an engine in the red and you keep running it, what's going to happen? The engine, it's going to burn out. It's not going to be usable. If you have someone that's psychologically stressed and they're in the red and you keep running them in the red, guess what? Eventually you're not going to be usable anymore. So you need to give them a break, get them off the line. Because if you do take an engine, if your engine like check engine light comes on and you go and get it maintained, get it fixed, the engine still good. If you keep running it, the engine will be destroyed. So you've got to do that with your people and you've got to make sure everybody knows.

Speaker 2:          00:15:04       And I think that's a real simple metaphor to use with people as well. Say, look, we're running hard and we're going to put some stress on the engine and if you don't keep the engine maintained, the engines is going to break and you won't be any good to the team. You won't be in good for the mission. So if you start feeling your engine light go on, you got to let someone know so we can give you the proper maintenance and that's it. Jody Mitic talked about that too. Jody was saying, Hey, you know, basically if you get injured, if you break your ankle, they don't just expect you just to keep going. No like, okay, you need to get back and you needed to rehab while the same thing had happened to your brain. Your brain gets a break in it. You don't just keep driving or it's going to fracture and fall apart.

Speaker 2:          00:15:44       What do you do? You, you take a break, you get downtime and you get recovered and then you'll be ready to rock and roll again. So two really good questions to start it off. You know, again, especially for folks out there on the battlefield and then it's not just for people on the battlefield because it happens with any, any group of people that are in a stressful environment. I mean obviously cops get put into a really stressful environment all the time. Well, if you need to take a breather, you need to say something before you, before you burn out the engine. Yeah. Same thing with business world, right? People in the business world get extremely stressed out. Well you probably need a break at some point. Make sure you work that in there. Don't like, uh, like police have like a, like a mandatory program or a mandatory situation where you know, you go through, I think we'll like when they shoot someone or something like that, like mandatory.

Speaker 2:          00:16:38       You have to go to like some kind of like counseling. Most of them do now. Yeah. Yeah. So that, that makes sense too because even if, let's say you don't necessarily need it or whatever, right? You'd go through a shooting situation, you got to go mandatory and then I got to go through. But it's good that everyone kind of does it because it seems like, oh, it takes away the negative, the stigma, you know, like kind of like, oh, I'm the only guy, you know, I'm the only guy that apparently feels this way. I'm looking around. No one else is going to counseling and now I'm the only guy, I must be the weak guy, so I don't, I'm going to know. And they do that. They've done that somewhat in the military of, Hey, when you come home from deployment, everyone's going to go talk to uh, talk to what does it a psychotherapy therapist or psychologist. They kind of do that. I know they did that in the seal teams where they'd be, everyone would go, they didn't do while I was in, they give you like a piece of paper to fill out, which everyone just kind of gun deck, you know, it just pencil whip. I don't know what, just like, you know, fill it out except for Tony. You know what Tony wrote on the, the head of his, what he wrote. This is a cry for help.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       That was pretty funny. But in the west that was, he filled out like a whole fake one about just a funny one.

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       Yeah. Yeah. But it makes sense though because of that, because that's kind of the,

Speaker 2:          00:18:03       yeah, that's really smart way to do thing. It's the smart way to do things. Let's give everyone a, let's give everyone a baseline sort of, okay. Check. Here you go. Yeah. And that way no one's, no one has to go. No one has to take raise their hand first. Right? Yeah. You're all going to talk to somebody. I think it's a smart thing to do.

Speaker 1:          00:18:19       Yeah. Cause it's kind of the thing, right? It kind of goes along with the earlier question too. Like if it's a water break and hey guys, water break, everyone's drinking water. So now it's like you don't have to feel like, Ooh, the one plus

Speaker 2:          00:18:35       who like me to use water. Oh you know, kind of thing. Oh yeah. Yeah. This exact same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       Yeah. Hey Man. So yeah, if you've got an issue, man, speak up. Let everyone know. You know, that way you can do your job, you can do it longer, you can do a better, your goal is to do the, is to be the best possible. That you be the best possible capability so that you can go out and do your job the best if you're, if you got issues, you got to say something so that you can keep doing your job for the team. Yeah. It's like, I'm like, don't look at yourself as being weak. Look at yourself is trying to optimize your strength, kind of, you know? Maybe just flip over the way you look, look at it and whatever. There it is. Next question. Do you think martial arts tournaments are the most effective way for preparing for physical confrontation? I just competed in my first, my second do just the tournament as a three straight white belt in one match.

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       I completely lost focus and control of my mind because I believe I was taken aback by the strength and wildness of my opponent. Amen, man. I dig it. Hundred percent I barely, I can barely even remember how my, how the match unfolded. I've given this match significant thought and I concluded that I need to compete more. I'm very calm. I'm very comfortable with everyone in my academy. I trust the desert role with without question. They're like family. Now. The Guy, the guy in the tournament was a total stranger. He was unknown and therefore elicited fear. I allowed myself to be, to be crippled by fear. Is there any other way to overcome this beyond competing in tournaments? Thank you. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       You know, competing is definitely part of it and it's interesting [inaudible] he's asking if this is the most effective way to prepare for a physical confrontation. It is a very good way to PR to help you prepare for a physical confrontation and the bottom line is competing. One of the things that competing, one of the things that that's true with competing and it's true with anything is that the more familiar you are with the unfamiliar, the more familiar it will be calm. Yeah, I know that sounds pretty obvious, but the more familiar you are with the unfamiliar, the more familiar it will become. So you get to become familiar with things that are unfamiliar and you learn how to handle things that you weren't expecting in the teams. We always talked about that your first free fall jump when you're, when you're learning how to skydive with the freefall rig and they're your first jump, seems like it's, it's like three seconds long.

Speaker 2:          00:21:13       Even though it's a minute, even though it's a minute because you're just, you're all amped up and you, all you see is your altimeter and the more you jump, the more you see until that minute. I mean, have you ever had tried to hold your breath for a minute? Yes. That's like a long time, right? But and that's, that's the amount of time that can take up a free fall can be a nice long minute where you're observing all these different things. But when he first started doing it, it doesn't seem very long. I'm sure if we had Andy, you know Andy Stumpf on here, his one minute free fall price seems like a really, really long time because he's got thousands of of jumps. And so this is the same thing. The more you train for chaos, the more custom you're going to become to the chaos. Now what's great is in this particular case he's talking about this guy's just wild and crazy and hey, if you survive it that first time will, the next time someone goes wild and crazy, you're like, okay, well here's what I needed to do.

Speaker 2:          00:22:12       Need to put this in check. I need to, I need to hold on, I need to make sure I don't give any positions but I'm not going to get crazy. I'm just going to absorb some. You go through that mental drill and the more you go through that mental drove a battle, you better you will get at it. And this is true, this is true with anything. And, and that's why, you know, when I was running in seal training, we put the we, we would make it. So we hit people with the most random hospital things because that's what prepares you for random possible things is random possible things. That's what you want to deal with. It's kind of weird, you know, in Jujitsu, Dean Dean used to talk about this and now you can hear John, Donna, her talking about it as well. And if, if you have never been in a certain situation before, you're not ready for it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       And when, okay, so there's a, there's a position in, in Jujitsu called 50 50 right, that's what it's called now. We used to call it cocker Reiko because that's the position that dean was in when he beat a guy named Cocker Rinko for the ADCC world championships. And Dean Dean calls that position 90 10 because he's been in it so much that even though it's a neutral position, meaning we both have the same advantages and disadvantages. When deans in that position, he's been in it so much that he's got a 90% chance he's got a 90% chance of success because he's been there 10 times, 20 times, 30 times more than you. And I heard John Dawn, her talking about the same thing the other day. He's getting Pete, you know, his, his Jujitsu fighters right now are doing things to guys that are these, they're, they're putting people in positions that the person's not used to.

Speaker 2:          00:23:48       So if you're not used to it, guess what? You're an advantage. Even though I might have trained, even though, let's say I'm a Jiu Jitsu black belt and I've been training for 20 years, if I've never been in this particular position before, it's I might as well be a white belt in that positioning. You can see that happening. You can see that happening in Jujitsu. That's why when somebody comes up with a new new type of moves, that move can be effective for a little while. Like let's say, let's say you came up with a new move. You might catch me in that new move one time and then I go, oh, I know what he did, but if, but now if instead of just a new move, you had a whole new area that I had to learn all. Yeah. Then I had had to learn a whole new deal around.

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       It's the same thing with Eddie Bravo and 10th planet. You know, like they, they were doing things like, oh, I've never been in this position before. Now what do I do? And they were catching guys like that. And then the more people figured out that part of that system, okay, well then you get better at it and we get to a neutral ground again. But anytime you can, so in training, anytime you can get to be put yourself in a situation that you haven't been before, it's going to be beneficial to you. Now what does it, how does this translate to real physical confrontations, right? How do you train for that? Well, how often are you putting on gloves and Jujitsu? How often are you having somebody punched you in the face? How often are you having somebody come up and push you around that? How often are you having people do things that people have been doing a street fight, right?

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       That people are going to do in a street fight that they wouldn't normally do in a Jujitsu match, right? For instance, in a street fight, does anyone ever start on the niece, right? They don't start on the nose. They don't. So you don't start on the knees and street fight. You don't say, Hey, you want to fight me? And then you, then you get down on your knees and so does the other guy. Now we figure out what happens. No street fights don't start on the knees. So you're almost, and people ask me, this is actually, somebody asked me the other day, w w what should I do when starting from the knees? What's a good take down? I'm like, oh, pull guard. Because why are you on your knees? Yeah. The best thing to do if your opponent is on their knees, stand up and kick them in the face, right?

Speaker 2:          00:25:49       Because you're not going to be, if you're, why would you be on your knees? Yeah. So don't practice that. So how do you prepare for, the best way to prepare for these combat situations is, is uh, is Jujitsu tournament a good way? Yes, it is. A good way. Is Boxing, is boxing a good way? Is it good to do a smokers? So you figured out what it's like when somebody, some you want to talk about with someone going wild. Wait til you get someone that's untrained in boxing. Come throne, the throne, you know, windmill haymakers at you 38 in a row. Now they're going to be exhausted after that first 32 seconds. But, but you will, I would have had to have withstand and not get punched in the head. You know, cause if you get punched in the head by a while, hey maker, I don't care who you are. If they connect with your chin, there's a possibility you might go down. So you need to be careful of that. So, so don't just think, oh just Jujitsu. Hey go out, train some boxing, train some boy tie and go and

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       spark. And if you can do a smoker's cause it's smokers. Pretty easy to do. In other words, you don't need to, you don't need to, uh, do like a full preparation camp and all that. Yeah, it's an unofficial event. So you go do a smokers and you're going to experience somebody going wild on you, throwing haymakers at you, throwing crazy kicks at you. Do that, do all these things to get ready for those physical confrontations. And then, then you also on top of that, you read and you look at youtube videos. Go Watch Youtube. I've talked about this before. Go watch youtube videos of street fights because you get to see what people, what kind of things people do, which, which can be very effective, right? You need to watch, learn to watch out for soccer punches. You need to learn to watch out, watch your back and watch you sneaking up on you and be aware of your surroundings and put your back against the wall. You know, there's all these little things that you can do to make sure that you're not going to get sucker punched, but you've got to pay attention to those things, you know? Yeah. That was that wildness that he talks about.

Speaker 3:          00:27:48       That is a huge thing. It's like a whole nother factor where, especially in exactly how he said he's real, he's real familiar with his training partners. So men, you know, the amount of cruising and kind of relax and even during the role there's probably a significant amount of it almost to the point where it seems like anyway where he kind of maybe expect that or you know, even subconsciously kind of he, he understands that that's kind of part of the deal. You go against a complete stranger and he gets wild. Then it's like Whoa, this is like, it's kind of overwhelming. And also even at the three stripe white belt level. Yeah. This other guy, he may, he's got his little game, he's got his game that he plays and there's a chance that as a three stripe white belt, you haven't learned that part of the game.

Speaker 3:          00:28:35       So it just feels crazy. Yeah. And that whole, you know, when you compete for the first, second time, you know, just a at the earlier, see that's the thing is the more you train, the less holes there are. Right. The last holes you are there are in your game. And so if you're a three straight white belt, you might not have good, uh, guard replacement. Yeah. Right. Like you really haven't learned how to replace the guard from cross side. Well, if this guy happens to be a guy that holds really well across the side and that's where he works his game from, man, you're in big trouble, you're in big trouble. And it all seems so unpredictable too at those earlier stages because you don't know where your holes are. I mean, you, you might know some, but you don't know, you know, you haven't seen enough of the game and you haven't been in enough situations where you, you can kind of stay calm and you know, all this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:29:25       So to your point where you say you got to be familiar with the unfamiliar kind of thing, remember when [inaudible] started just baseball bat choking everyone. Yeah. Yeah. These little weird setups. And he would let people pass as guard and he, they'd be thinking, oh, I'm about to score some points on that and boom, they're getting tapped out. Yeah. It was so foreign that, okay, so he went, the two real real famous ones at the time when he exploded on the scene with these was he was Clark and Zack Max through there's two matches. And one of them, Zach Maxwell had mounted in arm bar. No, hasn't been the arm bar. Meanwhile, baseball choke is in not, but who cares because really that rule not rule, but that situation of kind of applies. If you have someone in the arm bar, I don't care, he choked me up to break your arm, but he's going for the arm, but he can't lean back because baseball that chokes in and he's like, he got a tap, you've got a straight up tat.

Speaker 3:          00:30:22       And then, uh, I think he was Clark where he could've been the other way around. But either way, Clark has a smile. I was better at these matches, weren't we? I know I was. Yeah. No, I wasn't. I was there, I saw the videos. But um, yeah, the kind of where Clark was like, I know this joke, I'm in Maui or I'm in this good position. I know that this choke doesn't work. It simply doesn't work cause I have the advocate and he gets choked unconscious cause he doesn't tap. Sure it might hurt. And that is the case for a lot of jokes where it's like sure this her, no, no, no don't, no, a good one doesn't even hurt. Yeah. It's just a joke. It just in the, so what we're talking about there is a guy named measured, what's machines last name? Age.

Speaker 3:          00:31:00       Yeah, that's right. And he, he came onto the scene we'll say with, well this is what's interesting about this is the baseball bat choke is not a new choke. Yeah. It's not a domain that people were unfamiliar with. It's just that he was doing it really, really well with really good setups that people, that's what, that's the part that people weren't expecting. It was a really good setup. They really going to set up so people weren't expecting and so he let people pass their guard or his guard, but he had the token, they'd get across side and get mounted or whatever. Go for arm locks and they're tapping. Yeah. Because they weren't expecting it. Yeah. And even if those, you know, I mean Zach Maxwell and Clark Gracie, but just phenomenal competitors. Blackbelt Jujitsu, I mean been training their whole lives. Both of them got caught by that by, yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:31:52       The, the, the legitimacy of like, the way that whole thing went down was just so astounding. Like, just like how you said like Clark Clark has been winning stuff from day one and then, yeah. And yeah, it was just crazy. But it just shows, you know where you can, you can be that good. You get just that one teeny tiny window of unfamiliarity. Yeah. They guy creeps in there and he's familiar, but he'll just have his way. And then what was interesting is as people started knowing that that's what he's going to go for it, but he'd still get it. Yeah. And actually he and I trained with him before for know a few times or whatever and he didn't do that to me. And I was like, hey, you know, like Wah, I didn't have to him, why didn't he do it to me? But I was, do people, you know like does everyone asks you to teach them or what did he's like, you know what people don't w I don't even really talk about anymore because I've become so well known for that move that it becomes, it became less a part of my life.

Speaker 3:          00:32:51       He said, I was like, well, it can happen to where, okay, now once you go, okay, it goes through a phase of, hey, I wasn't expecting that and it worked because I wasn't expecting it. Then it goes like, hey, I was expecting it but it still worked. But then it gets to a point where people are just going, I'm not gonna do it. You're like, Oh, if he grabbed my collar, I need to go in a totally different direction. I need to not do anything, I need to back out, whatever. And then it becomes where, like you said, it's an now it's loses some of its effectiveness because everyone is expecting that to be the move that you do. That's what happened with Dean Paul a hundred percent sure. Like where there'd be like, I don't care what position that I'm in, I don't care what position I have to give up and just do not get into that leg lock position and you can tell when someone is bachelors.

Speaker 3:          00:33:36       I was like, I get it, I get it. But you know man that is how it goes. But the chaos thing, I think he should compete more. Yes I should compete more for sure. But what I'm saying is compete in Jujitsu for sure, but do some smokers, do some more Thai, do some wrestling matches, do some samba. You know, get out there, do some different competitions. And then on top of all of that man do some scenario based training. You know, do some self defense based training at the academy where somebody pulls out the, the, the, the knife, the fake knife, whatever. Would it would they call the fake knife and like let's make sure we know how to deal with that. Let's make sure we not to deal with a baseball bat. Like what are you going to do? What are you gonna do?

Speaker 3:          00:34:21       Cause Baseball Bat, you know what to do with baseball back close the distance, you know, hey that's, that's, that's not even really a game changer. As long as you know what you're doing, knife goes the distance with a knife, now you're getting stabbed this problem. Yeah. So you got to make distance. Yeah. It again, men that just, that familiarity, like once you go through it, that's like almost night and day in and of itself. Once you've seen it, if you've never seen it visited, if you seen it in once, like first step is night and day. So that's good that he went through this. Really. Yeah. Yeah. And what's the other good? Psychologically? Nobody recognized psychological. He recognized that he lost his mind. What he said. He said, uh, I fear. Yeah, I got fear. What was it in one match? I completely lost focus and control of my mind.

Speaker 3:          00:35:09       So once you, that's what you just said. When you get that you experienced that, that's a good thing to experience because then you learn to recognize that you're losing control and you're losing your mind and you're going to, when you, when you realize that it allows you to start monitoring it if you've never been, because there's people, we'll let her listen to this right now that have never lost their mind before. They've never been overwhelmed by something and just not knowing what to do. Never been frozen. You ever been frozen with fear frozen with fear if never felt your fight or flight thing engaged and when it happens you won't know what it is. Yeah. You want to know what it is so that way when it happens you can go, okay, I know what's happening right here. I'm going to make this, I'm going to make this decision yet.

Speaker 3:          00:35:50       And now you're saying when you train boxing or boxing? Yeah, yeah and MMA. So when you get hit in the face, and we talked about this before, when you get hit in the face, then you haven't really been hit in the face before. Like that's a, it'll throw you off. Oh, put really Miley, it'll throw you off. So especially, yeah, you're right. Because when you see someone get punched in the face and a movie and it seems like it's doesn't really phase him that much and they keep going, if that's what you expect is going to happen when you get punched in the face, that's the wrong idea. Because what's going to re if you've never been punched in the face before, when you get punched, it's a little shocker. Yeah. And there's pain and your eyes get blurry and you're, you get a little flash.

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       I mean, there's a lot of things that go on when you get punched in the face once you get used to where you're like, yeah, you can move right through it. Exactly. Yeah. But if you're not used to it, it's a problem. Yeah, fully. And it's, that's another one. It's night and day when a guide has been hit in the face a bunch of times and is used to it. And a guy who's not used to it because you know how like you can hit a guy in a face or get hit in the face and there'll be like, I'm done. Like I didn't really expect this encounter, this experience you don't want to get. And then other guys, they'll give him the face, break their nose, break their jaw, all this stuff in there, keep fighting, you know, it's like Dang. So that night and the situation, if you're not used to it, which is essentially the same thing you went through, this guy went wild.

Speaker 3:          00:37:14       He wasn't ready for this overwhelming experience and he lost his mind turning to him. Yeah. So you get him the face. Like I remember Greg punching me in my face so hard where I don't know if he was mad or, or just just Greg James fires it off. He punched me right between the eyes, thought he broke my face and it was the kind of where it was a timing thing too where I came in, I was shooting in and right before a level change to whatever he, it just connected and I was like boom. And I remember thinking, cause I just kept going and I remember thinking, Dang, I'm glad I was kind of used to getting hit in the face because that would kind of at the very least paused me for a long time. Like didn't he would've, but when you imagine just that kind of chaos and sensation that'll just stop you.

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       But once you're used to it, you're good. And this is a good point to bring up with just with any kind of training like leadership training, right? When you have leaders that haven't been put in certain situations before, that's why Ashland Front, we do like role playing exercises with people and you put people in situations the first time you put them in situations like dealing with a hostile subordinate that doesn't want to do the plan the first time they'd get put in that scenario. They just Lou, they just fall apart. No, I told you to do it and here's, I'm like, okay, let's replay that. By the third time you're doing it, are already handling the job, handling the scenario infinitely better. Infinitely better than they did the first time. Yeah. So it's the same with everything in life. Like the exposure to it and the rehearsal of it gives you such a massive advantage that to not rehearse and to not train is, it's actually sad and that's actually the national front's a great example because that's why we're in business because people, people don't even know that they should be doing this, you know, and, and to go to a company that has 50 100150200 leaders that are leading teams and they have no leadership training and therefore we're all surprised when the leader doesn't get the teams to do what they're supposed to do.

Speaker 3:          00:39:20       Well, who, who taught him how to lead because you just don't show, he just not, you just don't show up to work knowing how to lead. No, you actually get trained to lead all these unfamiliar micro scenarios happening. That's, that's one of the, I got the muster. We'd do these little drills at the muster and you could see people are, are overwhelmed with the knowledge that they gain from two or three little scenarios that we put in front of them. And these are common stairs that happened all the time. But when you watch seasoned business leaders trying to handle a scenario that they haven't seen before, now they might've seen it before, but they never actually had to deal with it the first time. They try and deal with it, they fall apart. Yeah. And it's real. I would say it takes like 10 seconds before you go, okay, let's just stop because you've already got this guy mad at you.

Speaker 3:          00:40:05       Well let's try this again because we haven't been sued the situation before. They never been punched in the face before. Yeah. And that's the problem. Yeah. Don't let it happen. Get punched in the face a few times to be, yeah, you can do this. It's kind of like, I remember when we were kids, there's this, there's this gut, you know, like Wrigley's chewing gum, the little packs, four or five of them, small little thing. And you know, you grab one and this one kind of sticky. Now you can say, hey, you know, do you want one offer, one of your friends. So it was my brother and he did the long story, but he was crying from something else who said, and he was like crying and oh by the way, you know, he offers me some gum. I grabbed the gum. It's one of those miles trap and it slaps you and then kind of hurts when you're a little kid anyway, and it snaps a fan.

Speaker 3:          00:40:50       I'm like, Dang, I never, you know, I see he's laughing. He was crying from something else and then he's laughing, cheered him up, whatever, double leg it was up there for, well actually, which would have made the double lake even better nonetheless. I had never seen that before. Now someone offers me Wrigley's gum. I'm aware I'm ready for that mouse trap. Maybe the muster at may be not, but you're grabbing by the side of the program or the site. Exactly right. Listen, learn. Yeah, exactly. Right. I don't have to take it into her that I won't lose my mind. Life is no different. Next question. I'm a chef in a large operation kitchen. I'm second in command overseeing a large kitchen staff, part of a five person

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       management team overseeing the entire account. Recently during my last review I was given some advice by my boss and his boss. I'm unsure about my last two annual reviews have gone very well and I'm on the rise in the company. However, they said if it was important for me to get or heat. However they said it was important for me to give up some of my kitchen dog mentality and work to showcase my artistic side and embrace more of a star role in the spotlight, get out of the kitchen a bit more, gain more exposure. Specifically with our high profile clients. While they appreciate their sentiment and respect their big management skills. Their style isn't one I strive to emulate or feel would work for me and the way I operate, I have always approached my work is more of a craft than an art. And I've always like being a trench, dug with my team, my team responds to it and I get results for the business and I feel the results should speak for themselves. It is propelled my career rapidly thus far. So why would I want to change and be something I'm not? Should I heed their advice or stick to what I do best and keep getting asked.

Speaker 2:          00:42:49       Great on my terms was just funny how, how that last statement is framed, right? Yeah. Should I stick to what I do best and keep getting after it as if to say, if you say no, you should not stick to what you do best and you should not get after it. Right. That's, that's the frame there. And actually this guy, I answered the question real tersely. I think this came through Facebook messages that, you know, I said, uh, sounds like you found a comfortable zone for yourself and you want to stay in their little cold butter and responds. And he's like, ah, I knew it because as we know in a comfort zone there was no growth in the comfort zone. So it's interesting this guy is actually getting some, some good solid and straight forward advice from up the chain of command. Uh, plus I think if they have him as more of a personality than the restaurant will do better and they're trying to build their reputation and your reputation at the same time.

Speaker 2:          00:43:52       And that seems pretty reasonable to me. Right? And I'm not real familiar with the restaurant business, but I'm familiar enough to know if you've got a good reputation with the staff that works at the restaurant. It brings in more people, like there's no doubt about it, the, the relationship, just like any other business, the relationships that you build with the customers strengthens them, strengthens that relationship and makes them want to come back for more. Right? That's the way it works. And so for them to say to you, hey man, hey, you know you're a good cook. We get that, but we need a little bit more. We want a little bit more chef. We need somebody that has, yeah, chef. Sorry. You're, yeah, yeah. Sorry. You're a good chef. Well, actually what I think I might've actually purposely said that like, hey, you're doing a good job in the kitchen as a cook.

Speaker 2:          00:44:43       We don't need someone that's just cooking the food. We need a chef with a reputation with a personality. Right. There's a difference there, right? Yes sir. So it was called out for reason. Gotcha. He's happy. And you can see like kitchen dog. Yeah. He's proud of that, right? Yeah. And I get that, man. I get that. I get that. Like you're one of the boys, you're back in the, in the grind. Well let me, let me ask you this or let me make this statement. Guess what you have to do as a seal, as a CEO leader, guess what you have to do? You have to build relationships. You have to make your commanding officer trust you. You have to build relationships with the army. You have to build relationships with the Marine Corps. You have to end. In order to do that, you have to like raise your hand.

Speaker 2:          00:45:26       You have to call a little bit of attention to yourself and raise your hand and say, Hey, this is who I am. You have to take, this is who I am. You. You have to actually have to step into the spotlight a little bit so that you can let people know who you are. Because if people don't know who you are, how do you have a relationship with him? And if you don't have relationship with people, how can they trust you? So, so that's part of it, right? That's part of what they're asking you to do. Now, in all seriousness, if, if you really don't want to do it, well then you can keep being the guy that's in the back. And guess what? You're going to be mad in six months when some other chef gets hired for a different shift and all of a sudden he's out making friends with everyone and he gets promoted.

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       And why does he get promoted? Well, look what the guy's doing, but he's not as good as, he's not as good as a cook as I am. Guess what? They don't really care. Being making the food is only part of what they want you to do. Just like being a seal. Doing, doing missions is only part of what they, what you need to do to do the mission. You can't just be tactically sound. You've got to have the relationships built so you can work in the battlespace that's owned by a conventional commander. You got to have the relationship that you can get. Your mission's approved up the chain of command on the special operations side. How do you do that? You build, you go out, you talk to people, you get out of your comfort zone. It's a weird thing, you know, I'm kind of, I'm kind of antisocial, right?

Speaker 2:          00:46:57       Like if you don't know me, we're not going to have a conversation. You know? Like we're not having a car. Like it's not, I'm not, I'm not walking up and talking to you if I don't know you. I'm not walking up and saying hi to you. It's not happening. It's not my personality. If you say hi to me, I'll say hi. I'm not disrespectful, I'm not rude, but I'm not looking to have a bunch of conversations with people and so that's known to me, but that's not okay for the business side of my life, which is, hey, I got to talk to people, got to build relationships. Got It. To had to know my commanding officer had to know the commodore, had to know the, the, the conventional battalion commander had to know the brigade commander had to build relationships. Could I just talk about war with the brigade commander?

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       Well I could, but what's more powerful that I talk about war and I talk about where I'm from or where he's from or what, you know, other things. Yes. Cause I want to build a relationship with a why? Because I'm trying to build trust. What? Why? Because I want him to allow me to go out there and do things in his battle space. So that's what they're asking you. They're asking you to step out of your comfort zone. It doesn't need to become your primary focus. No. Should you try and step out of the comfort zone if you want to grow, if you want to have more opportunity, I would give it a try. I would give it a try. If not, you know, like I said, if you hate it and you feel like you're not being true to your true self, that's okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       Maybe your true self is meant to be the one that's back not getting promoted. Yeah. They need somebody to do that. It's not you. It might be somebody else. Yeah. Another one of those tough questions where people, you know, hit me with like, should I just be, shall be loyal to myself because the obvious answer that everyone wants to hear is like, yeah, dude, two most important things. You've got to be loyal to yourself. That's the most important thing. Okay. If that's what your priority is, then that's the most important thing. But guess what? Who Does? Uh, who can take care of the other kitchen dogs that respect you so much? Who can take better care of them than you can? Because if you get promoted, if you don't get promoted and, and Johnny Glamour boy gets promoted because he likes to go out and Schmooze the clients and now he gets promoted and you're, and now who's going to take care of the kitchen dogs on his, on his time, right? Not Him. He doesn't care. He's got, he got promoted not for taking care of his guys. He got promoted because he smooths the clients.

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       Play the game a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       It's weird menu explaining that and it's like, yeah, makes complete sense. I'm thinking of it in terms of like being a, I dunno, I guess it applies to any relationship you have. So, so like let's say, okay, you have a wife, right? You're, you're buried, whatever. And so your wife wants to go to, hypothetically wife wants to go to, I dunno, Vermont, right? And you're like, hey, I don't like Vermont, you know, go to Vermont to whatever. But your wife say, Hey, I want you to come because I like spending time with you and in all this stuff. And as a husband, like, hey, I like spending time with Youtube, why can't we do something that I specifically like to do whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:50:22       And it has to do so a lot of times with like maybe your wife's friends or the enlarged. So I don't want to hang with the only hang you, but I want to hang with them. And the went from to hang with you with the friends and all this stuff or whatever. But a lot of the time, my case, it might've been me just sticking in my little comfort zone, you know, like the people that I like to hang out with there, there's like set stuff that I know they're into and I know that they like to talk about it and all this stuff. And I'm essentially rejecting being open to new or other stuff. You know, that's, you know, this kind of like a situation. But in a way, I'm kind of doing what this, what this guy is implying, where it's like I'm gonna say true to myself and my interest in all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       I love my wife hundred percent that has nothing to do with it. Vermont has nothing to do with me and my wife, you know, but why shouldn't I step outside of my comfort zone and you know, tried to accommodate her wishes in this way. It's not a make or break a relationship or nothing like that. But if I do that, if I just exercise the ability to be open, I become more valuable of a husband, more valuable. I offer more value in the relationship and as a person. So same exact thing when you're explaining this, when this guy's explaining where he's awesome as a chef in the back doing the, you know, doing his deal, doing what he does best, awesome. But they, and these guys see it, his severe, see it obviously, where they're like, hey, we want you to do this more stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       Even cause you're awesome in men. Imagine if you had this, this more stuff. You know how valuable you would be as a Xyz, whatever the position is in this case as the ship and to reject that is essentially to say, you know what, I, I don't want to be more valuable as a chef or I don't want to be more valuable as a husband. I prefer to stick with my current value. I don't want to upgrade. There you go. I refuse to upgrade some staying true to myself. Just saying anyway. I mean, can you cross the line and get to a point where you make yourself sick cause you've done. Yeah. Then you've gone too far. That's the dichotomy of leadership. Like, yeah, if you become just a disgusting Sycophant, then guess what? That's not good. Yeah, so I'm not talking about that. Yeah. Well not talking about leaving your values and abandoning your values, that's not what I'm talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:52:46       I'm talking about playing the game a little bit. There's a big difference. Step outside of the comfort zone. Play the game a little bit. At the very least, do it with an open mind. See how you like it. What if you were like, you got real good at that. You know how like public speaking for example, where I'm no exception, a lot of people didn't like public speaking even though they might have a lot to say or whatever. You know like some people like their their spot, but to I don't want to get up on stage and nothing like that. That's dumb. I'm going to, I'm not a star, I don't want the limelight on me and all this stuff. Then they do it one time and they, and they offer like just so much value doing it and then they get used to it and then all of a sudden they stay kind of like it. You know? It could be one of those deals. Could, could be.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       You never know until you try it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:29       Next question.

Speaker 2:          00:53:31       Two of my bosses have told me, I don't like Jocko.

Speaker 4:          00:53:35       Interesting, interesting concept.

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       Without giving any value, valid reasons. Their ego is in the way. How do I flank them to help them see the path? My belief is that they're afraid of the truth and they, they're afraid of the truth. They see in extreme ownership. Okay. So, uh, yeah, I mean, clearly ego could be a problem here as a leader, you know, who wants to constantly be compared to some other leader, right? You know, if you were teaching to Jujitsu class tickets, like, Whoa, the way that you, the way that Dean teaches this, you know, that that would make you mad afterwards. So that could be part of the problem. Oh, that's dead. That's definitely, that's way up there on the list of possible things. Could be the military flavor, right? Some people don't like the military flavor of thing, so that's, that's okay. It's,

Speaker 4:          00:54:24       it's

Speaker 2:          00:54:26       can turn some people off. They don't want to hear about it. That's fine. Uh, the reality is he, here's, but here's the reality of the situation. Okay. What is there to not like about the things that I talk about? Right? So let's say, you know what, I don't like people taking ownership. I want everyone to make excuses and blame each other, right? It doesn't, it doesn't even make sense. You know, instead of we, I don't want to hear about this cover move. I want everyone to ignore each other and get worry about themselves. Right. Like that, that makes no sense whatsoever. You know, if keeping things simple, I don't want it, hey look, I don't want to keep things simple. I want everything to be so complicated, but no one knows what's going on. Right? Like these things that they make. No, there's no human being, no one in a leadership position that would want everyone or that would, that would go against what these simple principles. So

Speaker 2:          00:55:23       how do you fix it then? Right. What's the problem? Uh, one, here's a couple of, and actually this was a Twitter thing and a bunch of people gave great responses on Twitter after I kind of highlighted it. Uh, one, one of them and my, my actual responses like, hey, just don't, you know, stop using my name. You know, stop saying, well [inaudible] was it? Cause you can't even imagine how annoying that must be. Right? Well, Jack was in, you know, when you're in a leadership position, you know, it's like that's going to really great on somebody. So, so, so throw that out the window. Don't pit it as me, Jocko against what your bosses are saying. No, don't do that. You've set up an adversarial relationship with them and you've set up or an advert adversary relationship with me. And I've never even met these people before.

Speaker 2:          00:56:06       I don't even know who they are, even know what business they're in. But what you've done by constantly harping on it as you've pissed them off and now they're saying, dude, quit talking about Daca. We don't care. Because also the way that he's in just the way he's being offensive in approaching these things means that he has a little more listening and growing to do. Because if you really want to approach your boss or you know, he asked about flanking as possible, the way you find someone isn't going, hey, the wedge Alcoa's says you should do this. Like, no, that's not good. So let the principals work in another, another person pointed out, you know, um, hey, don't, hey, stop trying to impose your things on them. Like take extreme ownership. How's that sound? You step up and start leading. You do your thing, you perform well.

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       Quit talking. Quit trying to force these things down people's throats and give them space. Give them room and then they'll recognize that you're doing a good job. If you label it with something that you know they don't like, well then they're going not going to like it. No matter what you do, no matter what you do, that's going to be problematic. Don't bludgeon them with with will. You know I've, this is blah, blah, blah. No, don't do that. Take Let. Bring your ego in check. How's that sound for your ego in check a little bit. Make the ideas that you're talking about their ideas. Get them to talk about ownership, you know, get them. Maybe they call it something else other than extreme ownership. Maybe they call it, you know, a personal accountability. Okay, awesome. That's great. Yeah, I really liked that. I really like what you've come up with, boss.

Speaker 2:          00:57:41       I'm in with. Oh well now they're in the game and they don't realize that you're talking about the same thing. That's fine. Don't they? Don't ever have to realize that. They don't ever have to realize that. So I mean there's some people are some people that don't like it. Even to the teams. There's people that like, they didn't like me, didn't matter. It didn't matter where, what the principal was, didn't make no, that's, it's like no, like, hey, just, just, just don't, don't attach my name to it and go and do be a good leader. How's that? So those are some things I think if you live, live the principles, act on the principles. No one's going to be mad at you for taking ownership and responsibility of what you're doing. Unless you say, Ooh, you look how I took ownership of that. Well then you might paint yourself into a corner where they ain't stupid, where they end up not accepting what you're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       And they'll get mad at you for stepping on their toes out of court. And it is also as you do this, as you take ownership, don't rub their noses in it. You give them credit. How hard is that? You know, you've come up with a solution to a problem. Say, Hey, no, actually I got this idea from something I saw you doing really. Right. That's how you, that's how you flank them. Hey, I took ownership of this problem. Who? Oh, really? Oh, you just go, oh, here we go. Extreme or, no, don't say that. Don't say that. You know? It's like, Hey boss, I wanted to make sure this got done correctly. I was watching the way you did, blah, blah, blah, blah, and you go from there. Give them the idea. You it makes sense it, yeah. I W I wonder how the boss got introduced to the concept of Jocko for him to eventually

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       hate and not like in this situation it probably was like, you know, multiple repetitions of way. Yeah. Like, yeah. You and didn't pick up the vibe. Yeah. Which is like, hey you, I'm dealing with someone with a big ego and they're not going to take well to me talking about this other guy's leadership style, do you, you don't want to be compared to some other leader if you're in a leadership position. Yeah man also is kind of the same thing but a little bit different. The, that thinking about that type of scenario, men, that's the worst. That's like as a boss, I would think that that'd be really bad cause, okay, so here, here's the situation. So I make videos sometimes. Right. And so let's say I am, and actually this is an actual thing that actually happened where, okay, so I made this video for this.

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       We'll see client and kind of take, okay. You know, they look at it and it's typical, you know, they'll have some input, maybe some information they want to add or take or change or whatever. And then, um, this guy said, oh yeah, I'm not sure about this part. I showed it to my wife and she said, you know, x, Y, Z and x, y. And I'm thinking, okay, I get it. Like, okay, you showed it to people that I understand, but I was like, wait, wait, wait. So this is the video made for you and your deal kind of thing. And you went and showed your wife and then now she has some kind of input. She's not part of this deal. You know, now you're like citing your wife's critique and like all this stuff and it doesn't make sense by the way, as far as what we've discussed and all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:00:52       Right. So the, so the wife is now, I kind of have this kind of disdain for the wife. I don't know the way if at all by the way. So I'm like, I'm just not feeling the wife anymore. Ego got in the way a little bit and it's, and it's natural is what I'm saying where it's Kinda like I thought we were doing this video kind of together and I'll just do this for you and you give me the input and when now you involve your wife in it, who threw the whole thing off? Cause she's not even part of this little thing right now. Really hard to put your ego in check. It's really hard to put your ego in check and actually listened to what the critique points are. It's he, it's hard for anyone to do that, you know? And so when it happens, you have to go, okay, that's my ego and you need to put it aside.

Speaker 1:          01:01:30       Yeah. So consider the situation. If the guy would have just said, don't say I showed it to my wife and she said this, don't say, if he would've said, well I was thinking about this, which is, what do I said? You know, in their whatever else finger about this, what does they, it woulda got delivered way better. Way Easier. Same thing with here, your situation. If someone's saying, I don't know, let's say for example, it's a fireman, there's a farm and you know the, the bosses saying, Hey, we should do this and do that. And then this guy had just out of the blue said so well Jocko says is like, who the hell is jobs? I don't remember hiring Jocko who did it, who is this guy and what's he talking about? Cool. But Jocko has no say in this department. It's me, it's you. It's the team. You know, the team that we've worked with kind of thing. And that's kind of the feeling. So yeah, man, don't say Jock, lead chocolate.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       I don't need the credit. Not all. Next question Jocko. Please explain how working harder for an incompetent superior helps oneself. I feel like screw them in whatever lightning bolt of luck they were struck by it again in their position. Is that kind of like screw them and the horse they wrote in on kind of thing? No, he's saying screw them. They were there. They're in their position as superior because they got lucky. Yeah, yeah. I didn't get all that. Yeah. And you know, here's the answer that I was like, okay, so what are you gonna do then?

Speaker 2:          01:02:53       What are you gonna do? Then you're going to sit around and wait for your own bolt of lightning of luck to hit you. Is that what you're going to do? I don't recommend that. Instead, I recommend that you step up and yes, you do work harder and you do the best possible job that you can do. And you take some pride in what you're doing and how you're doing it, and you do it better than they could, not to rub their nose into it, not to prove that you can do a better, but out of professionalism. That's why you do it. Now, one outcome that can come from that is they get credit for your work and it makes y'all mad. No, that's actually good because if they get credit for your work, guess what? Work's going well, they're going to get promoted,

Speaker 5:          01:03:37       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:03:37       And they get the recognition. Okay, that's fine.

Speaker 5:          01:03:42       Okay,

Speaker 2:          01:03:43       but, but they know where the actual credit goes, even if they don't give it to you.

Speaker 5:          01:03:49       Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:03:49       Even if they don't give it to you, they know it. Even if they're the type of person you'd go, that doesn't even realize that you're like, Oh wow, I did all that work and he's taken all the credit for it. They didn't even know that I made this happen or he doesn't even know that he, that I made this happen. They know. They know. So as long as you can keep your ego in check and you can let them have the credit, eventually they get promoted, the team's doing well, you'll look good, you'll get promoted. You're life is easy, you're gaining experience, you've got a good reputation. Like everything is going in your direction. And, and by the way, when that incompetent person does get promoted, who do they usually recommend that fills their spot? You cause you're the one that got them promoted. They're stoked on that.

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       Now you become a superstar. That's great. Eventually they're going to get found out. By the way, like someone in competency can't be hidden forever and eventually someone says, wait a second, you didn't even know how to do this. That was, that was echo Charles that was doing this this whole time. Yeah. Okay. Okay, well we're going to promote echo. You're out of here. That that'll happen. And when that happens, we in competency gets found out, then you will get the recognition you deserve because people said, oh, that wasn't Jocko doing all this stuff. This was echo. They go, oh Jocko, you're done. So that, so that's something had happened. Or another outcome that can happen is that they give you the credit that that you're do, which is great and you still get promoted and you may get promoted above, which is fine too. Oh and or they might get promoted, which is fine. Stop worrying about it.

Speaker 2:          01:05:24       So those two things, if you do a good job, eventually something good is going to come out of it. Whether it's they get, whether it's you both get promoted, whether it's they get promoted above you, whether it's you get promoted above that, it doesn't matter all those outcomes. Or maybe it's just the team continues to do well and your job is stress free and you continue to perform. And, and the, the, the, the division that you're in grows and you get a chance to promote because everyone's getting promoted. It's like all good, all good stuff. Or you can be angry. And you can be frustrated and you can blame your own bad luck and you can not work hard and you can not do a good job and you can be recognized as a slacker and you can get blamed by the incompetent competent boss when things do fall short, because that's what the incompetent boss does. He doesn't step up and say, go ownership of it. He says, no, you know what? I would've done a better job, but echo was slacking. That's the problem. Now Aco gets fired.

Speaker 5:          01:06:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06:12       And, and guess what? Someone we hire someone else to come in and they start doing a good job. That boss still going to look good. I still get promoted. Just that you lost your job and by the way, you lost her job with a bad reputation. Now you can't even get a recommendation for a new job.

Speaker 3:          01:06:26       So you lose. That's what's going to happen. Yeah. So step up, do your best.

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       It'll pay off in the long run. Yeah. It's funny how like it's one of those things where if you can just flip the switch and see that. Just that one little thing, and it's funny though too, the way. That's the way these questions are framed. You know what they want to hear is like, no, you know what? If you've got an incompetent boss, you don't help him out. You Bet I'm Berg. Yeah, that's what you do. That's what people want to hear. But it's, it's the easy answer and it's not the smart answer and it's a short term answer, not a long term answer. You make your boss look great. How's that? That's my goal. I want to make my boss look great. You know there, there was a little tell in the, in the question too, I'm no expert obviously, but lightning bolt of lock La. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:07:15       So you know the whole deal, and this is even, you can be an normal person. They recognize this like people who are bitter. I'm not saying the asker of this question has been, I'm not saying that, I'm saying this is the external scenario, but you know how if you get a bitter person who's just been in life, maybe not doing as well in life as they had hoped or whatever, you'll probability wise you'll probably encounter them from time to time. No more saying how the guy who is successful is lucky. They're lucky, big headache given to them like all this, all this other stuff. Me, I'm not lucky with whatever, but it's always the sixth successful guys. Lucky always. Yeah. They attribute other people's success to luck to look for sure. So the lightning bolt of luck in screw them, you know kind of thing. Just that is indicative. I'm not saying it is, I'm not saying it is or isn't as far as this particular person, but it tends to be like that. And again, like that, just that switch if you can like turn on the switch and just look at it. Just how you said, yeah, it's not

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       intuitive. I get it man. Because it's like I was in that situation where like literally I was doing the work.

Speaker 2:          01:08:22       So think about this. You just said you're in this situation. Almost everybody has been in this situation and here's the difference. If you don't flip that switch and you're in this situation, your whole wife goes down in the other direction. Yeah, that's a real problem. That's why you meet people. You know, this is a a thing I think about a lot. You, you don't know you, you know people in your life, they're bad asses, but they, but they're not going anywhere. Like, like you look at it and you go, man, this guy is smarter than me and, and by better athlete than me and a better speaker than me, but they're not going anywhere. And you know why? It's because at some point in their life, instead of saying, Oh wow, that guy's, that guy's lucky. That's what they do at some point their life instead of saying, hey, that person worked to get in that situation and I should do the same. Instead of saying that, they say, oh, that person got lucky. That's why they're there. And I'm down here. Yeah. You can't make the upward climb if you don't say, you know what? Hey, that person might be a little luck there. But guess what? They're obviously working hard. They're obviously doing something right because I'm down here and there up there. How do I get up there? Yeah. The answer to get up there as not by tearing them down. The answer to get up there is by working hard. Yeah. Make them

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       good that the line you said, um, what, and so what are you going to do about it? And yeah, what are they going to do? But that's the switch right there. Cause I mean you deal with it with kids obviously they have some young kids and you know, same thing like oh this is how it is or this happened or, or whatever, spilt milk out and whatever. And you know, the kid's crying. It's all this stuff's like, okay, so what are you going to do about it? So you can cry. You totally can. And you can complain about how junk that is that the mill that spill to your toy broke or whatever the situation. Yeah, cause that's all true. It's absolutely true and good. You can cry, whatever, but if that's what you're going to do about it, then okay, then that's what it's going to be and that's all it's going to be. You're going to continue to cry and you'll probably continue to cry next time. It happens too. Or you clean up the milk, you fix your toy, whatever, you know, whatever. What are you going to do about it? That's the whole thing. You know? What are you gonna do about it? It's interesting too. There's like a,

Speaker 2:          01:10:34       just a known, the right answer seems really obvious when we talk about it right now, but not many people see that right answer. No. Most people want to just be mad at their boss and be frustrated and undermine them and not work hard so that they don't get any shine on them. It's like, okay, great. That's you putting yourself in that barrel to, yeah, don't do it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:54       It's crazy, man. Actually, I shouldn't say it's crazy. It's, it makes sense. I mean, I felt that before 100% yeah. Oh for sure. For sure. Next question. Can you be default aggressive and relaxed in Jujitsu?

Speaker 2:          01:11:15       Okay. Yeah. This seems like two opposing things that you can't do at the same time, but the actual fact is yes, you can and you should. So you want your maneuvers to be aggressive, but you don't want to be using a bunch of strength to execute the maneuvers, right? You want to aggressively escape your opponent's position before your opponent gets settled. Therefore, you don't have to use strength. You can use relax it. You can relax, you can, you can be proactive. Same thing with defending a a submission attempt. You want to sub defend that submission attempt aggressively before the submission attempt gets settled in. You want to move aggressively. Again, I'm not talking about strength and spasming, I'm talking about moving aggressively before your opponent moves and get ahead of them on their Ooda loop. When you get ahead of them on their Ooda loop, they're going to have issues with you and so yeah, absolutely.

Speaker 2:          01:12:13       You can be default aggressive and at the same time you can be relaxed and you should. That should be your goal. Do you sometimes have to use strength in Jujitsu? Yes you do. Yes you do. Sometimes you got a power out or something. Why did you, the reason you had to power out of something, it's because you were too late because you weren't moving aggressively enough. You want to move in quickly enough and so then you've got to power out of something kind. Call those hands, claw that guillotine off your neck. Do you know what I'm saying? You want to get a gauge on what some of them, they're clawing your fingers away from their neck. Yes. Yeah. So when that happens, that person was late and and now they're clawing. They're resorting to strength. There were resorting to panic, clawing at your fingers. Sometimes it doesn't.

Speaker 2:          01:12:54       It usually doesn't even matter. They can claw. It doesn't matter. You good? I like that sense of panic that I feel when they're clawing. Yeah, I'm sure you do. You really like it a lot. So that's what, that's what it is. And by the way, this is true in life as well, right? Like if, if you are maneuvering correctly, correctly as a leader, you don't have to get aggressive at people because they're doing what they're supposed to be doing. You don't have to be, you shouldn't have to yell. If you have to yell as a boss, guess what? Your, your intent wasn't followed. Your plan wasn't understood. There's so many mistakes that you made. If you're yelling as a leader, do you never have the oh yeah. So sometimes you can yell cause you've got gotta make sure you can get that emotional point across.

Speaker 2:          01:13:38       Sometimes you've got to make sure that someone really like someone doesn't seem to realize that the mistake that they made is severe enough that it warrants a yelling and therefore it doesn't matter to them because their dad yelled at them their whole life. What? So if you're not yelling, they don't get it. So can you can, can you run into that cake problem? Occasionally, occasionally. Very occasionally. Very. Very rarely should you run into that situation because if you're doing the right job, being default aggressive as a leader, you should be in situations where you never have to yell because your people, because your people understand what it is that they're supposed to be doing. They understand why they're to be doing it. They understand what the plan is, they understand what the contingencies ward, they understand what the, what the intent that you had was. They understand this way that this fits strategically into the situation. They understand all those things and if they understand all those things, then they're going to do the right thing. And if they don't, if they understand all those things and they still do something that that doesn't make sense, we'll meet. Maybe they do deserve, get yelled at. But again, all the first person that I check is myself and say, well, I obviously I to make this clear enough.

Speaker 3:          01:14:38       Hmm. So yes, relax harder. So yelling is to leading as using strength is to Jujitsu somewhat. You got to do it every once in a while. Every once in a while. Or if you lay, maybe you lacked on your technique earlier, you got to kind of make up a little,

Speaker 2:          01:14:59       but think about this, you hurt your stamina. Strength. Right. And when I yell at you because something went wrong and you're my subordinate when I yell at you, I pay a little price for that too. Cause I better be important and I better really think about it cause I didn't do anything to build our relationship in a positive manner by yelling at you. Right. Didn't do anything.

Speaker 3:          01:15:20       Yeah. Just like you didn't improve your Jujitsu technique or knowledge in east or really you, I guess you improved your situation for a moment. Right? Cause you escaped, but now you're more tired. Just like if I yelled at you to do something and you did it cause you real, you know, you were like, okay, well fine. I want to get yelled at anymore so I'm just gonna do this thing that he told me to do that it's temporary. The temporary fix. It's a temporary fix. Yeah. You know how like JP will say, um, aggressive, it isn't, or do you felt aggressive isn't towards people. It's towards making things happen. So like so when do you do it? The same thing. So it's like I don't aggressively like it's and it in a way you kind of can narrow it down to the timing thing. It's like it's like it's either taking action or hesitating kind of thing.

Speaker 3:          01:16:03       So you just don't really hesitate. You can lay back if that's part of the strategy and stuff like that. You can relax when it's part of the strategy, but it's about making things happen. Like what are you trying to make things happen timing wise. So you know how like you have to think. Tim Ferriss asked what is the disrespect? Remember he asked me that, what's the disrespect? Oh it's a Jujitsu move. I'll go past your do that you made, but you made up the terminology as well. So the disrespect is basically when a guy pulls guard or you're in a guard scenario, it's actually not even the guard scenario yet. It's like you essentially treat that person like they don't even have a guard. The guard doesn't even exist. That's how little respect you have for the garden. And then you just pass. But when you kind of think about it, when I think about it, when you've done it to me, the times you have it is literally that.

Speaker 3:          01:16:51       So before I can establish any kind of position to establish guard, you're just just, yeah, you're a pass it, you're done. You know, you don't even consider the guard. You know what's weird is, is where people get confused on this though, is they think, Oh sir, you're saying move faster. Yeah, right. That's the weird thing. It is. It's not. It's a, I'm sure I'll think of this at a later time, but it's not about moving faster. It's moving more aggressively. Right? It's not faster. It's like being proactive and being aggressive and shutting down the situation before it, before it even becomes the situation that you'd know what's going to become. Yup. So if you take, like you said, like, like if you take a taking action and hesitation, you take those two. It's basically you're narrowing the hesitation down to zero, if possible. Literally what it is.

Speaker 3:          01:17:38       Yeah, just take action. And again, you can relax, you can wait, but it's not hesitation waiting. It's waiting. It's like one more like being patient or waiting for a very specific reason. You can do all those things, but there's no hesitation. That's what I think that is. And then obviously it's going to vary from case to hear over and over and over again in combat leadership philosophies like doing something now is better than waiting, doing, doing something, doing something that's pretty good right now is infinitely better than doing something that's great in two days. Yeah. Good plan. No better than a great, really aggressive. Make something happen like that is so important. Can you overdo it? Yes you can. Can you make stupid decisions because you rushed it. Yes you can. Is there a dichotomy in this? Absolutely. There is due. That's, there's a dichotomy and every part of it, so, and every type of leadership.

Speaker 3:          01:18:29       There's a dichotomy in Jujitsu, right? There's a doctor because if I just rushed to a situation, well that might be the situation that you want to be to rush to. You gave me the opening, the trap, the trap. So it's like, you know, when you're helping your friend move and then you get like three, four other friends, you know, and everyone's waiting around to be like, okay, where do we start? Okay, where do we put, you know, where do we start? Who starting first kind of thing. The default aggressive guy. He's just going to start moving stuff. And that seemed like, okay, that's like a little lighthearted scenario, but by that's real. That's when I would run into it. You don't want to, there's a bunch of people and we're all capable of making the decision. It kind of paralyzes everyone because this is so true.

Speaker 3:          01:19:09       That scenario that you're talking about, it happens over and over and over again in the business world. It happens over and over again on the battlefield. What happens on the training field where there's a bunch of people, no one's taking leadership positions. Yeah. Like you're all it takes is someone to say, Hey, we're moving this over here. Yeah. They put all this to get all this stuff off the truck right now. Boom. All right guys. We're like, okay, cool. Well we'll make it happen. Yeah. Like you're a oil rig scenario. The main exact same thing. Yeah. And if your default aggressive meaning that's your default, that's the, that's your zero, you'd hear that hundred percent. Then you're just handling business your whole life till you take it too far and you're trying to run stuff that other people might have a better vision of what to do. Like if I might be, I, if I'm only moving for the first time ever on our moving team and I come in, I'm like hey guess what? Hey we're going to start getting this the heavy stuff and you're like hey actually that's not a good idea. Yeah we should do this. We should get this stuff in here, the truck first or whatever. Right. Cause you've

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       been doing it longer so even though it's got to be your default mode again, there's a dichotomy you can push it too far. Yeah. Got to keep your eyes open. That's the question. Let's do one more Jocko. How do self awareness, self assessment and self improvement begin and how do they continue over time? Well, they're all tied together and it starts with being self aware, with being able to detach. Because if you, if you cannot detach from yourself then you can't see yourself.

Speaker 4:          01:20:52       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:20:53       And so people ask, how do you detach from yourself? How do you learn to do that in a good drill for this is try to imagine the way other people see you and what other people are thinking of you in one place where this happens, and it definitely happened to me is when I started getting put in charge of things, I started thinking about other people's perspectives. What are they seeing?

Speaker 4:          01:21:25       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:21:26       If you're in charge, then what are your subordinates see you do? What are your subordinates here? You say, what kind of representation are they receiving? And if you work for someone else, it's the same questions. What does the boss see me do? What does the boss here me say? What kind of representation am I making of myself? To my boss? And then you start thinking about what are your friends and family think? What do they see? What do they hear?

Speaker 2:          01:22:09       And so the question becomes how well do you represent yourself? What shortfalls do you have? Now when you first start looking, it's like you're looking at an overgrown lawn. There are some big obvious problems. So you do a broad, just kind of general cut of the grass. You fix some of the big easy problems that are obvious. Once you've done that, once you've gotten rid of some of those big obvious problems, you notice some more detailed problems. See? Then you handle them. And once you've got those handled, you see even smaller and more detailed issue. So you start trying to fix them.

Speaker 4:          01:22:59       Okay?

Speaker 2:          01:23:00       And that's what you do with yourself. You continually detach and then you look and then you refine and then you detach and then you look and then you refine and then you detach and then you look and then you refine. That's what you do.

Speaker 4:          01:23:19       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:23:19       That's how you get better. And that process doesn't stop. It can't stop because if you stop refining, then

Speaker 4:          01:23:31       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:23:32       then the weeds grow back in. The next thing you know, you can't see yourself anymore there when you can't see yourself anymore. When you stop looking at user yourself, then you accept,

Speaker 4:          01:23:48       yeah, you accept anything that's wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       Don't accept the faults. Don't give yourself the benefit of the doubt. You've got to be your own harshest critic.

Speaker 4:          01:24:10       It hold the line and don't let go.

Speaker 1:          01:24:21       Yeah, and I think that's all I've got for tonight. So Echo Charles, speaking of improving ourselves, sure. Have any recommendations as to how we might be able to prove ourselves a little bit. Sure. Improve and maintain, improve, maintain improvement. Well, something like that I would recommend. Okay. Let's start with the workout, right? We're keyed out is established and known, well known by the way to be one of the only things that you can do that all affect every other part of your life in a good way. It's also one of those things that, well, more health, if you lose that, you lose everything. It's one of those things for why do some of us not regarded in that way 100% of the time? Why is, why do people not have time to exercise? Lack of discipline. We, yeah, possibly. It might be that short term payoff thing.

Speaker 1:          01:25:29       You, it's natural to seek short term path. It's natural. I think that's it because again, you lose your health, you lose everything straight up. So why wouldn't health be first on the priority list? I don't have time to exercise. No, you have time to exercise. You might not have time to the rest of the stuff in life. Really. That's how it should be, right? Nonetheless, when you're exercising your joints degenerate, the, don't worry about that even because chocolate supplements, Jocko supplements, Jocko, Super Krill oil. This is Omega threes for your joints for a lot of other stuff too, by the way. Praying skin, skin tone, that's like a supplemental thing, but it is good for it nonetheless. That's a fact. And another one called Jocko joint warfare. So your joints, when you start to lose the functionality of your joints, not only does it make workouts, less desirable, less fun, effective, less fun, less everything it can, it can jam up your health physically.

Speaker 1:          01:26:34       You can be less capable. So you want to maintain your joints. I didn't know this, but now that I do, I'm never looking back. Jocko Supergirl, take that and joint warfare, maintain the joints. Maintain joint health every single day. Get the subscription so you don't run out. That's what I say straight up. Like there's a panic mode if you run out. Yeah, and you don't want that panic mode. You don't even need that panic mode. You didn't need that in your life even. So why even bother? So get the subscription. Do the recurring one every month, every two months, however often you take them depending, you know how, how nuts you want to get. Also, Jocko has a supplement. This is for your brain and your body all in one. You don't have to take the pre workout and the cognitive enhancing a nootropic. You don't have to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:27:18       And where you take to just the ones called discipline tastes good to lemon, lime forced multiplier, what we call it. Boom. That's a good way. Take that. That'll help you. That'll take help you to stay on task. Find all the words that you're looking for to use, you know, you don't want, what do you call that anyway? Not Brain fog. Brain farts. Such a lame word. Not late. It's not a lame word. It's a lame word when I say it. Absent mindedness, absent mindedness, you know it kind of combats all that stuff. Present mindedness is the opposite of apps technically. Technically. Yeah. Nonetheless. Promote that and you're all good. It's called discipline. Get all these ad or domain.com the company's origin. I say origin Maine. I just did. That's the company. I say its origin Maine, but it's really called origin. It's in Maine and the website is origin main.com also on origin.

Speaker 1:          01:28:11       Me, Giza in rash guards for your Jujitsu journey. Important journey, by the way. I would say 90 I would say every 100% of one, not 100% almost a hundred percent of people who started Jujitsu, we'll say, okay, it's valuable whether they stick with it or not. You cannot deny the value of Jujitsu. Even with the, is that one of the questions earlier? Boom. You inoculate yourself, you know all these things and it, it's weird how it affects the rest of your life. Jujitsu's good. Yeah. For your whole life. Yeah. None the less. When you start, you could ask what? Gee, should I get? Guess what origin you get an origin g made in America. The fabric's made in America that cotton to make the fabric is made in America. Grown in America. See, we're going all the way down to grown you straight up from dirt, from the dirt to the her shirt to the guitar top to all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       They also got hoodies. Pizza, me some new sweat suit situation. Oh, joggers got him on right now she's straight up. Most comfortable. What does comfortable clothes, this goes for all clothing I've ever had. Just to Anna, that saint alive most comfortable and for a straight up. Is She straight up? Yeah. How did this happen? Um, is it because it's made in America? Maybe, maybe not, but it does speak a lot for the quality of origin in and of itself. And oh wait, it's comfortable because it was made in America. That's the question. Is it? Or isn't it? I don't know. But it is comfortable. 100% the most common, most comfortable. That's, I know it is because you are one that deals high and comfort. I know my comfort levels. Yes. I mean comfort kind of sore a hundred percent and this one graded off the charts check, but he'd lay down, he'd take a break.

Speaker 1:          01:29:56       So I export stuff, you know, in, in, in video editing and special effects, you get an export. So three d stuff, export and takes a long time. Three d studio Max, that's what it's called. It takes a long time. So while it exports, you start using your computer, doing other things, it kind of, you know, he can jam, you'll up, it will slow down your computer, whatever. So, you know, I'd take a little break. I'm gonna lay down on the couch and called my origin. Whole sweatsuit on gets off and I lay down on the couch and I'm like this for some, for some reason I'm the most comfortable I've ever been in my, I'll talk to Pete. You need like a, uh, a signature series series. Yeah, I have it on right now. That's it. You know you've got to do is rename it, embroidered it right on the side.

Speaker 1:          01:30:40       Boom. Eq, doctrinals cruising and comfort. Oh, big time day. And here's the thing. Sure. I say that and I know comfort is kind of a subjective thing maybe. Well, okay, I challenge anyone to, if you have the origin sweat suit or if you get one, get on it, lay down on your couch. Temperature would have to be just right. Cause if it's hot and you have a sweat suit on and not to be as comfortable, but keep that in mind. I challenge you to do that report back. If it's not the most comfortable letting me know we're 100% you get a taste of real American made comfort too. By the way, also, if you're into Jujitsu or if you're not introduced to those in Jujitsu immersion camp on August 26 this year it goes to September 2nd one week, two sessions in that one week I'm going to cause doing going and so is Dave Burke the real top gun? Big Burke. Yes. We'll data, you know why he's going. He sounded like a good deal.

Speaker 1:          01:31:40       Good deal. Good deal. It does not do non good deal things. Yeah. And good deal. Not in the sense where it's like a good deal like um, you know like I'm going to get over. It's like a good deal. Like it's like it's good. It's a win, win, win, win, win. It's linked. The best, best case scenario kind of thing. That's what a good deal Dave is all about. That's just him. That's how he is. How he rolls. Unless other people will be there. What would it be there? Hopefully JP in life. Yeah. Well they've just got his uh, strike another stripe on the white belts. White belts. Yeah. So He's getting shit. He might very well be there as you think of your blue belt by then maybe. Sure. At this pace keeps trying to hard. Yeah. And well he has prior knowledge as well, so yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:32:22       He never know. Yeah. Yeah. So did you see immerse yourself and you're just the best way to learn? In my opinion, Marne too. And a lot even if you've never gotten go cause last time I even went on the side with beginner beginners, like one day, zero days experience, boom. We go through through some stuff from, and I'm not saying, look cool, I'm such a good teacher. I'm not saying that at all. But after like that session, they were ready to go start rolling. Humblebrag to say I know this because that's what they said that not all of them, but some of them said that. Nonetheless. I'm saying there's a lot of value that you did see value. If you've never done before, ever. Clia or gin main.com check it out. See if it's for you. It's for you, but you want to make sure and check on that one.

They're not. I get it. They're not boring. I re retract that statement. They're not boring, but if you run the risk of your workouts being boring, just get some new equipment. Actually it's good because you don't, when you get new career, like getting even like something as simple as a jump rope, right? When you get it, it kind of rejuvenate a little party. You want to, you know, it's like when you get a new key, you want to go to practice more.
