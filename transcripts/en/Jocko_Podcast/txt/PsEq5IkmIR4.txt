Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 104 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       We're going to go right into Q and. A. Cool. I don't think there's anything to discuss. Let's do it. Let's do it then. It's Q and a. It's Q and a time. All right, question number one. You discuss leading and maneuvering up and down the chain of command, but what about laterally within your own peer group where the competition for advancement is fiercest and your ability to sit team objectives and implement some of the tools you discuss is limited. Okay, so you, you absolutely do have to lead laterally amongst your peers and since you don't have rank or position, you have to do it another way.

Speaker 1:          00:00:49       But wait a second, since you shouldn't use rank or position to lead people below you in the chain of command and since you don't want to be led by someone that's throwing their rank and position around, then guess what? You need to do the same type of leadership that you would use up and down the chain of command to lead your peers. So what does that mean? That means you'll help them when you can. You support what they're doing. You try and build a relationship with them. That's what you're trying to do. Now, this, this part of this that we're talking about, the competitiveness, like if they want to maneuver and try and make you look bad and jump in the spotlight and try and get all the credit, guess what? That's fine. That's fine. Let them do it and everyone is going to see what they're doing and they might not see it immediately, but they will eventually be found out. So do your best to support them. Do your best to help them. Do your best to build the relationships. Make the mission the most important thing, not the little politics that you're about to dive into and get involved in. Don't make that the primary thing. Make the primary thing accomplishing the mission.

Speaker 2:          00:02:00       Hmm?

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       Think about this. If you start fighting with them a year, expending energy on fighting your own team, that's what you're doing. Instead of fighting the enemy, it's, this is a blue on blue situation. This is a friendly fire is fratricide. Don't do that. Disengage from the friendly fire and focus on how to make the team win.

Speaker 2:          00:02:19       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       Take the high ground. Take the high ground or the high ground. We'll take you.

Speaker 2:          00:02:29       Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       Another one of those points that we always say, I know I do and I always think this where people are watching men, they see that and they see that you see all that stuff, but let's play this game too. You know the game where I play with like who would you hire? Who would you rather have working for you? Who would you rather have working for you? The Guy, the guy, oh, you got four guys. One guy is helping the other guys out trying to help them with their mission. One Guy, the other end of the spectrum is undermining people trying to make himself look

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       good. Which guy are you going to promote? Yeah. All Day long. You know who you're going to promote. Yeah. You're going to promote the guy that's trying to help the team win and not just look out for himself. Yeah. Yeah. Fully and consider that with not just your boss, but like your peers as well. You know, even if there's competition, let's say there's everyone's competing. Well, yeah, and you're the guy who's jumping in the spotlight always, whatever. Versus the other guy who's always helping everyone. Even the, even if they're competing with you, for sure, I was dumping the spotlight. He's going to get ostracized if anything, you know, so man, yeah, they, they see that stuff, man, that goes socially. You know what? Now, now, now answer me this. When someone sees the world this way, that means to have a tendency to think that way.

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       That means they might have a tendency to act this way. So they're going to be especially cautious if you're looking at everyone, like while I'm trying to compete with that guy anyway, I might be getting screwed over if I don't, if, if I let him, you don't get the spotlight right now. If that's the way you're thinking, that's the way you're acting and if you're acting that way, everybody can see it. Yeah. Don't act that way. Don't act that way. Be a good team member. Yeah. The enemy is outside the wire. Yeah, that's a good one too. Where the good news about that is like let's say you are acting in that way, as long as you can admit it to yourself. Even if you do have those feelings inside, but you're like, hey, I don't want to act like that, and you start, even if you know it's kind of against her feelings and then you start acting that way slowly and slowly.

Speaker 3:          00:04:27       Your feelings kind of accommodate where you don't feel that way anymore. You'll start to feel that way. Let's start to realize how you should act as a human being. As a team member, as a leader, as a follower, you'll grow up, you'll mature, you'll be a good person. Yeah. Feel the benefits as opposed to just looking out for yourself at school and over. The other team. One is against me, check, kill or be killed. Next question. My jujitsu school is small and I'm a white belt under three months and there are typically two or three blues and maybe a purple belt in the class with us. When I trained her spar with the blue and purple belts, I can win the advantage or submit them more than half the time. They don't like me because of this. I like what my is teaching, but I feel I need more of a challenge.

Speaker 3:          00:05:14       Should I find more a more competitive school? Your time is appreciated. Okay, so there's something very sus suspect going on. Yeah. Uh, there's something wrong with the school. If you're a white belt that can submit blues and purples, and I don't know, maybe, maybe if you're 500 pounds or just a super athlete, like your normal person, even if you wrestled in high school, maybe even if you wrestled in college and you, you've been training Jujitsu for three months, do, you should not be submitting purple belts. That should not be happening. There's, there's now there's a small chance of tiny, tiny chance that they're just being like, so super cool that they're letting that, like they're saying, oh yeah, you know, all that was good. You know, you caught me my arm and it was just giving it to you. Just too dumb to realize that.

Speaker 3:          00:06:03       But since you're saying that they don't like you because you're submitting them, that, that, that's very unlikely that they're just super nice. So, uh, I think you may actually be in a fraudulent situation where the school is not a proper school and I haven't heard one of these in a while, but you're a white belt should not be on the regular sub meeting. A blue belt and definitely a purple belt or any purple belts. Yeah. If there's a massive size differential, it'd be an occasional occurrence. Yeah. But on the regular shouldn't be happening. Yeah. Right. Correct. That. Yeah. I mean, unless again, like there's maybe, and maybe it's a small school, you know, there's, you know, a few people maybe like some real old people or something like that. Maybe this guy, I don't know how big he is, but let's say he was too, I'm getting real specific here. Right. What a fees to 25 solid [inaudible] six to [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:07:07       may or may not have been a college wrestler. Okay. Learned a few chokes guillotine. Yeah. Um, oh, go ahead. And arm arm bar to 25 college wrestler six to yeah, he knows basic submissions that, that, that could be problematic. And then the rest of the people, those may be like a 65 year old, hundred 3,545 pounds. Um, he, you know, if there's no extreme, um, disparity between you and the other students, yeah, we have a problem. If there's an extreme disparity, even then you should go look around because even if you're, even if you're a 225 pounds, six foot two wrestled in college, most purple belts, you'd be able to handle you if you've only been traded for two months. Yes, yes. Yet so, yeah, even three men, and not to say my situation and soul, the, here's proof. I'm not saying that, but just an example, I was two when I started. I was two 25

Speaker 3:          00:08:13       I'd say when I really settled into it, I lost it got down to about two 15, two 20. Oh. And I was the white belt over three months, by the way. And I rolled with this guy, George was his name. You might remember him small, teeny go a purple belt and no chance I had with this guy and I was, so this is more than three months by the way, is after I started competing in there, which is good too. Yeah. Purple Belts. Yeah. He's the one who taught me first bite guard by the way. For sure. And Jimmy. Yeah. But yeah, no chance purple belt like him. You have no chance against. Yeah. But this is not a big guy. This is know five, six not, you know, I think you might be smaller than five. Six. Yeah. He's a small guy. I light. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:08:53       Yeah. That's a great example. That's great example. I'm trying to think. I mean, when I started Jujitsu I was 215 pounds. Who else? Bigger than 215 pounds. And Dean was a blue belt. Just got his blue belt. Yeah. And I had no chance. Yeah. You know what I mean? By the way, I forgot to mention Dean weighed 174 pounds. So yeah, it's very similar. Yeah. You'd have to like get the disparity between the two with blue tack to be, oh, so what do you think it is then? I think it might be a fraudulent school. Like how, like what the instructor, the instructor is not a real black belt. The instructor knows he's watched enough youtube to show an arm lock and he can actually do it on the purple belt because he he's bigger and stronger or something and he knows a little bit better cause it's facing.

Speaker 3:          00:09:47       If you, if, if you're, uh, if you watched youtube and you studied as hard as I could as you could and you owned a school and you trained all the time, you could be a blue belt level and then you can beat the other blue belts that you taught and then gave the boob cause you gave yourself a black belt. That's probably what's going on. That's crazy. Now whoever this is hit me up again and tell me what your school is on Facebook or wherever this question, once you do that and once you, you know, I dunno. I Dunno. I mean, is that a, is that like a, is that a hard move to be like, Hey, this is my school and put it out there, you know, and here's my instructor. I mean on one hand you want to think if the instructor is legit?

Speaker 3:          00:10:31       No, no, no. That's what I would want to know. I want it if the, if the guy wasn't legit, I dunno what I do. I don't have a plan for that. But if the guy was legit, I'd come back on here and say, Oh, here's the situation. When you found out that this is what's going on, you are a six to 285 pound collegiate NCAA champion wrestler and you studied sambo or Jew. Like if somebody had Sambor judo under their belt, that's true. But you wouldn't even be asking this question if you had that under your belt because you know the answer to. Yeah, man. So yeah, I think the chance of that is, it's fair. It's a fair chance, fraudulent situation. I haven't haven't seen too many of those lately. Yeah, because that's a rare thing. The Internet can mop those up now. It used to be all kinds of fraudulent schools.

Speaker 3:          00:11:14       Yeah, it makes sense. Let me think about it. The Internet is all over everything. Oh yeah. You get even halfway fraudulent person. Yeah. It's like, Oh God, is this guy like, you know what I mean? Is like, man, you're really held to the Kohl's, so I dunno. Maybe two it up. Yeah, I was going to say she, we have some kind of thing on our website where we have, if you're legit school, like a Jocko approved school in theory is how many times a day do you get asked? I live in Tennessee where structuring and I live in Chicago. Where should I train? How many times do you get asked that? A day. Half. So every other day is, is that about okay? You get ask more than that, I guess. A lot more than you. Maybe not tons more, but definitely I could ask repeatedly. Worst I train.

Speaker 3:          00:12:01       I live in Jacksonville, Florida. Where should I train? I live in wherever, Concord, New Hampshire. Where do I, where should I train? I live in Salt Lake City. Utah. You know what I mean? People are always asking about, the only risk with that is like, okay, so first off, we don't know all the schools. We've probably don't even know half the schools. And just cause you say you're under Hixon, it doesn't mean you're legit. You know, we'd have to have some sort of an approval process and then at the end of the day, let's say you approve, I dunno cause some place and then it then or no, no. Or people will be like, okay, here's the page or the website or whatever. They'll be like, okay, this school that I'm like looking at, I like it but it's not on this list. I don't know. We didn't get to it kind of thing. And then it gets kind of like the Dean, you know? And that way it shouldn't be that much of a problem. By the way, there's not that many fraudulent schools. We're talking about one right now possibly. But there's not many out there. Although there are some, they're like, they're in strip malls. You drive by like a strip mall and you see something that says Jujitsu. Now there's legit schools.

Speaker 3:          00:13:03       You're him. He's his legitimacy. It's hard, man. I Dunno. But yeah, the, there's actually strip malls is actually the normal place for Jujitsu schools now that I think about it. There's a lot of crazy. Here's the one that's straight up in the mall. Oh that's not a strip mall than a mall. Yeah, Mall Mall. I'm going to have to go visit. Come Prieto. Yeah. See if you watched that video I did with them for Metamorris a long time ago. It's like kill. I forget if it was in the outtakes or not, but there's this cool, you know those trains that go around the mall for the kids. He's like, I hate that you to train because it always comes by my academy. That's funny cause especially cause computers such a nice guy. You figured he'd be like, I love that. That's exactly how he said it. They totally me, but he says I hate it. Meanwhile he's smiling and laughing. It's very interesting. Dichotomy can wait more information needed on this academy. Next question.

Speaker 3:          00:13:59       I am seeing at work as a very assertive and aggressive dude and I seem to rub people the wrong way when they think I'm upset or frustrated at problems they they present, which is rarely the case. I'm just so fired up. How do I work on Mike hacked while still being assertive with my team? You know what, I'm fired up too. Sure. How you liked that Jagan and when I was young I, this is when I was younger. Sure. I rubbed some people the wrong way. I know that even when I was a young kid working on a construction site, guess what? I was doing work in too hard, making people rubbing people the wrong way. When I got to the team, those little crew of us that were too hardcore, we were too fired up. We were, I would run the o course with my, with with a rucksack with a 40 pound pack, a 40 pound sandbag on it. No one was doing that,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       like everyone does it now. But back then there was a small crew of us that were doing it, running with jungle boots all the time instead of in sneakers. And I literally got pulled aside by some of the old guys. And by old guys, I don't mean nom, I mean old guys from wherever, uh, you know, from the, from the nineties or late eighties. And you know, I'd get the, hey, you just need to calm down dude. You know, you need to do that. And so yeah, maybe I wrote those guys a little bit the wrong way. Understandable. But when I got a little older and a little bit more mature, I got fired up to actually do a good job as a leader to actually build relationships with my platoon mates. And I got fired up.

Speaker 2:          00:15:39       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       For people to, instead of thinking that I was upset or frustrated what I was fired up because I wanted people to think that I was calm and cool and collected. Right. So how's that for? Don't totally different. It's like when we say default aggressive. Yeah. And I always say, hey, you're not being aggressive and being aggressive towards your people. It's not yelling. It's being aggressive towards the mission. I was, I'm aggressive towards making people think that I'm not upset and that no matter what's going on and they just go, man, Jack was, he's not going to lose his temper. He's a super levelheaded right now. Now that being shit, that doesn't mean that I was passive. Sure. That doesn't mean that I wasn't assertive. It means that I was aggressive and assertive, but I did it with tact and instead of coming at people straight on, I flanked them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       I've listened to their little ideas or I made their ideas come from me, but they didn't know it. I listened to their solutions. I helped him support it. Well, how you go so far just by helping people out and helping them with their idea instead of trying to control them and make everything your idea. So that's my advice here. Relax. Calm down, focus, get fired up, get aggressive about being tactful. Get aggressive about working with people. Get aggressive about showing your calmness. That's what you get aggressive about. Don't get assertive, aggressive and create antagonistic relationships across your company. Check. Yeah. Good. He said he, he gets or they think he gets upset or frustrated at problems that they present, which is rarely the case. He said, he said, I'm just fired up. So it's, it's, it seems like, and I'm no expert, but I'm trying to put myself in a position where like, I think maybe like it, it's just a presentation thing, you know, like yeah, it definitely has a presentation is aggressive. Like he's saying he's not even getting frustrated. I'm getting frustrated with him for fracking this, right? Yeah, like a mindset. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       definitely. It's definitely a presentation thing. No doubt about it. But so that means you say, okay, I'm presenting the wrong thing. I will fix what I'm presenting it. Do you think actually I think you do think this or know this or whatever. Oh, you know how people, they'll, they'll get nuts or whatever. They'll, they'll, they'll be aggressive. They get fired up. Right. And you know, the, whether it be they'll lose their temper or their behave in a way that's, that's aggressive towards people and their justification is not to say that this guy does this. I don't know. But I'm just saying their justification is I'm just passionate about it. I'm just whatever, you know. Um, is that, that's just the justification, right? It is because, yeah. Yeah. Like if at the end of the day it is, it's a joke. It's a justification. It is also a reality. So think about it from the other perspective.

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       If, if you're dealing with someone, if you have someone on your team that gets all that they're passionate about something and it can be problematic if they don't learn to control their passions, right? Cause they just get, Hey, we're gonna make this happen. And they make bad decisions because they're so passionate about making something happen that there dot did not doing something logical. So yes, you could say it's just an excuse and there's no such thing as a passionate person. But that actually wouldn't be true. It's not an excuse. It's a real thing. Now, if you are aware of that, then why do you keep acting that way? You've got to put your passions into check. That's what you got to do. 100%. Yeah. And I meant more like it's an excuse for their behavior. You know, like to me, I personally, I think that being passionate about something that you're into is good way beneficial of course.

Speaker 3:          00:19:35       But again, you know how to say like there's a difference between what you feel and how you behave, you know? So if you're, if you're super passionate about something, it doesn't justify it. Like all this aid rational or emotional or like loss of temper situation, behavior. You see what I'm saying? So, you know, yeah, be passionate but don't behave in some crazy off the handle with agree. So I think that they use their passion as an excuse for their behavior. I just got a quick temper man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It doesn't mean that you can act like that's worse. That's exactly right. Yeah. That's just who I am. I'm unique in that way. Next question. My wife told me that she thinks our 11 year old daughter is being bullied emotionally by some girls at school. As I drove into work, I wondered if Jujitsu would give her some tools to help her deal with emotional stress and or bullying that might be taking place. I think we all know the answer that Daca will give to this question. Absolutely. Jujitsu will help 11 years old as a perfect age for getting in there and you will learn to, she will learn to defend herself for real and physical confrontations,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       which will give her real confrontation, which will give her confidence because let's face it, emotional and verbal bullying is absolutely backed up by a either

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       clear message of possible violence or a subliminal message of possible violence, right? I mean a big group of girl that's getting picked on the, the, the underlying messages there, the implied messages there that it's, it could go physical if it had to and when that gets removed because the, the daughter knows how to now fight and defend herself, that starts to impact these emotional bullies as well. So yes, absolutely get her training. I would throw some boxing in there too, just because that is a pretty empowering thing. You've punched in something that feels good and you, you know what, while we're at it, let's get some working out going on. Right. Get a pull up bar. Get away of the warrior kid nick. No kidding. Absolutely. Get her way of the warrior kid. Don't baby her too much. Yeah, you gotta be careful of that because she's your daughter and you say, Oh, you know, it's so horrible and these girls are picking a, don't, don't do that because guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       She's going to be dealing with this their whole life you're going to be getting, there's always bullies in every environment, in the school environment, in the work environment, in everywhere. There's bullies and she's going to have to deal with them. So don't, don't baby her where she thinks that you're the one that's going to save her from it. Um, and I also think should know that everyone gets bullied. I got asked that when way the warrior could came out. Hmm. Someone said, what did you get bullied? And they think, of course I would never get bullied because I'm a big dude. Well, guess what? When I was nine years old, I was a scrawny little nine year old kid and every buddy that was 11 was bigger than me and stronger than me. Yeah. And then when I was 11 everyone that was 13 was bigger than me and stronger than me. And when I was 14 everyone that was 16 was bigger than me and stronger than me. So no matter who you are as a kid, there's always somebody that the bigger and stronger than you that's going to bully you if they're a jerk. So I think she should understand that she's getting bullied right now. But that's, that happens to people and people get over it and get through it.

Speaker 4:          00:23:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:10       I, I do think you have to be, when you say that you can't leave the imprint, you can't overwhelm her and say everyone gets bullied and you can always get bullied in the office, all, you know what I mean? Like I'm not saying to overwhelm her. I think that's just like, there's a, there's a lot. Did you ever see that movie, that professional? Which one was it? The French guy. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a great scene in that movie where the girl is, there's like a crazy fight going on between her parents in the apartment. They're yelling at each other, the screaming and just slapping people that domestic violence is going on and she comes out and she's sitting in the hallway. Yeah. And she's crying

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       and the assassin guy kind of walks up the stairs and she looks and he looks at her and she looks at him and she says, is life always like this or does it get better when you get older? And he looks at her and says, always like this. So you've got to be careful that that's not the message that you're sending. Now. There is some reality to that statement. Like, yeah, guess what? Life is always going to be hard and you do want to give your kids enough exposure to the hard thing so that they're not weak and they don't, they don't go into panic mode when something tough enters their world. So that's why things like Jujitsu when working out are good and exposing them and letting them experience some hard things. But again, you just don't want to overwhelm her. And that's that.

Speaker 3:          00:24:41       And by the way, you might as well start training Jujitsu to their dad. The mom in there too. Yeah. Now you've got an excuse to get down in that gym Jujitsu on, and I know you that you don't train Jujitsu. Cause if you did, you wouldn't be asking this question. You'd be getting, getting her training you making that happen. So emotionally bullied. Right. So this is interesting. She's in the new warrior kid book, the bully. There's a bully in there, but he's not a bully like Kenny Williamson, who's a big, strong bully. He's a bully. That's an emotional Bulleit Kinda is d. And every time there's seems like there's going to be a confrontation, he finds a way to weasel out of it. Yeah. You know, so he'll harass people, but then he'll get harassed people. He knows perfectly how to push the buttons. That's what the marks are dealing with.

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       This kid named Nathan James Vaguely from Nathan. James Causes Problems. Yeah, there's some layers in that name for sure. That, so this, this makes a lot of sense to me. Cause I have a daughter, four and a half by the way, goes to pre k pre k. Is that the Jujitsu school? She goes, no, no Bruh. Anyway, so she instructor, she told him you one day. Um, she said that her friends, I'm not gonna say their name doesn't matter. Um, she said this friend told me that she's not my friend. She's only this other girl's friend. That's emotional. That's emotional bullying. Right? Then for the four and a half year old version of it gets way worse at 11, by the way. And then probably way worth it. 1516. It's just my assumption. So what I told her, not to say this is the right answer, but maybe the thing to think about.

Speaker 3:          00:26:29       So my daughter does digit two has done, you get to double leg choke. I like it. Well that's what you want to say. Yeah, you'd smashed it. And she's bigger too. She's bigger than, than everyone, you know. So she's going to, no. All right, so what was your, what'd you tell her? My daughter is trained to be nice for. Okay. So I always have this underlying thing. No matter if someone be's mean to you, that doesn't mean you be mean to them. That makes you mean person. I said mean people will be mean to other people. Nice people tend to not be mean to other people. Right. That's really real basic stuff. Fundamental is for, um, so you just keep reminding her. So, uh, so I, I told her, hey, look, if she doesn't want to be your friend, then she's not your friend. And that's okay.

Speaker 3:          00:27:14       Does that mean you'd be mentor? No, but at the end of the day, she, I said, are you stronger than her? And she said, yeah. I said, are you smarter than her? She said, yeah, I dunno. She has or isn't. Here's the thing, it's the self-empowering thing. Just like how you said where she knows you did sue. She's smarter, she's stronger, she can do more pull ups, she can do more burpees and stuff like that. All this stuff. It starts to form in her head. Hopefully move the goal. Yeah. Hopefully it'll form in her head that if they don't want to be my friend, that's okay. That's no loss to me. Maybe if someone who was strong like me, smart like me and whatever, like me, didn't want to say, well, okay, maybe that's something, but this isn't the case. You know? It's kind of that idea. That's good advice.

Speaker 3:          00:27:57       I think the, the thing of just saying, oh yeah, that's okay. Not everyone's gonna want to be your friend. That's okay. Yeah. And some people are going to like her and some people aren't gonna like you. That's okay. You just be nice to everyone. That's fine. Yeah. I've got to ask that question. When we did the one warrior kid podcast, a bunch of people asked, oh my, I feel like people don't want to hang around with me. And I was like, yeah, that's okay. Yeah, that's okay. You don't need to hang around with people all the time. I don't, I don't like even like hanging around with people. I didn't say that because I don't want to turn it over her hands. I social person like me. But yeah, that makes it in that thing or I think you just said where, cause my daughter always asks, you know, did people not want to be your friend?

Speaker 3:          00:28:38       Or um, what'd she'd like? Bumped her head real hard. She'd be like, did you use to bump your head when you were little? You know, she always wants to know like, am I alone in this whole, the whole deal and men, it seems like you're really helps what I say no, I used to do all the time I show her like my scars and stuff like that and she'll be like, oh, and you can tell she feels better about it. That's pretty cool. It's weird. I think that would help with a bullying thing and it's good. Your daughter's smart and so she has the capability of formulating that question. I bet a lot of kids might not be able to even say, hey, did you bump your head too? Whereas a parent, if you just recognize that they probably feel alone. And so if you say, Oh, I know you bumped your head, I used to bump my head too one time.

Speaker 3:          00:29:17       Look, I got a scar on my head. It happened to me too. So they don't make your kids beg for a partner in the world. Give it to them. Yeah. Follow the Echo Charles model of parenting. And that makes sense too now that I'm thinking of, because even as an adult, okay, so you got a kid and they're like, hey, did you, I don't know, did you bump your head like this and get blood on your head or whatever when you're little and you're like, you're like, yeah, and if you add this, and this is how I

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       dealt with it, right? Because a lot of times like you give him a little path. Yes, exactly. Right. So you go, you know you got this poor little kid bumped her head and it's like, Dang, I don't even know. I've never felt this before. There's a lot of paint. There was blood. Oh, that's scary. I don't know really how to deal with it. Right. So of course you go to your dad and then your dad's like, yeah, Hey, yeah, I've done it. This is how I did it. This is how I dealt with it. And she's like, okay, maybe I can deal with that. And even adult because adults, we do that too. You know, like Dang, I'm getting, I don't know, audited. Yeah. Getting audited the first time, whatever Jocko, hey you know, or you know your friend or whatever. It's like, hey, I got audited and this way you can back to this is like how you deal with it and all this stuff. Boom. You feel better about it indeed and more empowered and that's on top of the Jujitsu. If I got audited I would way rather know Jujitsu that not by the way here.

Speaker 2:          00:30:31       Yeah. Chuck, next question. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:30:35       I've got a leadership situation I need help with. I was promoted to a troop commander position over a fellow team leader who now reports to me. He has many years of experience in a lot of knowledge. He's very, he's very bitter and not getting the promotion at not getting the promotion and it's letting me know when I include them in decision making for the troop or try to tap into his knowledge and experience. He, he shuts down, refuses to give input and says that I should already have the answers. Since I'm the troop commander, I know the truth would benefit from his input in team dynamics would be much improved if it wasn't so negative. I've tried to let him know that I value, I value his experience. I feel that his input would be beneficial and that his negative attitude and bearing and bearing are not acceptable, is making very ineffective team leader. I'm, I'm failing at getting through to him and I don't want, fuck, I don't want to fire him for his position. How can it get him to value his own position in the troop and become effective?

Speaker 1:          00:31:42       Okay, I actually think you're doing the right thing and you've opened the door for him. So I think that's a good first initial approach. Uh, but obviously it doesn't seem to be working. Now a couple of different courses of actions you could take. One of the things you could do is actually give them some higher responsibility, right? Give Him, put his team in charge, put him in charge the whole team. Sometimes maybe he will step up and start to lead and see that he's now able to prove that you have a lot of trust in him and all that stuff. There's also a chance, think about this. There's also a chance that you might be coming off as condescending to him. So imagine this, hey go, I, I value your experience. Oh No. So right. You know, the troop would really benefit from your input.

Speaker 1:          00:32:23       It's like you're treating them like it's a key. He's a kid and he's getting that. Those can come off as condescending. So we have to put those a little bit in check as well. And I think those are a little bit, you know, you put the, put the person in charge, you try that you've opened up to try and get their input and get them involved. But it's, it might be coming, it might be coming across as condescending, even if it's, even if you're doing it now, even if you're just saying, hey man, could really use your input on this thing, it'd be great. Even if you're doing it in like a cool way in your mind, you might be hearing, oh, I could really use your help. So even if you're saying it in a perfect way, it still might be hitting his ears in a different way.

Speaker 1:          00:32:59       So I don't know. At this point, I think when I would do is I would maybe just back off, I would just go forward, uh, treating him like one of the leaders and expect him to perform as you expect your leaders to perform. I think you've made the effort. It didn't really work and now you have a job to do and you got to get on with it. There's also, um, you know, the world doesn't revolve around his pouting in his being native and, and you, you can't let that happen. Now on top of that, this guy is a powder and he's a negative guy. That's probably the reason he didn't get selected to be promoted. What we talked about earlier, the boss saw that he saw something along the way where things didn't go his way and he and he pouted and it was negative and that's why he didn't get promoted.

Speaker 1:          00:33:44       Meanwhile, the guy that did get promoted when things didn't go his way, he's like, okay cool. Well we'll drive on with what the new plan is and that's why he got promoted. So I would say, move on, do your job, treat him like you would treat one of your leaders. I had be very careful that you don't correct cause you hear me say like, okay, I'm gonna treat him normal and now all of a sudden you're treating him like crap. Don't do that. But treat him as firmly and as fairly as you would any one of your subordinate leaders. And we have to see where it goes from there. He may end up just not being able to deal with this fact. I mean there's, there's a reason why some people get promoted in, some people don't. And maybe he's one of these people that can't humble himself, which is one of our biggest fears in somebody that's trying to be a leader is that they can't humble themselves. And if that's what's going on, he's going to have a long, hard road. And you know who's fault it is going to be never his never going to be his fault. It's everyone else's fault. And, and that's, that'll be problematic.

Speaker 5:          00:34:48       Yes. Tough one right there. Yeah. Because in his mind straight up that like, you're condescending. You don't deserve it. I deserve it. You know, and now you're [inaudible] irrigates yeah, he's already lacking humility. Was this one time in football, in junior varsity football and we're suiting up to play game. Right. And my bra jade, he was, he's really good. So he, you know, you know how you have that one guy, especially junior varsity, you have the one guy who makes the majority of the touchdowns. Jade was that guy. So we're suiting up and one of our team guys on the team, he was, he was that guy right there. He was, he wasn't, the thing is, but he wasn't very value. He wasn't very athletic. You, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       um, and they kind of played the same position. Judas Rhinebeck, back, he was a running back to, I think this goes a full back though. I don't know. I forget. Um, anyways, so he goes, he goes to jail. Well, time to show off again. Yeah. Holy Cow. So you imagine the mindset, it's the same. That guy probably has the same kind of mindset. Absolutely. So it's like, man, it's like you can't, even if you are doing the right things, how you said, like saying everything all cool in his ears, it sounds different. It sounds different showing off again. Yup. So, so sometimes when someone isn't going to hear your words correctly, sometimes it's best not to say it miss times, just keep the mouth shut. And you ever been in an argument with someone, but you're completely trying to deescalate it. And every single thing you said is getting taken the wrong way.

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       Be Quiet. Listen, nod your head anyway. You know like you're, you're not gonna, you're not going to convince someone, you're not going to get through to them. They're too emotional. This guy's too negative and yeah, everything you say is going to be heard differently and not in a positive way. Yeah, yeah. Currently called opportunity cost of addressing it is just next question. I'm often given tasks on the fly whereas many of my tasks are given as a result of meetings these days and increasing number are coming from emails or my manager or client asking me to do something. I find myself quite disorganized when dealing with this. I'm writing things down when I'm told, but it's all over the place. Postits notebook phone. It's such a, I don't have a solid method of keeping track of these things. I'm guessing that a possible solution is to write all these things down in the same place, but I've also tried that and didn't really make a difference.

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       I'd appreciate any input or advice you have on how to record and track objectives in a functional, in a reliable manner. As I'm subjected to a lot of information each day, week, month, I'm definitely overloaded to remember it myself. Discipline equals freedom, so yeah, a few things. First, first of all definitely write the things down in one place and it sounds like since you're moving all the time or you're going to meetings carrier, just a nice little notebook with you and write the things down as you get tasked with them. Then on top of that you have to have a master list of some kind, either paper or digital. I'm going to probably recommend digital to track things overall in a prioritized method. So if you get tasked something in a meeting and your little notebook, you come back, you put it in the right place in the master task list and then like twice a day to consolidate the information that's in the little notebook you have into the big master list and then before you go to bed at night, you organize those things by priority on the master list. Do you put the most important thing at the top and that's what you're going to attack the next day?

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       That's part one. And how you get these things organized. Now the part two is you got to schedule this stuff, and actually I always say this, when people have trouble with tasks, put them on the calendar. You don't actually Jamie does that for me. When Jamie's got something for me to do, she just doesn't email me and say, hey, you need to do this. And she puts it on the calendar. So I look at my calendar, boom, there it is. I got to go do this. Whatever this task is done. So put these things on your calendar and that includes scheduling time on your calendar so that you can have time to consolidate your list and do a review of your lists. You know whether that takes that probably take 15 minutes to do and I guess there's a bunch of apps you can use and I'm sure people will make recommendations, but there's a ton of to do list apps including there's one, there's native ones on all the different phones, so you could look at that as a possible of voice recorder. You can either use the voice recorder app you have or you can carry around a little mini voice recorder. Then you can just take notes with that and then you consolidate those notes from your, from Your Voice Recorder into your master task list every day. And then you just got to prioritize and execute to it pretty straight forward.

Speaker 5:          00:39:54       Write the stuff down and put a little bump. I was, I was put little boxes in front of everything. Do you understand? Like when I have a task I put a little box so you can check. I can check it. Yeah. Yeah, it makes bro. You're obviously compared to me a master at that. Like all that is like, Dang, you can do all that bro. I'm, I'm on the flight just like this guy, this person straight up, like on the fly in new stuff comes up. Same bold. Be surprised at how much more you could get done if you actually made a list of things you were supposed to do. How's this? How's this? I make lists and I still try and turn and nail it down. Right. I'll make a list. I even, okay, so I have a book that Jamie gave me by the way, a book a to do list book and then I help you is trying to encourage good habits and then I have my phone and then I have this, oh and then have just the regular thing on the paper and then I do this thing where I'll open word and have it on my side screen and I'll put the list there for the day.

Speaker 5:          00:40:58       It'll just be upstairs at their my face and strangely that has proven to be the best one because I'm doing, I'm in here. I see my mistake right now that I'm telling you this, I put it on on the book that Jamie gave me, write my to do list. I put it there and then consolidate your list. It's on that book. There's one on the, on the phone, which is different now by the way, your master list, there's some apps

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       that may, so it doesn't matter if you put it in your phone, if you put it in your computer, I mean obviously you've, it's if it's on paper you need to transpose it into digital format. But there's, there's things that too. Yeah, you need to consolidate a list here, have master list of things

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       that you're trying to do and then I need to attach myself as far as the routine goes to look at that list. You know all like that's why you schedule it, which is what I just said. That's why you put it on your schedule. Hey, every day when I sit down for lunch and we would do a five minute review of my lesson, make sure I'm on track. That gives you the afternoon to catch up on anything you might've missed and just get rid of my other list. Cause half of it is me trying different methods out there, right in the middle of carrying out one other meth he at all. So it's always a bad thing about trying different, trying to combine a bunch of different methods, what you're doing when you do that as you're looking for the easiest way. And I'll tell you the funniest, clearest example of that.

Speaker 3:          00:42:15       When Dean first started fighting and he was going through his various stages of trying to figure out how to cut weight, and he already cut weight cut white in high school as a wrestler. So he knew how to cut weight. But what happened is people would come along and say, hey, there's this trick. I use that trick and there's this trick and there's that trick. And he would try these other all these little tricks out and you would try them, you know, at the same time. And that's exactly what you can guess what you don't when you try all these different, because what you're really doing is you're looking for that something that sounds easy. Cool. Yep. I'll do that. It was the, you know, for Dina was like, oh, I'll go on the Epson salt bath and the hot tub. And then it was, oh, you know, and I'll drink just distilled water for x amount of days and it was all these, which all of these things are viable, right?

Speaker 3:          00:43:03       We know that there are viable options, but there's, you have to use them in conjunction to have to be, you have to, you can't just like pull the pull whatever little piece you want and think you're going to be good to go. No, you've got to do, you've got to follow the system, take one and go with it kind of thing and what you're trying to do is you're looking for things that sound the easiest and that's what you're trying to do. The easy path, the easy path over here, but meanwhile you've got three different paths all effective. Meanwhile you're jumping from one path to the others. That's exactly what I'm doing with my to do lists. I would like for to do lists. Okay. You needed to do list that says consolidate all of your to do list. That's step number one. Then I got to remember that.

Speaker 3:          00:43:48       That's the list that I'm checking. Then I got to remember to check it because you know how you, cause you always have that to do list in your brain. You always do. You know you're like, oh I've got that thing. By the way it's on my mind. One in my brain is real solid. What? Like the the the to do list in my brain is really, really solid. Like I know what I have to do. The only the, the things I have to write down are things that are outside of this. Outside the, the, the parameters of daily situations. Like let's say there's some admin thing that only comes up. Well if it comes out super rarely I'll remember it. But if it's an admin thing that comes up once every quarter, yeah, I probably won't remember that. It's not, it's not so far outside that I'll remember and it's not in the routine so I don't remember it. So I got to write

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       that thing now. That's what's on my list. So do you write down the list that's in your head? On the, on the, on the written list, I'll write down the things that I know are

Speaker 2:          00:44:42       are

Speaker 1:          00:44:43       subject to being forgotten because the other things I don't forget them. Yeah, so you're just, I don't forget the hard core like company. If I have a, let's say I'm going on a trip of a con, like if I'm going on a regular trip, I'm going to go to company that I work with and they're in Atlanta and I'm going to fly out there for three days. I don't even, I don't even have to think about that. Everything that I do is, is the the work I'm doing, the prep I'm doing, everything I do is this standard. It's a standard operating procedure. Even that, even the things I'm going to bring with me, it's the same. I went on a one day trip to Vegas the other day, like in and out. I didn't even stay the night and I had the same suitcase that I take when I go on a five day trip.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       Like it doesn't matter to me. I'm not changing any standard operating procedures. I got there and they said, aren't you leaving today? I said, yeah. He said, why did you bring a suitcase? This is how I, this is how I travel. This is the standard operating procedure for me. I'm not deviating from it whether I'm going for one day, but like a nine hour trip to Vegas or a five day trip to Atlanta. Guess what? It doesn't matter. I'm carrying the same thing cause that's what I do. So if it's something like that, I don't need to, don't even need things. Some things don't make my list because they're already in my head of my list in my head is solid. It's things that are outside the bounds of the standard operating procedures. Those are things that'll make the list and that makes sense for this question.

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       It's kind of this question cause he's getting stuff on the fly. It's getting stuff on the fly. He's got a piece, got write this stuff down. Yeah. I think, yeah, I think we're all kind of the same way in that way where you're going to have one, two, maybe three things on your mind that no way I'm going to forget this, you know, kind of thing. But man, those lists though, you get to really to choose one path and stick with it and then remember it. That's the thing. I think that's my problem. I know that.

Speaker 2:          00:46:28       Next question.

Speaker 1:          00:46:32       How did you deal with losses in Jujitsu, Jujitsu day today? Losses look assuming in a tournament, right? I just had my first tournament and got the floor wiped with me. Yeah. Welcome to Jujitsu. The obvious thing is you got beat. Good. You learned, I think we may wave wedding, we've gone through that one. And then really, you know, how did you get beat? What areas where you're weak in? Then you analyze and improve in those areas. And that's Jujitsu, right? Don't dwell in in, don't dwell in your loss, but learn from it and move forward. And actually speaking of Dave Burke, I was talking to Dave Burke and he was explaining to me his psychological current status in Jujitsu. So He's, however he's, he's basically my age. I'm 40 might be 45 or something like that. But he's been basically a master of kind of everything he's done.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       And you know what I mean? I mean, he's like, like factually, if you look at his life, he's been top gun top gun instructor. He was telling me that during Operation Southern Watch, which was pre you know, post first Gulf War pre nine 11 he was the, he was one of the very, very, very few guys that actually dropped a live bomb. And you know, back in the day when no one had any experience, he was a guy that had really, really done it and, and then he was talking on top gun instructor it, you know, you're just, and then after 35 f 22 just all that stuff that he's done and he was, he was telling me that like if he thinks about it, he gets a little bit bummed out because he's just starting Jujitsu right now. Obviously it's in his head and he's thinking, oh, I'm never going to reach the highest level that I should or could if I had started younger.

Speaker 1:          00:48:47       And so he, if he, it's almost like if he thinks about that too much, it's almost like all that, I'm just not going to do it. You know what I mean? But depending, he immediately was like, of course I know that I'm going to do it and I'm going to be as good as I can. But you know that that's, that's also the way life is. Right? Just like when you, how do you deal with losing in life? You learn from your mistakes, you move on, you don't, well, it's the same thing as you did to, you study your weaknesses, you figure out what you can do, you fix those problems, you move forward. Don't dwell on it

Speaker 5:          00:49:19       fast. That's it. Yeah. Got Beat. Good. Yeah. Actually put it into perspective even more. We're okay. So this is just an assumption. I know I just had my first tournament. I'm assuming white belt, maybe blue belt. Okay. I'm assuming. Yup. You know, it just doesn't seem like at Brown belt or something, you just turn this question or you're not in your first tournament typically. But I mean you never know, but you wouldn't even have this in your mind where it's like, how do you deal with loss? You, you won't have that in your mind as a brown belt. Like, you know, it's a little bit more clear anyway, so unless you, this is like scarred you for life. I lost and I'll never compete ever again kind of thing. Um, I think this is, this is a good way to think of it where, you know how it's like, I dunno your first girlfriend and like junior high or something dumped you.

Speaker 5:          00:50:13       Like, at the time it seems like, Dang, I got dumped or whatever. And then when you're an adult you're like, oh my gosh, same thing, Jujitsu. So like when you're a white belt and you lost your fridge, you know, as a white belt and you're, you know, I dunno, a blue belt, pro, belt belt, black belt, whatever. And you're thinking about your first tournament. You're like, oh my gosh, who cares? It doesn't matter at all. And really when you kind of put into perspective, unless you want to dedicate your life to competing, the tournament's don't really mean anything. It's just fun. And if you take the fun out of it by putting everything on that one tournament that you're currently doing, probably you won't, won't want to do it. And you'll kind of think that that's kind of what competing is about. It's not. So if you're, if you lose your first tournament, my first match and my first tournament, I lost.

Speaker 5:          00:50:59       I didn't get the floor wiped with me, but I, that's a common thing. Yeah. You think back on it. And not only do you, well, I think you'll always remember the first one, but, um, as far as like, whether you want or lost, it doesn't matter at all. Totally doesn't matter at all. And you'll find that the more you compete, the less it'll matter. And then do you get to competition? Really? Unless you're like really dedicating your life to being a good competitor. Um, Jujitsu competitions, you're gonna win some and you're going to learn. You do some yes. And you learn. And Learn, oh my gosh, that doesn't work if I don't time it correctly, or Dang, that doesn't work because that's not a real submission. I only do it to smaller guys and they tapped because it's uncomfortable kind of thing. But in [inaudible] it doesn't, you learn these kinds of things, you know, but it's not even gonna matter.

Speaker 5:          00:51:46       Like dealing with the loss. It's not even going to be a factor because you just got to know that's just part of it. And really, who cares when you're kind of just starting out. You know, like if you ask like a top level black belt competitor, you know, did you win? Ask coiler. Okay. Coiler right. He tells the story about him in her hoists and went into their first competition there. Dad said, if you win, I'll give you 10 bucks. If you lose, I'll give you 20 so it takes the pressure off. Like it's not that big of a deal. You know, if you lose, boom, you know, it's all good. That's what that was for. And heuler loss hoist one boiler loss. He got the 20 bucks and he's like, sure I would've, you know, had heuler one of the greatest legendary guys lost his first one, puts it in perspective.

Speaker 5:          00:52:40       It doesn't matter at all and got $200 you're not always going to get the 20 bucks, but just say it, I'm, yeah, it doesn't matter. It won't matter. And you're going to think the same thing like high school, like the stuff that happened in high school. When it happens, it seems like it's a big deal, but then when you're an adult you're like, ah, this is an adult. Cool. It's a cool memory, but you know, could have been better. Anyway, next question. Hello, Mr Willing. I'm currently deployed to Iraq as an east six in the army. I have listened to your podcast and really enjoy your stuff. Especially different discipline equals freedom. I know as a sergeant and as a leader, your focus isn't to be liked. However your soldiers should respect you, respect both you and your rank. My question is how

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       do you tell your soldiers to do the small stuff? Tedious stuff like taking out the trash and still be like, all right, well first of all, if we want to get respect from people, we have to give them respect for sure. Thinking about this, think if you took out the trash sometime you don't think if you're the, you're the boss, but you see that the trash is getting overfilled and you just grab it and take it out. Yeah. There's thinking about what that does is thinking about what that does, the attitude of the guys, if you took out the trash, you, you maybe in your mind, do you think you'd be losing respect, but you actually wouldn't be at all. In fact, everyone looks at you and goes, oh, he's a good guy. He's taking out the trash. It was little full then he's taken care of it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       So maybe if you're insecure, you'd think you'd lose respect. But I think if you're secure in your ability to lead and if you know that doing some tedious stuff is going to make you guys appreciate you than to me that means it's kind of worth it. Right. Um, another example, you know, we talked about taking out the trash, but like what if the platoon space has to be cleaned? And on Friday you, you just say, hey guys, you guys can go ahead and roll out. I got this right. There's a chance. They're like, hey boss, we're not leaving. Where are we know will help you there. There's of course there's a chance they'd be like, oh, that's awesome. Thanks boss. And they bail over time. That might be if they don't respect you at all, they might bail. Now in order to regain the respect, do you make them stay in Boston around more?

Speaker 1:          00:55:06       Does that increase the respect for you? You see, you see how interesting it is, is that if you go, hey guys, that's cool, I'll do it. And you're working hard and you still got to maintain the discipline and you don't take any slack. But at the, it's the same balance. It's the balance we talk about all the time. So the more that you treat them with respect to more, they're gonna respect you and they're going to know that you're not, you know, too high and mighty. Yeah. They're going to know that you're down to earth. When I was a platoon commander, tasking to commander, I picked up brass, I cleaned the ranges with the boys. That's just the way I operated. And I would recommend that kind of attitude. It didn't make people think, oh, Jockos doesn't have anything better to do that actually knew I had stuff to do.

Speaker 1:          00:55:59       But what am I going to do? Pick up brass with the boys. Build the relationships, set the example they're gonna respect you for it. Makes Sense. At the end of the day, do you have something better to do? Right? Cause the whole, in the big picture, it's like how you say like that's a leader. Sometimes you literally have something literally been no, no. Like sometimes you literally pay, the boys were up brass and guess what? You got a meeting with the commanding officer, you gotta go, do you? You know, sometimes we, you actually do. And what's cool is tactically is, and you heard us say this at the, uh, FTX and were up in Utah, if you see the leader doing something menial, what you should do as a sub, as a follower, step up and say, hey, echo, I got this. You can go and lead. That's what, that's what you want. That's what I want to do for my leader. I want to take things off my leader's plate as much as possible. Now the more you try and you just have to build those relationships, the way we build those, if you don't have anything better to do, then you get down there and do you help you help clean up the, do you help pick up the brass? Yeah. That's the way it is.

Speaker 5:          00:57:08       Notice that about you and Lafe too, where you know, like I'll have my camera equipment and you know, lights or whatever and it's not a bunch of stuff, but you know, you're always like, oh, you'll like grab something and you don't like it when I grab your camera. Don't touch it, don't touch it. But, and when it's just me and you, it's kind of like cool cause we're just kind of friends or whatever. There's no perceived or no like hierarchy kind of thing. Like you're, you know, but let's say like at the muster, whatever, it's obvious like you guys have a specific job. I have a specific job, you know, kind of thing. And meanwhile you and, and life will, like if I'm around, I'm carrying something that you'll always like grab something or, or say, hey, you need, you know, you didn't though at the Utah thing, he's like, oh, are you good? I'm like, Bro, you're the instructor here kind of thing. That's what I'm thinking in my head. And um, and yeah, you guys always offered to like help. Really? Interesting. I'm like almost offended. Like Bro, like do I look like I need help because you shouldn't really be asking me, you mean for

Speaker 1:          00:58:09       apple? But there were bright, very capable individual. Yeah. And the small tedious stuff. And the other thing is you explained to why it's important, right? Yeah. About to answer. We give all the time. Why is it important? Why is it important that the platoon huts clean? Well, cause I want you guys to have time off over the weekends and not be stuck here cleaning. Cause the commanding officer came in and saw that this place look like a hell hole. Okay, well that makes sense to us. We understand why you want us to clean now you want us to clean so that we can have time off. You want us to clean or you want us to train hard? Do you want us to do this? Cause cause we want to be ready for combat because I want you guys to be able to come home to your families. Make sure they understand why they're doing what they're doing. And if there's no reason why, if the reason, I mean even cleaning, even taking out the trash, there's a reason for that. Right? There's an actual reason for that. We can't just have junk everywhere. So explain why participate when you can build the relationships with your troops, you'll be good. Yeah, that works by the way. Thanks for your service and brother, I hope you're having a good time over in Iraq, getting after it. Second that for sure

Speaker 5:          00:59:23       that works for kids big time explaining why you do it. And if you really want to dial in, the effectiveness is make that reason somehow tie it to their interests, their direct interest. Cause sometimes kids can't see the big picture. You know, like if I say you got to clean your room and you know, otherwise your room be messy and then maybe you know, um, later in life you might be comfortable with a messy room, might get in the way of your effectiveness at a little four or five year olds. They're not gonna understand that. And they'll be like, cool, that sounds like terrible, but they won't feel it. But if you tie it into their like direct interest as a four or five year old or however old the kid is, it works really

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       good. What if you don't clean your room and there's a fire and I come in here to get you, but I trip and fall down and then you die. That's one way. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:19       Yeah, for sure. All right. Yeah. I don't know if I'd say that, but it's cool. Good time for one more here. Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       Jocko. In war, the enemy is clear, but in life, in business, not so easy to identify any tips?

Speaker 2:          01:00:42       Well, um,

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       I mean, first of all, that is not a true statement.

Speaker 1:          01:00:50       And in, in war, the enemy is not always clear, not at all. The enemy, the enemy can be hard to identify, very hard to identify the enemy's gonna use camouflage to conceal themselves. They're going to use deception to, to distract your attention. They're going to blend in with the friendly civilian populace, and they're going to take advantage of your benevolence, right? In fact, the enemy is going to do absolutely everything in its power to obscure their position, to hide their purpose, to even mask their identity. So it is not easy to identify the enemy in combat in war. So what you have to do is you have to control what you can control, right? You gotta be prepared. You've got to train, you've got to study, you've got to rehearse. You've got to remain vigilant. You've got to maintain discipline in everything you do so that when the enemy does reveal itself, you have the ability to out think it, to out maneuver, to fight the enemy. And it's actually the same thing in business, right? The enemy can be hard to identify. Your competitors aren't broadcasting their next move,

Speaker 2:          01:02:22       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:02:23       You don't know what the market's going to do. You can't be certain about the next trend or the next down turn to the next bubble that's gonna burst. You can't know those things. So you have to do the same thing. You have to control what you can control,

Speaker 2:          01:02:36       which is you

Speaker 1:          01:02:38       gathering intelligence. You've got to analyze the metrics that you can track. You got to train yourself and your team to be prepared for both the known and also be prepared for the unknown. Figure out what the likely contingencies are. Then have some plans to execute if those contingencies occur. Maintain discipline as an organization so that you have the flexibility and the responsiveness to maneuver effectively and efficiently when the unpredictable actually happens. So instead of suffering and falling apart in the chaos, you can take advantage of it and when

Speaker 2:          01:03:26       and

Speaker 1:          01:03:27       that's business and life is the same. The enemy is not always clear in life. It can be hard to tell who's going to try and bring you now or what is going to bring you down. There's distractions. There are things out there that will do you harm, that are so camouflaged. You can't see them at all. There are deceitful people. There are accidents that can occur and diseases that take root and there's bad luck. And there's Murphy's law and there's times when it seems that the whole world is against you. The whole world

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       is the enemy

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       and the same rules apply. Control what you can't control. You train hard, learn, maintain the unmitigated daily discipline in all things. Train hard physically and mentally. Push yourself so hard that you become accustomed to the stress you get used to it every day. Make yourself stronger and faster and smarter and better so that when the enemy does finally climb out of the shadows and expose himself to you, you are ready. You are waiting and you can relish in the tunity

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       to attack and fight an orderly decimate and destroy him.

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:05:29       And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So Echo, maybe you could,

Speaker 2:          01:05:42       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:05:42       Help us figure out how we can support ourselves and perhaps be better prepared for the enemy yeah. Of whichever kind and whenever it exposes itself so that we can smash it. And if you want to do that, you can also do that while simultaneously supporting this podcast. They want to of course, or we could just have a bunch of advertisers on here, listen to us talk about stuff that, sure. Yeah, yeah. Either way. Hey, I'm here to do one of the things I was talking to. Uh, actually that's, that's true. That where, you know how, you know, you say that a lot and it's easy, especially me. I go, what do I say? A lot like, be ready, you know? Yeah. You know, um, you know, prepare you stronger, faster, smarter, and you don't like a lot of things after a while, you hear it like enough.

Speaker 3:          01:06:41       A lot of times, a lot of times, a lot of times, sometimes it clicks, but then every once in a while you'll, it'll like leave a mark. No, no, no, no. The opposite. Sorry. The opposite. Like, um, okay. You know? Yeah, I get it. I get it, I get it, I get it. And Blah Blah, blah, blah. The next kind of, yeah. And these things, like when you really think about that one, like we, there was a saying, I don't know, I'm sure it's not new. When I heard it was like chance favors the prepared man. Is that the correct fortune? Favors the brave.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:07:13       Wait, wait, what are you looking for? That, that quote is like basically some chance. Favorite though. The one that I heard it was chance favors the prepared man. Yeah, for sure. So it's all, it's all the same variations of that one. I went straight to the fortune favors the bold or brave. Yeah. Prepared. Right. So if you're scared, you know you're going to seem to have more luck with victory and all this other stuff. Right. So it's like, you know, in any circumstance, like if you take working out working that as like the easy one because like if you're in shape or you're, you're strong or if you're not weak or if you're not incapable, you know, like you don't work out so your backs out or something like that or compare it with being strong, being strong is always more beneficial in pretty much every single situation is them being weak. Yes. True. Or being in shape, you know, being healthy, being zero, order, being smarter. Yeah. Yeah. You hesitated, but that's, it's always good to be strong and occasionally it's good gum. No, not saying there's not one of the, it's, it's one of those

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       things where where are, where the result of working out and being strong is always going to add a tangible benefit to most of this. Pretty much everything you do in your life. That about being smarter. I'm not saying that I'm not just going to jump into, yes, that's true too, because I didn't think about it. I thought about this. Let's see. There you go. Well, nonetheless. But I think that's one of those things where we kind of, it's my opinion that what you just said there is, should be taken to heart hundred percent concur. Yeah. Not just some cool thing like let's face it. That sounded good. That sounded cool. But in there I don't, I don't listen to it cause I'm saying, yeah, I thought it sounded dope, but it's absolutely true. And you know, and there's little micro struggles, you know, in life. Let's face it.

Speaker 5:          01:09:07       I know you have some of my clothes, all my struggles or my, but guess what? No problem. You know, no factor, no factor. I was filling up jugs and I used this example. I'm going to do it again. You know why? Cause it's it, every time I fill up jugs I think about this, the struggle is real water jugs. They're like, well, 40 pounds, right? I think like seven pounds. I think it's an eight pounds per gallon. Seven. Okay, so they're five gallons each. Yeah. Okay. That's, you know, but no problem. You know, if can do it. No, I don't need a cart. Take care of him. You know kind of thing. Do you carry just one in each arm yelling, any Chan it see what it is. See what I'm saying? They'll see how you're like, that's nothing. That's nothing. But for a lot of people who don't work out and I was like that, that's not nothing.

Speaker 5:          01:09:57       It's something nonetheless. I'm just saying like if you're prepared. Okay, so tell us how we got bless struggles. Yeah. Okay, so first thing you do is maintain, maintain your, your, what do you call it? Your, your, your structure. Foundational structure. Foundational structure. Make sure you're not breaking down, starting with your joints. As always, say chocolate has some supplements. Krill oil and glucosomine can Drayton supplements, Jocko, Super Krill Krill oil and what's called joint warfare, chocolate joint warfare. That's Glucosomine conjoint and some other good stuff for your joints. It's funny. The other stuff is actually really beneficial. So go to origin main.com and read so that you can realize the benefits that you're getting because it's good for you. Yeah, and I'll go beyond just good for you. It's the kind where, and I'm saying this firsthand, firsthand account. My account before you take this, you're going to have joint pain.

Speaker 5:          01:11:10       And even if nonfactor joint pain, I was talking to Dave Burke the other day, Dave Burke's popular tonight. Yeah. So Dave Burke asked me about Krill oil just in general. He's like, well, I don't have joint pain. Like most of the workouts and Martin workouts, they do see the, and that's the thing. So I was like, I was kind of like that too, where I didn't know and I don't want to be the guy who's like, no, you do have this problem. And they're like, Bro, I don't have this run. No, no, you do and you need this product. You know, I don't, I'm not, I didn't want to be that guy and you want to come off like that guy. So I'm like, yeah, you'll save coming off like that for the podcast.

Speaker 5:          01:11:48       No, he made a good point. If you don't have like joint pain or whatever, um, then yeah, you won't have the exact experience I did because I did have joint pain and I joined p and in places that I didn't kind of realize it. You just feel like, oh, don't Dang, I'm still better. That's your baseline. You get used to the pain on top of the fact that it had pain that I didn't, I, that I knew it wasn't normal, you know, just more stiff now that I'm getting older or whatever. But nonetheless, I was like, Dude, look an old I think, how do I look cool? You know, it's my birthday in two days, by the way. Anyway.

Speaker 5:          01:12:29       Sure. You could not have joint pain, but the, even before I had like any kind of pain from working out or whatever, from joint or in my joints or whatever, I should have started taking it before that I should have. And I'm not saying people will take it or what. I'm not saying that necessarily. Um, so Dave's question to me was, should I start taking it? I said yes. Yeah, hundred percent. It's good advice, but I did have to let them know if you legitimately or not having joint pain, don't think that it's going to be a miracle thing. Like it felt like for me, that's the point. Nonetheless, it's the best stuff because it's from Jocko, right? Yeah. Well it's the best stuff cause it's the best stuff it happens to be, happens to be. Anyway, go to origin main.com for this super krill oil and Jocko joint warfare on the tops is labs.

Speaker 5:          01:13:23       I always see that it's on the front too, so it's real obvious. Just go there or [inaudible] dot com there's also some geese if you're still wondering about what gay to get. Don't wonder anymore. Straight up. Yeah. And there's actually, there's actually no comparison to be quite honest with you. There's no comparison. Every other g is not made here in America with American hands. American material. Yeah. So there's no compare. You can't compare. Can you literally can't compare. There's no comparison. And I don't want to turn this into like, you know, putting down any other geeky company. So I'm not necessarily going to do that. But let's face it, in certain manufacturing industries, I guess brands, a lot of brands, they go, they all go to the same stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:14:21       Plier in Pakistan, they are aware of the things come from the same place. Yeah. And that's why I said there's actually no comparison. Yeah. And it's not just no comparison cause it's made in America. It's no comparison because it's been designed from the ground up by people that do Jujitsu. Yes. By people that do Jujitsu on the daily at origin, the factory. Then you know what the next building is, the origin training facility. So it's like, it's like we're going to put on our gies and train and then we're going to do, make sure that it's squared away from, by the way, it's not like, oh well we want it to look like this and we'll just have to use some random material. We'll design the material, design the weave of the material so that it's optimum for Jujitsu and that's what will make and sell. So there is no comparison. Yeah. And he was like no one else doing anything close to that. Yeah. The closest would be, hey we're, we're making it. Look, we're putting a color to it or putting a patch somewhere or you know, that's the closest you could do to say, and we're doing something like this. Yeah. No one is designing from the ground up from the material up from the threads themselves. Yeah. The typical scenario, by the way, it's not just the geese, the rash guards, same thing. Yeah. The material created by origin.

Speaker 5:          01:15:43       Yeah. Yeah. The typical scenario is you get, you know, hey, I'm been to, and you'd be surprised man. Even these like kind of established brands like it doesn't matter which ones, whatever. But there'll be like, hey, yeah, let's do you know, let's make this g, oh by the way, let's get the same blanks that we use. Is everybody always been getting and that everyone else and let's just put a cool stitch on there or something or patch or, or design doesn't just the way it typically works. Not even necessarily that there's anything wrong with it. Cause if you like you eat like your gay. That's good. That's how I am. But yeah, the origin, once you kind of put it on, I will argue that you're, you're going to kind of understand my opinion on the last or do you mean.com that's the one, that's the good one. Also for legit fitness gear. Go to on it.com/jocko good kettle bells on there. They got some star wars Kettlewell's. That's cool. Yeah. See that's the thing, man. You don't really care that much about these, these cool kettle bells. I do. Nice about it. I do. I think they're dope nonetheless. Um, yeah, kettlebells on there. I got into kettlebells awhile ago. Very glad I did. Wish I had done it earlier.

Speaker 1:          01:16:58       Did I get you into kettlebells? Yeah, I got you into Krill oil and kettlebells. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:17:03       Okay. Give it up. But both. Yeah, both. Not necessarily. Not actively. I got you in the metcons to make cons. Yeah. You used to not do metcons. I remember you sent me a text sometime like what was like, what's the deal with this, this metabolic conditioning? He said, what should I do and I just sent you in there. All of a sudden you started doing metcons and your cardio on the Mat got a lot better quick too, by the way. Metcons metcons with kettlebells and Krill oil. Ooh. That Combo right there. Anyway, and there's a lot of cool other exercise stuff on there like creek kind of create more creative stuff. Um, you know, keep your workouts interesting. That is on at.com/chocolate checkout. Some stuff on there. They got some really good stuff. Really good stuff. I'd use [inaudible] smart with that where he's always like pushing like the good stuff, you know.

Speaker 5:          01:17:53       You know also Jack was a store. It's called Jocko store. Jacqueline's store.com. It has, if you want to get these shirts that we make and we have been to make their good shirts do, they're not like free shirts. You know the free ones that you like. Cool. And you never wear it. It's not that kind of very wearable. I made it a point to make. I'm like good. You know, it's the women's stuff on their rash. Guards, patches, hoodies. I know it's getting colder now. Places they're thicker. Hoodies does it called Nicola? You right now it is actually. It is. It's like 60 there's no other topical. Why you right? No, not quite. It's a big island. Yeah. Dang it. Monica. I just revealed my, not everyone knows Hawaiian. That's all right, but you're coming to me. That's a man. I might have to suspend your my co E-card for a little while. They'll have to now anyway. We've got some hoodies for people who are in places other than Hawaii or if you're on Mauna Kea, thicker hoodies, all this stuff. Anyway, I'm not saying buy stuff. I'm saying [inaudible] check it out. If you'd like something, get something. It's a good way to support. Also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes and stitcher and Google play. However you listen to the podcast who's subscribed seems obvious. I know, but if you haven't subscribed, good way to support. Also on Youtube we have a youtube channel.

Speaker 5:          01:19:22       There is various reasons to subscribe to Youtube, but the main one I think main two is if you'd like the video version of this podcast and you like little excerpts, whether we put some music behind them. When I say we, I mean me, it's a music guy, them and some various effects or not. There's excerpts, you know, little shorter than the whole version of the podcast and you can share him, listen to him or whatever. Let quicker anyway, subscribe to Youtube. This is what I'm saying, if you want, and if you do want to and you do, it's a good way to support also psychological warfare. If you didn't know what that is. It's an album on iTunes that you can get with tracks

Speaker 5:          01:20:09       that on your campaign against weakness on the path, trying to get in better shape. You're trying to get in shape. You want to maintain your sheet, you want to what? Wake up earlier. And you covered it too. No, no, no, no. These are the, I'm saying, you know, but here's the thing. It's like, well it could cause, okay, so it seems obvious, right? You're trying to get in shape. You're going to have hard days, you know, days where you're like, I'm going to skip the workout. Right? No, it seems obvious. That's an element of life on the path that's, it seems obvious. You'll run into like points of weakness that's obvious and I dig it and there's a track for that. Chocolate tells you why you shouldn't do that. You just listened to it. Boom. Get it right back on track. But I don't always do. What I don't always talk about is that this tracks for other things like the creativity thing, like if you got like a procrastination situation. How's Allen?

Speaker 5:          01:21:07       The reason you're looking at me like this is because you already know this, but not everybody knows this. You're procrastinating me finishing this podcast and no, no, no. We are finishing this podcast strong with boatloads of value because I'm lazy. I'm letting people know this is what it is. Say psychological warfare. It's an album with tracks on iTunes, MP3, Google play, Amazon music. If you're going to run into some issues, it'll help you out and get into those issues. Next topic. Yeah, Eh, I guess I could have said it like that. That's more of like the Jocko way to say it. You know, like I don't, I feel like if I come from a place of, you know, authentic relation to the struggle, I feel like it'll, it'll, it'll pass the message in a more accurate way I think. Okay. You don't skip workouts. True.

Speaker 5:          01:22:07       You do. You okay, here's this. How's this? Do you ever sit in your gym, sit on the bench or whatever, or the bike and be like, man, if I am make deals with yourself. Hey, if I skip today, I'll just do a double. I'll do is like, if I'm doing something that's going to suck like squats. Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll put, I'll procrastinate. I'm in the gym like it's gonna happen. Okay. But I'll like, okay, let me just start talking. But it's, it's one of those things like the outcome is known. Yeah. Yeah. The outcome is not in question. The workout will happen. I'm just being a complete baby about it. Okay. So then I just have to suck it up. Yeah. So see, that's why you're looking at me like that because me and a lot of people like me, we're not like that. We're trying to be like that. We want to be like that. I know. I do. I want

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       to be like skipping the workout is straight up a non, not an option ever. I want to, I, that's a total wine. I want to be like that. You won't let it happen, but there are times and have been times where I'm sitting there. There's been times I drove to the gym before I got my own show, drove to the gym, sad in there. It was like, look, if I just walk right out of here right now, he's skipped this workout I need. I need Rick. I'm not going to get a good workout anyway. Oh, you know what? I'll just come back in on Saturday. That was my active rest. I'll come back in and I'll get it. Then today will be my rest day. Right. I'm like that. Some other people were like that. You're not like that. That's why you don't understand. You know what I'm doing right now with, I'm shuffling my papers, being passive aggressive. I know it's very unlike you, but you know, hey man, so good. Nonetheless, psychological warfare. I'm trying to make the make disappointed. This is a for real point.

Speaker 2:          01:24:00       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:24:00       Valuable point is the track that Jocko.

Speaker 2:          01:24:04       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:24:04       Hi Nick. Even though he tried to talk me out of explaining this to you right now. God, he will talk you out to out of effectively talk you out of skipping the word, skipping the workout, talk you out of pressing the snooze or whatever. All these little points of weakness gone there. Just if you look at them, you'll see all the little points of weakness that you, that these tracks address. It's good. Very effective. Cool. Are we done with that section? Very good way to port podcasts too. All alright. Jocko white tea. You can get that on Amazon. It will guaranteed a hundred percent double blind placebo, a placebo tested triple, triple blind. Uh, you can deadlift 8,000 lbs. So you might want to pick that up on Amazon. You can read them. If you don't believe me, that's fine. Go read the, go read the reviews on Amazon where every verified purchase is like they're dead lifting minimum 8,000 pounds. Books. Got Some books way the warrior kid. If you have a kid or you know, a kid did help a kid,

Speaker 2:          01:25:03       okay.

Speaker 3:          01:25:03       Help them be a better person to have a better life. Get in the way of the warrior kid. Extreme ownership. The new edition is out and you all helped write it because it has questions from this podcast. Also, the new forward, also the color pictures, lame didn't want them but made up for that by just making the cover black because black and that book has all the fundamental principles of combat leadership. It's for you and your team do you don't need to hide it. Remember in the beginning people would want it, they'd get it and they'd want to key up for themselves. They want to hide the knowledge because they want to look. They want that. Don't do that. It doesn't help. The more people know it, the more people on board, the better it's going to work. Also from an individual perspective, to get yourself on the path, there's a book called discipline equals freedom field manual. It's available everywhere.

Speaker 2:          01:26:00       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:26:00       and you might be wondering if it would make a good

Speaker 1:          01:26:03       gift. Well, not only is it heavy, have you noticed how heavy it is? It's a heavy book. It's a big book. It's a substantial book. It's completely unique because it has black pages and the outside of the pages are also black to work of art for sure. So get some copies for the people that you know because beyond blue looking really cool, there is no better gift than discipline. So I get some copies and also if you want the audio version, see now look, I'm doing the same thing you just did but let's watch how long this takes. If you want the audio version of discipline equals freedom field manual, you can get it on iTunes, Amazon music, Google play and other MP3 platforms period. Right there. Now everyone knows what you took 15 minutes to explain if you were in further need of more fire support in terms of basic leadership.

Speaker 2:          01:27:10       Okay.
