Speaker 1:          00:00          Two of my bosses have told me, I don't like Jocko.

Speaker 2:          00:04          Interesting, interesting concept.

Speaker 1:          00:07          Without giving any value, valid reasons. Their ego is in the way. How do I flank them to help them see the path? My belief is that they're afraid of the truth and they, they're afraid of the truth they see in extreme ownership.

Speaker 3:          00:24          Okay. So, uh, yeah, I mean, clearly ego could be a problem here as a leader who wants to constantly be compared to some other leader. Right. Do you know if you were teaching a Jujitsu class, it's like, well, the way that, the way that Dean teaches this, you know, that that would make you mad afterwards. I didn't even think so. That could be part of the problem. Oh, that's dead. That's definitely, that's way up there on the list of possible things. Could be the military flavor, right? Some people don't like the military flavor thing, so that's, that's okay.

Speaker 2:          00:52          It's, it's

Speaker 3:          00:55          can turn some people off. They don't want to hear about it. That's fine. Uh, the reality is here's the, but here's the reality of the situation. Okay. What is there to not like about the things that I talk about. Right? So let's say, you know what, I don't like people taking ownership. I want everyone to make excuses and playing each other, right. It doesn't even, it doesn't even make sense, you know, instead of, I don't want to hear about this cover move, I want everyone to ignore each other and get worried about themselves. Right. Like that, that makes no sense whatsoever. You know, if a key keeping things simple, I don't want it, hey look, I don't want to keep things simple. I want everything to be so complicated, but no one knows what's going on. Right? Like these things that they make, no, there's no human being. No one in a leadership position that would want everyone or that would, that would go against what these simple principles. So.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Huh? Do

Speaker 3:          01:53          you fix it then? What's the problem? Uh, one, here's a couple, and actually this was a Twitter thing and a bunch of people gave great responses on Twitter after I kind of highlighted it. Uh, one, one of them and my, my actual responses like, hey, just don't, you know, stop using my name. You know, stop saying, well chocolates it cause you can't even imagine how annoying that most. Well, Jack was June. You know, when you're in a leadership position, you know, it's like, that's going to really great on somebody so, so, so throw that out the window. Don't pit it as me, Jocko against what your bosses are saying. No, don't do that. You've set up an adversarial relationship with them and you've set up or an adver adversary relationship with me. And I've never even met these people before. I don't even know who they are, even know what business they're in.

Speaker 3:          02:38          But what you've done by constantly harping on it is you've pissed them off and now they're saying, dude, quit talking about Jocko. We don't care. Because also the way that he's just, the way he's being offensive in approaching these things means that he has a little more listening and growing to do. Because if you really want to approach your boss or you know, he asked about frank as possible. The way fight someone isn't going, hey, the way jock was says you should do this. Like no, that's not good. So let the principals work and another, another person pointed out, you know, um, hey, don't, hey, stop trying to impose your things on them. Like take extreme ownership. How's that sound? You step up and start leading. You do your thing, you perform well. Quit talking. Quit trying to force these things down people's throats and give them space.

Speaker 3:          03:25          Give them room and then they'll recognize that you're doing a good job. If you label it with something that you know they don't like, well then they're going not going to like it. No matter what you do, no matter what you do, that's going to be problematic. Don't bludgeon them with with, well, you know I've, this is blah, blah, blah. No, don't do that. Take let but your ego in check. How's that sound for your ego in check a little bit. Make the ideas that you're talking about their ideas. Get them to talk about ownership, you know, get them. Maybe they call it something else other than extreme ownership. Maybe they call it, you know, a personal accountability. Okay, awesome. That's great. Yeah, I really liked that. I really like what you've come up with, boss. I'm in with. Oh well now they're in the game and they don't realize that you're talking about the same thing.

Speaker 3:          04:16          That's fine. Don't they? Don't ever have to realize that. They don't ever have to realize that. So I mean, there's some people are some people that don't like it. Even in the teams, there's people that like, they didn't like me, didn't matter. It didn't matter where, what the principal was, didn't make dog. That's the dog. It's like, no, like, hey, just, just, just don't, don't attach my name to it and go and do to be a good leader. How's that? So those are some things I think if you live, live, the principles, act on the principles. No one's going to be mad at you for taking ownership and responsibility of what you're doing unless you say, Ooh, you look how I took ownership of that. Well then you might paint yourself into a corner where they ain't stupid.
