Speaker 1:          00:00          And you know, this, this last question, it's not really a question. What would it look? I get a lot of awesome emails and I get emails from people that have completely turned their lives around. They've, they've lost weight. If they needed to lose weight or they've gained weight because they needed to gain weight or they've gotten promoted or they've become a better parent or they become a better spouse or they become a better kid. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:33          yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34          And I get emails from people that have quit their addictions or they've, or they've overcome their fear and I say, what? I get letters and packages and notes about all this kind of stuff. Then it's awesome. I get, I get people send me books for the podcast and pictures and drawings and, and, and military memorabilia or unit patches and coins from police departments and fire departments and, and military units. It's just, it's awesome. And, and I, um, I'm so thankful for all that feedback and it, it drives me bad feedback that I get, drives me to work hard and keep pushing to do this to the best of my ability and try and get better at it. But you know, I, I hear from people that have used the podcast and the discipline and the, the, the mindset of looking at things that are problematic as being good. I hear from people that have used those things to overcome, you know, dark patches yeah. In their lives. No, whether it's depression or anxiety or even like full fledged despair. And again, when you hear from people that are turned that corner, that's just incredibly rewarding

Speaker 1:          02:25          to know that there's, you know, there's people out there that are really changing for the better and turning their lives from negative to positive. It's unbelievably rewarding. But I also get some other emails and I get some other messages from people that haven't been able to dig out of that hole to overcome that, that despair. I hear from people sometimes that fuel Vitters nowhere, nowhere else to go. There's no way out. And they don't have any more options and they are considering taking the only way out that they can see. And that is they want to take their own life.

Speaker 2:          03:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:42          And to anybody out there that's in that place,

Speaker 2:          03:54          you know,

Speaker 1:          03:57          I don't really know what exactly to tell you, but I can kind of tell you what I think. I think. No, I think, no, I think don't save that last bullet for yourself. Don't save it for yourself. You lock and load that last bullet and you shoot it at your enemy. And when you're out of bullets, get out your knife and attack with that. And if you lose your knife, grab your enemy by the fruit and you keep fighting and you keep fighting and you keep fighting and you keep fighting no matter what. And you never quit. Never, never

Speaker 2:          05:10          quit.

Speaker 1:          05:14          And if you feel like your wife isn't a place where you can't get any lower and you don't think you can find any way out,

Speaker 2:          05:28          good

Speaker 1:          05:32          cause that means the ultimate challenge is ahead of you. It means you can only go up. And it also means that things are going to be tough. Things are going to be tougher than anything you can imagine, but that storm you're in from, from your perspective, it seems like that storm is enveloping the whole world, but I'm telling you, it is not the storm that urine. It is hard to see out of that storm. It's hard to see past it. It seems like the storm, it seems like the storm is everything, but the storm is not everything Andy alone last forever. You can get out of the storm and you will get out of the storm, and when you get out, you're going to see this sauna.

Speaker 2:          07:02          Okay,

Speaker 1:          07:07          but right now you're being tried. You're being forge. You're being tested by fire and by pain. That's the test. Don't fail the test. Don't fail the test. Don't give in. Don't quit.

Speaker 2:          07:43          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:45          Don't ever quit. Fight on fight through the storm. Fight through the pain and come out the other side. Stronger and tougher

Speaker 2:          08:02          and better. A fighter,

Speaker 1:          08:13          a survivor,

Speaker 2:          08:17          oh, winner.

Speaker 1:          08:24          Victorious and free from that storm. Free from the darkness.

Speaker 2:          08:46          Free.
