Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 33 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. People say there is a line, there's a line between good and evil, right and wrong between light and dark. And that's a nice clean way to think of things. But the line can be hard to recognize. It can get blurry, it can get twisted by emotion and passion and by one's own ego, they in war, that line is tested, it's pressed, it becomes even more blurry. It gets crossed and violated and sometimes abandoned. Or we can see that throughout history and we've talked about it here in the Japanese slave camps in Rwanda, it me lie, those are a few examples, but there are thousands of them,

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       And obscene the line. And I've seen men approach the line driven field with fury and with hate. And that fury needs an outlet. And if it gets a purchase, it can become unstoppable. But it can also be controlled,

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:02:05       Because there is a counter to all that evil,

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       There is the man that steps up and says, no, no, not today, not here, not now. We will not do that.

Speaker 2:          00:02:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       And the dichotomy of leadership and that they caught him. He of war is so hard to balance. Soldiers are trained and to have asked to kill and yet they are also trained to be humane and fair and moral and good [inaudible]. So how does a warrior reconcile those opposing forces? That dichotomy. How does he know to balance

Speaker 1:          00:03:16       God damn faults rush through my mind is I tried to decide what to do. Women, old men and kids, obviously non combatants but this is a free fire zone. They are not supposed to be civilians in this area. Yeah, but dinks occasionally ignore those warnings about free fire areas. Maybe they're the point element for Vietcong or Nva traveling behind them. Maybe they're supposed to give the warning if stopped. It's happened before. In that case, some of my men could come under fire and be killed or wounded for six killed that one dink last evening and he had a Thompson, there was a whole squad of Kong in that group. There was some incoming fire when we made the Elz a dink, try to cost cross the dyke last night. These people look innocent enough. They may be carrying supplies for the Kong in the area, food and or Ammo. It's a free fire zone. Everyone is supposed to be considered enemy. I'm responsible for my men. They'll get killed if I make the wrong decision. These dinks coming toward us mean nothing to me. My men mean everything. What if the dinks aren't innocent? My men depend on me to keep them alive.

Speaker 1:          00:04:37       I spoke softly to the men around me. It's a lick on them. When I give the order open fire, I brought up the [inaudible] to site in on the dinks. SPAG was standing to my right, his m 60 machine gun support it on his hip by a sling around his neck and shoulder. He reached over and touched my arm. His whispered voice reflected the agony of doubt in his face. No Sir, you can't kids, women. He motioned toward the file of people coming towards us. I felt ashamed. SPAG was right. Wait one I whispered to the men around me, I'll call for them to surrender. I felt relieved capturing them. What's the best solution? If they were the point for a VC group, I would just make sure none of us was exposed to fire. When we captured this point, the dinks, we're almost to the intersection.

Speaker 1:          00:05:38       I stepped through the brush with some of my men dung. Louis don't. Louis, I warned they were only 10 to 20 meters from us. They all glanced at us standing with our weapons, trained on them. We had them dead to rights. They had no cover on no place to run to a perfect capture situation. Almost in mid. They all moved with astonishing speed. The two boys in the point split up. The one ran past us heading down the trail, pass the school house, the other boy, the woman, the old men started running back towards the bridge. Stop. Stop. Don't like Deloitte. I yelled to no avail. I could not order them, the men to run after them. It could be a trap. Neither could I let them get away. Why were they running in the split? Second, those thoughts ran across my consciousness. I gave the order to open fire and irrevocable wave of death swept in front of us. After the initial burst of gunfire, I yelled, cease fire.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       The two women survive long enough to cross the bridge and enter one of the hooches. Three of my men crossed over the bridge and threw grenades and the hutches. We heard lead looked over the bodies on the trail since they were lying in the open and we had no desire to be caught exposed. The men reported that some of the dead had been carrying hand grenades in their ammo and ammo packs. I felt somewhat relieved. Those supplies could have been for, could not have been for anyone but the Kong I received report from the squad down the trail. The firing had alerted them barely fast enough to fire at the teenager running toward them down the trail. Someone hit him in the shoulder and knocked him down. Surprisingly, the boy had jumped up and run past the squad to safety somewhere in the brush. I had no pleasure in reporting to Delta six that we had killed six dinks and one wounded.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       I knew who you would ask how many happened weapons we had captured. I stared at the gray horizon for a long time before answering that. The dinks, we're not carrying weapons, only supplies and grenades. I felt low this putrid war. I thought of so many ways I could have done it differently, so easy to think afterward. After all, now I knew there was no dink squad behind on the trail. This episode would be the darkest of my career. I called my men together for a march up the slight hill to Delta six his position forcing the dinks out of my mind.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       Now that's from a book that we're looking at tonight. It's called the killing zone, my life and the Vietnam War by Frederick downs. Now Vietnam, it was a hard war, obviously a wretched whore for many reasons, and the mee Lai massacre is almost the apex, almost the pinnacle. It almost seems like the essence of the war in many respects. At least it's viewed that way and it did have a huge strategic impact. It was devastating to the war effort and something that should always be remembered is that tactical operations can have strategic impact. Like Hackworth said, the mee Lai massacre probably did more to end the war and he snored departure from Vietnam. Then anything are communist enemy did

Speaker 3:          00:09:08       okay

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       in in a similar vein in the war I was in, in the mistreatment of the prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and the photographs that showed that mistreatment likely did more to fuel the insurgency in that country than anything al Qaeda did.

Speaker 3:          00:09:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       Tactical actions can have strategic impact and that actually happens in business too. One bad customer experience for a customer that's got some reach and there can really be a strategic impact and what the front line troops do really does matter and what the frontline troops do is based on how they are led. Clearly in me lie, there was a total lack of leadership, especially from the moral and an ethical perspective, but this was not the norm, not by any stretch and, and like I said, it's viewed sometimes as the representation of what the Vietnam War was like, but it's not an, and I said this when we talked about me lie, yeah, America has done monstrous things in our history, but we most certainly are not monstrous. We are an amazingly benevolent nation, especially now perhaps even to our own detriment, but that's why I wanted to talk about this book, the killing zone to show the challenges, the Vietnam War and how American troops handled those challenges and pressures on a day to day basis and how they sometimes cross that line if only for a moment, but then most of the time brought themselves back from the brink of darkness into the light.

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       Now let's go back to the book here.

Speaker 3:          00:11:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       Going to the beginning when Fred downs young lieutenant in the army is flying into Vietnam at 2130 hours. The continental big bird with a golden tail DCA dropped through the night sky into the landing pattern over the black landscape of Vietnam. 23 hours earlier, 165 of us had been crammed a board, the commercial jet at the airport near San Francisco. I looked around the cabin at the officer and enlisted at the officers and enlisted men who'd come from all over the United States to catch his flight from San Francisco. How would they return? How would I return? I had graduated six months earlier from the U S Army to ocs program at Fort Benning, Georgia, and now I would seem to be leading men into combat. I was 23 years old and I had been trained to lead physically. I thought I was ready. Mentally. I was as confident of myself as any young officer could be, but underneath my confidence where the ever present questions, worry and curiosity about war and my role in it, I was eagerly looking forward to finding answers.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       I would not have to wait long. So we've talked about that before. When you're stepping into a leadership role, you're not going to get, if there's a good chance, you're not going to feel a hundred percent confident. And that's okay. So he gets to Vietnam, he gets assigned to a fourth division and he actually, he hadn't heard of fourth division, he hadn't seen it in the papers. And he kind of is asking, hey, why, why, why haven't I see that in the papers? What are they doing? And he said, there's no reporters up there where they're working. It's too rough for him. And he's kind of saying, you know, I want to get, I want to make sure I get it on. And in some of the old timers are telling them, one of them says, you'll get a belly full of fighting up there, son, if that's what you want.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       So it's one of those, be careful what you wish for scenarios. And uh, I thought this was pretty, pretty interesting. You know, we talk about Hackworth and the hardcore rock condos as the salute and reply. The reply is no fucking slack. So here's what they had here. It was sop to solute in the fee and the company area, but not in the field. When enlisted man saluted, he would say Golden Dragon, sir. The officer would return the salute with right of the line. I asked about this. They told me that in that the first, the 14th that's the, that's the division. He's with the first. The 14th was an old infantry regiment steeped in tradition. During the boxer rebellion in China, the unit had fought bravely. Afterward they adopted the symbol of a golden dragon. The other part of the solute came from some, some battle in the civil war right before large battle, a staff officer asked a general where to put the first to the 14th the general had roared back, put them to the right of the line where they belong. The right of the line is where a leader traditionally puts his best men in units. This comes down through military history. When a man fought with the shield and sword, the right arm or sword arm was unprotected. The best fighter was put the right to protect the sword arm of the man on his left. Only the most trusted and best fighters held the position to the right.

Speaker 3:          00:15:03       Legit.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       So he's there in the, in kind of in the, in the uh, headquarters area for a little while and then he gets his indoctrination and then gets flown out. He's flies out into the field into where he's going to be operating out of. He gets up there, and this is, this is straight out of a movie right here. Bug swarmed around my face. I squatted and looked at the men who looked right back at me. It was my first view of American Gis who had spent several days in the jungle. I stood there and sparkling, crisp, fatigues, brand new boots, new rifle, clean shaven, fresh haircut. I even smelled clean. My helmet, camouflage cover didn't have a mark on it, nor did I. The two men opposite me were filthy. They're fatigues or torn and they had scratches all over their skin. Two or three days of growth on their beard and dark circles under their eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:16:02       They look tired and they smelled the high heavens. So that's, that's right out of a movie. The boot lieutenant coming in to take over, he's in his pressed Cam, he's looking all squared away and these guys look like they're living in hell. And they introduce the, the company commander and this guy you're going to see throughout the book, this guy captain cells was an ROTC officer, 26 years old, son of the son of a father killed in Korea. So that's, you know, the guy's dad got killed in Korea and he's there during the Vietnam War. He's joining up and leading men at a comedy is a company commander. And if you remember from, from the book platoon leader where you remember, he didn't even meet the company commander. So his direct boss didn't even meet him for weeks. He'd been in the field for weeks before I even met him.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       And here's this, this company commander obviously much more squared away, walks him around, introduces into, everybody's given him a heads up, you know, this is the way it's supposed to be. And you know, he's getting told, look, there's any me all around. And you might've heard in that intro piece that I read, I was talking about Delta six and, and here's a little piece about that. He informed me that his radio signal was delta six. So that's the Delta company commanders, Delta Six, Lieutenant Smart, the first platoon leader was delta one six. The second platoon leader was Delta two six six is where the commanders of the unit. And this is a tradition that holds true in the, in the army and the Marine Corps today. And it's pretty cool when you're, when you're in the field, you'd hear someone call for the six and, and that means that we want to talk to the guy that's in charge out there.

Speaker 1:          00:17:37       Their seconds, a command. We're known as fives. For instance, Delta one five was the first platoon sergeant. And this is a, you know, goes on to talk a little bit more about captain cells, who's asking him about his family. He's getting to know him and he's, you know, uh, uh, down's had, I had a wife and two little girls back in Illinois. And so again, you're getting, the impression that sells is a guy that's trying to get to know his people when they learn about them, which is, which is the way a leader, what a leader should be doing.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       Now these guys are out and he's talking again. This is, this is something straight out of a straight out of a movie, darkness quickly and Gulf to us. My hooch. May Ch watched an astonishment as I pulled out mosquito netting and spread it over my poncho liner and air mattress. They were aghast that I carried so much extra weight. No, I answered. This is all the good stuff. That amazement grew as I revealed three changes of underwear and fatigue. Close. Wait until the next day they scoffed when the sun is sun and heavy pack will drag me down. The jungle would exact a toll for every ounce I carried. We'll see. I answered.

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       Not a good answer. Lieutenant Smart said. Yeah. You'll see. You'll see that the only change of clothes your carriers and be an extra pair of socks, you'll learn to live in one set of jungle fatigues until they rot off you or grip to badly to where that's that. That actually reminds me when we were in, uh, my, my first deployment to Iraq, we, uh, we had three sets of cammies and just warm rotated them in Ramadi that the op tempo was so high and the conditions of fighting we had to order new cammies. We then within a couple of weeks of being there, guys had destroyed Caymus can run across the street. They're getting, you know, dragging people and they were just ruining their, their cammies. So that was another indicator in Ramadi that we were in a totally different scenario than I was on my first deployment to Iraq.

Speaker 1:          00:19:37       Back to the book. My first days on combat control, combat patrol introduced me to the vicissitudes of war, 10 foot deep Punji pits. Wait a minute, vines at collected around the feet and legs until the combined strength stopped you. And you had to say, wait a minute while you untangled or cut yourself loose. The Hot Sun beating down on us, on us as we marched around with 70 pound packs, the sweat pouring office, the bugs, so stick our faces that around our faces that we sometimes inhaled them of and the physical agony of forcing tired muscles to keep going. It was a search and destroy mission, which meant we searched all the hooches we found and then burn them down whether a single farmers, hooch or a whole village, all were burnt. The few Vietnamese we found in the area where women, children, old men who had been left behind, when we started to burn their particular hooch, they would start wailing, crying, and pulling in our clothes. We didn't harm the people, but the orders were to destroy all the dwellings. So we did. The first time I saw a Vietnamese family go into hysterics when their hooch was set on fire, I was unsure of whether burning their home would accomplish our mission. The mission was to deny the enemy use of the hooches to destroy any food we found had to teach. The people a lesson about supporting the enemy. But I quickly got used to it and accepted that this was one way to win the war.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       And that's, you know, a few. If you talk to anybody, anybody knowledgeable about true counterinsurgency, this is not a great plan to go in and basically abuse the populous. Now, if you know that they're supporting the, the insurgence, sure you want to, you want to disrupt that. But oftentimes they're not this, they're not supporting the insurgents because they want to, they're there supporting the insurgents because their fear for their lives. That's the way it was in Iraq when, when I was there. So back to the book, Sheldon brand took the opportunity later that day to explain in the, in this unit, everyone called the enemy and ultimately all outsiders dinks. So that's their word that they use. And I found this interesting. He says, ultimately all outsiders, and you've reverbed me and eve or lay from, in the book we talk about Moose. That's what we call it, the enemy, we'd call it the enemy MOOC.

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       But what's interesting is here it says all outsiders and that's exactly what we do. If when we were getting resistance from, you know, up the chain of command down the chain of command, guess what we call them Moosh we'd say all the boss is saying this or can't believe that Mooc. So it became the word that we use to every, to all outsiders and that's, that's the unit cohesion and there's some dehumanization of the enemy there obviously, but the fact that you ended up using the same slang word to describe anybody that's against you is, is is interesting. Back to the book, it turned out that the enemy started calling us dinks first because it was an insulting or demeaning term that meant hairy man from the jungle. We had just turned the word around and started calling them dinks. At least that was the story. I don't know if that's true or not. I never, never read it, didn't do any research on that one.

Speaker 1:          00:22:50       I saw the face of the enemy for the first time. He'd been machine gun down by one of our gun crews. The powerful weapon and throwing a hail of bullets into the brush where we had spotted him. When we got to his position, I saw for the first time the death of a soldier. The machine gun crew had done a good job. The young soldiers, green combat uniform body was riddled with bullets. He was sprawled across his bicycle with his face toward the sky. At last, I had before me, the enemy I had been trained to destroy. He was a young man for whom the war and life had ended. One evening, a jet was returning to base and needed a target to get rid of his unexpended bomb load. The captain called the forward air controller and gave them the coordinates of a sniper 300 meters away who had been pestering us off and on for three days. As the jet pulled up after dropping napalm on the snipers position, we could hear the pop pop of the sniper firing at the jet. The men talked about the of that sniper. As I watched the napalm burned itself out. I wondered what would drive a man to stand up to death and so remarkable a manner.

Speaker 2:          00:23:57       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       gain. You're dealing with a hardened enemy. You're getting napalm dropped on your position and as you burned to death, you're trying to shoot down a jet fighter.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       Back to the book, Sheldon brand was worth his weight in gold to me in running that platoon, he even introduced me to the platoon motto. It's a lick. A lick is a lick on a young man's ass lieutenant. You remember when you were a kid and you did something wrong or something got fucked up that you got the blame for the old man would give you a licon with a switch or a belt. Yeah, I sure remember getting lickings well, when something goes wrong, it's a lick on you. You see anything that goes wrong, I'll give you a lick and over here you'll get plenty of licks. My RTO was, or the other most important man to the platoon. His job was to carry the radio and stick to me like a shadow. The radio was our link with literally everything outside our platoon from supplies to survival without a working radio.

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       When a good Rto, opportune leader and the platoon were as good as lost in this war. My RTO man, a skinny kid, five feet, 11 inches tall, was next to perfect for his job. He loved to know what's going on. And his job was a kin to the central switchboard operators. So that's the RTO. That's what that was actually when I was an enlisted seal. That's what I was. So I was a, I always had that same attitude. When you're there, when you're the Rto, you always know what's going on cause the, the officer's telling you, you're right next to him. You're listening to what he's saying. So you always know what's going on. And that was a real good education for me. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:25:35       Grown my whole career. Always be next to the, to the guy that was running in the platoon. Talk a little bit about the troops here. My squad leaders were first squad Delk, a tall cowboy type from Wyoming, second squad porter. I light a slightly built black from east Saint Louis, third squad, Jose, a skinny, short, sparkly Puerto Rican fourth squad, Gallagher, a medium built redhead from New England states. And of course there was the platoon medic doc, but platoon makeup was whites, blacks, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Americans and an Indian and a Japanese American. All of them from 18 to 21 years old in a combat platoon. We were evaluated by our peers on our ability to help the platoon survive and not on our racial backgrounds. A combat platoon pulled together and was tight with each other, with no room for the soldier who wouldn't do is share. So I, you know, it's always good to just point that out.

Speaker 1:          00:26:30       These are just people for this, a cross section of America and these, these are pretty stereotypical, right at cowboy from Wyoming. It, you know, this is, this is stereotypical stuff and that's, that's one thing that the military, so when I joined, I grew up in New England, right when I joined the navy and I got to California and I went to the enlisted man's Club on any B Corp Natto. The gator gardens back in the day, I was 18 years old, 19 years old. And I showed up, you know, cause there's a club, it's a club on base, right? And so I go, oh, I'm going to go there. People are saying, hey, we're going to go to the club. So I go, okay, well let's go see what's going on there. So I walk over to the club and as I'm kind of standing outside, I see two guys walk by with, with jeans on, with cowboy boots, with big belt buckles and cowboy hats and like a wrangler shirt.

Speaker 1:          00:27:25       And I was kind of thinking to myself, oh that, that's there. Is there some kind of, is it Halloween is the, these guys get dressed up for something. And again, this is pre internet man. I mean, and, and, and then I see a couple more guys go by and it turned out it was country Western night, but at the club, at the club. But I had never seen a person in, you know, I come from a small town in, in Connecticut and there's, there's, there's just no cowboys up there. I mean, interestingly there's farms and there's people that raise cattle and there's people that grow. You don't have have farms, but they don't have cowboy boots and they don't wear cowboy hats. And so it's just, that's what I, that's what I was thinking about when I read this is just how you take all these different people from all over the place. They had no idea. You have no idea what other people are like. And again, this is pre internet. You know, when I joined the navy, we didn't get to Google. We didn't watch it. Youtube videos because you, you're exposed to the entire planet and, and galaxy through youtube.

Speaker 3:          00:28:28       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:28:31       First Time you saw a real cowboy. How it is. I thought, I thought they were, I thought they were dressed up. I thought they were dressed up. Yeah, it's crazy. It is kinda crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:28:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:28:45       And then, you know, I ended up, I mean the, in, in tea, you bruiser we had all kinds of guys from Texas and there's all kinds of cowboys down in Texas. Uh, but like Graham and Chris, Chris Kyle was like a legit whatever Rodeo dude in Lafe later cowboy place and absolute cowboy. Yeah, absolutely. I mean there's all kinds of cowboys in there. Yeah. So all right. Now we were going to advance a little bit and it's the first time that that Downes is actually in charge. Um, he did a little turnover with the, with the form of platoon commander. He takes charge of a platoon and he's doing security for the bridges for some bridges that are out kind of away from the main camp. And they're out there to prevent landmines and gathering Intel and kind of set up a checkpoint. And, and they're, they're, they're, they're actually staying out there.

Speaker 1:          00:29:37       So they would, they would set up by these bridges and as they're getting set up for the first time, I'm going to the book and explosion, rip the air behind me, followed immediately by a scream. My body instinctively through my, through itself, against the sandbags is my mind shouted, mortar attack, my eyes registered the scene of men frozen in shocked Wunderman, their eyes staring behind me. Man was directly in front of me and the track man, we're off in the background crouching where they, where they were when the explosions went off. So they're actually out there with some tracked vehicles quickly turning around my eyes swept and awful catastrophe. One of the claymores had gone off shattering for over the lives of the three men in front of it. Jesus Christ was in a mortar. No one of our claymores went off. Get those men quick.

Speaker 1:          00:30:26       No, no wait, there's another claim or out there. What the fuck? Set it off. What about the other one? So imagine this, you, you get to a position and you want to put out claymore mines. And if you don't know what a claymore mine is, it's a, it's a directional blasting mine that you set off by command detonation. So you have a little, a little thing that you squeeze and when you squeeze this thing, it sends an electrical charge down the wire into the claim or detonates a blasting cap, the claim or explodes and everything in front of it's going to die. Well, they had set up the claymores and then they were going to put some barbed wire out and as they were putting the Barb wire out, there was a storm, electrical storm, you know, thunderstorm and the static electricity in the air actually set off the claymore so it killed or it, it did some serious damage back to the book.

Speaker 1:          00:31:21       Only a few seconds had passed. Since the explosion, one of my men and I dashed to the other claim or frantically fumbling, unscrewing the plug and holding the bast and crap, throwing it away from the claymore. Then I rushed back to the radio. Two men were applying first aid. The other positions were covered by the men assigned to them. They had stayed in place during the action. Good training. I fought as I fumbled with my map. It was folded into plastic radio bag. All of us used to carry maps in Delta six this is one six over one six this is delta six over. This is one six I need dust off. There's been an accident resulting in three peanuts over. We tried to say nothing over the radio that could be understood by the enemy. Thus, we used code words for certain things. A koolaid was a dead soldier and a peanut was a wounded soldier.

Speaker 1:          00:32:03       This is Delta six what the hell happened over? This is one six static electricity in the air, set off a claim while three trackman. We're putting out barbed wire over. This is Delta Sex. What's your position over now? What would he ask me that for? I was on the bridge heat assigned to me. Let's see, we're here. So I read writing up real easy, just like all the training. So he's looking at his maps, trying to figure out where he is. Of course, that was my first responsibility where men had been hurt, so maybe that accounted for what happened next in spite of training. Lieutenant, Lieutenant, you've got to get a dust off out here quick. This man's got a bad head wound. Said one soldier, as they brought the wounded over to me, dirty black clouds of lightning crashing around, added the confusion as the wind howled over from all directions, huge range drops.

Speaker 1:          00:32:47       Started to spatter down. This is one six. I'm at coordinates to nine eight zero two eight over. I read them out. This is Delta six. Are you sure of that over? This is one six. Uh, let's see. Yeah, it's, that's it. All right there. One, six. You better check that again. According to what you gave me. You're in the south China Sea over. Oh, did he sound mad? God Damn. I've done this a million times. The thought ran through my mind is a sweat broke out. The wounded were groaning. The storm was reaching gigantic proportions and the track sergeant was demanding to know where that fuck that dust off was. Concentrate Fred, concentrate. I said to myself while staring at the meaningless blob of colors, worlds and numbers, so he's looking at his map. It's just trying to figure it out. Suddenly everything jelled and perfect clarity. Delta six is one. Six. You're right. My coordinates are two eight eight zero two eight. I need to dust off fast over one six. This is Delta six. I know where you are. I just wanted to see if you could figure it out. I already called the dust off.

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       So captain cells this, that's who he was talking to. Captains cells. That's a, that's Delta six, the commander of the company. And even in this pressure situation, he's trying to make sure that the guy is thinking he's in opportunity to think for the first time under pressure. And he already called the dust off, but he's still putting the test to him and seeing how he operates under that kind of stress and pressure. Another uh, following situation there, they're kind of sitting in this location and they see a woman start to start to approach where they had some, some equipment and she was looked like she was going to steal some stuff and you know, was kind of no big deal. Okay, she's gonna Steal. So whatever, some ponchos or something, well then they see her, what she picks up as a case of grenades and they're thinking, wait a second, now this is just got really bad because if she was stealing a Poncho, okay, no big deal.

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       But if she's stealing grenades, that's stuff that's going to be used to come back and kill them. But again, because we have a guy with a, with a conscience, you know, a guy that sees where the line of darkness is and he doesn't want to cross it. So instead of just shooting her, which she could have done, he loads a magazine of tracer rounds into his, into his weapon, and he starts shooting them around her kind of warning shots and then eventually start shooting. He's a good shot. He starts shooting at the little rope that holds the case that she's holding on to. He starts shooting at that rope, shoots out at like five or six times, finally hits the rope, kind, Kinda hits her hand. She drops it, she runs off again, just trying to show the discretion that this guy's using as a real contrast to the meal. I episode.

Speaker 1:          00:35:35       Now. Speaking of that, the little later on they roll up some prisoners. One is an old man and one is a young man and this old gray haired sergeant starts going after him to, they got these two prisoners. They're captured and here's the sergeant, so you're the fuckers that Zap my buddies in the tank. The old grey hair sergeant snarled without warning, he swung a heavy fist in the face of the old man knocking him down. The other fist swung into the face. The younger man knocking them down beside the old man. The sergeant was screaming and bellowing as he pummeled the two men on the sand. They rolled into balls for protection, but we're hampered by their tied hands. I ran from the road yelling my two men to pull the sergeant off the prisoners. They grabbed him by his soldiers as he fought them to get back to the Vietnamese.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       He lashed out with his foot at the prisoners, catching one of them in the side. What the hell are you doing, sergeant? Those men are my prisoners. I exclaimed, his face was red with fury. As he yelled back at me, you had no right to take those stinking Kong prisoners. He smelled of beer that he had drunk. You should have killed those motherfuckers like they killed that other tank crew. Fuck, these men are tied up. We don't know who they are. I yelled back, I was saved by the sound of lieutenant nut. Can Knutson's voice breaking over the argument? Calm down, sergeant, go back to your tent. So that was the other lieutenant was the commander of the tanks. Again, I'm pointing this out. He's new in country. He sees somebody beaten up a prisoner. They had just lost a one of the tanks to a mine earlier and obviously the gray haired sergeants pissed and he wants to take it out on these guys.

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       But you know, calmer, cooler heads prevailed in that situation. Now speaking of minds minds back to the book, mind continue to be laid in the road at irregular intervals. It was a fact of life. But the terror of an explosion never failed to send a shiver through our guts. No matter how many times we heard them, whatever we were doing, our heads would jerk around. It was terrifying to hear the explosion. See the ugly gray and black crowd cloud is it ripped into the year. See dark pieces of metal, canvas machinery and human beings flying in the blossom of death out from the center of destruction and this one big mine happens and he's going to check it out. It hits truck, hits a vehicle. I approached the twisted wreck. It was very disheartening to see the smoking rec, which had once been the carrier of human beings.

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       There were with smoke drifting upward from the HOLC. As we approach closer, we saw parts of the driver's body mangled beyond recognition in the cab and on the ground. That main portion of the driver was only recognizable because we knew that was what it was supposed to be. My men ran toward the still living, being huddled in the rice patty mewling over and over that his leg was gone. The scene of desolation brought about the impact of the Vietnam War. To me. There was no enemy to fire at. There was no nothing to retaliate against at a distance. The traffic of vehicles and Vietnamese watched.

Speaker 2:          00:38:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       All that remained was the messy job of cleaning up while thinking that this could happen to us. A small part of her mind tried to retain it's sanity by reminding yourself over and over that it would never happen to us. It can happen to everyone else, but it would not happen to me. With that in mind, we started scraping up what was left preparing it for the plastic body bag.

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       Now eventually they, they go from guarding the bridges to where they start doing patrols out in the jungle and ambush is out in the jungle and direct action missions out in the jungle and at this point they're out in the jungle and I'll go to the book. My platoon and I had not shaved for three or four days. Delta six was a bear about shaving combat patrol or not. Just because we live like animals didn't mean we had to look like them. Who was his way of thinking? Throwing my fatigue jacket across a Bush. I grabbed my shaving gear and told spag and visa nor to accompany me. We would guard each other as we shaved. So the company commanders coming out and there unshaven and they're like, okay, we gotta shave real quick. But again, you can see that captain cells has a real influence.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       Any, you can see that that discipline, it carries over. And when you let it slack and, but then you go visit your troops and they'd have to get back in line. It brings him back to humanity. It makes, it reminds them that thing. Cause think about it, that shaving is something you do in the military every single day. So when all of a sudden you're out in the field, you start losing that, you start slipping away from that and things start. Other things start slipping away as well. Hmm. They get into a, they get into some firefights out there and at one point he gets wounded and I'm going to the book. After homes had finished bandaging my arm, I put on my fatigue jacket and lit a cigarette. I felt good. I'd only been in country a few months and I had my second purple heart. The first one had been from a wound received an October to top it off.

Speaker 1:          00:41:10       I had been wounded twice in one day, shot in the ear in the morning and hit with a grenade, shrapnel in the afternoon. Luck was with me. All three wounds had been slight. Now you can say luck when you get shot in the ear and you are lucky for sure, but that's, that's a real, that's a real eyeopener indicating that you realize how close you were to dine and I had guys get shot in the helmet and and they didn't like it one bit because that's real close. Someone got real close to getting you now going forward more. There's a, there's a battle going on and the companies out in the field and they're not directly involved in the battle so they get told, okay you, we want you to go set up where the, where we think the, the VC is going to run to where we think they're going to run.

Speaker 1:          00:42:06       You guys set up a blocking force so that way when the VC runs into, you ambush them and take them out. So they're kind of maneuvering to go set that up. His platoon is maneuvering to set that up and we'll go to the book. After 15 minutes or so, we were approximately halfway down the ridge. The captain gave me a call. Dragon six had decided it would be better if I have to my platoon marching the two elements in opposite directions in order to cover a larger area. I was dead set against this. My platoon was below strength and dividing. It would be asking to reinforce rifle squads or defend hundreds of acres of jungle against a foe of unknown size. So dragon six is above the company commander. This is now the battalion commander. And so now you're getting an order from the battalion commander. So it's, you know, you're a young lieutenant platoon commander and you're getting told to do this and he doesn't feel good about it back to the book.

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       But orders were orders, especially from dragon six I pass back the ward for Sheldon brand to come up. I was pouring over my map and compass when Sheldon brand reached me, the battle was full, the full blown it sound, it sound provided background noises. I briefed Shelly on the situation and our orders, shit, I don't like it sir. I know I don't either. But it's a lick. You got your map and compass. Good. So there's all kinds of reasons why they don't like this idea. Uh, obviously one that he already stated was that, you know, you take your platoon and you cut them in half. That's, that's just, you don't have the same fighting capability at all. I think they had one, one heavy machine gun and each squad. So now you've got basically they're down to two squads cause they were under strength. So we're talking one heavy machine gun.

Speaker 1:          00:43:51       And by the way, if somebody gets wounded, you know, you got your wound do guy and if you're gonna carry that guy, it takes two or three guys to carry the guy. So that's four guys go on. So you could very easily be outnumbered outman and Outgun by the enemy. So he doesn't like this idea. On top of that, I will tell you, he doesn't talk about it here. When you split up in a situation like this, it becomes very difficult to do command and control and now you've got two elements that are weak size and you're, you're no longer able to support each other. That's the, that's the premise of cover move. Covered. Move means you want to be close enough that you could support each other. You don't want to split far apart where you can't help each other if something happens. Well that's what they're getting told to do.

Speaker 1:          00:44:30       They don't it and, but they do it and maybe he should have protested more, but he's getting, he's getting orders from the battalion commander and he says, okay, let's do it. And of course, within a couple of minutes of doing it, they lose radio contact. So now they can't, they can't hear each other and they're starting to march apart. Finally they get radio, uh, they get connected on the radio again, they get columns again. And it sounds like this one five this is one six. Have you figured out where you are yet? This is one five negative. So Shelley with his squad is lost, doesn't know where he is. Okay. Now the lieutenant is all set up though. They're, they're in their position where they're thinking the enemy might come by. They're set up to attack them and here we go. Back to the book, Lieutenant Porter risks whispered as he reached my side where he, we hear noises to our front.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       Men are moving across in front of us in the jungle. Hold on a second. Porter. One five. This is one six. The sound of the battle should be on your right. If you're going in the right direction where the sound's over. This is one five negative on the right. The sounds are on the left over one five did you just say the sounds are on your left? I was squeezing the handset so hard. My knuckles were white. Affirmative. Affirmative. Jesus Christ. One five I Horsley whispered intensely into the mouthpiece. You're heading in our direction. I could hear the sounds of men moving through the jungle below us. I whisper deporter get back down there and tell the men to hold their fire. That may not be dinks. After all, hurry porter and heard the conversation with Shelley and quickly turned to are to carry out my order.

Speaker 1:          00:46:15       He couldn't yell because the sounds were coming from the dinks soldiers. His yelled would put us in jeopardy. As porter started toward the crew, the machine gun crew, open fire, the harshness of the guns, multiple explosions ripped across my thoughts as it sound echoed through the handset I was holding next to my ear, the sound of American swearing and screaming, rebounded from the jungle below and from my handset cease fire. I screamed, cease fire so he can actually hear his guys getting shot by his own guys. We have a blue on blue porter and I were running the gun crew. Both of us yelling, cease fire, cease fire, the sound of their gun blanketing the screens in front of them abruptly. The gun quit firing. I yelled into the jungle. Shelly, is that you? Yes. Yes. Stop firing. Don't fire. I was answered by many voices. I stood there and instant the horrible realization that I had fired on my own. Men's swept over me like a wave from an ice cold. Hell, the gun crew looked at me, their faces filled with shock. I ran leaping and falling down to the brush line where my men were asking the question to anybody hit for Christ's sake, Gallagher yelled back as I burst into a small clearing, one man, the point man.

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       So there you go. Blue on blue. Another reason why if you don't have to separate your forces, you don't. You don't separate your forces and unless you have to, and when you do what you do with extreme caution, and we, we've w I think every book we've, we talk about blue on blue, it happens in all these books. It happens in my book and some of these descriptions right here, I recognize those 100% when he says the horrible realization I had fired on my own, bent, swept over me like a wave from an ice cold. Hell yeah, I totally recognize that. And the fact that he says the gun crew looked at me, their faces filled with shock when I, when I explained to my guys in the field like that was a blue on blue. Their faces were just complete shock. If you're in the military, if you're in law enforcement, be very careful when you split your forces. It's, it just multiplies the challenges. Sometimes it is necessary, but you got to keep control over it. And now we go to where he's calling for a evac for his, for his wounded guy.

Speaker 3:          00:48:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:40       Delta six. This is one six over, this is delta six over, this is one six. I need a dust off for a peanut. We run into a little action over. This is Delta six. What do you mean a little action? What's going on? What happened over my knees felt weak and my stomach was sour. This is one six. We had a little difficulty with w with the terrain and uh, I ambushed one five over what? How the fuck did you do that one six you mean your ambushed your own men? What kind of outfit are you running up there? That's the most asinine thing I've ever heard of. You get your head out of your ass one six and get that platoon straightened up. You've got that over. This is one six affirmative over.

Speaker 3:          00:49:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:21       Ah, one six gimme your coordinates. The dust offs. Honest way. How bad is your peanuts over? This is one six. Not too bad. He'll lose a couple of toes, but everybody else is okay over, all right. One six settle down out.

Speaker 3:          00:49:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:36       He was more gentle with the last transmission because I'm sure he heard my voice and showed the strain I was feeling, whatever the reason, I welcome the sound of his voice. Perhaps he understood better than I thought what had happened, so he comes at him real hard. He realizes that the guy feels horrible and me and, and then he kind of backs off and to settle down. He also knows he's got to stay in the game. He's got to get him to stay in the game. And there's a nightmare of a video on youtube of then just actually it's from a documentary, but there was a really bad blue on blue in the first Gulf war where a Apache gunship led up, lit up. Uh, I think it was a Bradley, some kind of APC, the one that, it's a nightmare, but you can hear the one guy that fired, they're saying, hey, you got to get back in position, you know, hold the line basically.

Speaker 1:          00:50:25       And he's like, ah, I just killed my own guys. I want to come. And they're, they're saying negative. And so that's basically what this, what captains cells is doing here saying, hey listen, okay I'm pissed. But guess what? Calm down, settle down, get your shit together. And he sits out in and, and by the way, for those folks that aren't military over, when you say over at the end of a transmission on the radio, it means you expect a reply. When you say out there is no reply expected. So like when we end this podcast, I say out cause it's over there. Don't say anything back to me. It's over. I don't say over and and sometimes you'll hear people say over and out in the military that doesn't, you don't say that. It doesn't make any sense. So when you hear that in a movie, no, that they know that they are cheesy, that kind of like when you, when they hang up the phone on the movie, he goes [inaudible] and you hear the dial tone. Yes. That doesn't really happen either.

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       I trudged back back to the book. I charge it back to my position one five and his men following man handed me a can of coffee. I chain smoke my cigarettes and drink coffee while the platoon expanded into a larger perimeter, I stood facing the mountain, the battle still raging on one five walked over to me, still shaking from his experience. He told me how he was sorry that he had gotten to me in such a Dutch with a captain and we discussed the operation going over his mistake while we attempt to figure out ways to keep it from happening again, if we were ever split up, Shelly and I had been through too much together for me to blame him for what had happened. I told him so and we let it go at that. We have been lucky besides, I blamed myself for what had happened. The responsibility for any units, actions ultimately rests with its commander. The leader got the glory when things worked out and he took the blame when they didn't. That went with the job. When it came right down to it, the men were my responsibility and I had failed them today.

Speaker 2:          00:52:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:25       Little bit of extreme ownership. If you read the book extreme ownership that Leif and I wrote, the opening chapter, that's what it's about, blue on blue and doing exactly what what lieutenant downs did. Right. They're taking ownership of what the mistakes were made in the battlefield

Speaker 1:          00:52:43       back to the book. There's a couple of got well actually not yet there. They link up with another with another platoon and now they're having a conversation. Uh, Downes is having a conversation with another officer named Anderson. A dink was lying next to us as we talked. He had a black ace of spade stuck onto his fist. Handerson what's that all about? That's so the dinks no, what outfit fucked them up over here. Look around. Most of the dinks got those in their hands. Sure enough, the dinks. We're all holding an ace of spades. That's a good idea. But where'd you get all the aces? One of the guys. Mom's works in a card store, so he wrote home asking her to send her a couple packs of nothing but an ace of spades. Why did we want to kill dinks after all, we had mostly been law abiding citizens back in a world and we were taught that to take another man's life was wrong. Somehow the perspective got twisted in a war. The government told us it was all right and in fact a must to kill members of another government's per people. Then we had the law on our side. It turned out that most of us liked to kill other men. Some of the guys which shooted a dink as much as they would at a target.

Speaker 1:          00:53:59       Some of the men didn't like to kill a dink up close. The close to the killing, the more personal it became. Others in the platoon like to kill in clothes. A few even like to torture the dinks if they had a prisoner or cut the dead bodies with knives and a frenzy of aggression. A few didn't like to kill it all and wouldn't fire their weapons except to protect their buddies. Mostly. We all saw it as a job in rationalized it in our own way over. It all ran the streak of anger or fear that for brief moments ruled us all. My job is platoon leader was to control the spectrum of emotions, to guide the men towards survival. I didn't believe in torturing or and allowing a dink to die lingering death in the jungle. We never took prisoners. If we can help it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:49       Every day we spent in the jungle eroded a little more of our humanity away. Prisoners could escape to become our enemy again. Hence no prisoners. The philosophical arguments in favor of man's ability to resist the slide into barbarism, sound, noble and rational in a classroom or at a cocktail party, but when the enemy is bearing down on you, bent on taking your life away from you, it's not his country against your country, not his army, against your army, not his philosophy against your philosophy. It's the fact that that son of a bitch is trying to kill you and you better kill him first.

Speaker 1:          00:55:30       That's a reality right there. Now going back to tactics a little bit, back to the book, there was a spot about midway down the mountain marked in blue. That meant something bigger than a stream. If I were an enemy commander, that would be a perfect spot for a camp. High mountains on three sides, a good water supply, thick jungle growth and escape path in any directions. If he decided on that location, the any we could commander would be counting on attack from the valley up towards his location. He would have his back guarded but not very heavily or so. I reasoned. I just liked that because you can see he's getting his mind in the mind to the enemy. He's thinking about what he's looking at the map. He sees the stream, he sees valley, he sees good, good, uh, covered positions from three sides. He's thinking, okay, this is what the enemy must be thinking right here.

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       Now the, the fighting continues and as always, you know, I'm burning through book. I mean, this is, uh, this is a 250 page book and I'm reading, you know, what, maybe 20 pages from it. So there's so much action going on in, in so many good lessons to learn. Obviously I can't cover them all. That's why you can buy this book yourself as you should. But here we go. I'm going to a point here where they've been in a firefight. They'd got three wounded. One of the guys lost an arm, one of them is unconscious and they're getting a, they have a helicopter to come in and the helicopters lowered down a cable and they're lifting the guys out to get them to a med evac situation. Back to the book, the signal was given and the cable pulled him off the ground. About halfway up he waved to all of us just grinning like a Cheshire cat blood dripped on us.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       It was a picture I shall always hold in my mind. A man dangling from a cable holding a stick fastened to a tourniquet on the stump of his leg, waving at his comrades with the other hand, a cigarette dangling from his lips. One six is getting hairy up here. We're starting to take fire. The pilot reported, hold on just one more. SPAG and I lifted the unconscious man up while we slid the vest on to him. Someone had to be the cable, which I hooked onto the ring. The unconscious man was winched upward, dangling like a limp doll at the end of a cable. SPAG and I stood underneath watching this final exodus. As the crew man reached out to grab the man, something went wrong. The man had become unhooked and somehow fell through 50 feet of sky towards us. We jumped back as the man fell in a heap, better feet, the medic and I pulled the man over. Fuck, he stopped breathing. He goes on to say the attrition rate on our side was terrible on our morale. Although we killed and wounded many of the Nva, we never knew how much it hurt them. It seemed there was an unlimited number to take their places, but on our side, when we lost a man, we all knew

Speaker 1:          00:58:35       and it wore heavily on our minds. The constant marching and fighting demanded two things of us, strength and absolute reliability.

Speaker 1:          00:58:48       Now they're moving out on another operation and there was one of the, one of the soldiers named Yoder Yoder was the point man. He was experienced and full of good humor due to his promotion to door gunner. A good man to have on point any day. He was aggressive and unafraid, even though he was going in soon. There was no question of putting someone else in his place on point. It was his turn and he would not have in any other way. So he's getting promoted to door gunners. He's gonna get pulled out of the field, is going to fly around in the helicopter. You relatively safe compared to being in the field. He reminded me of a hillbilly with this course, language, mannerisms and humor. I was always asking him who he was going to get that front tooth replaced, that missing tooth made him look more like a hillbilly than anything else. He always laughed and said, fuck sir, I ain't about to let them fucking army dentist work on me. She had no, that would be a lick on me.

Speaker 3:          00:59:47       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:48       So they continue their patrol and they're coming up on this kind of flat area and Yoder crept forward in a crouch, looked back at me and grinned. I grin back and nodded my head. Yoder stepped over a tree root holding up part of the small gully bank.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       At that moment, all hell broke loose as a chai come machine guns. Strafed the point element. Yoda was hitting the body and fell forward into the gully. The machine gun acted as a key which triggered a complete ambush. We walked into a classical u shaped ambush with a machine gun being at the base of the EU, so this is, we used to call this a fire sac. When you're get ambushed and you're completely surrounded by the enemy and that's where there, that's where they are, starts with this machine gun and and Yoder and then just breaks out.

Speaker 3:          01:00:42       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:00:43       explosions, machine guns and rifle bullets rip through the air and ricocheted off the ground and trees around us. The noise was overwhelming. Men were screaming and yelling, trying desperately to get covered or screaming when they were hit or thought they were hit, which was almost as terrifying. We still not seen any of the enemy in the thick growth around us. Most of us in the point play dead. I lay trying to get my thinking organized as to what to do. So you're just taking massive, a ambush and you're laying there thinking, well, what am I going to do?

Speaker 3:          01:01:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       I could hear Yoder crying on the other side of the route where he had fallen. He cried out for me to come and get him lieutenant, I've been hit. I've been hit bad. I'm dying. Please come and get me. Please come and get me.

Speaker 3:          01:01:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       I turned my head in his direction. Twigs and bark from trees were falling like snow all around us as the charitable shrapnel and firepower rip through the jungle around us. I was terrified. So they're, they're pinned down and

Speaker 3:          01:01:46       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:01:46       he's actually ends up going to try and help one of the other guys. First, a guy named bell, then he gets to bell under covering fire and he says, bell was able, was able to help me but couldn't see anything. He limped and crawled. I pushed and swore as we continuously fell in our flight back up the hill. As I pulled him up the hill, one of my feet was shot up from, from underneath me. I've been shot in the Hilo, one of the bullets knocking off a piece of my boot heel and then, and the force had knocked me down. I got a begin and felt a tremendous blow to my hip, knocking me down. He had again, I thought finally I got bell behind. A rock doc was there and started working on him. I lay on my back looking up at the sky through the jungle canopy, not believing I'd actually made it down there and back. Yoda was still down there and although I had witnessed the bullets hitting him, I didn't want to leave. I had to be absolutely sure he was dead. I would never forgive myself if I pulled back and he was still alive. I was ready to call artillery in on our position if we were overrun, and that's like the ultimate,

Speaker 3:          01:02:51       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:02:52       the ultimate game over move. We're going to be overrun by the enemy. Okay, here we go. I'm going to call, call all ordinance on my position drop, but luckily the fire subsides. The one of the other platoons had come to their help and now that other platoon shows up and the enemy's pretty much gone and it stopped shooting. We all stood up. A couple of my man and I ran down to where three six his point with standing over Yoder, I leaped over the edge of the goalie and stop at younger. His body kneeling down. I turned his body over. He died with his headline downhill. His face was a dark blue from the blood, which gravity had pulled into the downhill portion of his body. There wasn't much blood on his body, but numerous bullet holes were cut into his fatigues covering his stomach and chest. His eyes were closed. I looked at him for a moment. My thoughts running back to our many conversations in the past. Once we had discussed whether we would go to the aid of one of our fellow soldiers if he was in trouble, I told him I would always respond to one of my men if they needed help. He had replied it would be a lick on me. I wondered if he had known that. I tried to get to him.

Speaker 1:          01:04:06       He was the first man under my command to die.

Speaker 3:          01:04:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:04:11       I looked up to see some of my platoon in three, six per tune standing over a dink body, and the goalie, three six had an Indian, his platoon and I had an Indian in my platoon. They drew their knives and slashed the enemy's body and frustration. This was the only dead dink. The men could find one lousy dink for all that pain and suffering. At least we could take our hate out on that son of a bitch. They'd also taken one prisoner as well. The the other platoon head

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       answer. Now he starts thinking back to the book. This is it. I thought I'd been wounded four times in battle. I had done my job, captains cells had asked after my third wound, if I wanted to be sent back, anyone with three wounds was do that. All it took was two wounds to get you out of the field. Surely forward, let me live with myself. What was I trying to prove? But I answered my own question. The men depend on me. It's my job to keep them alive by giving them good leadership and looking after them. They need me. Yeah, but shit, what did I own myself? I had a wife and two little girls who needed me. The $10,000 in insurance money wouldn't do them much good. Where did my duty lie? I was still shaking. I couldn't go through this again. Reluctantly. Almost against my will.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       I started walking toward the captain. Captain? Yes. Fred. You asked once if I wanted to go out of the field, if I had been wounded a third time, he turned and looked into my face. Yes. Well, I think, I mean, what do you think I was letting you and my men down if I did I stammered. No, I wouldn't. You've done your job. I could get you a job. Get you a good job with us too. That's some intelligence back in the rear. I, I think I want out. I don't know if I can do this again. Maybe I can't cut it. That's nonsense. You're a hell of a fine officer and the men will understand, but you think about it. Okay. I will. Let me think. A little bit of confidence returned at his words. I handed Yoders things to him. I wandered back to the pacs thinking I should find Yoders pac bell had stood up and was coming toward me.

Speaker 1:          01:06:34       When he saw the blind fold to dink in one motion, he swung his fist into the dinks face. He hit him again and again, knocking the surprise, dig down in a burst of fury. Bell started kicking him. It was obvious. Bell was going to kill him. The other men and I stood smoking and watching. We were going to let bill kill the dink. Bell had the right captain. Sales yelled and ran over to us, pushing me out of the way and pulling bell off the Dick here. What's this? What's going on? We are not going to have this in my company. This man's a prisoner lieutenant downs. What are you doing? Just standing there. I looked at him in surprise. Bell was killing this motherfucker. What's wrong with that? I retorted. You know God damn well, what's the matter with that lieutenant? This man is defenseless and our prisoner. Now let's get this prisoner back to the LD Lz. I wanted the dink dead, but the captain was right.

Speaker 1:          01:07:35       So you can see there obviously captain cells has a, has a great head on his shoulders and there's something else at play. The other thing that's at play is that by function of the way the battle went down and by function of being one rank above the platoon commanders that are in the firefights, guess what he is defacto. He's detached, he's detached. He didn't, I mean bells, the guy was pinned down, almost got killed, right? He's the guy that's emotional and guests who pulled him out risked his life, lost Yoder. That was downs. So these guys are emotional. They're there. They want to kill this guy. They captured him. He's VC, let's kill him. And captain cells is detached because he wasn't in that firefight. He wasn't directly there. So he's able to maintain enough mental detachment to, to make a hard decision, but also hold the line.

Speaker 1:          01:08:38       And this is something that, you know, when we go through the meal, I'm massacre. This could have happened to over and over again, just going to happen to 80 anywhere along the way. Someone could have said, hey, what are you doing right there? Stop. We don't do that. And that's exactly what sells does. And I think another thing that's that's important from a leadership perspective is also, well before I go to that point, you notice that when he's having a personal conversation with lieutenant towns, he calls him Fred. But when he's screwing up and he needs to kind of put him in his place, he's lieutenant downs on top of that from the leadership perspective, from captain sales perspective, he's got to always remember that w w what is happening that they are emotional that they did just lose their buddy that he's got. He can't just, you know, be so on the straight and narrow that goes, oh I'm going to court martial you.

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       He could call it or he could court Marshal Bell, right? Hey you abused a prisoner, you're, you know, I'm going to court martial you. And he doesn't do that because he understands their perspective and that's why you know, again, throughout this book sells really impresses me as a, as a very squared away, good solid leader as does downs. I mean downs. Obviously right here. He's emotional and he's lost it. Uh, he's, he's crossed the line, right? But all it takes is sales. Just telling him, get back over here, buddy. You crossed the line, come back and he says the captain was right. So that's all it took. Just a little snap just to get him to detach a little bit from the emotions and, and move, move away from the darkness.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       Back to the book, I walked over to the bodies. Yoders eyes were partially shut and I leaned down to push them clothes. Not that it did any good, but for some reason I thought it was better that way. I stood there with one hand on my aching hip smoking and thinking Yoders face was all muddy from the numerous times he'd been dropped in the mud and it was a trickle of blood at the base of his throat. This is the way it will always end. I thought men being killed in the jungle, other men dragging their bodies out, putting them on choppers and the rest of us going back to the fighting. When they left on the chopper, it was as if they had never been man's beginning and man's and would always be attended by only a few. Those that bought them at birth and those that bore him at death, the only important thing was what he did in between, good or bad or indifferent. He would touch those around in some way and then be gone. I wondered if a solute would be an order, not necessarily in the military sense, but a salute from one who had known him and who would never forget him. I decided it was and I raised my hand to my forehead in a farewell.

Speaker 3:          01:11:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:11:37       Now the birds coming in to pick them up as after he gives that final salute to Yoder. Smoke was popped and the large chopper swung in towards us for is landing. The doors were pushed back and I saw the door gunner on the side facing me looking around, anxiously searching for the ominous, for the omnipresent enemy. Good man. I fought not trusting a goddamn thing, even with an American infantry companies surrounding the Lz and I love, I love, just love that he's noticing that this door gunners coming in, the he coming in to pick them up and instead of this guy cutting corners and be like, oh, there's him fucking Trump again. There's no rounds being fired. I'm just gonna Relax. No, this guy's in the game. Opens the door, doesn't, what does he say? He says, uh, not trusting a God damn thing. Even with an American infantry company on the LLC. Many thoughts were Chris costing my mind above everything else ran the fought that I could not abandoned my men. I felt the shame that I had asked captain sales to pull me out of the field earlier when I was still shaking. What would demand think if they found out I was doing such a thing worse? What would I think of myself?

Speaker 3:          01:12:52       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:52       Now they continue to do operations and eventually they get, they get pulled out of the field on this for the final time on a helicopter back to the book, the machine carried us away. I looked over my men sprawled along the sides of the chopper. They'd removed the magazines from their weapons before boarding and now we're holding them close to their bodies. The men were dirty and unshaven. They're clothes in various stages of disrepair. Jungle boots, worn and torn with clouds and mud. Between the cleats, there were dark rings under their eyes and their faces were drawn and tired. Some of those phases were new men set ultra places. The faces that started the operation in were racist. We had experienced the worst of life and the most challenging. We had survived. The platoon I took back was not the platoon I had brought out.

Speaker 3:          01:13:53       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:13:56       Now they're on yet another operation have to go back. They get reset and they're out on another operation.

Speaker 3:          01:14:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:06       Doing a patrol and him going back to the book about five meters past the gate, the two men turned me and waved me forward all clear, sir. Let's go Rudo I pass through the gate. My right hand grasp my m 16 my left held my cigarette. I was humming the blue tail fly. As I mentally ticked off the physicians around the saddle where I would set my men, I noticed the time zero seven 45 hours, my foot slipped backwards, a fraction of an inch hitting the trigger mechanism of a mine. I never heard the explosion. Black powder and dirt flew by me. My eardrums ripped. My body was flying through the air. I threw my arms in front of me in a reflex motion to balance myself. My eyes registered the horror of a brilliantly white jagged bone sticking out of the stump of arm above where my left elbow had been.

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       Ragged. Bloody flesh surrounded this splintered bone. My mind cursed as utter helplessness in disrepair and despair overwhelmed me on another part of my bodily Cooley calculated what had caused the explosion. It had been a landmine, but what kind would blow off my arm instead of my legs? Of course it had to be a bouncing Betty mine that flies up to out of the ground after being tripped and explodes to waist high. That would do it. My [inaudible] had been in my right hand. The rifle was shattered. My hand was mangled. I stared in horror at what remained of my right arm. The flesh had been ripped away exposing two bones in my wife forearm. From risks to the elbow, the bones look like two white, glistening, narrow rods, buried and raw bloody meat thinking. My God, my God, my God, I felt told to feet of my life as I landed on my feet, five yards from where the mind it explode.

Speaker 1:          01:15:56       It exploded. After landing. I staggered forward two or three steps and then collapsed. My legs wouldn't work. The mind had gone off about six inches from my left hip, from the waist down. My body was mutilated and torn where large chunks of flesh, muscles, blood vessels and nerves had been ripped away by the hot, exploding shrapnel. My buttocks were blown away. The back of my legs were ripped to the bone down to my heels. I rolled over on my back being careful to keep my stump and right arm out of the dirt and sand. My body was sending so many pain signals to my brain that had overloaded like an electrical circuit. It caused me to feel a racing, humming, numbness. I lifted my head to view a scene from hell. I watched a couple of men run by me to the wounded point man.

Speaker 1:          01:16:45       They would only glance at me sideways as I lay there holding my bloody stump in the air. They seem nervous. Some of my men ran toward me. Then turn suddenly away at the sight of my torn body. They stood near me, but hesitated to come too close as if their movement through the air would make it worse. Spag asked me to turn sideways a little bit so he could pull my gear off. There were tears is not Adam. His eyes as he worked over me with a grunt, he pulled the belt out from under me. Is there anything I can do for you? SPAG asked. Yes. Run over there and pick up my arm and bring it back to me. I don't want to leave it in this stinking village.

Speaker 1:          01:17:25       I told Marlene to get my squad leaders go take care of the other men doc, they need you. I looked up Marlene and my squad leaders were standing in a rough line along my right side. I asked who was hurt. I was feeling weaker and weaker. It was so god damn cold. As my body fought for life, my thoughts ran to my man and my platoon. I felt I was cheating them by leaving them when they needed me. Most when I joined, the platoon is their leader. They had taught me the ways to survive in combat. A second lieutenant who is new and country and they were old timers, 18 1920 but old to the ways of combat and deaf. As I gained experience and confidence as a leader, I became an old timer having to make decisions that put me in the position I was in now wounded and maimed, facing death.

Speaker 1:          01:18:13       My men were still up there looking at me. Despair on their faces. They're in vulnerable leader had been brought down. Marley. Yes, sir. I want you to your men to get the dink. Who planted that mine. I want him dead. Get Him. We will want six. Don't you worry about that? They looked at each other. Then back at me. The gray haze of the day was strong. I pushed it back to look beyond my men. It was colder now and harder to see. I was thinking of my grandma downs and her form of the woods and fields of Indiana. I love so much. If only I could walk them one more time. If I'm only 23 years old and I'm dying, what a waste. There are so many things I had meant to do and say, but I hadn't

Speaker 1:          01:19:05       now I will never get the chance. So obviously, although he thought he was gonna die, he lived, he lost his arm. He, uh, ended up with, uh, with severe wounds, got discharged from the army. And you know, it's one of the things in the story. He had actually got picked up for up for a pilot program. So he's going to be a pilot in the army. He was gonna stay in the army to become a pilot and obviously that was gone because he didn't have an arm anymore. Uh, luckily they were able to save his other arm, but you know, severe wounds, real long Rehab and eventually he ends up going back to college. And here we go back to the book in the fall of 1968 as I stopped at a traffic light on my walk to class across the campus of the University of Denver, a man stepped up to me, said hi, without waiting for my reply to his greeting. He pointed to the hook sticking out of my left sleeve. Get that in Vietnam. I said, yeah, up near Tam, Ky and one core serves you right.

Speaker 1:          01:20:28       As the man walked away, I stood rooted to confused with her shame and anger to react. 10 years of past the hurt, shame and anger still flood over me with the memory. But one thing I am certain, none of the men I knew who served in Vietnam deserve to die or be maimed either physically or mentally. I think it is necessary now to give Vietnam to give another view of Vietnam that have the day to day life of an infantry man on the ground. I have always been asked what I thought about Vietnam, but never what it was like to fight in Vietnam. This is the way it was for us, but platoon of Delta one six in the afterward he talks about why he wrote this book in writing the killing zone. I had two goals.

Speaker 1:          01:21:39       I wanted future young infantry lieutenants and noncommissioned officers to learn from my experiences both good and bad. Some actions I took as a combat officer had worked out well and some had not. The time had come to deal with both. Perhaps some would learn from my mistakes, especially the lessons that combat, especially the lesson that combat does not go by the book. I also wanted to show future generations that the American soldier in Vietnam was a good soldier. In 1978 the anti war anti military feeling in the United States was pervasive in the newspapers, on television among writers and movies and in colleges. I had started college and at the University of Denver in the fall of 1968 while I was still on active duty in the military, the students for a democratic society, the weathermen and other antiwar groups on campus targeted to anyone in the military as fair game for their anti war stance. Such hostility was not pleasant for me or other Vietnam veterans. It was hard to be denigrated for serving your country. Many veterans have never admitted. Many veterans never admitted they were in the service for many years after Vietnam, angry at the antiwar faction. I wanted to set the record straight by proving that the men I served with had fought and died with honor

Speaker 1:          01:23:08       and here are the men that died and made the ultimate sacrifice

Speaker 2:          01:23:17       for freedom

Speaker 1:          01:23:19       and for their brothers in arms from Delta Company. First Battalion. No, the 14th Infantry Third Brigade, Fourth Infantry Division, PFC Donald Lawrence Glover, Pfc Norman Charles Kissing her Pfc Robert Wayne Seaton, Spec for Gregory Timeless Thomas iding Spec for Charles Irwin Edwin. Dot. Kaufman, Pfc James Garrett Miller.

Speaker 2:          01:24:06       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:24:55       So

Speaker 1:          01:24:59       Fred downs. Second Lieutenant asked us to do two things in this book. First, learn from his experiences, the mistakes, the lessons, and that is what we do here. We read and we study and we think and we learn. Then the second thing he asked is that we remember the man who fought and died with honor. Then that's something that we need to do and we should continue to do each and every day.

Speaker 2:          01:25:42       Remember

Speaker 1:          01:25:47       in that is one thing about this podcast that is a has a lot of meaning to me is the fact that people are listening it and the memory of these types of men and the challenges that they faced, it will be remembered. They will be remembered

Speaker 2:          01:26:22       always. So

Speaker 1:          01:26:33       once again, the book is called the killing zone, my life and the Vietnam War by Frederick downs. It's, it's a fantastic read. It's a fantastic book. It's a fantastic,

Speaker 2:          01:26:49       okay

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       dedication and, and it's a, it doesn't incredible job of honoring, honoring these men that fought so hard and are in a very unpopular war and by the book and read it. You will, you will absolutely get a lot out of it.

Speaker 2:          01:27:10       Echo Charles,

Speaker 1:          01:27:14       I believe we can move on to the next sector of this podcast. And again, um, if nothing else is delivered through this podcast, you know, let's let it be these couple things, these couple ideas of learning lessons from other people's experiences in remembering other people sacrifices. That's definitely one of the driving forces behind my wheel to do this podcast.

Speaker 2:          01:27:52       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:27:52       And we're going to keep doing the podcast echo. Get me out of here. Please. Let me out of this situation over there. I'm in that zone right now. Um, I need to send up a red star cluster. You know what that is? So, so in the military, when you need help, it's a red star cluster. It's a, it's a flare. You pop up and it means you couldn't communicate with anybody and you need some help. So there's my red star cluster. Do you need to jump in and say, Hey Jocko, speaking of the podcast, here's how we can support it, you know, so talk about that while I go get over here and get myself under control before I start smashing things.

Speaker 4:          01:28:28       Uh, yeah, if you want to send any reinforcements to support Jocko and end our podcasts here while supporting yourself with supplementation, by the way, good idea. Go to on it.com/jocko so on. It has like these supplements that we take supplements for your joints, Krill oil, boom, shroom tech for a performance. Hard stuff, you know, cross fit Jujitsu if you're trying to go hard, you know, hardcore in the paint. Yeah, shroom tech boom. Um, also if you do your shopping at Amazon, which I think we all do, um, good click through our website. We have a little link there. Um, you know, you can support it that way. That's a super easy way. All you gotta do this, remember to do it before you shop. That is helpful. Yeah, very much so. We also have a new tool

Speaker 5:          01:29:26       because can you, can you make them remembering part a little bit easier?

Speaker 4:          01:29:29       Yes. So when you know, you figure, Hey, I got to remember to go to the website before I shop on Amazon. Sometimes I'm in a hurry, whatever, you know, maybe I'm thinking about other stuff. I'm not thinking about Jockos podcast every single day. All Day. I got to buy some, you know, some cleaners, some duct tape, whatever. Here's a way so you, it helps you remember and or makes you not have to remember, know this little tool called the trooper tool. Oh, jock podcast. Super tool. Thanks to Brady for the Allen Brady. It's, it's a cool little thing. It's like this small little thing is pretty cool.

Speaker 5:          01:30:29       That's a really easy way to support the podcast. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:30:33       The, the,

Speaker 5:          01:30:35       it doesn't cost you anything. Yeah. It cost to Amazon something. And it seems to me like Amazon can afford to kick a little bit to the podcast over here. Right? Yeah. And it does serve its purpose because you don't have something, you know, like Amazon, they're, you know, they're a good company, provides good stuff, good service and all that. And they're trying to get the word out and you know, they'd be partner with people who, who can get the word out. Yeah. There's people that are going to go, oh, you know what? I want to support the podcast so I will buy this instead of buying it through some other website, they're going to go to the store that's going to support something that they enjoy or something that they get value out of, hopefully from this podcast. So yeah, that's an awesome way to support.

Speaker 5:          01:31:13       We appreciate it and it makes it like, it's kind of this little tool. It's kind of cool because it kind of makes it official. You know, like if you're, I mean if you're one of the people that listen to this and really talk with us and stuff, it's a, it is a cool way to kind of be more part of the it group, I guess. It seems like it, when I put mine up there I'm like, Hey, you know I'm like a fish. I don't know. It felt weird. Again, Echo Charles is in the game. We did that. So it was cool. Yeah, it's a really cool tool. You don't have to, it's safe. It's not like you just put it on if you don't want it on there anymore for whatever reason. Right click it right click and it, cause she made a little video that shows you go to the Jocko podcast, youtube channel and Echo Charles made a video of very high speed instructional video on how to do this.

Speaker 5:          01:31:56       Trying to waste anybody's time. It's really easy. You are not around with the instructional video. I think that was very impressive. And, and by the way, subscribe, do me a favor troopers. Subscribe to the Youtube Channel, the Jocko podcast, youtube channel. That way when Echo, cause I'm been, I've been to hacking on echo to make little outtakes and other little conversations and videos and he's like, well you know, we, we got some subscribers but maybe you know, if we had some more maybe I'd be more so we need to motivate Echo Charles just a little bit because so we could get some outtake videos, some other other interesting videos. I wanted to do a little pre video today of what it was like when we were getting set up because we have a little ritual that we go through when we're making some, some beverages, you know, some, some Alpha brainy and we have, you know, so I was like, I'd be pretty cool if you shot a little video.

Speaker 5:          01:32:47       And he's like, well you know, maybe one day, no, I actually am imitating. So subscribe to the, I don't think, if it doesn't, I mean it's just, just go to, go to the Jocko podcast channel on Youtube, subscribe at youtube.com/chocolate pie. And also what's cool about that is when you do that, then you get little emails that say, it's not like you just get an email and says, hey Jocko podcasts just uploaded a new video. I get those. And I'm always like, oh yeah, cool. Now I can watch the video and even that's option. Oh okay. If you don't opt out. But yeah, that's a good, I have, um, remember that that one, a cha children's book idea I had. Yeah. You probably forget cause you know, you need to remind me, I got a lot of ideas that I had that on video when we were talking anyway.

Speaker 5:          01:33:34       Oh yeah, that'd be funny. Yeah. So yeah, I'm going to pull some of some things you've got understand. So I have a certain standards, I'm talking not talking to you, echo and talking to people that are listening right now. I mean you're here too. So I guess I'm talking to you too, but people got to understand that there's a certain expectation in my mind of what the podcast is and what it's supposed to be. So when something happens that's not quite there, I'm like, you know what, I don't really, hey, you know, I don't want to talk about that on the podcast. But it's like, for instance, before we hit record, we're recording, but before we go, before I opened the show, we're talking about something, right? We're always talking about something and sometimes those conversations are 20 minutes, half an hour. We're talking about real stuff, we're talking about legit things.

Speaker 5:          01:34:21       But we haven't even introduced the podcast yet. So that goes into scrap pile right now. Some of the scrap metal material, while it might not be in March, marching step with what the podcast is, it does perhaps have a, have a life that it could live and it could, it could guide people in a certain way and it's stuff that people might be interested in. So that could be youtube download, you know, youtube just posted on there. So that way people get a little taste of other things around the podcast, which I think people would dick. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. So like, you know, if you free, you buy an Echo Charles, free your mind. You're totally right. I'm the thank you. Thank you once for once. Yeah. Yeah. Cause you know if you listened to it on iTunes you're like, why am I going to sit and watch?

Speaker 5:          01:35:12       And Josh would talk to each other. You know, I listened to one and I got to look at them too. You know, a lot of people might not be interested in that really. There's some moments, you know what I do is I, well I watched certain moments of the podcast on Youtube. Yeah. Like when I know I was feeling intense about something, I go and see what it, see what that looks like. So like, okay, what does that look like when I'm feeling that? Does it look like, does it look like from the outside, what it feels like from the inside? Because even today I was getting pretty fired up. Like, I mean you're talking about heroes and young man, man, 18 1920 years old that said, okay, this unpopular war. I'll go fight it. I'll go fight it. You know, I'll go rest of my life, I'll go out there in the jungle and live in, you know, I was, I was, uh, out this week in the field, right.

Speaker 5:          01:36:05       Camping. I, I kept putting it in quotes on Twitter. I was putting in quotes because I was like, I can't call this the field, but you know, it wasn't the comfort of a house, right. It was, it was, and it was, you know, bugs and ants and, and I'm like thinking to myself, you know, this is nothing. And I was thinking back to, uh, to the forgotten Highlander and remember the bugs were just eating those guys alive and you know, you just, you just can't, you can't compare. So these guys that, that just stepped up fought and I just wanna I just wanna always, you know, that kind of thing will get me fired up. So when I go back to the videos sometimes, like, oh man, what, what was I looking like, you know, a little self assessment and I wonder if, you know, cause when I'm feeling that way, I'm like, okay, you got to detach a little bit.

Speaker 5:          01:37:00       Cause you're starting to get a little bit fired. I'm gonna start breaking them and start getting them like really emotional about something. And so I got to, I got a little red flag goes up, I go to you going to back off a little bit here. We don't have to edit the video and if I break down, so I got to just back off and sometimes I got to see you. What does that look like? Does it look, can you tell? Am I looking? You know, so that's the kind of thing that I like to go back and look at the youtube videos and say, you know, what does this, what does this look like? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's some value. There was a lot of value on youtube. We're probably not, you know, capitalizing, I dunno, whatever. For people who care. And it's weird too because the interesting thing about all this is you used the word capitalized, right?

Speaker 5:          01:37:38       In the fact of the matter is we aren't really capitalizing on this at all. And I keep getting told by a variety of different people what to do to you to do what? That right there to capitalize. Just capitalize, not for us to come and I know everybody, you know, but what we, what would you want to do is we want to maximize the effort that we put in here. Want to maximize it so that people get the most out of it. That's, that's what I know. That's what you meant. I know you didn't mean like let's run to the cash machine because we're doing it for the passion of doing it. That's what I'm sitting here for sitting here so I can tell. So I can tell this story right here about these guys and I know, you know, I know, I hear from all kinds of cops.

Speaker 5:          01:38:21       I hear from my seal buddies that are still in, that are listening to it, that are asking me, texting me questions going, hey man, what's going on with us? Hey, what would you have done differently here? Hey, those are my buddies that are in, that are getting ready to deploy overseas right now. And I get texts and emails and Twitter things from guys that were guys that are active duty in the Marine Corps and the army. So I know that we're getting the word out there and that's what, that's where I'm sitting here for. So you make a good point with, you know, there's a lot of people who don't watch the video. Of course. I mean, I don't watch podcasts videos, right? I mean, why? The reason podcasts are so convenient that you can be doing something else. You don't have to dedicate, you have to dedicate your all your senses to it.

Speaker 5:          01:39:04       You only have to dedicate two of them, your ears and your brain because you don't have to dedicate your eyes. You don't have to dedicate your asked to sit down and share and watch something. You can walk around, you can do yard work, you can drive, you can do what you gotta do. But I think the shorter little youtube clips where you go, hey, check this out. This is when Jocko and I were discussing a kids book that echo was talking about, or yeah, I'm going to post. Yeah. Post that thing though. And it's interesting cause a lot of people apparently don't. I mean don't are surprised that I looked different than I sat on a pair I guess. Oh yeah. They think you're a skinny white hipster or that's what they think. Maybe I am at heart. Maybe you are at heart, you're just trapped.

Speaker 5:          01:39:45       Maybe you identify as a skinny white hipster even though you're a 227 a I don't, I don't identify myself by my physical characteristics. It's what's in my heart and my mind. The content of your character, like to say, think the youtube. I just, good idea. Yeah. We'll post more. So I have a lot to men. So many outtakes a lot. You've done something really good outtake videos in the past. Yeah. Yeah. They're pretty, yeah, from when we were filming commercials and stuff. Yeah, those are good. All right. Anything else? Jack? Can you in chocolate store? Did you talk about that? Yes. Go to the store to buy some Bryce and merchandise. Somebody who hit me up on Twitter the other day and they're like, hey, you should set up a, we've got asked this a bunch of times, set up a Patrick on, is that what it's called?

Speaker 5:          01:40:34       Patriarchy. Patriarchy, where you can donate to the podcast certain amount. And I just said, hey man, go buy a tee shirt. You know, that supports us just as well. And you get a t shirt and just that's a good way to support the podcast by buy some merchandise. Buy some gear. Yeah, the chocolate store. That's a good one. Tee shirts, coffee amongst stickers. Those are kind of cool. Um, one of my friends saw to Jacqueline stickers in the wild in the wild one day or maybe one location here at San Diego. Everyone in San Diego, we know everyone in San Diego doesn't count. I Dunno. Yeah. Cleveland counts.

Speaker 5:          01:41:10       But yeah. Awesome. Good. Yup. So now we get to those questions from the inner webs. First Question Jocko is the minimal amount of competent defensive ability defense, essentially the most overlooked essential stabilizer of young male psyche. So this question, this actually, this actually came across the interwebs as a, as a statement, an opinion. And I kind of rephrased it just a little bit to make it into a question, but it actually came across someone and saying, look, he believes this person believes that the no one had a fight, no competent defensive, defensive ability. I call that knowing how to fight is, and he thinks it's the most essential stabilizer of a young male psyche. I agree with this statement. I think that, yeah, I completely agree. I think that learning how to fight and knowing how to fight gives you real confidence and security, not just in the form of being secure, but as, as in in opposition to insecurity.

Speaker 5:          01:42:27       Right. Because when you know how to fight, all of a sudden you don't have anything to prove anymore. Yeah. And we, this change is so I, you know, I wish I would have learned how to fight and I'm watching. Sure. We fought all the time. When I was a kid, we fought, we didn't know how to fight. So what do we have to prove that we knew how to fight. If we actually knew how to fight, we wouldn't have to prove that all the time. So I absolutely agree with us and that's why I'm constantly trying to get people to get into Jujitsu. You know, get your kids in. Did you get your, get your 13 year old boy, your 10 year old boy. Get him into Jujitsu. Your girl too. I mean your girl too because your girl is gonna use it for defense.

Speaker 5:          01:43:05       Um, girls don't have the constant tension of fighting that guys have. It is part of who we are. When I shake someone's hand, I don't care what kind of mood I'm in. I am thinking about taking them down. I am thinking about what I'm gonna do to him in a fight. It doesn't matter if I'm meeting Santa Claus, I'm thinking about doing a double leg. I'm thinking about what, what his weight his, does he have cauliflower ear? That's what I'm doing. And guys do that, guys do that. And it's real. And I mean, especially in the environment I grew up in the seal teams. I mean everybody's got that constant like test evaluates the evaluation, you know? So if you don't know how to fight, there's only one way to figure out where you are and that

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       is to fight know. And so you end up doing stupid things, stupid things to prove your, your manhood. And I hate to use that word, but you end up doing stupid things to prove your manhood. So my recommendation is, well, I totally agree with this statement. I think it is a huge stabilizer of, of your personality and, and your psyche as a man. So teach, get those kids to learn Jujitsu. They're going to understand the things you understand violence you respected because you know where you've got choked out. You know it's happened. You know that is a horrible feeling. It's a horrible feeling when another human being can't control you 100% you know what? Physically, it doesn't matter how smart you are anymore. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how smart you are anymore. When you are getting completely physically dominated by someone, it doesn't matter that you're smarter than them at that time.

Speaker 1:          01:44:51       There's nothing you can do about it. What are you gonna Challenge them to a spelling bee. It's not going to help you. You're, you're under their control. And that's a horrible, horrible feeling. And so I think it's a, you know, and I felt that, you know, when I was a kid, you know, I got bullied just like everybody, everybody gets bullied. It's at a certain point, you know, you show up to high school, you're 13 years old. I was 30 I was a young, whatever, however that works when you are born. That was born in September. So I was a young, scrawny kid and I didn't get bullied to some crazy extent, but you get picked on, you get picked on, you get in little scuffles and you get thrown around by a kid that's, that reached puberty when he was nine and he's now, you know, six feet to 20 and I'm showing up at school 13 years old way and a buck 45 you're going to get, you're going to get physically controlled and it's not fun.

Speaker 1:          01:45:42       And so I didn't know how to fight. I was trying to figure it out. And there was no, no one knew how to fight back then unless you were a boxer, maybe a wrestler. Um, but yeah, so definitely this is a huge piece. Helps you with I think, I think kids that know how to fight are going to get an a lost less street fights. They're going to do a lot less stupid things to prove themselves because guess what? They already have the essential primal, animalistic characteristic of physical domination. And that goes a long way. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:46:16       And we talked about this before, back to the the girls thing, getting your girls into it. You know how when you get into any kind of physical situation, even if you're in a crowd and someone starts shoving someone else, not even you and pull him, you feel the force of somebody or someone's just all like on you. Or even if someone like, I don't know, tackles you or something like that. It's like this kind of imposed physical situation. And when you're into Jujitsu, that's every day. So you get used to that real quick and in fact you get real comfortable with it. But as a girl, not trying to like

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       win fight, now you know, I know what you did, so I'm going to trade when fights and beat up guys. That's not really what it's for for girls. It's more for knowing how to function, knowing where to be, where not to be. Because man, if you don't know, you just simply don't know. And also being totally right and then also being inoculated to the, the physical comedy when it happens. So you can't win. I mean, not looking to win fights. There's go watch youtube. Yeah, there's all kinds of videos of girls and just working over guys and I mean in street fights there's one particular where this girl's just triangle. Our mock just choke. Just crushing this kid. Yeah. Well the, I mean the truth is if you learned, you did. If someone knows Jesus, someone doesn't, the the chance of the person knowing you did to winning the fight is very, very, very high.

Speaker 5:          01:47:36       Even if you're a girl, it's still applies to you. Of course the girls that have physical diff disadvantage because she's smaller, weaker, whatever. But like I said, Jujitsu is just this huge jump in, you know, ability as far as fights go and you know something else from a pure self defense perspective, if you, a lot of times, let's say a girl's not able to physically, let's say she's a hundred pounds and she's a guy attacks or that's 200 pounds, she might not be able to put him to sleep. She might not be able to finish him, but she may able to be able to survive. Fend the guy off for a minute and 30 seconds instead of two seconds. Yup. Instead of four seconds instead of eight seconds. So that's what it takes for someone to hear, for someone to see. So every second counts. And if you know you did too, I guarantee you it's, it's really hard to subdue somebody that knows some Jujitsu.

Speaker 5:          01:48:29       If you don't know anything, you are going to have a hard time getting control them. They're going to, they're going to be, and even if you're stronger than them, you'll be able to get ahold of the, maybe eventually if there are a lot smaller, a lot weaker than you, but it's going to be a fight. And a lot of, a lot of, you know, you read a lot of stories when in self defense situations, if the girl puts up a decent fight, the guy's not going to have any of it. You know, he's going to realize that he's not looking for that. He's not looking for a fight, he's looking for something else. And so the fight begins, he backs off. So yeah, absolutely. It applies for, for girls as well. And there's just a certain level of confidence, you know, and I've seen that, you know, my son's had a couple of little scuffles, a couple that I've witnessed to where, uh, you know, he just was like not trying to, not trying to have a problem until someone just grabs him and is obviously going to do, try and do something to them and then that person's getting launched.

Speaker 5:          01:49:16       You know, like a perfect judo cause you're going to, you know, how hard is it to judo? Throw somebody that doesn't know any judo, Jujitsu, it's so easy. So you see a kid fly through the air, hit the ground, you see my son, you know, just like there's no guard passing because the person has even know what the part is there. So it's just straight to mountain. And then once you're in mount, the person has no idea what's happening and, and they're completely controlled and they're getting put to sleep. That's it. It's as easy as that. Yeah. And so funny how you, this is kind of the part that I forget actually every once in a while where, how you brought up,

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       when you shake someone's hand, you're always thinking about it or whatever. So that's, that's the thing too. That's why, that's why it's almost like if you don't know what you did to like or are for real fighting's not many out there man. There's not many. But even we'll just say if you don't know Jujitsu, you might fall into this trap by thinking, well you know, I might, you know, you never know. He's not on all the time or he might not be ready for this or you know, all surprise them with a like does punch or something like this and they'll, they won't give it its due credit. But the thing is when you learned Jujitsu Bruh, that's all you're thinking about. You're like, Oh fuck, take this guy right here. 100% of the time you, you can be laying in your, in your bed with your wife and she'll be like, hey give me a hug.

Speaker 4:          01:50:27       And you're like under hook there. Yes, exactly. The whole time. So you can't really to surprise the guy who knows Jujitsu to surprise them. It's super hard. Like you gotta do from behind. I don't know. Even if you think up for me, I like, you know what to do from beginning, you know, you gotta like I dunno hit him or something really hard, knock them out one punch or something like that to knock somebody out. So yeah, but that's so funny cause that, that is how it is. Even as like a, like a high level guy, you're still like, it's always on your mind. Like it's like you're walking around with this big powerful like gun or something. Like you're like, okay, who wants to get shot? Not that you want to shoot people specifically, but it's like this radar that's like, okay, who wants to get shot kind of thing.

Speaker 4:          01:51:12       Cause you're just rates ready. You know, you're just ready to do the time. And to me honestly, it's so instinctive. You know, at this point, part of every movement that you make is thinking about that and your, you know, you ever had somebody that doesn't know what you did to like maybe you haven't seen someone in awhile. I've had that half what I've seen someone for awhile and I mean 20 years so they have no idea what Jujitsu is. We've gone a completely different paths in our lives and they like grab a hold of you as if it was the old days and you're going to have a tussle and it's edible. It's just a, it's just a four second, you know, Spirit crushing maneuver of death and, and you're happy to do it too, you know, cause as an adult like you know, I think anywhere past 26 27 years old, it's hard to get away with like getting into a wrestling match in public or you know, somewhere outside of the math.

Speaker 4:          01:52:03       That's interesting. You might not have known that, but I don't know. I think I speak for more than more people than just myself, but there's a part of your mind that kind of helps it. It happens just with your friend, you know, or something like that. Just always on. You're always hoping for for a scrap. You know what? Ironically, back to the part where, where I was saying, um, it's Kinda hard to surprise that you did to guy. Ironically, the easiest time to surprise the Jujitsu guy is on the mat. If you're another Jujitsu guy, what do you do is you play like, oh, we're just going light right now and then you go hard. You know, so you can't really surprise them in the, like in public you gotta like you gotta learn Jujitsu, go on the mat with them, make them think you're not rolling. Are they in surprise?

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       And you know, I think that's part of it is you become more aware when you're just talking. What you've been talking about the past couple of minutes is awareness. And when you have Jujitsu in your brain then, and it's true with boxing too, and Moy, Tai, when you have that stuff in your brain, then you can't help but be aware of what's happening around you because it's in there. It's like knowing that the color of the table is Brown. Like you, you know what that person's body position is. You're looking and seeing that their stance is off balance. You're seeing an under hook exposed, you know, so you can't help, you can't take it away. So your awareness increases. You also are aware of what problems can occur really quickly. So if you start, you know, if you're a girl and you say, oh wait a second, now I'm backed into a corner where I can't get out, I don't like this feeling.

Speaker 5:          01:53:34       It becomes a, it increases your awareness as a human and makes you more aware of your surroundings. So there's so many benefits. It's kind of ridiculous. You kind of have almost like one level up from that or awareness that you're talking about because like how are you saying it's part of that. Even if you don't know how to fight, it's still kind of on your mind. You know, like all guys have that kind of of evaluates, especially with the guys close to your close to you, who you are, what are the age, size, whatever, whatever the scenario. Even like if you're a scholar and no one else's scholar, then another scholar walk through this evaluation, you know? So that's how it is naturally smart. This guy. Yeah. Well, so as a guy, just naturally you're going to have even more, it's like you know what the color of brown is or whatever, but just instinctually you're always looking for Bratton.

Speaker 5:          01:54:21       That's kind of what it's like. So now you, when you're doing these evaluations that are going to happen anyway, your Jujitsu mind is right there at the front. Ready the whole time. Yeah. They thing to people. But that's not to be confused with like you're aggressive and want to fight. That's the weird thing. It's like you don't want to actually fight with people because you don't feel the need to like, oh, I got, I dunno. That's where this whole conversation started off. And also now you not feel like you need to prove anything. But I literally am like, oh, there really want to get in a fight with this guy. I'm gonna get my knuckles. You know, I'm not going to rip my tee shirt disguising it. Right. Yeah. This is really, no, I fight every single day. I don't need, I don't, I don't care about this guy.

Speaker 5:          01:55:05       This is a two second thing where I've got to scuff up my knee on the pavement and he's probably gonna rip my shirt, my shirt, and that's going to be a pain. And then I got to deal with the cops. If they show up, it's just a big pain. Whereas if you don't fight and you have that opportunity, maybe you got the thing inside you and will, you don't know the payoff of the fight, right? If you don't know or, or if you're just insecurity over the payoff of the fight and hopefully winning is bigger than all the detriments that you had to be. I used to tell him, my platoon guys, when we were overseas before the war started, they didn't know. So guys were overseas. What are you doing? You're drinking, you're out in bars or just causing problems or whatever. And I've, you know, before we go on over here, hey guys, if you feel like fighting tonight, come find me.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Cause if you want to fight, come find me and we'll, it'll be all be good. You know, you, you know we'll, we'll fight and it's all good. You won't get in trouble. You won't get arrested. You won't get hurt. It's all good. You'll get in trouble. You get in trouble for sure. You're not getting in trouble with the law though. You know what I mean? You're not going to get that kind of trouble. You didn't have a little trouble in your situation and your in your positioning is going to be troublesome. So yeah, it's better to fight amongst yourself than to fight against the outsiders who are going to sue you. Pull a knife out and stab you in the throat, whatever. Right. Don't do that. Stay out of the street fights. Not Worth it, you know. All right. I agree with it too though.

Speaker 1:          01:56:20       When you said you agree that it is the stabilizer in religion. It is. Cause if you don't know, you don't even know how much you don't know. It's funny cause we get a lot of people that have started training, Jujitsu move. Yes. A have over. They'll come on Twitter or on on the Facebook he and, and say, you know, um, hey, you started training Jujitsu. Oh my God, I can't believe I need to train this all the time. I can't believe I got control. How they always say how humiliating and sometimes they say humbling, but sometimes I think even when they say humbling, they actually mean humiliating because they you've, that's the weird thing when you're walking around on the earth without the knowledge, you don't, you look at other people, you think, you know what? This guy knows Jujitsu. I heard this guy knows just to, it doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          01:57:06       I'm strong, I'm athletic. I'll just hit him in the neck. Or even even, you know what? I'm just strong enough. He's not going to get my, how's he going to get my arm over there? That's not gonna work. I'll just pull my arm back. And then you get on the mat and you go, oh my Lord, I have no control over this situation. This guy has effortlessly making me submit over and over and over again. And that's when the reality hits the reality hits, doesn't it? On the first time you tap cause on the first time you tap you go, oh I'm going to, I'll just, I won't do that single movement again. I won't stick my head over there. Okay. So then you get your arm locked and then you get your foot locked and then you get your knee lock and then you get [inaudible] and then you get a gay teen again.

Speaker 1:          01:57:43       Then you get rid of. So you all, it's just a lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose, lose. And then you go after. Usually for me it's like three to five times with somebody that's never changed you. So before three to five times before they realize like, oh I will never, cause you knew when you tap, a guy wants us never trained before and he comes at you so hard, he and his mind, he thinks all this time I'm going to get them and they don't even come close. They don't even realize. So yeah, get on the mat man and learn. Learn the Jujitsu. Nope, please cover the over or please cover overcoming the frustrations of beginning Jujitsu. And this is coming from a 54 year old by the way, but not quitting. Good. Good for him. That's awesome. Glad you're picking up the Jujitsu at 54 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:58:28       Uh, okay. So how do you, the frustrations of beginning Jj and it is absolutely, if you have the wrong mindset, it's viciously frustrating because of everything we just talked about and you think, oh, I'll just do this and let's go a little bit harder and I just won't put my arm there. I'll be able to win. You're not going to win. You are going to lose. You're going to lose over and over and over again to people that are smaller than you. Weaker than you. Not as tough as you are. Literally not as tough as you are. Not as tough as you are. You know, Jujitsu has a faction of, of getting nerds, for lack of a better word, straighten nerds. And no offense to the nerds out there, but you know, people that are not physically active and in some, for some reason they fall into Jujitsu at some point and, and the, and they, all of a sudden you've got a guy that's, they're not tough, but they'll know, they'll know the moves and I'll finish you so that, so those are the people you're going to lose to.

Speaker 1:          01:59:21       So, and it's a, it's a long, long, slow journey that takes a long time. Now that being said, if you train for a month and someone's trained zero is, that journey's not that long. You've been that guy, you, you will beat that guy. I mean, you know, again, you take two people, one of them knows Jujitsu for a month and one of them doesn't. Yup. That guy's going to win. I mean, you know, basic weight, same weight, basic same, you know, you can't have somebody that's completely weak, but in six months you're beaten. Anybody that's, I'm trained for 95% of it. Maybe you're 99% of people that aren't trained, but, but, but as far as like, you think you show up and in six months you're going to be beating a blue belt. It's not happening. It's not happening. A beating a purple belt is not happening.

Speaker 1:          02:00:14       You're not gonna, you're not gonna catch a purple belt know in, in your first two or three years. Um, unless you got to somebody that doesn't, of course, like Glover, Jeff Glover, he'll, he'll, he'll, that people put him in all kinds of, I mean, he does that in comedy. You just saw that I've met at Morrison. He lefts all kinds of crazy things happen. So yeah. Can that happen? Of course. But as far as legitimately taking someone down, yeah, it's not going to happen to you. So, so that's all. That's what I'm saying is a long, slow journey. Especially too, because everyone's on that bus. We've talked about this before. Everyone's on the bus getting better. So that blue belt that started, that you started six months behind or a year behind. So he's a blue belt. You're a year behind him. He's not stopping getting better.

Speaker 1:          02:00:56       So as you start to pursue his game, his game is evolving and changing and improving student, you're not going to get there. And then on top of that, when you do learn something new, it takes time to incorporate into your game. So if I taught you echo a new move tonight as it, hey, here's a school, here's this new setup for the arm lock, and we drilled it 10 times and you went now and started to apply that, gee, it would make your game worse because you'd be trying to apply a move that you don't know 100% yet. Like you got some good solid moves that you do. And those are, you know, those work really well. So when you start incorporating this new move, you don't need to know it. Well, you don't get it all together. So you're going to fail out it a hundred times.

Speaker 1:          02:01:42       It's not going to work a hundred times before you get it. And by the way, every time you tried it on me, I got on top and then I smashed you in the night. So you're, you're sacrificing. And it's in every time. So you're actually going backwards a little bit before you can go forward. So that's problematic and that's very, very frustrating. Occasionally you might learn something that like really improves your game dramatically, almost instantly. That happens from time to time. Some will say, Hey, put your arm position here. Or Hey, you know, whatever the case may be. But generally when you incorporate something new, it can take some time. You're going to get injuries, you're going to get little injuries, you're going to get big injuries, you're going to be sore, you're going to, so yes, you will be frustrated. So how do you counter all that?

Speaker 1:          02:02:20       You just got to embrace it. You got to embrace all those things. You got to enjoy all those things. And I hate to be cliche, but you got to enjoy the journey. You got to enjoy getting tapped out by somebody that smoking. Be Amazed by that. Say, Dang, how did that just happen? That is impressive. Uh, you know, say hey, got a little war scar on my face. I got, you know, split the eye open. Okay, cool. Chicks dig scars. You know what I mean? Just going to go. Don't, don't, don't look at all that stuff as negative. Look at it as, you know, it's like, don't rush to the end. Don't rush to the end. Don't be in a rush to get there. Take your time and enjoy the sites that you're going to go for. Also, I've said this before, select your training partners carefully, especially like you're 54 years old.

Speaker 1:          02:03:07       You don't want to be rolling with a 20 year old steroid freak that's going white belt trying to kill you. You want to be rolling with a cool mellow purple belt that's wants to do Jujitsu and train, um, and find me. I would just say, remember that Jujitsu should be fun. It should be all those other things, all those frustrating, all those challenges, all those things, all that humiliation and humid and getting humbled, but she'd be a good time. You should have fun. We were doing Jujitsu. I know I do. Yeah, yeah. Like a video game, right? You know how I was going to hit town for a couple of days, man, and I came back and had a little injury that I figured figured out. It took me a little while. I got my jacked up finger and it took me a little while, a little while to get the right, get the right apparatus to splint it properly and protect it. But it's, but tonight I train and I was so happy. I was so happy. Go and getting on the mat, just saying yes.

Speaker 4:          02:04:02       Yeah, that that is how we're all these, all the junk parts that come with it were quote unquote jumper. You know like the bitterness. Yeah. I got choked out. Aware. That's all part of the game. Seems obvious, right? Yeah. It's all part of the game. But be happy that that's the game you're in. You know? I mean, do you get some basic, I mean if you don't do Jujitsu, this would be kind of kind of an insight. Basically all it is, you go, if you go to a class, you go in, you, you may or may not warm up. You learn a move. Whether it be a submission move or just a move. You learn a move to move three moves, sometimes four moves and then you to

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       Roland straight up. You guys are fighting, no strikes. That's it. You're finding no strikes. If you whatever moves, you know, go ahead and do them while in real life against this guy. That's it. If you don't know, if that's your first day and you learn one, two, three moves that first day, you better try to do those moves. That's it. So of course, you know, two, three moves that you learned once. By the way, and your role with someone who, even if he's still a white belt or whatever, he knows those moves and then you know, three, four more and he's practiced some in, you know, in real time or whatever. Of course he's going to get you, you know, that's just how it works. But keep in mind, the more you go, the more you do, the moves, more moves you learn, the more you practice them in real life, the better you get at them and you don't.

Speaker 5:          02:05:16       Let's go ahead and just apply this to life as well because you just to such a great metaphor for life, whatever you're doing, whatever goal you're trying to achieve, if you're letting those frustrations, we hit those obstacles. If you're letting them control you and get you down, that's the wrong attitude to have. You know, look at it as a learning opportunity. Look at it as something that's good, that's happening. Look at it as, as a chance for you to try something new. Look at it as the journey that you're trying to achieve. And by the way, anything that's easy to achieve and you don't hit any obstacles, well that's not worth it, right? That's not, is not going to get the full satisfaction that you want out of that. So in life as in Jujitsu, don't get frustrated. Embrace those challenges because those are what is making this goal worthwhile.

Speaker 5:          02:06:03       You know, man, and I'm telling you when you, let's say you well back to the, um, avoiding frustrations specifically. Um, it does how you were saying training partners, that doesn't make a big difference because sometimes every once in a while, like I've, I've heard of people where they, their schedule doesn't allow them to catch like the beginner class for example. So they're like, hey, I have no choice. I got to do this more intermediate or advanced class. So they're the only white belt and the next, you know, guy, even close to the Tim is like advanced blue belt. So that's going to be a steep learning curve. It's going to be tough because how are you going to practice your moves in the wild. You won't get to work your offense. It's really, but he was kind of the good thing you get to work your defense.

Speaker 5:          02:06:44       So when you do get the opportunity to exercise, like your offense, whether you, you get another class or it just comes but just takes longer or whatever, but you know how good your defense is going to be. Yeah. And I actually, so from training with Dean for so many years, you know, he's just got some positions that are brutal. Yeah. Brutal positions. And you know, for instance, his mount is, is outstanding. He's when he gets the mount, when anybody else that I've ever trained with in my life as mountain with the exception I guess of Hixon Gracie, I felt like, oh well it's not dean. This is not, you know, this isn't a horrible scenario. Right. And not that I'm not that worried, I'm not trying to degrade people I've trained with, but that is a great, Dean has an incredible amount and on top of that Dean kind of knows my escapes.

Speaker 5:          02:07:27       So whereas if I roll with a random other really good, you know, worldclass black belt, they might not know the particulars of my escape. Dean actually does those and he's good and he's good at it. So you're right in that the more you train with people that are better than you, you're, your defense is going to be very good. Cause like when you mount me, I mean you've got a good solid mountain, but I'm not, I'm like, I'm like, okay cool. I'm going to be out of this and in a short period of time with, with no real threats, keep telling me and the re uh, you've had, I mean, I'm sure it's the same way if you've got dean mountain on you. I mean my mouth, because I don't have a great mouth. My mouth is nothing compared to deans. Nothing. Yeah, yeah. Fully.

Speaker 5:          02:08:07       Yeah, that's absolutely true. And at the same time though, so if you fall it, and I don't want to say it's like a small thing because it's pretty big chance where if you enter a beginner class, there's going to be a guy who's just as much of a beginner is you. And that's where you can really flourish because you're, you can practice moves your new moves, which I mean, for lack of better term, your junk moves, you know, junk people. I will say this though, whoever you roll with, whether they're worse than you, the same as you or better than you, you're going to get a lot out of it. Of course, all three of them. So you should roll with all three of those types of people. I have a tendency to want to usually roll with guys that are, you know, light good and, and I should spend more than I do.

Speaker 5:          02:08:52       I mean, I definitely, I trained with everybody that we got at the gym. I'll turn him and everybody, but I always prefer, of course, I guess I shouldn't say of course, because there are people that are like white belt hunters that want to go out there and be bullies. I'm not like that. I'd rather get bullied. Right. I want to get, I want to feel the, I want to get after it, you know? Uh, but you definitely get benefit from training with people that are better than you. Worse than you, and the same as you because you practice one of them. You're practicing defense, one of them. You're practicing pure offense and someone that's equal than you. You got to start practicing your setups and, and your approaches and you got to learn how to defend and do offense and defense at the same time.

Speaker 5:          02:09:31       So it's all good, bro. Yeah. That's basically the concept here. Roll after it. Consider that scenario. You roll with it and you're talking from an ideal standpoint, role with people better than you, same as your worst in you or you know, not as good as you. Um, for a beginner, that's not really the option. The worst than you guys. That's not an option for a beginner. Like really, and also there's no one that's worse than them. Well, as far as overcoming the frustrations or whatever, it is a good situation where you can get in with guys just as beginner as you and, and it helped that they hang around and listen after a certain amount of time. Those guys who aren't as new or, or I could, I could see where it could become frustrating if you were the guy that you're talking about earlier. Let's say a guy that's, you have to work late and you can only go to the advanced class and all of a sudden you think Jujitsu is just getting crushed and destroyed. They can't learn this really, I guess, the distance to, to understand. But yeah, that's, that's a good point. So keep in mind that if you're in that situation, it's okay. You're gonna, you're going to, when you eventually get to roll with people that are more your skill level, you will be,

Speaker 1:          02:10:33       uh, you'll be that much better off. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. And, and watch the first time you tap someone out with the move that you learned. Celebrate that. Did you, yeah, that's a good, that's a good time. Next question, Jocko. How do you balance the idea of checking the ego well in an interview scenario where you need to talk about yourself? Okay. So good, good question. I would say in that situation, and that's something that it's not just an interview situation where you're going to need to do that. I mean, you're dealing with your, your superiors, you know, throughout the course of your career, whatever that may be. You're constantly interacting with people and you of, you're going to want to make an impression. Uh, so I think one of the best ways to do this is instead of,

Speaker 2:          02:11:28       okay,

Speaker 1:          02:11:28       you speaking about why you're so awesome, just state facts of let's say accomplishments and let them speak for themselves. In other words, you know, you wouldn't want to say, uh,

Speaker 1:          02:11:45       Yup, I am the best project manager in the entire world. Right. That's not, that's sounds ego centric. You know, instead you'd say, uh, you know, I got this a, we had a $38 million project, got it done on time, under budget, ahead of schedule. And when I got done with that, when they moved me to another project that was off track and we got that one back on schedule and back on track as well. So that, that's the kind of experience that I've had and I, and above to bring that here to this company. Right. So you're not, you're not,

Speaker 1:          02:12:19       you know, there's a hint of, hey, this is what I did. I can get some stuff done, but you're not saying, listen, I'm better than the people you currently have, so you should hire me because I'm the best cause you don't want to do that. Um, and you know, so, so yeah, just build, think about it, you know, before you go in, how, what, what experience that you have represents the good qualities that you have. So then you can say, if they say, you know, how are you at meeting timelines? You don't say I am perfect and we're never late dope. You just say you say you say, well you know, as far as meeting timelines, here's a bunch of projects that I got completed on time. The only one that I missed was one that we had to roll back cause whatever that we are actually showing a little bit more humility.

Speaker 1:          02:13:02       You're saying, hey, here's what happened. You're being logical about it and you'll speak to that. I actually got a good question that's similar to this one. Um, about what's the best way to interview people to see if they can be in a leadership position. And this is really hard. This is really hard because it's really hard to interviews and working. I work with all kinds of different companies and everybody always has, you know, hey, what's the best way to interview? And Man, I interviewed this guy and he seems so great. Or I interviewed this woman and she seemed incredible and her, her paper look great. You know, she looked great on paper and we hired her and she's a disaster. He's a disaster or whatever the case may be. Because, because there's people that are very good interviewers, right? I mean there's people that can interview well they have the gift of Gab, they can, they can bs their way through anything and make themselves sound good.

Speaker 1:          02:13:48       So it can be really hard to identify if someone's good is actually going to be fit for a leadership position or really any position. So one of the things that I was telling people to do is it, when you go into these, when you want to ask interview questions, ask them scenario based questions and say, okay, here's what's going on. You've got these three people in your department and one of the people has come to you and said that they think there might be something illegal going on in with the other two. What actions do you take? And you know, have a scenario built out that you can actually talk through and see where they go and see what their mindset is and see what they're going to develop as a plan. And see how they would execute the plan. So it's a great way of figuring out how people think.

Speaker 1:          02:14:34       And then you know, even that's not a guarantee because there's people that can, can navigate those types of answers as well. So, you know, one thing you can do is hire people on a little bit of a trial basis. And that can be difficult in some situations where people are walking away from one job to another job or they're not going to do it on a 90 day trial basis. But when you do have that opportunity, it's a good thing to do as well. Um, but hey, so going back to the first question about keeping your ego in check and an interview, like I said, be confident but not cocky and let the facts of your experience speak for your, your abilities rather than beating your own chest.

Speaker 4:          02:15:13       Yeah. So it's almost like, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong here, still you, you essentially, even if you're talking yourself up, you just, you simply state the fact that you just state the fact, don't say your opinion about it.

Speaker 1:          02:15:27       Just simply state the facts. Here's what I did, you know, we turned this project around, we got it on, on track and on budget. And that's the type of, that's the type of experience that I have in those situations. Right.

Speaker 4:          02:15:38       Just like how you're saying like even if someone has got like an award to be the best, whatever salesman of the year, the right tells me that you're the best whatever of the year. And then, um, like to say that in a factual way would be, I was recognized as the best guy in the world instead of saying I'm the best guy in the world who my award to to prove it, you know? So it's like you're seeing the fact that you were recognized, you know, not so much the fact that a way of doing it stick to the facts. Right. Just the facts. Just the facts. It's good. Yeah. Sure. Next question. Um, how do you stay humble when you know you have better skillsets than others? You seem humble with all that you've accomplished. Well, this is just what like in general, just holiday back, be humble. How'd you stay humble when you know you have better skill sets than, and

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       then he's saying that I seem humble with all that I've accomplished, which is, which is actually, it's funny when I read that, like it's not, I'm sure that for the dude is asking this question, he's thinking I accomplished all this stuff and it's not, I don't feel that way. Like first of all, there's always somebody that's better than you. That's D. I guarantee it. There's someone that's done more than you. There's someone that's had better experiences, someone that's accomplished more and, and if you are truly the master of some thing, whatever one thing you're a true master of, there's going to be people that are a lot better at other things than you. So you might be the master of one particular thing, but are you, you have to respect the fact that people are going to be masters at other things or better than you'd think.

Speaker 1:          02:17:26       I mean, so if you're super strong, that's great. Let's see. You run a marathon. If you're super flexible, awesome. How much can you dead lift if you're, if you're smart, that's great. You're smart academically, let's check out your common sense and see where all that at. You know, so, so you, you, you are going to be good at one thing, but you're going to have failed in other areas or have weaknesses in other areas. And so you just have to keep that in check. And I'll tell you like, I recognize why I've been successful, you know, for one thing, been surrounded with great people, for others being lucky in certain situations that I've been in certain times. And you know, going back to Jujitsu a little bit, it's a good example because just because I can beat someone in Jujitsu, it doesn't mean that I'm a better person.

Speaker 1:          02:18:24       Yeah, it does. It doesn't mean that I'm a better person. It what it means basically is that I happen to get into this random fringe sport before they did and I spent more time on the math and they did. That's what it means. It doesn't make me a better person. And I'll tell you what it goes with. You know, if you're, if you feel like you're smarter than someone, it's probably because you've had the opportunity to study a subject or you've had a bunch of education on something or you've, you've dove into some subjects. So that might make you seem smarter. Whereas if they applied themselves and that particular because what they were applying themselves to something else. So yeah, stay, you gotta stay humble with that. And also when we talked about those are when you fo [inaudible], I am smarter than this person. Well guess what?

Speaker 1:          02:19:15       There's something, there's still something that they're better than you and what is it? You might be smarter than him, but guess what? Maybe the guy we talked about earlier where I'm smart as I can be, guess what? This person can physically take me down and dominate me and that's horrible. Or they're better at whatever, better athletically. Or some people are really good craftsman with their hands. I mean, there's so many different things you can be skilled at. And if you start thinking that yourself, that you're, that you're better than other people, you're going to have issues because in the long run you want to stay humble. Just stay alive because life will humbly humble you. Life is hard. And if you're pushing hard and you're driving hard and you're trying to achieve a lot, you're not always going to win. I don't care who you are.

Speaker 1:          02:20:01       You going to get humbled. It's going to be hard. So many, so many people that are successful, they've got some hard luck stories along the way of things that they had to push through and overcome in order to get there. They got humbled. And if you're winning every single time, then you're, you're not, your goals aren't high enough. So step those up. So, you know, I appreciate the, the kind of comment, but um, man, it's not hard to be humble when you know, you can, you just take like maybe someone I didn't, you know, people always think, oh, oh, he's a navy seal or whatever. Um, you know, there's a lot of seals that are more badass than me that done more deployments that have gotten after it more than me. And I know that, that, that, that's awesome. I mean, good, good for them.

Speaker 1:          02:20:54       I, you know, they got after it good. Um, so I don't feel like, oh, I did more than everybody. No, there's no one like that. There was no one like that. Even even, uh, you know, Mikey Thorton who will seal that won a medal of honor, awesome guy of, uh, you know, just to, just to, you know, he's a, he's a hero, but if, you know, when he gets interviewed, I've watched a bunch of interviewed here, heard him talk, he's like, you know, he's like, oh, you know, you, you, you got the medal of honors x, not mine. It's my guys. You know, it's the guys I was with. It represents all. So there's a guy like, who's going to be, if there's anyone in the world needs to, that could not be humble. Maybe it's Mikey Thorton, but guess what Mikey Thornton, he's as humble as they come, because you know what?

Speaker 1:          02:21:40       He also has been humbled by combat cause he realized there's things that he tried to do that he didn't get done. There's blinds, he tried to save that he couldn't save. So you're Gunna, there's no doubt if you're living the right life, you're going to be humbled by it. And there's always, always, always going to be somebody that's better than you that's done. But then you, so just stay humble. And by the way, what does being cocky gets you anyways? What does that turn you into? What I talked about last time, what is, what is overconfidence gets you, you start cutting corners, you start to slack. I mean it's just ridiculous. So you got to stay humble. You've got to stay hungry. If you, if you want to stay in the game and believe me, you want to stay in the game on if you want to stay in the game. Did he think that

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       like, and I can't, I mean, I don't know if maybe this is where this even the question is coming from, but if, you know, when you're insecure and at you like you're just like everything's a competition. Like, just in life, it's, it's like, it goes beyond just what you're into. It's just like, if someone's better than me feel, it makes me mad. It makes you uneasy or whatever. It's like this insecurity kind of thing. So when you do, it's like if you look at everything is just this big life compare. Like I got to beat that guy gotta be better than them. So when you are better than them, it's like you're still looking at it as this competition. Like, Eh, you know, like you're not on my level, so you don't deserve to be treated. It's kind of like maybe this good analogy, maybe not, but like in Jujitsu where if you roll with a white belt, you don't go hard, you don't get satisfaction or whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:23:13       So in the Jujitsu competition arena, you're not giving them the respect. You're not going all out like you would, you know, you're not respecting his arm bar. You know, if you are, you're smashing him. No satisfaction, you know, whatever. It's in that specific competition setting. But if you're just an insecure person where you think that all life is like just one big competition, you've got to smash that person. And if you're not worthy of my smashing, it's like I don't even treat you like you should be on the mats with the kind of saying cool, but may, I mean, do you think that maybe that's where some of that comes from? Like if you're having trouble, like being humble, it's kind of like I'm better than you in life

Speaker 5:          02:23:53       driven from intercity insecurity, but there's also a way, uh, there's a dichotomy there too because man, I like to win. Like, like no doubt about it. I like to win in the dichotomy of it is, is that I also don't literally don't care. Like if I get beat, I'm like, okay, well what can I do to get better? It's not, I don't feel this despair because I lost. Losing actually kind of motivates me more. Yeah. As opposed to getting angry. And the worst thing that happens is people decide they're not going to compete. Right. They're not going to compete in the game of life because they didn't win or they don't feel like they can win. So they go, ah, you know what? I'm just gonna, I'm just going to back off. I'm just not going to participate in the game. But getting the game get in the game theme.

Speaker 4:          02:24:45       So maybe it comes from not understanding what that means when you win and stuff. I guess. I guess like let's say like the fight back to the fighting situation where the about, you know, being a secure part of the males, balancing real psyche. If you know that you've achieved these skills, have these skills to when people, you know who, who don't have your skillset, you don't want to fight them. So you're just like, whatever. But let's say like you, you have a better skillset yet you're still blowing your horn about your skillset. You know, you're not humble about it. It's, it's

Speaker 5:          02:25:24       like he comes from maybe, I don't know, something. There's no doubt there can be some insecurity that charges, that makes people super competitive beyond healthy, competitive, just like in life, like just in life, you know? No matter what, which again, there's people that are that way, myself included. And, but again, the dichotomy is I don't think you're like, no, no, I, I, I know I am. Well, how can I in the know I am remember echelon front, remember the logo? Yeah. Right. And I'm going to post this on Twitter to Jocko made the original echelon front logo Liz like long time ago. And you're like, hey, you know, this is the logo, something like this. And then basically you, but you didn't care that it was junk. No, no. But I, all I want to do is get you the idea. You weren't competing with me, but you drew and I drew.

Speaker 5:          02:26:17       But like, like as someone who's competing in everything in life, like if you draw something and I draw something and you're like, I want to make mine better. No, no, no, no. But well, uh, see I wanted to win with the idea, not with the skill, the idea of the war. I wanted to win the war, not the short term battle. It's like who can draw this thing better? That the war was who comes up with a strategic victory, which the icon and the symbol for echelon front is the one that I drew. I liked it.

Speaker 5:          02:26:48       So yes, I didn't care that it looked like junk cause I'm not, I was did it what you should post docs is pretty fun. I did it on PowerPoint with like a, like a Cran, it looks like a crayon cause I, I didn't want to take as much time with it. I know, I knew that that thing would take you 15 minutes to make on your, what is it? Ai Ill illustrator that might have been with don't be mad at me. That's probably the first logo I've ever actually made. Hmm. Maybe hey, there you go. Cool. Thanks for trusting me.

Speaker 5:          02:27:24       Next question. What do you do when you have two extreme ownership believers that have to go against each other? Ooh, sounds like a big challenging question, but it actually shouldn't be because if you think about this, if you truly think about this, this should not be an issue and here's why. Go against each other, against each other. So what are the goals are, are these two people on the same team? I'm assuming that they're on the same team right there on the same team. So if they're on the same team and we want to win, we have the same goals. We want to win, but we won't work together because if the goal is to win and we both want to win, why would we be going against each other? We are not taping, taking actual extreme ownership because if you and I were had opposing ideas, but we had those same longterm goal, I'm going to take ownership and say, all right, echo, we got to come to terms here.

Speaker 5:          02:28:25       We're going to work this out. We got to fix it. If you were doing the same thing, you'd be like, yeah, absolutely. Let's sit down. Let's figure this out. Let's figure out what's going to be the best. Let's take two mark. Let's do a market says we're going to figure out a real solution because we're taking ownership of it. So what's the little nugget that's getting into the system here in screwing things up? It's Edd. Go 100% and I will say this occasionally, the idea of extreme ownership can be very poorly and very incorrectly interpreted as micromanagement and Egomania meaning like, I'm going to own this, I own this. This is mine, right? We're not, that's not what extreme ownership is at all. It's you. You've got to own everything, but you don't, you don't feel the intrinsic need to do everything right cause you own.

Speaker 5:          02:29:18       It's like owning the outcome and the owning the progress and owning the steps along the way and owning the responsibility of mission achievement. It doesn't mean that you own each individual step and you have to make it your way. That's not extreme ownership. That's micromanagement. What you know, it's so extreme ownership is about leadership and decentralized command. Then using indirect tactics to make things happen in owning the outcome. So that's, that's why when you, if you have two people that were truly about like, Hey, I'm gonna own this, I'm going to do, I'm going to have the attitude of extreme ownership. If you and I have the attitude of extreme ownership, we're not going to fight over anything because we have the same long term goal and if you come up with a better idea of how to get there, I'm going to say, oh, Echo, awesome job.

Speaker 5:          02:30:18       That's a great way. We're going to get to where we want to go. We own that outcome. We're going to make it happen. Boom, I'm going to support you. The only time it's going to be a problem is if I have an ego and then you have an ego. When we both have an ego issue and and usually one person with a big ego, it that that inflames other people's he egos because if I say, hey, echo, I got a great plan for how to do this. We need to execute it my way. There's a little bit of ego coming out. It doesn't matter because now your ego was down, but I wasn't even really, what do you mean you're away? Right? Well, wait a second, just right there. Now we've got a thing. Now we've got some cop kind of issue going on. You know, we're now, we're working against each other instead of working together.

Speaker 5:          02:31:03       So that is, uh, that is absolutely problematic. And I guess to say, to put this in a nutshell, the Wifi, if you're using the principle of extreme ownership, the most important thing you to take extreme ownership of is your own ego and put that thing in check. Yeah. It seems like the extreme ownership as far as owning it is more, is essentially take responsibility, like at all costs kind of thing. For more like the, the bad stuff that happened, the bad stuff. Absolutely the best. What'd you know? But you're going to take week because absolutely. If you and I do something great together and I was the leader, I don't go, yes, that's right. I was the, I'm the, you know, you say, Hey, first of all, this was mostly on Echo. He did most of the work. He did all the, you know, that's what I'm going to say.

Speaker 5:          02:31:57       I'm not going to say no, this was mine. But when something goes wrong, obviously I don't say no. It was echo's fault number. I say, Hey, this was my fault. So, you know, I should have done double check on the audio before we started the podcast because, uh, you know, we wanted to make sure that thing was recording, right? I don't say no. Echo dropped the ball. Yeah, I don't do that on him. I said, hey, you should have double checked. So that's if you truly have to people that have real ownership and they put their egos in check, this is literally not an issue. Right? So they, yeah, this isn't even a question for that, right? Cause they don't go against each other. They're going with each other. And so what are the chances that you as a person that's really put your ego in check and you're exercising extreme ownership, what are the chances that you work with another person that is exactly with the same mindset taking ownership but no ego.

Speaker 5:          02:32:51       What, what are the chances that they're actually pretty slim? This is not easy to do this. It's simple. Not Easy, right? So that means you have to be even more proactive in helping adapt to their ego scenario that's happening. And when Echo says, hey, we need to do this my way, I'll be like, hey, you know what? Echo, let's take a look at it. Absolutely. You've always come up with great plans. Let's take a look at what this one is here. And all of a sudden I've disarmed you a little bit. You're feeling good about it. You're like, oh yeah, that's right. Jack was going to listen to me cause that's, that's great. That's exactly what I want you to think. It's exactly what I want you to think. So you're going to have work to do. You're going to have work to do that.

Speaker 5:          02:33:29       So that's what, that's what, that's what it is. It's a challenge. It's work. But when you have the basic principles, the, I shouldn't say basic, when you have the fundamental principles, they are going to work well for you. And when they're not working well for you, don't get mad at the other person and blame their ego. Look at your own ego because you can adjust and adapt and maneuver and get that person disarmed and you can flank them and then you're going to win. But that's so interesting that all of this question is like that. Like it seems like when, like when I first read it, I was like, oh shoot, that's a good question. You know, no one there. And it is, but in a different way, because this question is essentially what it does. Is it like, what do you call it? Like a strainer or whatever.

Speaker 5:          02:34:12       Like it shifted it SIF see strains out. The guy who's not doing extreme ownership, see how it says if they're both exercising it, but if they're going against each other, that means there's some extreme ownership not being practiced. Somewhere in here, we didn't know, but we're going to, we can find out. You know, who's going again to kind of thing. If they're both going against each other or maybe they both have it. You know what? There's always gonna be one person. Well, not always, but there's usually me one person that is got it. Okay. That understands it and that's going to be working in this guy. He's just so good and so smooth. It's so tactical and they're going to win. And that other person that's like, that's right. You know why we're winning. Cause I got extreme ownership going on and I, I took ownership of this project and you want the guy says they're good. Real. The real leader is like, absolutely man, you did a great job with that. And meanwhile he knows he just made his manipulated and flanked him and made it happen to the best of the best for the team. You know, just keeping the train going. That's good. Yeah. Interesting. Okay. I think we got it. Last question. Yeah. Just maybe one more, maybe a jacket. Can you talk about fear of failure in how to overcome it?

Speaker 1:          02:35:28       Fear of failure. So obviously fear of failure can, can keep you from taking risk. Yeah, they can leave you just sitting there paralyzed into not taking any action at all. And obviously that's bad, but I don't actually want you to overcome the fear of failure. I want, I want you to be afraid of failure. Fear of failure is good. Fear of failure. We'll keep you up at night. Planning in rehearsing and going over contingencies. Fear of failure will keep you training hard. It'll stop you from cutting corners. Fear, fear of failure will keep you working and thinking in striving and relentlessly trying to be more prepared for battle. So I want you to be afraid of failing. I fear failure, but more important. I want you to be horrified.

Speaker 5:          02:36:59       I want you to be terrified of sitting on your ass and doing nothing. That is what I want you to be afraid of, of waking up in six days or six weeks or six years or 60 years, okay?

Speaker 4:          02:37:15       In being no closer to your goal, you've made no progress.

Speaker 5:          02:37:21       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:37:22       that is the horror. That is the nightmare. That is what you need to be truly afraid of

Speaker 5:          02:37:34       being stagnant. So get up and go. Take the risk. Take the gamble, take the first step, take action. Don't let another day slip by. And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

Speaker 4:          02:38:13       And if you got something out of the podcast tonight, you want to hear some more,

Speaker 4:          02:38:18       well then maybe you should go ahead and support the podcast and echo. How can the troopers out there best support the podcast? Well, one of the or the initial way is to support yourself at the same time and that is to supplement on it on it has the best supplements. Uh, you know, it's one thing to say they have the best supplements because I like them, but they have for real, have the best supplement. Like the legit, you read all this stuff about it, it's straight up the best anyway. You want 10% off there. So support your wallet as well. So you're supporting podcasts yourself and your wallet. 10% off on it.com/josh. Yep. Solid. Um, also if you want to passively support, uh, you can do the Amazon click through. That's you got to one of the websites doc, podcast.com or chocolate or the chocolate store is the Amazon link on the top.

Speaker 4:          02:39:12       Now we have international cause there, um, every once in a while like who are overseas or you know, international. But Hey, what about this? Cause it's a, it's a long story, but we have everywhere overseas, it's Canada. Basically I started the ones that people have actually told me, you know, like, Hey, we're here in the UK, we want to, you know, be done with the thing or whatever. And yeah, so, so I did those and so those are up on both websites as well. Thanks for hitting me up with that by the way. Um, overseas support? Yes. Yes, fully. So dope. And also speaking of Amazon, the, the new trooper tool, that's pretty, it's a cool little tool. Thanks again Brady for that one. It genius and Jujitsu student by the way. Nonetheless, like this tool, you just click it. You got it. There's a link to it on things called the called the true chuck podcast trooper tool. Chrome extension. That's what it's called. Awesome. You Click on the thing, you just like you clean thing if you want and you click

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       on the thing, it shows up as a little icon. Jack was head and you can even hide that if you don't want it on your browser or whatever. You just hide it if you don't want it there. But it looks, I think it's kind of cool. It's up there or whatever. Anyway, it helps you go to aid, makes you good at Amazon. It helps it go through the affiliate link so you don't have to go through the website anymore. Does it automatically for you? Don't think it. Say it. Say some time. Uh, also, you know, of course subscribed to the iTunes and youtube. I think we're going to pump some more value in youtube, but some outtakes on there. I think I like that. I like where you're coming from. Yeah. I subscribe to the Youtube, the youtube channel. That would be cool. So we know that you're out there and you're going to receive these things that echo was putting together.

Speaker 5:          02:40:58       Yeah. And then also the uh, the Jocko podcast store. Yeah. If you like shirts, if you were sure it wasn't Jocko store chocolate store.com Jocko store.com. Yup. Some cool t shirts. I still, I their eyes delivered yet to see one in the wild. Not someone I know. So I'm looking forward to seeing that somewhere in the world, somewhere on planet earth. I am thoroughly enjoying the pictures that people sent their awesome, you know what's funny? The, the, the Heather Gray, right? Gray like that's the kind of shirt like you know, a lot of lighter colored shirt, they get real, um, like dark. If you sweat in them. There'll be like pictures where, I don't even know why I think this is funny, but it's interesting because the other one is charcoal gray. That's a dark gray. So they'll be like, yeah, I got my disability to, and they see the bottom line.

Speaker 5:          02:41:48       It looks like a stripe. I'm like, wait, what? That's weird how the lighting is. So there's a stripe on the bottom of your shirt, but it's not the charcoal gray one. It's the, you know, they, they were getting after it of getting after it is very much so. Anyway. I know why I thought that was funny, but it's, it looks funny. Not Funny, like I'm laughing at them, but it's interesting how it looks like a shirt then it's like an optical illusion. Anyway. Chocolate store.com. There's some other shirts on there if you like them. Coffee mugs and stickers. Awesome bumper stick. Also, if you like the podcast and you want more of this information, there's a book that I wrote with my brother Leif Babin. It's called extreme ownership. You can order it through Amazon or you can get anywhere books are sold. It's available in hard cover, digital and audio format and the audio format and Lafe and I actually read so get some of that.

Speaker 5:          02:42:39       If you want to talk to echo and I, you can find us on the interwebs at Twitter. Echo is an echo. Charles and I am at jockowillink. We're also on the Facebooky and some of that Instagram, I got a snapchat thing, I signed up for it or whatever, but I haven't done anything with it yet. Yeah, so I got to explore that. But man, the social media stuff takes time and, and I can't, if you want me find me on Twitter, that's the best way. Ask Your questions on Twitter. Hit me up on Twitter. That's the most common thing that I use. I do. I do check Facebook. I mean I read everything that has ever been sent to me. I've read, I might not have responded to it because I can't literally can't respond to every single thing that gets sent to me. Uh, which is what's nice about on Twitter.

Speaker 5:          02:43:39       I can just hit that. I like it, you know, so that people know like, oh he read it cool on Facebook. I read it, but there's nothing to press to say I read your thing. So, um, maybe I should figure something out like that. But anyways, it, you're solid on Twitter, you get back to people and stuff, which is cool cause there's some people you can tell it's not them, it's like their, their social media. Me and I was just out where I just was, there was very limited internet, so I was able to get like a tweet out in the morning, a couple of weeks out in the morning. But when I'd go to start responding, it was, you know, three minutes to, to look at the tweet from somebody. So I'm backed up right now for like five days, four days behind or something like that. Five days behind actually.

Speaker 5:          02:44:23       Yeah. Let's see. You mean? You're saying that like that you're like backed up. It means like your, you know your engagement and that's good, but even then I was reading and I do, man, if you send me something on Twitter, I'm going to see it. You want to read it. I might not respond to it directly, but I might have had a day actually more than once too, but I'm remembering a very specific time a day where I wasn't going to go to Jujitsu. I wasn't going to go. It was, you know, today's the breath, dare what? I Dunno, whatever. I wasn't going to go. We call it, we call that weakness. Maybe call it what you want. Nonetheless, when you see pictures of, I saw, I don't know that the name of the specific person, but I saw a picture first day of Jujitsu and I'm like, you know how you get that feeling when like let's say you weren't at Jujitsu and I took a picture of me on the Mat saying I'm here without Jocko.

Speaker 5:          02:45:12       I'll do that every once in a while to like my friends or I'm here without Jacquelyn's. You kind of like, you have this feeling like, Dang, I wish I was there right now just to whatever. I kinda got that feeling, that weird competitiveness you were talking about earlier. I want to be there with you maybe, maybe a little bit, oh by the way, I don't know if you knew this, you know like guys will be like, Hey I want to come visit you at, at the gym or went on. Right. And to me it's a guy showed up when I was out of town. Yeah. And that's, you know, I I I say the days like I go on this these days typically and whatever. So it just hit me up, whether it be on Twitter or whatever, if you're in town. And he did. And cause he, the reason that's significant, one of the main reasons what I said too, was he from Arizona?

Speaker 5:          02:45:50       So Arizona, his name is ab Ab. The man showed up rolled money. Yeah. So cause a lot of people in life, I'm not saying just on Twitter, I'm just seeing in life they always will be like, Hey, oh you do? Yeah. I'm going to combine, you can show me or all roll or whatever. And I would say a good 95 to 99% of the time they don't, they don't come. Yeah. Well a lot of times they're hitting you up from love plays her farther than the way than, than Arizona. I'm even talking about like before the podcast and stuff, I'm saying like your friends, you know. Oh, just, Oh, whatever, you know. Yeah. I'm going to come check it out. Sounds cool. You know, and they never had this dude rolled before. Ab Ab ab. Um, was he uh, he's a uh, yeah, he was like a three straight white belt or something like that. Yeah. Nice guy. You know, he's cool. What's up baby man? Thanks for coming. Um,

Speaker 1:          02:46:47       yeah. And, and obviously just want to

Speaker 5:          02:46:52       give a shout out. We talked about some soldiers today, but I want to give a thanks. All the police out there. I hear a lot from police officers all over the country and thanks to you guys for doing your duty to keep us safe. Same thing for the firefighters. I've actually hearing a lot from five. There's all kinds of firefighters and all you guys are protecting us on the home front, obviously much appreciated and then course the military folks out there, especially those that are deployed right now, taking the fight, hey

Speaker 1:          02:47:22       to the enemy, be aggressive and crush him and we'll see you when you get home. And finally to all the 12 the Jocko podcast troopers out there. Thank you for the support across the board with all of us. We appreciate it. And what we really appreciate more than anything is you out there in your life taking ownership of your world and getting after it. So until next time, this is echo and Jocko out.
