Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number one 18 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. I need a mission. We all need a mission. That's what life should be is a mission. That's what gives your life purpose and focus and drive and ultimately satisfaction. Now that mission can be the job you work at. It can be providing for your family or it can be getting better at Jujitsu or stronger at Olympic lifting or starting a business that you want to grow and build and take over the world. And sometimes people ask me what to do if they don't know what their mission is or what their mission should be. And I tell them if they're in that situation to go help someone, go help someone else. Make that your mission because that will make you better. It'll make the world better. And eventually from that you'll see what your mission is. Now I was lucky because from a young age I had a mission. I want it to be some kind of commando. And eventually I ended up hearing about the seal teams and decided that that was the best place for me. And that's where I went.

Speaker 1:          00:02:00       And once I got to the seal teams, I had a new mission, which was to prepare for war. And that's what we did. And then eventually war came. And then that was the mission to take the fight to the enemy to close with and destroy them through close combat. And that's what we did. But eventually for me and for everyone in the military, it ends maybe because of retirement or maybe because of family obligations or maybe for medical reasons, but for every warrior, eventually the war ends

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       and that career ends. And that mission ends. And I've talked a lot on this podcast about how important it is to find a new mission. Once the war is over for you and you've done your part, you have to find a new mission.

Speaker 3:          00:03:26       Well tonight we have a guest on

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       who pursued much the same mission as me for as long as he could and who has now found a new mission that he is on.

Speaker 3:          00:03:45       So

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       Dan Crenshaw, welcome to the podcast. Thanks Jack. [inaudible]. Pleasure to be here with you. Real honor. Thanks for coming on. And let's just start at the beginning a little bit for people that don't know who you are. Let's talk a little bit about, I guess we'll talk about Katy, Texas and at the same time also include Ecuador and Columbia about your childhood. Absolutely. Well, like you said, I grew up in Katy, Texas, um, at six generations of and flowing through me and my dad's side of the family. And, uh, my dad was in the oil and gas industry our whole lives. So when you hear the things about a Ecuador and Colombia and even Egypt in Scotland, that goes all the places we lived over the years. Um, because it is a cause of his career. Everybody and anybody in the oil and gas industry in Texas knows that it's, it's a pretty common theme.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       Um, you know, I like to talk about some of the challenges that I went through from an early age and uh, what kind of, what drove me or it may be, and maybe drove my, that, that get past that mental capacity that you need to become a seal. And um, that started with my mother and my mother got, um, diagnosed with breast cancer and I was five years old and she fought it hard for five years and she never quit. She never complained. I never saw it. And if she did, I never saw it. And um, and she just took care of me and my brother every day right up until the end. Man. Now she eventually lost that battle when I was 10 years old, 1994. But she instilled in me, you know what I, what I think are American and Texas values of integrity, respect and it just never quit. Never quit no matter what. And don't feel sorry for yourself. Um, cause she never did. She truly never did. And she asked where she told me before she died that I would sort of great heights and I don't know what that meant at the time. Um, but I think we know now, and I'm not long after that, you know, when I could start reading books and m and uh,

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       in grabbed the first navy seal Dick Marcinko novel rogue warrior that I could be, your book wasn't out yet, taco otherwise maybe I'll, yeah, rogue warrior that, that, that came out when I was already in it. Matter of fact, it came out right as I showed up at the teams. It, I'm pretty sure that's right when it came out and obviously created some turmoil and the teams, but it was pretty interesting, especially because I knew guys that had worked for, for Dick Marcinko and that was pretty interesting to talk with them. And, and to be totally frank with you, most of the guys that work for Dick Marcinko loved him. And, and as a matter of fact, one of them, a couple of the guys that I respect, my, there's one guy as a matter of fact, that that I work for. And this was a couple of years later. It's a matter of fact, it was around 1994 because I was in a seal platoon and I was talking to this guy that had worked for, for Dick Marcinko and I said, hey, you know, how was Dick Marcinko?

Speaker 4:          00:06:56       I wasn't to work for him. And he looked at me, he said, best CEO ever. Yeah. And this was from a guy that I have utmost respect for. So I thought that was pretty cool. Even though you know his book, you know, the book is, it's, I'd say it's a Hollywood ish book. And, and you know the, the statement in there that everyone always laughs about in the teams is the statement that every seal on his team could bench press 500 pounds. The number game. We're not going, we're not even going to make it realistic. We're not going to make it realistic. And we're just going straight to 500 pounds, everyone on the team. And that's just a patently untrue. And what sucks is when you do that with that thing, well then you, then people start looking at the book and going, well, what is true and what is not?

Speaker 4:          00:07:40       Right. So, and although from the way it's been described to me, the events in that book, a lot of them are compiled. So like this little thing happened on a training event and this thing happened on training event and this thing happened on a training event, but they'd all be compiled into one big story. And yeah, so it's kind of like a Hollywood, it's a book. It's a nonfiction ish. 10 year old Ben Crenshaw. I didn't know that. He was like, I'm going to bench 500 pounds. No problem. Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be here without the, that series of books, frankly. I probably still have two eyes, but no, nobody. That's a luxury that we'll get to that in a little, in a little bit. Um, so yeah, I mean that, you know, once you've, once that and you know this and most seals operate this way or at least they have this same story of we had, it was from a young age I had a mission.

Speaker 4:          00:08:34       Um, I knew what it was and every decision I made from, from then until the moment I got into Bud's was, was, was just to prepare for that. Now when you, did you, I know you lived overseas, what, where'd you go to high school? So most of high school and Columbia. Okay. What did you play sports down there? I played soccer. Okay. Yeah. Cause you were in Colombia have kind of like what they had to play soccer or volleyball. I played volleyball. And then you applied from college? From Colombia, yeah. Okay. This is, this is kind of an important question because a lot of people ask me this question all the time. You were definitely want it to be a seal. What made you make the decision between going to college and you ended up going to Tufts? Yeah. Ended up in Massachusetts. So at some point you said to yourself, okay, I could enlist tomorrow and go to bootcamp and you know, be a seal within the year, or I can go to college for four years and then apply and I'll be in an officer in a leadership position.

Speaker 4:          00:09:40       I could ask that question all the time. For me, when I was 18 years old, the answer was real easy. Like, oh, I can be a seal of in a year, sign me up. And, and that's what I did. And for you, you obviously took a different approach and people ask me all the time, which one is better? And I think I tell them that there's advantages and disadvantages to both of them. But what made you decide you're gonna go officer style from the get go? Um, maybe along with my mission of being a seal my whole life, the a similar mission of I wanted a college degree as well. I wanted to knock that out. And um, and then, you know, I wasn't well informed enough to, to really speak about the difference between officer and enlisted back then, like I am now. Um, but I did want a leadership role.

Speaker 4:          00:10:24       It was important to me based on what I'd read. And based on the movies I'd seen that I was in a leadership role. Did you see navy seals? Was that, that's nice. That's Lafe baboons answer to why you became a seal straight up. He's like, Oh yeah, Charlie Seals Charlie Sheen gets out of, I'd be that, didn't just see it, you know, we had it on all the time. Greatest movie ever. Um, it, you know, it was so a combination of wanting a leadership role, um, maybe knowing too, was I really ready at age 18? I knew I wanted it, but I am also, I also wanted to be prepared and it was able to think ahead enough to know that maybe I can't swim all that great just yet. We might need some more practice. Um, but uh, but it was mostly like, it was mostly, I'm going to go to college first, then my life path, that's what I'm going to do.

Speaker 4:          00:11:17       And so that's what I did. And I ended up at Tufts University mostly because of its international relations program. I was that, that was my focus. It was foreign affairs, international relations, politics and a, and I did a minor in physics just because, why not? Cause that sounds like fun. Yeah, it's awesome. Speak Spanish obviously from, from growing up in Columbia too. Are you fluent in Spanish? Pretty fluently. It's kind of a little rusty but we're weak. And you did ROTC at? Yes. Was there any seals? They're like a prior seals that were instructors or anything like that? No, I, well no, there, there was at Harvard. So a lot of these guys doing master's programs while we're doing ROTC, they're not attached to the unit. But I did have the opportunity to work with some guys and um, you know, just get that mentorship. You just, hey, this is the kind of workouts you might want to be doing.

Speaker 4:          00:12:11       I mean, just the basics cause you just have no idea going into it. Do you think kids over prepare for buds now? Um, I think it depends on the kid. I often mentor guys who want to go through and you know that sometimes they do focus a little bit too much on, especially things that are good at, like I'm running 10 miles a day. It's kind of like a five minute pace. I'm like, stop running, never run again. You know, you're good at that and move on to the next thing. Uh, you know, focus on your weaknesses. It, look, guys just don't understand the little little basics. I don't know if they overtrain I haven't worked with enough to really know, but I talked to people and they send me messages all the time and they're on this two year training program to get ready for buds and I'm like, hey, train for two months and then go, don't, it's not that hard if you played a sport in college or have you played a sport in high school and you can run like you'll get in good shape there and it's going to be a challenge.

Speaker 4:          00:13:08       But waiting around, especially when there's a war going on that you don't really want to miss. Yeah, that's a big deal to me. You know, and I told these guys this war's not going to last forever. And you know, I showed up at the team in 1991 just missed the first call for it. And it's, you know, we, I, I didn't shoot my weapon at the enemy for 13 years and that's a long, dry hard 13 years. And so, yeah, you don't wanna miss out on that snow. You don't, one of my old team guy buddies, it was like 1971 and, and he loved, he thought the Vietnam War was going to end and he's down at the Marine Corps Recruiter Tang. I want to be a door gunner. Huey. It's interesting that there's the, you know, you always hear about the protesters and whatnot, but there's kids that want to fight.

Speaker 4:          00:13:57       Oh yeah. We do have, there's a warrior class in America that I think we should be proud of and it'd be proud to be a part of because it's a, they're good people with good values and they want to do the right thing for the country. So you show up the buds so you get to be good done with college. College is college, right? Is there anything particularly you want to say about college? No. Okay. Well cool. We want to hear about college happened college. And so you show up at buds and any issues at buds. Yeah. Um, you know, I started my, I started with class two, six, one about Tuesday afternoon of my first hell week. My, I stress fractured, developed into a pretty noticeable fracture. And uh, I got the old question, are you hurt? Are you injured, Mr Crenshaw? And you really want to be injured because you better not

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       just be hurt because then you're just quitting. And uh, I was, I was injured pretty substantially. I mean, you know, I mean, we stress fractures are pretty normal injury in buds. Okay. So you, so when I'm sitting here talking about people don't prep enough, you're like, actually you should prep more. Do you think you could have run more preparing for bucks? I would have. I ran plenty. I would've, uh, I would've focused a little bit more on strength and conditioning. You know, something I just didn't know how to do back then. Right. Because what happens in buds as you, I mean, you're going to go to failure and w you're going to go to failure no matter what you're in. It's going to happen on the hour, every hour, maybe every 10 minutes, all the time. So the guys who overprepare, they, they can't understand why they're failing so much.

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       Right. And that, that messes with their heads. So maybe that's what you mean by overpreparing cause that, that's what I mean by like, I think, I think guys get too confident in their abilities and they just don't understand why they're hitting a wall all the time where it's like guys like me are just like, I just, I just, I expected to suck, so it's really not a surprise. Um, but we're just going to keep trying no matter what and just never quit. And quitting is never an option. The other problem is if you over prepare, it may be, it becomes an option. This isn't the case for everybody, but I see some of the best in shape guys quit because it was just, they were like, maybe it was an option for them. Like maybe I'll make it, maybe I won't. But if you, you should never go into bud's thinking that way.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       And um, that's why a lot of guys who make it through, I think have this story that, well, I wanted to do it since I was 10 years old. So it was just never an option for me to ever quit. So yeah, you do need prepare enough to make sure your, your muscles when they do fail aren't putting all the strain on your joints and your knees. And that's what happened to me because it just happened over time and over time you're limping a certain way and that just, that causes a fracture eventually cause there's too much pressure being put on your bones. So, you know, or I just had a week genetics, which is like one story where likely answer, I got rolled back, I came back again with two, six, four. And um, you know, you know, you know, there's the two mile run you do in hell week.

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       It's like Tuesday or so if how we can, it's a time you went through a long time ago. Well it's like a Tuesday or something and it's a time to run and if you, and if you get in the top five, you don't have to do it again and then everybody else has to do it all over again and you get to rest under a boat and you know, eat sand or whatever. They let you do much on that sand over there. At, uh, my first hell week I was dead last. I mean just we'll way be like not even close. Right. Cause I was limping the whole time and my second hell week I was, I was first placed by maybe five minutes, you know, and maybe cause I knew what the game was, but everybody does actually because the word gets around it, you know that it's, but it was, it was, it was a message maybe to myself of like we're gonna, we're gonna not only do this but we're going to crush it and I'm going to feel good about it and I'm going to rest under that boat and eat my sand

Speaker 4:          00:17:49       while everybody else is running the, frankly, it was really cold. So I kind of wish I'd been running at the time, but whatever I want, the closest store I have to that is we got done with a four mile time, Brian. And when we got done that people that failed and I didn't fail, but there was a bunch of people that failed. And the instructor who is a really a perfect instructor, meaning that his attitude and the way he carried himself was epic for buds. And he was the senior chief of the phase. It was dive phase. And the guys come across and he's collecting the guys that fail, which was probably at least half of the class and then, you know, he says, you know, because I'm fair, I'm gonna go ahead and let you do this time. Don't again get on the line, ready, go.

Speaker 4:          00:18:36       And everyone had to run another four mile time to run. Right. Well not us, but the people that, the people that passed got to not be, but the people that didn't pass, which was half the class, had to go and just run another form of time to run right then to see if they could then pass it. Much easier to pass. Eighth Mile. You're definitely doing a lot better after you've put out as hard as you possibly good for a four mile run, which I actually had to do every time I failed to run and I failed one run in bugs. I paced myself. I said, well, you know what? I'll just pace myself. I'm not going to put out as hard as I as a kind of, I'll, I'll save a little bit for later and that didn't work. I failed because I'm not a fast runner.

Speaker 4:          00:19:12       And so from then on it was just a sprint. As hard as I could go for the whole damn time, unlike you, I didn't win any races in buds. That's literally not. So you get done with and you show up. So now it's 2000 and what? What year is it a, this is 2007 2007 yeah. Finishing bugs 2007 and I'm moving in SQT Oh, that's right, Leif Babin putting me through [inaudible] nice. You know, I was, I was, I was indoctrinated early on bruiser stories. Jack, Jack, and that's awesome. And then from there you rolled two team three, team three, team three with collusion in 2008 and then I'm back in Ramadi in 2010 with a tribe platoon, you know, your little troupe, you know, going back to life, running that course. It was interesting because what that course used to be was almost like an administrator course, hey, here's how you write evils.

Speaker 4:          00:20:09       And they had a little tiny bit of dashing of, of, of tactics in it, but it was, here's how you read, right evils, here's how you write navy messages and just that kind of stuff. Yeah. And you know, we knew that these kids needed to train because I, in Ramadi, I had guys that were the first platoon guys out, ground force commanders and we wanted to make sure these guys knew what to do on the battlefield and it was awesome that lake and went there and started rehashing that program and the, and did a great job. I think it was very valuable. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, so then you got done with that, then you showed up at team three and you went right on deployment. Right. I mean, the three was already on deployment,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       so they had just deployed, you know, and you know how that goes. Um, the cycle of graduates. So we met up with team three. I was in Fallujah for a little while. Uh, it was done in Bosnia for few months and actually stayed on deployment to meet up with team five and, and, um, and, and help them transition. You know, as we were setting up another, uh, uh, debt out there and Bosnia, um, great, great first deployment and learned a lot and got to work a little bit and uh, then came back to Iraq in 2010 and another great deployment for me because I was able to take over as platoon commander, uh, when my platoon OIC had to go to relieve another platoon OIC. So we were going through the entire targeting cycle, working with multiple Iraqi partners throughout Ramadi and throughout all, all of Al Anbar. We got to operate throughout the entire province even a little bit in Baghdad. So, uh, just an amazing experience for young Jio who wouldn't normally be put in that position. And, uh, working with some of the best people I've ever met. You know, we've talked about before. Uh, I won't name names on the, uh, on the podcast,

Speaker 4:          00:21:54       you know. Well, your OIC was, it was a great guy that got moved. That's why he got moved and obviously they had confidence in you too, to move you up in to the platoon commander position, which is an interesting thing. I had a group of business people and they, they, there was a guy that kept saying, well, no one can take my place, you know, and then he was surprised that he wasn't getting promoted. And you explain to people, if you don't have a person below you in the chain of command or two or three people below you in the chain of command that can take your job, well then you're going to have to stay in your job and you're not going to get promoted. So that, that's, that's proof that you're OIC. Like I said, he's a great guy, actually. He's supposed to come on the podcast at some point, but he's a great guy and he had groomed you and taught you everything he could do and, and made you ready and trusted you to say when the, when the boss came to him and said, Hey, I've got to fire a guy.

Speaker 4:          00:22:46       I'm going to move you over to Afghanistan. Is Your, is your AYC ready to take over? And he could constantly say yes, he is. And that's, that's awesome. And that shows that he was a great leader too, to kind of prepare you properly for that situation.

Speaker 2:          00:23:02       That's a good point. I mean, that is, that is part of leadership and management. It's making sure that below you and above you is squared away. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:23:10       And I would do that when I was running training, I would always kill, you know, theoretically or what does it virtually kill the commander's. Yeah. All of us. The 10 sometimes I'd kill all of you that I remember. Yeah. There'd be some, some somebody carries happening for extended distances. Uh, yeah, I was a little bit, I was a little bit crazy at that point and, and you know, I was good training. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's, uh, I was coming home from Ramadi and I wanted to make sure you guys were ready to ready for the worst possible case, you know? Um, so then you get, so you do that, you finished out that deployment. That was a solid deployment. You were, you were running a bunch of stuff that, that sounds like a good deal then what'd you do when you came back? So he came back, um, moved over to support activity one.

Speaker 4:          00:24:01       And as you know, they, they run intelligence support operations for the seal teams. Uh, it's, it's a fairly normal transition to make as an officer and for a lot of guys too. Um, but what that ended up w would really what that translated into his back on deployment 2012 with my platoon again, seal team three Charlie Platoon, uh, in Kandahar province. So on that deployment, uh, this was one of our more kinetic deployments. I mean, it's, it's Afghanistan, it's Kandahar's IED is everywhere. I mean everywhere. I mean to the point where, you know, our, our TTPs are, are, are sparse or our sop is our standard operating procedures where, hey, we're on patrol, were getting shot at, don't even move. Don't even go look for cover. Because as soon as you move, you hit an IED. I mean they're, they're, they're just there that prevalent throughout the entire ground, not just on pathways, not just in doorways, in the most random of places.

Speaker 4:          00:24:56       These guys are just burying these things at a one, at a win, you know? And then it's, then it's chaos out there. And we know they're not that great at shooting at us. So we'd rather just take it. So I'm going to take a moment just to emphasize what you just said because it's really important and not everyone will understand it the way you, the way you went over it quickly, almost from a tactical mindset. So I just want everyone to understand what he's, what he's saying is when at this point, the ids were so bad that if you started getting shot at by the enemy, the obvious and common and practice that everyone in the world instinctively and by training has, is you immediately hit the ground and seek cover. And you get behind a log. You get behind a piece of terrain, you find somewhere to hide from the bullets that are coming at you.

Speaker 4:          00:25:46       And what Dan's saying is during this deployment, the IED threat was so high that when the enemy started shooting at them, instead of finding cover to hide from the bullets, they would rather just stay put, probably take a knee but not dive behind something because of the likely there was a likely chance that there was an IED there. Yup. That's, that's crazy. It is. It is. Um, you know, we've, I've seen multiple guys get, get blown up and, um, usually our partners, our Afghan partners who were patrolling with us, I, because, you know, maybe they don't, they're just not as careful or maybe they're there. The equipment they're using to detect ICDs in the ground, they weren't using it properly, whatever the case may be. Or maybe just cause it's bad luck and they're just everywhere. Um, you know, it's more, you had more Afghan partners than Americans. Oh, by far. We would sometimes go on operations with about a hundred Afghans and maybe 12, 15 seals. Yeah. Because there were, were

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       doing entire clearance operations through villages. You know, we're, we're going house to house, we're shaking hands. It's a little bit of shaking hands. It's a little bit of on security, you know, either defending ourselves or going on the offensive. It, it depends on the situation. But, um, you know, we round everybody up, we talked to them and we have, we meet with village elders. So it's, it's, it's, it's a little bit of your, your, your, I guess your more typical unconventional warfare tactics of we're trying to meet and greet the population, um, while also, you know, being prepared for battle and, uh, and, and, but the hardest part of that was certainly the IED threat. You know, only single file lines. Everything we ever learned in training of different formations and staggered actual on whatever it is, it doesn't apply at all. It all gets thrown out the window because it's, it's only about single file.

Speaker 2:          00:27:36       What has been cleared, what hasn't been cleared. And you could, you could veer from that a little bit depending on what area you're in, in Kandahar and went more mountainous areas, less ids. But even then, I've got a story, you know, these guys, uh, some of our guys take a take a point to take out on the high ground and a little hilltop. I mean, just in the middle of nowhere. I mean, middle of, no, I can't emphasize this enough. It is the middle of nowhere, right? And they sit down in this pop goes off, it was a blasting cap that went low order, which means it didn't blow up the main charge, like a 15, 20 pound charge. It would have killed all three of them right then and there. And, uh, I mean, I want to say that again, middle of nowhere. There was no reason for there to be an IED right there.

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       But there was this one, this was out in the mountains and this wasn't even in the, the pen, you know, the southern Kandahar district, which was, which is truly just a minefield everywhere, you know, so, you know, the, I can't emphasize how bad the threat is there. And even, even, even taking that, even taking a small high ground position behind a rock, like, you know, this is what we, the kind of things we ran into. And, um, so that was that deployment. It was a lot of fun. And, uh, um, but it was, it was a hard one for us. Uh, you know, on month six, that's six months in is June 15th, 2012. Um, I was hit by an IED blast by one of these. Again, they're everywhere. And it was, it was the one day we spent in Helmand province. So we went to Helmand on a, on a last minute mission, uh, to support some marine special operations forces out there.

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       And, uh, as, as the early, I know we, oh, we always fly in about the middle of the night and we do that so that the enemy can't arm the ids. The Ids are everywhere, but they're not always armed. And if they, if they keep them arm, they run out of batteries and they don't work anymore. So they, so there's, there's a little bit of tactical consideration there. But, uh, you know, in the early morning hours come and the, and the daylight starts to hit, we start to move around and we start to clear out this one compound and hadn't been totally clear jet. And one of my Afghan interpreters was responding to a call, runs in front of me and completely gets dismembered by about 15 pounds of explosives underneath him. And, uh, all I know is I got hit with something and it feels like you're getting hit by a truck while a bunch of guys in the truck or shooting you with a shotgun.

Speaker 2:          00:30:01       That's sort of what it feels like. And um, you know, immediate, my immediate reaction was feel my legs right. So I feel my legs and everything is still there. Um, you know, I know something is wrong distance from the Iud, a couple of feet. I mean, it's so, I mean, cause I would, aliyah a few feet were, you and me are probably is about it. We're just across the table and uh, you know, lots of pain, pain everywhere, but not in my eyes. So that was completely blinded. But, uh, you know, uh, totally under the assumption that I just had dirt in my eyes. And, uh, I remained under this assumption that there was really nothing wrong with my eyes for frankly, for weeks to come. And we'll talk about that. But, you know, I, I was, I didn't lose consciousness. I knew what was happening. I could hear the moans.

Speaker 2:          00:30:50       Everybody thinks that when somebody gets their legs blown off, they're screaming. Like in the movies. It's just never the case. It's a very different, like visceral sound of pain. Um, and it's, and I've heard it many times now because this happened to us a couple of times. And, um, so I heard that. I knew, I knew that Rockman had been hit because I could hear him. And, um, you know, one of our, one of my teammates tells a story where he got hit with the foot in a building next store. I mean, and it was, and that's how they knew something had gone terribly wrong. And, uh, you know, the medics come to me, there's nothing they can do for me. They sorta just wrap up my eyes. They know something's wrong. I really don't. Frankly, I was just, I keep assuming there's just dirt in my eyes and that it'll be fine.

Speaker 2:          00:31:38       And, uh, eventually we get taken out of there and I was able to get up and walk to the Hilo because you don't let somebody carry you when they've got a fire fight to finish and we get on and uh, as soon as the medics on the helicopter see me, they, they put me out right away and I don't wake up for days. So when I do wake up, I'm in Germany. They told me my ride, I had been removed and I'd probably never see it again out of my left eye. But there's a chance and again, kind of self deception kicks in and I'm like, so you're saying there's a chance that we'll be fine, just get the surgery done, get me out of plane to, to back to Maryland, to the Walter Reed Hospital where these surgeons are and well, let's do this. And they're like, it's going to be a day or two. I argue. We argue, you know, that's how it goes for the next couple days. I can't really move. I can't get up to use the bathroom. My body is completely swollen and, and, and, and shredded really. I mean there's no real permanent injuries to the rest of my body, but it's, it's in such a state that like I just, just shockwave from

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       the blast,

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       I think shock and I was, I had a ton of shrapnel just throughout, I think I was swollen, um, might've been muscle atrophy from being in a medically induced coma for so long because I'd been there, been that way for five or six days, but really couldn't move. Um, and, and just wrapped up really tight cause I mean there's, you can see the scarring a little bit. Um, I was just, it was kind of been through a meat grinder a little bit. And uh, I was also, I was hallucinating wildly so I, everything I saw was Afghanistan. I was lucid, I understood what was around me, but all I could see was an Afghan guy sitting next to me or an Afghan village. It was, it's, it was, it's almost like phantom pain but with your eyes and there's a medical term for it that I can't remember.

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       Um, but it was just an odd and terrifying experience because it was, I knew it wasn't real, but it's just everything I saw. And, um, eventually got back to Maryland, um, on a one on one of our medical flights. And, you know, my wife was there waiting for me and you know, we began to have that conversation about, okay, what's the next surgery? Cause I had to remove the cataract and then that was, that was the issue. There was a lot of shrapnel in my left eye. The eye that was still there. And you know, the, the, the issue was, could we came, we were safely removed the cataract and will he ever see again? And if you have to be, we do do that. What are his chances really of having decent vision and um, you know, we, we prayed and we, I and I look back on it and again that, you know, we call it self deception, but it was really the strength to stay sane and, and believe that it was actually going to see again.

Speaker 2:          00:34:23       And you know, I truly believe that was God. Strength is working through Migos, allowing me to, to believe in something impossible, um, because otherwise I would have gone nuts because people sometimes ask me, what's it like not knowing if you're ever gonna see again. And I always answer, I, I don't know. I don't know what that's like because it was never, that was never my mental state. My mental state was always, it'll happen. It's just a matter of time. And then I can finally get back to my platoon. You know, the, the, the, the issue for me, it was like, when are we going to do this? You guys told me six weeks. All right, let's schedule it. Inhale. It was insanity.

Speaker 4:          00:34:58       Obviously when a, I hear this story, I think Ryan Job, who was with me in Ramadi and he, and he got shot in the face and you know, it was a similar situation where, you know, clearly his, his eye, one eye was gone, but his other eye appeared to be intact. And he could actually see after he got wounded, then he got put into a, uh, you know, he could see what was happening and, and walked into the CAS evac vehicle. Uh, but, you know, they put them into a medically induced coma. And when he woke up he couldn't see and then it was the same type of thing that they were, you, they were telling him which is look, well there was some nerve damage, we're not sure. And his attitude was very similar of like, well, it'll be okay and you know, it'll come back.

Speaker 4:          00:35:49       Um, but you know, what didn't take very long before the doctors were like, no, um, it's, it's, it's not coming back. And, and I forget the timeline, you know, I forget the timeline cause it's, it's kind of a kind of, uh, a blurred together. Um, but yeah, for him it was, he had a great attitude, but, um, you know, at the end it didn't happen. And you know, and that's a guy that was still like a, he also still wanted to come back and get back with his platoon and was telling me, you know, don't worry, I can smell the enemy and I'll know where to shoot. Let me back, sir. So, yeah, uh, the, the fact that you were able to recover is awesome. Awesome. And you know, it's, uh, it, it shows, it should show people that, you know, even though you had a great attitude, the threat of have never been able to see again was very, very real, very, very real.

Speaker 2:          00:36:52       Oh yeah. And, and it truly was amazing. We had miracles occur in the operating room multiple occasions and, uh, doctors are just amazed that not only could I see again, but see, well again, um, it, it was because they're at, in their minds they're like, well, if we do the surgery and his retina, doesn't it detach? Like, we think it might, um, he'll still have, you know, crappy vision, you know, cause this is corny as all destroyed. I mean, everything's a mess in this eye and, uh, you know, we'll get them some decent glasses so we can kind of live his life, but he's, he's pretty much permanently disabled and I'm, I just didn't listen. I don't even remember these conversations. It's like I like I blocked him out and, um, and it's just, cause the first surgery was we've got to remove the cataract.

Speaker 2:          00:37:32       Okay. That went well. All right. We removed the cataract. Great. You know, and the next step is to put a lens implant in your eye. Like, like anybody normally would only have cataract surgery. That's just the normal thing to do. Um, we ended up never doing that because it's kind of like replacing a window pane on a normal line, but if the frame of the window is completely destroyed and you have to, so the window pane to curtains and that's never a good policy. So, uh, they, they eventually refused to do that on me even though I was demanding it constantly. Um, but because I wanted to see again, I wanted to get back and I didn't want to have a big thick glasses, which is what I have to wear now or, or this specialized contact. But then another problem occurred, which is a hole in my retina that was expanding and event.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       And this is again, it's kind of a normal, you know, I, if if you're over 50, this might be a normal thing that occurs and then you have a pretty routine surgery to get rid of it and to stop it. But for me it was incredibly fragile. Um, but we had to do it. So I went blind again for six weeks recovering from the surgery. So, you know, I was, I was, I was truly living in darkness for a long, um, you know, and not always thank God I wasn't hallucinating the entire time. That stopped after about week one. Um, you know, just, or just after my major surgery, my first major surgery. But, um, I went blind again and another miracle happened because they truly thought I wasn't going to make it through that surgery either. So after when they, when you were blind to again for six weeks going into that, did they tell you, okay, you're going to be buying for a period of time and it's going to take time to you eat just yet, because of the recovery process.

Speaker 2:          00:39:04       You, they put a gas bubble in your eyes so that it puts pressure on the back of your retina and you would have to be face down for six weeks. It's just the weirdest, what the hell did you do for six weeks? I down my bed, I get one of those massage chairs where you put your face down. And I had audio books going all day long. I mean, it was great. Yeah. And by great, I mean, not great at all. By great you mean awesome. Yeah. You know, uh, yeah, Starbucks and uh, you, you had to stay face down all the time. Are you? Um, and that six weeks goes by and then they eventually remove the gas bubble and dissipates. Yeah. So there's eventually a point where you're like, okay, it's gone. Now I can, I'm allowed. I'm allowed to look straight again. And then, and then it's just, you know, refitting your eye with the right eyewear, you know, like glasses and contacts so I can actually get back to her normal life.

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       And in frankly, that took years. Uh, it, you know, it's w I eventually, I'll just, I'll skip to the end, about two and a half years, then I finally got, got referred by the Navy to an outside clinic that does these, these amazing contacts. Um, there's only one company in the world that does it and I can see 2020 with it, you know, not up close. You know, my vision is complicated because I have a cataract, but, but I actually see 2020 vision at distance, which is, let me just, not even close to what they thought was possible. So I'm in. But despite all that, I mean, before that two and a half year mark, I still had decent enough contacts to survive. I mean, they just weren't comfortable. They kind of drove me crazy. And, um, you know, all I cared about was getting back to the team.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       I was almost going back to team three. The, uh, command wouldn't let that happen in the end just because I couldn't get the medical waiver to do it. So I stayed at what was now it's called special reconnaissance team one. Again, we do Intel support for the seal teams and uh, did a troop commander there. So in charge of about 50 personnel, mix of seals, intelligence specialists, um, all sorts of really great people that you know, as you know, support the teams and intelligence matters and deployed to Bahrain, uh, worked with, uh, joint special operations task force out there working in all throughout the Persian Gulf, uh, working on classified programs. They're working in Lebanon as well. And uh, coming back from that, I'm told I had to eventually get out. I mean, I, I had to start the medical retirement process, but before, before I did, I, I truly, I wanted to serve again.

Speaker 2:          00:41:37       I mean, it was, it was extremely important to me. So this deployment to by rain was about 2014. By the time I was really told I had to medically retire was around 2016. But you know, this process takes up to a year. And I asked that I be able to serve again in some capacity. Let my, let my, the specialties that I had that I had acquired over the years at SRT one, um, be put to use in the Pacific. So they deployment to Korea for my last deployment in the end of 2016 and as soon as I got home from that, I was, I was medically retired and, uh, had to find my next mission. You know, like you talked about the earlier on in the podcast. I mean, it's, it life truly is about mission and, um, you know, I'm getting into politics now running for Congress and in Houston, Texas, uh, for the second district.

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       And I talked about this a lot and from a, from a political philosophy standpoint, if you don't give people a mission or you don't encourage people to find their purpose and their dignity, you, you have a failing society. Uh, it's so important and you're not, you know, even even think tanks, talk about this, like American Enterprise Institute, like our policies need to promote a sense of mission for people and help people understand that they have value in this world. They're here on this earth for a reason. And if you're not constantly seeking out what that value is that you contribute to society, you're not doing your job and we need to help you do your job if, if, if, if need be, but you, but you do have value and you, and you must find that purpose in life. Um, and guys like us, I think can't survive without that constant mission. And uh,

Speaker 4:          00:43:14       well we see it all the time with, with all vets. And when they, and I talk about this all the time, the vets that get out, that have a note on newt, another mission, they focused on that mission and they go kick ass. The vets that get out and don't know what they're going to do, that flounder around without a direction. Those are the guys that end up in trouble because they don't have a mission. So they go and drink a beer, then they have another beer and then the, they could get prescribed pain medicine for their back, which hurts which socks and, and they go down this bad road. And I believe a lot of it is because, you know, they just need that next mission. But you got done with, so 2016 you didn't roll right into politics. You rolled to you, you went back to college. Did that become, doesn't 16 did that become you? You looked at what you're going to do next and you said, okay, well how else can I serve? How well it's going to move forward? What's my next mission going to be? And you decided you're going to go back to school, back to school

Speaker 2:          00:44:10       for, I knew it was going to stay in public service. So I knew my next mission was going to still be government. I wasn't exactly sure what I knew I wanted to do. I wanted to be able to implement policy and strategy and, and take that tactical experience. Um, cause I had to have, you know, cause I that built an understanding of what policy in d c looks like on the ground. Um, and actually because the reason I was hurt that day in 2012 was because of an Obama administration's policy of always wanting boots on the ground battle of damage assessments for any, any close air support. So because earlier in that day, marines that called in close air support on a compound they were taking fire from, for some reason they wanted guys to walk across minefields and go take pictures of it. Right? That's not good policy.

Speaker 2:          00:44:57       Now it's not a victim hood story. Don't get me wrong. I mean there was a battle going on. We want it to go, I don't care really what the reason is, but from a policy perspective, that's, that's concerning that, that, that kind of pressure has being put on our two star and our, and that's what drove that mission. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Um, so it's great to see somebody like General Madison right now who says the opposite. I will not waste my troops time with these kinds of things. And he's on record. Um, you know, after we dropped the mother of all bombs while back, he's on record saying I will not waste my troops time going to count the dead bodies out there. That's just good policy. So, you know, a wanted to take that experience to Washington, um, the natural and the national next step was get the right education.

Speaker 2:          00:45:41       So the Harvard Kennedy School of Government is where I went, got a master's degree in public administration focusing more on national security issues, economic issues, um, and, and, and a little bit of political us politics. How long was that school? I just did a year when your program and, um, you know, it's kind of the, uh, accelerated executive style program that you can apply to if you're, if you're older and you actually have some, some life experience, the intensity level of that, uh, it's tense as you make it. I took, I took about four extra credits more than I needed to. Uh, so I was busy cause I, you know, it's, it's not like going to college where you're just getting through it. I think, uh, I would highly recommend anybody, you know, you do a master's degree later on in life, you're really going to get the most you can out of it.

Speaker 2:          00:46:26       You cause you care about learning. You're there for a reason because you have purpose and, and you know why you're there. So I got a lot out of it honestly. And it was, it was quite, it was really an amazing year. I mean, you hear from the greatest people had, you know, bushes, deputy national security advisor teaching us. Um, I had, uh, you know, the, the premier experts on counterproliferation policy, uh, teaching us in classic Reagan's Chief Economic Advisor is my economics professor. I mean, you just can't, you know, the, these people don't speak in terms of like, this is what we think happens in the White House there. No, they're like, when I was in the White House, this is how it got done. I mean, that's the kind of the, the level of instruction that you're getting. So it was really happy to, to get that education.

Speaker 2:          00:47:08       And it, it, it, it's, it truly applies to, as in the hood. My current role is as running for office. Um, I'm glad it was there, but what I hadn't necessarily thought about running for office even after I graduated, uh, I was looking at more policy jobs, you know, cause I didn't, I don't have the political connections. I don't have the background and money and the donor networks to really to, to jump on a campaign, uh, right away we've thought about it in the longterm sense, uh, for sure. But, uh, but not in the short term. And a, I was working with Pete sessions, Congressman Pete sessions and Capitol Hill for a little while, getting legislative experience there and I'm working, doing some consulting and uh, eventually came to a head where I was about to take a job that they're doing counter weapons of mass destruction policy for Department of Defense or go run for office because my congressman, Ted Poe had just announced retirement and we prayed about it.

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       We thought about it. We, uh, had the right backing from, you know, some well connected people that I think God just put in front of us at the right time. And my wife and I went for it. You know, she was, uh, she was all in, who was all in and, uh, and that was it. I mean, I've already, I'd already come back to Texas, but at this point to help with hurricane Harvey reconstruction was out. Volunteering were my old hometown of Katie. Um, my parents didn't flood. They were, they were living there. They've been living in spring, which is just north of Katie for the past 13, 14 years. But, you know, neighbors needed help. They were still need help. Um, it's, it's still pretty devastated in Houston. And you know, I think the decision became easy that we knew this was the right choice.

Speaker 2:          00:48:45       Like this was the right mission. If I cared about nuclear proliferation policy, what better place to affect it for them from Congress. If you care about helping flood victims, no better place than elected office. Um, if you care about border security, which Texans do no better place than public office. You know, if we care about protecting Americans and protecting the sanctity of the seal teams and, and pushing the right policies from the defense level, then you know, elected politics is where I can do it from. And so the decision was easy was it was, it was the right choice for us. We knew we were doing it for the right reasons. We know we are still doing it for the right reasons and we're not going to quit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:24       So with all those things that you said that are, are real positive about having a political career, yeah. You must have also been looking at the, the nightmare gut check, just mudslinging that you're going to have to go or that's going to be thrown at you and all that and, and your family getting a microscope on him and watched all the time and no privacy and all that. How did you weigh those things out and that, did you think about those things as well?

Speaker 2:          00:49:54       Absolutely. Uh, it's, it's by far the most concerning thing about politics. I mean, if anything drives, drives you out, it's, it's that, you know, and frankly, the experience hasn't been too bad yet. I mean, I get attacked for silly things, uh, here and there. I've got a, you know, one of, one of my opponents, I what I would call one of his cronies there. There's these, there's these corrupt, um, they called them the slates in Harris County, which is Harris County is Houston. Um, and these three slates are essentially three political mailers that go out and they, they make, they target senior citizens especially, and they make it sound like there's these, these um, these conservative review type of magazines. You know, these something with authority behind it. But really they're not really, they're pay to play and it's just one author and they pick who they like based on what kind of money they were able to get out of the deal.

Speaker 2:          00:50:49       And then the trash, everybody else. So, you know, they put mine, they put my bio on there. It doesn't say anything about who I actually am. It just says I'm homeless and don't have a job and would like to be gone. I mean it's, it's absurd, right? And most people read it and they think this is this, this can't be serious. So it actually, it got me a lot of votes because people would look me up after that. It's like, oh well this is, this is who this guy is. Maybe I will vote for him after all. Um, but, but unfortunately that's politics and that's, that's the world we live in. Um, even though the, you know, the Harris County Republican Party has publicly denounce these so-called slates, um, cause they send out these voter guides and you know, they just announced them. But people don't always know. People aren't, you know, sometimes a lot of folks still rely on those so that you're battling this kind of corruption.

Speaker 2:          00:51:31       You're battling this establishment. I mean, you know, we always talk about the establishment and politics and I never really knew what that meant. I think until I stopped behind the curtain and now I truly understand and it's this class of politically connected people in the donor class that really just stick together and it has nothing to do with policy or doing the right thing for the American people. It's just how much money do you have? That's all that matters. And it's not, it's not all that matters. Um, we made it into the runoff after last week's election, which is March six. I was nine candidates in my primary and on and on election day I came out far and away first place. Um, we beat out overall in the election. I was second place, but we beat out.

Speaker 4:          00:52:13       So just to again, explain that a little bit for people that aren't paying attention to the election, you were in the, in the fight, you're going against nine other candidates going into the election. Obviously there's some people that vote early through mail voting and they just vote early and you were behind there. But then as your campaign picked up and people started to actually see who you are, when people came to vote on election day, you, you won election day, but you didn't win all the votes combined because the people that had voted early and got it correct. And it shows the trajectory and the momentum of what you're doing. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:52:52       We've got some great momentum that we're excited about and even put in, he would paint a broader picture. You know, we started this late November and the election was march six. That's, that's a very little time for anybody to get a campaign together. So, and we're going up against, um, you know, one of my opponents had s probably all ended up spending the, when the numbers come in between six and $7 million, which is a record for self funding for a campaign like this. Um, another opponent in a similar, similar or very high spending, very much self funded. And it was already state representative, so had had some kind of campaign machine in place. You're trying to catch up, you're trying to build a campaign team and an an a message within almost no time at all and no money whatsoever. That's, that's not an easy task. And it only a couple of months.

Speaker 2:          00:53:38       Usually you start like a year out if you're going to run for Congress. Um, but, but this, that just wasn't the case here because a typo announced retirement and about mid November. So we had a lot to overcome. Um, we built that momentum quickly. We worked hard, worked hard, got the message outs, met as many people as we could. And you know, in, uh, worked, uh, we, we, we've snuck by, uh, was snuck out of that third place spot because as you said, so we were behind during early voting and mail and voting because that, that stuff happens so early. There was just no way for my momentum to catch up in time. But by election day, we were far and away first place and, uh, were able to sneak into the runoff. So now we're in the runoff and that's a May 22nd. So we've got another two months to, uh, to really prepare and get our message out there. And I think we're, we're excited about it and I think it's going to go well.

Speaker 4:          00:54:28       So you talked about this a little bit. You talked about money, right? Money and as disturbing as it is, what's driving so much of who wins these elections is who has the most money because that's how you get the advertising. That's how you get the mailers. That's how you get the word out there. I mean, if you don't have the money to pay for advertising than no one knows you the yard and you don't get any votes. So as disturbing as that is you without money, you, you, you, you have a real hard time. I mean, you've done an amazing job with the limited amount. How, I mean, how much money did you go into that last election? Spending

Speaker 2:          00:55:05       ended up spending total about $200,000. So we were outspent in a 30 over, over 30 to one easily. I would say. You could say more if you count what everybody else, you know, first and second place also spent against me. I mean, you know, it's something to be proud of,

Speaker 4:          00:55:22       but uh, so I, I think if we can raise $200,000 and you went up against somebody that spent $6 million sprite and yeah, like I said, unfortunately money drives so much of these elections and that's why you end up with those people that, I mean, I know you can't technically or possibly, but you're not supposed to be able to buy an election. Right, right. But I mean, the, the, the person that you talked about that spent 6 million without that money, I mean we're where wood is a female. Right? Where would she have been without spending that money? I mean, I'm assuming she wouldn't have been anywhere. No. So she was able to by herself at least third place. Right. And maybe if she had another more money, she would've been able to buy herself first place. That's a scary thought. It is. I mean, it, you know, I, I, I

Speaker 2:          00:56:11       don't like the way campaign finance works. I don't think he should be able to self fund that much for a race. And you know, I understand that there's some good arguments to make that you can sell fund over what the individual limit is. But, but to that extent, I mean it's, you know, it truly creates a, a donor class of politicians and like that's just, I don't think that's what we want as American people and it's, it's up. But it's up to voters in the end to decide. It's up to voters to see through that. And you know, I always encourage go out and do your research. You know, just, just do enough to go on the websites of each candidate and get a feel for who they are, watched them, watch their videos, see how they speak, see how they would represent you, see how they would articulate your values.

Speaker 2:          00:56:53       You know, we put up youtube videos all the time. You can always wash me and interviews. Um, you know, we're, we're coming to or listen to podcasts, listen to Jockos podcasts and uh, you know, cause cause you want people to get to know you and you need to be out there with folks. You need to be meeting people everywhere you go. And that's how we won. You know, that's how we built that connection with the voter. That's how we built momentum. Just getting out and meeting people and inspiring them to connecting with them. That's, that's, that's still works. And we proved that that's one of the things that you did while your opponents, we're spending a bunch of money you put on your running shoes yeah. And ran through your entire district. Right. I did lift a lot of the way to cause uh, we talked about overpreparing well sometimes you can under prepare and a, when you're running a campaign there's not a lot of time to get your running in.

Speaker 2:          00:57:43       And so I started at a hundred mile run and um, it was going well. And so I want to back up a little bit. We, we planned this awhile out. It was going to be five days run across the whole district. Really show that dedication. I want to, I want to get on the ground. I want to show the dedication to every inch of this district and I'm with, with whatever publicity we get out of it, we're going to use it for a good cause and we, we set up a go fund me account. It's still active if you want to donate to it, let's go fund me.com/rebuild Houston with Dan Crenshaw and that money goes to three particular volunteer groups that I was able to identify and vet that are still out there everyday rebuilding people's homes. Is that, I mean that is still going on. I always try to let everybody know if you're a contractor, if you've got any expertise, please come volunteer in Houston.

Speaker 2:          00:58:26       We are backed up into, you know, it is, it is tough to find a contractor these days. Even if people have the money to pay for it, they still can't get any availability. The demand is so high that the prices have gone way through the roof. We need more people. They're nationwide. So, you know, police come to Houston, there's work for you and there's good work. Um, and there's a lot left to do when people need it. So in these volunteer groups are out doing it, you know, for five, $7,000 between five and $7,000, they can rebuild a whole home because all their labors free, right. It's volunteers and they may do a great job and they're working in a lot of these neighborhoods where we're individuals just can't do it themselves. And it was, it was, it was just great to see that a lot of church affiliated groups always out there helping and um, you know, it makes you proud to be a tax and it makes you proud to be an American.

Speaker 2:          00:59:12       So we finished that run, you know, by by day three I was certainly limping through most of it. Um, it changed out my shoes day five or we're running pretty well again, but um, it was tough, but it was, it was fun. It was great. It was a great experience. You see people honking at you maybe because you're in their way. Maybe because maybe because they're supporting you. I don't know, but, uh, I mean it was just, it was, it was pretty credible experienced to see the supporters out there to see just, you know, it was, it was great. Um, we went and that was, that was one early voting started. It was a, we voted on day one of that run. And, uh, and, and, and, and, you know, two weeks later on election day, we wrapped it up and it was, it was a good night.

Speaker 2:          00:59:55       It was a, we're on pins and needles. It wasn't until 2:00 AM that we knew that we'd actually come that come into second place by 155 boats. Oh, so you think anybody says their vote doesn't count, doesn't matter. That's wrong. It, it truly matters. I mean, every single vote mattered. I can't thank every volunteer enough. Can't think every supporter enough. Cause a lot of people went out and they maybe got 10 votes here and there, maybe a hundred votes here and there. You know, individuals were able to do that and put us over the top because they believed in the message they believed in our candidacy. And it was just, you know, it's humbling. It's, it's almost, you feel a weight of responsibility when people put their trust in you like that as you should feel it because you don't want to disappoint them and they know you.

Speaker 2:          01:00:36       You can't let your supporters down. And I truly feel that way about every vote. So what's so what's next right now? Well, it's the runoff, the runoff. It's just me and Kevin Roberts and I'm just, you know, it's May 22nd early voting starts again a couple of weeks before that. And it's a lot of the same, you know, we, we, we stick to the basics. We professionalize our organization. Uh, we asked for more money. Please donate a Crenshaw for converse.com and at noon. And we, and we, we, that's actually real though. Like you, you Kinda, you Kinda joke about it and I know you're like, like most good human beings, you feel uncomfortable saying, hey, give me some money. But the reality is for you to take this to the next level that you need, you need money. And, and so when you say that kind of jokingly, the reality is if you don't get that money, it's going to be really hard to swing it upset.

Speaker 2:          01:01:31       Right. And so, so that's what's the, what's the website? It's Crenshaw for congress.com c r e n s h a w for congress.com you can donate there. You can check out the canyon to see there. You know, see our interviews here, youtube videos or commercials, my bio, everything. It's all in one spot. Follow us on Facebook. We've got a pretty exciting social media presence. That's how we get a lot of our word out because you know it's cheap and it hits the right people. So Crenshaw for congress.com and you know that money, we spend it wisely. It doesn't go to anything silly. It's, you know, we need it to, to send mail to, to, to voters. You know, to get our message out. We needed to put out radio ads, we needed to buy tee shirts for volunteers and to buy yard signs so that people can put them in their yards and create that upwelling of support, uh, where everybody's got to Dan Crenshaw sign that. That's, that's how we

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       do it. And, um, it's, it's, but it's, we work our butts off, I promise you that we work for, we work for every vote out there and I'm, I, I truly believe that's how it should be. Um, and that's how it'd be in Congress. Yeah. That's awesome. And I know you're on a kind of a, a time schedule today and I know you've got some other things that you want to do here while you're out here in sunny, Sunny San Diego, which isn't too sunny today, but I think we just hit everything of how people can best support your cause. And obviously I'm in Crenshaw for Congress on Twitter. You're Dan Crenshaw, Texas, TX, correct. So at Dan [inaudible], Crenshaw, TX, and then on Facebook it's pretty easy to find you is just Dan Crenshaw, Crenshaw for Congress at Crenshaw for Congress. It's pretty easy.

I appreciate that Jocko, you know, the search services and over, um, you know, we, we find our purpose, we find our new mission and this is it for me. You know, it's, it's helping Texans, it's given. Texans are representative I think they can be proud of. We are so often just disgruntled and ashamed of our politicians and we don't really think they're working on our behalf because we don't always let people who truly put service before self and, and you know, part of this campaign is it's convincing those that we do have a future and we do have a future of leaders that will attract people to conservative values and um, and, and keep those values alive and, and, and again give us a leader that we can be proud of.

Speaker 1:          01:04:21       Awesome. Well I think they'll definitely find that with you. Thanks for coming on. And it's an honor to be here until you come back on.

Maybe you could tell the troops how they can support this cause sure. If they want, if the course, if they want and, and while they're supporting this cost also support the to themselves, which is important. Tiffts if they want, you know, did you hear what I just

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       said? Yeah. Very important. I said important. Yeah. You said it correct. Yeah. Two t's in that one for sure. Normally there's no t's in it for me. Yeah. Yeah. Important. Kind of like the British accent. Sometimes they don't say the [inaudible] and sometimes the same, really solid, you know, like they say snap back to reality e they don't say the reality or reality and I see it nonetheless. Back due support. Yeah. If you want to support, support your joints.

Speaker 3:          01:05:50       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:05:51       This is how you support your joints. If you didn't already. Jock was supplements, good supplements, Krill oil, Super Krill, Jocko, Super Krill oil and joint warfare supplements for your joints. Maintain them. Also discipline preworkout pre mission cognitive enhancer plus physical enhancer force multiplier. Wholesome Force multiplier. Yeah. There's layers. Yeah. Actually, yeah. It's like a blend. It's a good blend. Yeah, I am running low on the Krill oil. I did not take my own advice for the the restrictions subscription. Yeah. So I had to manually get some more, but hey man, that's life sometimes. Uh, if you want to get on the subscription thing

Speaker 5:          01:06:41       re up every, what is it month, right? Cause it's a month supply. Yeah. Yeah. However much you take and that's the smart way to do it. Totally is joint warfare to did you mentioned drone warfare? Yeah, fully. It's the one, I think the Combo is the best way to go. For sure. Recommend the Combo. Nonetheless, you get them@originmain.com. Good way to support and support yourself. That's a big one. also@originmain.com they're Giza and rash guards for you. You Jitsu journey. If you have chosen or will choose to go on that Jujitsu journey, there's no reason why not. You should go on the Jujitsu and if you're going to ask, what if I'm small, big, large, overweight or your older, younger, young. The answer is start Jujitsu. Yeah. How'd you get in shape for Jujitsu? Jujitsu. Yeah. That's what you do. Yeah. You know, Tim, Tim always says like, Oh, you know how t he's been out of the Jujitsu for a long item forward.

Speaker 5:          01:07:35       Yeah. Yeah. And he'll be like, Whoa, I gotta get back in shape to go. No, you're looking at the wrong layman. Oh yeah. You go back to Jujitsu, the Gds to get you in shape. You'll be, you'll be fine going to me, shit, you can suffer a little bit, but might even suffered a lot and probably a lot. It's hard to gotta be hard mentally for a guy like Timbo because he's a purple belt. Yeah. And so he's going to come and get beat by some white belts. I mean, not wipe outs by some blue belts. Yeah. Cause you know some blue belts and they bring it. Yeah. And the key and they can keep bringing it up. They been in there because it got the Kadesh. Yeah. Yes. Tim would be like, come back in then. And it adds that level anxiety because you know, when you feel yourself gallon, well you probably don't know this boat.

Speaker 5:          01:08:18       If you feel yourself gassing and you're like, should I knew I was going to gas now you're really gassy and now is the anxiety goes up and yes, some more. There's a how it is. He'd want to avoid all that stuff. That's what I think. But you know, that's when you put all these weird expectations and yourself. That's my opinion. And the Jujitsu. So just go into Jujitsu and learn Jujitsu. And when you do, you're going to want a Ge if you do geek cause he can do no g as well. But when you choose a g I recommend you recommend. I think there's only one recommendation. I agree. In all seriousness, there's only one recommendation. Yeah. And I've been through a lot of geese. I have a lot of key experience. We'll see a significant amount of gay experience and the origin. He has proven legitimately to be the best one.

Speaker 5:          01:09:02       Kind of by far too. Yeah. There's this one that I used to use it to. Dell's good was fine and it was like good. Yeah. There's a difference though, when there's a difference between this skis. Good. Yeah. And then you get an orange and gay. Yeah. Right. Yeah. You know, it's funny like, you know how like when you get a new ghee and rash guard or whatever and you're kind of fired up and go train because you got your new gay, you know, it's that faster. That feeling didn't wear off like for a while. Did you feel that like when we rolled, when we were both wearing you origins? I did. Where are you fired up? Yeah. Yeah. Cause like, yeah. Did you think maybe it was going to be the day?

Speaker 5:          01:09:39       Uh, for the record, I always think it's going to be the day. Always. Yeah. Dang. Because maybe one day there will be that they just think it's going to be the day to, maybe it's not though. Maybe it will. I don't know. Could be the day she anyway, origin main.com get your g there when you choose to get a g, there's compression gear too. Rash guards. If you do know, gee, there's rash guards there too. All made in America. Yeah. I was gonna say all made in America, which is like, it's no big deal. No, it's a huge deal. It's a huge deal made in America, in Maine and our factory by awesome workers. And it's not the kind where by crafts cross people, crafts, craftsmen, crafts person, crafts people. Cause people, man, there are more females. Yeah. But they're craftsmen. Yeah. Men doesn't mean you're a man.

Speaker 5:          01:10:27       It means you're human. Yeah. As far as I know, like modern man, like mankind, mankind. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. So, so crossman kind of craftsmen kind nonetheless. All made in America. Yes. And that is a big deal. And it's not the kind where it's like, yeah, let's import all our things or whatever, and then we'll quote on quote, make it in America where you tick the one checkbox that it's like, yeah, technically it's made it, it's not that kind. It's the kind where they grow the continent in America, they, what do they do after they grow the content and the harvest? The harvest, the cotton. They, well, they could die the cotton and they weave the cotton. Yeah. Yeah. There's a whole bunch of steps all done in America. The land of the cotton, because it's not just cotton. It's an athletic, that's one of the problems with the old geese is they're all made just with, with cotton.

Speaker 5:          01:11:17       They're like, like crap. Yeah. And then why would you not get modern technology? Well why? Because they don't have, they don't do Jujitsu where they're making the geese. Yeah. Now, so like little issues that come up in you, just little ones or big ones or whatever. When they come up to what's going on and put it, you put an origin g in the dryer it's dry like quick. Yeah. And because it's not all cotton. Yeah. Cause if you remember in the teams, cotton kills. Sure. Cotton Kilz because it gets wet and then it's heavy and makes you cold jams you up. Yeah. It doesn't dry quick enough. Get the blend going. Yeah. Then you're good to go. And there's all kinds of different leaves too, which is cool. Now let's go to, or did you mean.com you can check out with whichever one you want. Hey, if you want something, get something.

Speaker 5:          01:12:06       Also what you want to do is go to the immersion camp if you want. So did you see any emerging camp? It's not like a training camp for ADCC. No. It's an educational experience. Like you immerse yourself in that you can modulate to the level of your personal commitment to getting after it. Yes. So some people will be there and they're going to be really sore every day. You're gonna be getting after it hard. Some people are going to be brain, their brains going to be some more sore than their body because they're going to be more looking at it from the education that they're getting of learning new moves and techniques. So that's what's cool about the, the immersion camp or some of us, nothing's going to be sore because maybe it'll be sore for a little while and then we're just going to cruise a little bit of exercise, the brain more, and then the button he has to go back and forth, do whatever you like.

Speaker 5:          01:13:02       Yeah. And there's a lot to go on and it's kind of fun too. That's the thing. Yeah. What's cool to hang out with just a bunch of people that are going to do Jitsu for seven days. Yeah. And then then they get like five tons of lobster. You don't have to stay there the whole time. Yeah. There's a, there's a, there's a first part in a second part, you know, it's like the first few days and then you can do this the second few days and then you can do all of them if you want. So August 26 through September 2nd, we're going to be there. You know who else is going? No big deal. Dave Berg. Dave Berg got the bug. Oh yeah, no, he's got the bug. Yeah, he'll call me for just like verbally, like, so he's db texted me about, uh, about like guard passing. I'm like, Oh really? Hey, let's do it. Let's communicate about guard passing that via text. Amen. People with Americana and it's good. It's an interesting conversation because, you know, he says, oh well the American is like what I use the most right now. And, and I told them like, the American is actually not a really effective move, right. Against anyone that has trained for a little bit. Right. Purple Belt,

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       you're not going to, you might catch an him, a blue belt in and Americana and purple belt. Probably not going to happen. I did catch a black belt in America under the other day and, and it was like shame. Yeah. I got caught with the Americans in this, this particular black belt was like shame. He hung his head in shame. He was like, you need to go South America Honda. But I explained to Dave the, the reason that the Americana is effective for him right now, the most effective. I'm like, is it the first submission that you learned? Yes, it is. So he's practiced at the most than he's figured out all the little nuance things that you have to do right in order to make the move, a move, work and the American work. So he's figured out some of those things cause he's tried it a bunch.

Speaker 1:          01:14:58       Even when he missed it, he learned something. You didn't even know he learned something, but he learned something. So he keeps trying and he got good with me. So He's good at the Americana. Yup. He's not going against people that know how to defend a yet, which is going to be a problematic. So you got it. You got to, that's what happens. Isn't that part of the whole learning process though? Cause yes. Same thing. I mean remember when a, I mean I'm assuming you had similar experience where yeah, you sure you do Americanos and you'd get them certain moves for years like, like, like for when I first started, my first good move was the keel. In fact, I used to call it the easy kill, the easy keeled, easy kill. That's what I thought it was. That was wonderful. It was, I learned it like one of the first submissions I look and then I just tried it all the time and I got pretty good at it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       But then you realize that it's not that hard to defend the Zeke. You'll eventually, when you start going to get better guys. So then you got to move to the, I think the next move that I actually started doing a lot of that, the camera and I spent a couple of years at com era and then I still spend a couple of years at crucifix. Then I spent a couple of years at the straight foot lock than it, you know, so and alluded to those positions. That's how, but Dave Burke, back to my point, he's coming, he's coming to the camp and you know who else is? I will see you. I'll just get a call. We'll see if we'll see if Lafe yeah, hopefully you know we all have to work. Sure. Yeah. We block this off though. Just sweet. That's really good fun. Yeah. Cool. Go Man. If he can make that, make that, uh, what's the date on them again?

Speaker 1:          01:16:27       August 26 through September 2nd oh yeah. And if you want it, if you do want to come, you can go to origin main.com and you go to emerging camp and you can sign up. You can come and hang out. Eat lobster if you like lobster state steak. Yeah. Hang out in Maine, visit our factory, you know, which is awesome. I think you can go like paddling, stand up, stand up paddle boarding and stuff. All kinds of stuff. Yeah. Also good way to support yourself. If you choose to vary up your workup, make it a little less boring. You always make it sound like I do these boring workouts and I just realize I've been taking that abuse for for quite some time. My workouts are not boring. Well

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       yeah, in fact they're boring and hard, so they're hard. Here's the thing where, well, boring is like just a complete matter of opinion, you know? So to me, if you're going to do 20 rep squats, Bra breast, 20 reps, rest 20 reps until you're like, that's kind of boring. And have you ever done it before? Yes. You've done that work your exact one. But yeah, I did do 20 rep squat, some in fact don't. 20 rep squats that you can only squat 10 times. Well that's physically impossible, but you know, yes it is. If you could only do it 10 times, you can only do it 10 times. You can do it 20 times. You can do it 20 times. No, that's it. That's not how it works. I bet. Hey, look, take my word for it. You can physically do it 10 times. Mentally, you do it 20 times.

Speaker 5:          01:18:03       Imagine you do the 20th okay. It's a look. You can physically do it 10 times. I guess. Technically you're right, and I don't want to listen. I don't want to split hairs, but you're still not right. If you can do it 10 times, but you can do it 20 times, because look, if you can do something 20 times, you can do it 10 times. So yes, but what you're seeing is something that you max out at 10 times the weight you use to Max out at 10 times. You do it 20 times physically impossible. 10 Moscow apparently for Echo. Oh Man. See, anyway, back to the workout. Maybe that's where them skinny me calm maybe. Anyway, if you want to vary up the workout, go to audit dotcom. Slash Jocko. Get some cool kettlebells. Yeah, get some battle ropes. Get a mace, get to Macy's, a heavier one and a lighter one.

Speaker 5:          01:19:00       Boom, formulate a more end and I use them so my, my workouts are interesting. All right, well there you go. You have any interesting workout. We'll do it that way. That's what I, that's what I would would, what do you say? Suggest. Okay. Anyway, dot com good stuff in there. Don't get addicted to the website because there's a lot of good information too on there cause you could nonetheless also good way to support when you get the books that Jocko sometimes reviews on this podcast I organized or we organize them on Jocko podcast.com and click on the top to the books from the, from the episode I got all the books listed there including little articles that you know how sometimes you'll cover article. I'll list those on there. How much research would you have to do if you knew nothing about this podcast or me?

Speaker 5:          01:19:49       How much research would you have to do to figure out that we read books on the podcast and that they're all on Jocko podcast.com the reason I ask this is because I've had, I've had people ask me on social media like a week ago, like on Twitter, like do you like to read? Yeah. Right. Like that's a cre. You don't have to dig very deep to, to know that answer. Yeah. Right. Do you like to read, right? That this is a really low level question that doesn't take a whole lot of research to figure out, right? Yeah. I guess is that laziness or is it like, Hey, this guy seems pretty accessible. I'm just gonna ask him areas. I wonder if this guy likes to read. I don't think the likelihood of it being laziness cause I'm just going to be different for different people, but thought the, the likelihood of it being laziness is pretty low I think.

Speaker 5:          01:20:46       I don't think it's lazy laziness at all. I think it would be a mix or one of these things. Yeah. They just want to ask you a question that, that you know that you're going to have an answer to or, or maybe they're just new or maybe they know you from extreme ownership and you know, I know you wrote this cool book, Hey, do you like to read in general kind of thing. Maybe they don't listen to the being harsh, being too judgmental on my part. If you're, if you're jumping to that conclusion that it's laziness tend to read. Like we literally have a podcast about books that we read and, and then people say, do you have a list of books? Do you rec? Do you have any books you recommend? Yeah. Do you have a book list? Do you have a reading list?

Speaker 5:          01:21:34       These are all things I could ask on a regular basis. Is, is this kind of like the time I asked you, Hey, do you know of any gun ranges? I said, yeah, Google, go on Google and search done. Re kind of like that. So yeah, I feel the same tone. Here's the thing, you never know really know, uh, when people were coming into the game, you didn't know what, you know, what their deal is or where they're coming from. So yeah, like maybe, or maybe maybe they just heard you on Tim Ferriss or Joe Rogan and was like, boom, this guy, super interesting. Let me go straight to them and start talking to them kind of thing or start asking questions rather than going on the Internet. Let me research who this guy is and what he likes and doesn't like to do, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 5:          01:22:13       Am I, am I lazy in the fact that when I want to know something, I'll Google it? No, that's not lazy. I don't know. I don't think so. All right. As opposed to what I dunno. Saying going to school and studying at first, you know, alternative nonetheless, if you were feeling not lazy, actually this has nothing to do with laziness because this is more a convenience that I think would be benefit or I thought it would be beneficial for people who are looking for the books that you cover and ways to get them. That's why organize these books on, talk about gas.com the website are all there. They're all there by episode and by chance they're kind of in order of preference in order of the way you, almost the way you should read them. Maybe I'd have to shift some of them now. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:23:05       Put them in a different order because there's some books that I read again. I was like, man, this should be, this should be near the top. I mean about faces as the number is a number one. Yeah, right. You should read that book first. Yeah. People ask me that all the time. Well, what, what's your favorite, I've already read extreme ownership. Is there another book you recommend I read? Well, and I've read all your books. What books should I read next about face by Colonel David Hackworth. Yeah. So anyways. Yeah, makes sense. I mean, I organized them by episode. Yeah, most recent episode. Right, with book. But if you go back to episode one, which there's no book, but two, there's a book, and if you go in that order of reading, that's a good progression to get rid your books properly. Gotcha. So if you, if you, if you want to read your book Jockos Book list in order of importance, order importance, you go in chronological order per pod cast.

Speaker 5:          01:23:54       Yes. With books that's recommend not all podcast. That's recommended. Cool. Well there it is again. Just click on the books and boom, it takes you there. Boom. Click through there. Get your book. Easy way to good way to support. Takes it to Amazon. All good. Continue shopping if you feel the need to, like if you're shopping for Vat Ellington's Day. Now that already passed. What's the next one? Easter. Hmm? Carry on Easter gifts. Sure. Good. Those chocolate Easter bunnies in the, and the eggs. You know, you go Easter egg hunting, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well my kids do. Sure. Well, my youngest kid does. Yeah, there you go. My, you can shop for that compare. Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. You know, they're older. After a while, you kind of figure it out. Kind of still fun though, can be nonetheless click through. That's good way to support.

Speaker 5:          01:24:44       Also, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already. Leave a review. If you're in the mood, leave a review. Here's the thing, I'm not saying, hey, leave a review. I'm not saying to leave a review, but I think sometimes people, they want to leave a review, but they don't like think about it. You know? And then when let's say I get reminded like, oh shoot, I wanted to leave a review and I get reminded me like, boom, then I'm going to leave a review. That's a good one. I read all the reviews. Yeah, and I've read them on the podcast before when they're really funny or I've quoted them on social media. Yeah, so there's that too. Yeah. Yeah. If you write an awesome review, well, it doesn't have to be awesome, but if it's funny or it's good or it's a creative, what's the, that's what I should've said.

Speaker 5:          01:25:27       It is a creative review. There's been some really good ones too. Same thing with Amazon reviews for tea and books and there's a lot of people that get after it. I think it colorful for sure. I would say colorful. They put the main thing is layers put a lot of layers. Yeah. Some people are real good at the layers. Very impressed with that on many levels. I see what you did. Nonetheless, subscribe if you a, you know, if you want us to wear it that way, that's a good way. Thanks for the people who have subscribed. That's, that's a good, good deal. Too much. Appreciate it. A big deal. Also on Youtube. Subscribe to that. If you, if you like the video version of this podcast or if you want to watch and or share excerpts of this podcast. Three minutes, one minute sometimes. Do you haven't made any one minute.

Speaker 5:          01:26:13       One, six minutes sometimes. Some one minute ones. Okay. That'd be good. The one you just made is good. Thanks. The time's running out. Yeah. That's like a woody code. He was settling. Enhanced, enhanced, I think it's called enhanced excerpt. Enhanced excerpts, which means that echo has gone and put his cinematic flair. No, I would say I put some music on it and it put some text on it. There it is. Cinematic hats. It's enhanced it a little bit of salt and macro flare there. Yeah. All right. Well there it is. There's some of those on there as well. By the way. No big deal. I I when I got to the gym today, Carl. Yeah Carl, he says, Hey I saw you on Worldstar. That's when, you know, made it straight up in popular culture. Popular Culture. We're on Worldstar Worldstar if you don't know what world star is, it originally was for fights.

Speaker 5:          01:27:14       That's what I knew at four. Yeah. That's how it, I think that's how it gained game cause it just scraps it was for, it was for like music videos I think pop music videos and stuff like that. Then you get, you know, I would watch it because they, cause people would film street fights and I like to watch street fights. Sure. Learn a lot from street fights. And what's funny is it became such a popular culture thing that when people would be recording the fights that they're gonna then put on Worldstar. They would be saying worldstar during the fight. Someone refilming and saying Worldstar this is going on. Worldstar well now guess what's on Worldstar that goes video we made. It just goes on with star World Star. That's good. Nonetheless. Cross cultural boundaries. Okay. Worldstar worldstar maybe it happen. You did 100% but yeah, youtube, we'll talk.

Speaker 5:          01:28:06       We'll start. Thanks for putting me on there. Yeah, it was good. That is good. Awesome. Youtube. Good one good way to support also, Jack was a store. It's called Jocko store. Obviously chocolate store.com obviously that's where you can get shirts, tee shirts, some travel mugs on there. Some rash guards, more rash guards. This is like Jocko gear rash guards. So compared to, how would you compare them to the origin because actually there may their religion. Yeah, they're similar. They're more like geared tour light toward like Jocko. Well, let's, yeah, let's say this, that from a, from a visual perspective, there's a way that Jocko gear looks and there's a way that origin gear looks. There's some areas that overlap. There's some areas that don't overlap on over there. Some of the, let's call them color combinations that my brother Pete Robert's puts together. They wouldn't be allowed in the Jocko store.

Speaker 5:          01:29:07       They wouldn't be Jocko gear. Okay. And there's some things that Jocko gear does that wouldn't be appropriate for origin because origin is a little bit in the other direction. Sure. The overlapping areas, all good. Yeah. But if you want your gear made in America, there's one place to get it done, right. That's our factory up in Maine. It's your story. So yeah, boom. You can get rash guards there as well. Uh, some patches, those are restocked. A lot of people were hitting me up. That's slide for patches. Yeah. It's weird that people have to hit you up, that you just don't pay attention to the stock and say, wow, look running low. I should order more. Yeah. Maybe it's not that important to you. None of that's important. So I got a handle on it and I think I have a solid system where you know, we're going to run into way less of that, if any of that.

Speaker 5:          01:29:56       Okay. The less the women's stuff on there, some hats. Cause it does mean a lot to me, eh. I'm saying that's cool. So maybe I should be more, I should do a better job of expressing how important it is to me for people if they want patches to be able to get one. Yeah, maybe I haven't, I obviously haven't done a good job. Yeah, it's your fault. It's your fault. It is. So yeah. [inaudible] dot com that's good. Good, good way to support. Also psychological warfare. If you didn't know what that is, that's an album, an album, not a music album. It's a spoken word, spoken word with tracks, chocolate tracks. And each track is designated, formulated, engineered, engineered is what it is to help you through little points of weakness that you might run into on your campaign against weakness. Like if you want to skip I s I always say if you want to skip the workout, if you're like, Hey, I'm too tired. I don't feel like it. I don't feel like it.

Speaker 5:          01:30:56       I start with Alan because that's essentially why this whole thing exists because that that was the issue that was the genesis of this album was echo questioning how he could overcome these moments of weakness or how I do and the nights kind of answered one of them and we do record those things. You know what's funny is that I asked you that before and it wasn't that specific question, but it was essentially that question and be like, Hey, what do you do? And then you look, he kinda gave me a look in more like as if your feelings don't matter kind of thing. Basically pulled the jockey and I was like, dude, your mood or if kind of the day I got asked this similar, you know someone said, Hey John, can you tell us a little bit more about your morning routine? Like what you just want, you know your camp, I know you got up early, but can you tell us more about your morning routine? I was like, yeah, listen, my morning routine is extremely, extremely important. So here's, here's the steps of the Jocko morning routine. First of all, you set your alarm clock, you set all your alarm clocks, you set the first one at four 30 you set the next one at four 35

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       you set the next one at four 40 and you have your backups. By the way, you don't set your backups at the same time cause you want to be fumbling around with three alarm clocks in the morning. It's a good tip. I said, then you get done with that. Then when the alarm clock goes off, you get up, you get out of bed, then you go. And it's important that you get your toothbrush out, isn't that brush. And then I use it 46 brush strokes on each side of my mouth and no more, no less. And then I spit three times to city. So yeah. And I'm like, oh good. Here's the morning routine. Dude, you get up and you go, well then again, no, I know, I know. But it's like the reality is, is someone gonna write down my morning routine and then follow the exact same thing and would that be good for him?

Speaker 1:          01:32:46       Maybe, I dunno. Well here's what their morning routine then get up and go get up and get it. Yeah. But here's the, like some people they, they, they focus on in this can be beneficial from, from what I hear they focus on or I they identify certain things they do in a morning routine that helps them, that like sets them up or whatever. Morning routine. And I've, I actually wrote about in the, in the field manual, it's like the morning routine starts the night before. Yeah. Yeah. The morning routine starts when you get your gear ready cause you want to be fumbling around in the morning. Don't wake, don't set yourself up to fumble around with things in the morning. Right. That's just a bad thing. Don't do that. So you have your gear ready. You know, for me, I mean I'm very systematic in pretty much the way and throw at you.

Speaker 1:          01:33:35       You know, I have like all my workout gear is in the bathroom on hangers, you know, pair of shorts, shirt on each hangar, there's six of them. They're all the same. There's no thought process that's needed. They're all matching and I have the same kind of socks. All my socks are the same. I do have black socks and white socks, but one girl or is just completely white sox. All the same. You grabbed those, you put those on, boom. You brush your teeth, boom, you take, I take my supplements in the morning and at night, but I take my micro oil and my, my joint warfare boom, and then I go hit it. How much water teaching? It's it's, I drink when I'm thirsty, I drink and then if I'm, I don't measure it. You don't be like, okay, no, let me dig. I drink when I'm thirsty.

Speaker 1:          01:34:19       I eat when I'm hungry. But if you drink water when you're thirsty, you're already 2% dehydrated. Okay, well I drank a little bit more. I drink about 3% more than all right. There you go. So you 1%, uh, over, over hydrated or hydrated now less. Uh, but well, you know like all drink a whole thing like the, you know, the mugs that we have to travel there three ounces by the way. I'll drink a whole thing of that just routine. That's kind of the routine. But what's it like in the morning? You had to pound it. Sure. If you want to call it pounded and the drink it cause you want to stay hydrated. Get the water back in there man. Get it. Okay. That sounds good for you. Water is good for you by the way. Yeah, no doubt. It's better than soda in the morning.

Speaker 1:          01:35:03       You were drink a coke in the morning. No Bro. It's like the worst we did these monster mash is back in the or, so my son was doing the monster mash with us when he was like six or c. What's the monster? Mash is like, Yo, you do rope climbs that you do a sprint workout swimming, that you do pull ups in the EU and they put little things in there sometimes. So one of the things that they had to do was drink a coke through a straw. So you're like doing pull ups in a rope climb in the coke. Yeah. And so he uh, he, he, I think that was the first time you ever tried soda. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:35:38       nasty. Well there's of wanting soda though. Yeah. The, there's two elements to drinking a soda, especially for the first time is okay. It tastes weird. Sweet. Sugary and carbonated. Carbonated will burn your mind. It feels like it's burning your mouth. Yeah. He's like, yeah, you can't do that. That's up right in the middle of the work, not to check and do that. You keep in mind, you just described your morning routine. You answered the question that they were, I know you didn't answer. That's why I said, look, I'm not trying to be negative against morning routines and there's pretty much what I do. But the reason is I think people think, Oh, if I have, if I knew your morning routine, then I'd know what the secret is. It's like, hey man, the secret is get up and go do something. That's the secret. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:36:23       I'm not going to say, here's the deal. Here's the deal. I'm not going to sell you my morning routine as the solution to your problems. Now I will say that if you fumble around in the morning, it's going to cause you problems throughout the day, so I don't fumble it on in the morning. Set your, set your life up correctly so that you're not fumbling around. That's good. I'm not going to sell you my morning routine as the solution to your problems. I'm not going to do that, but I will say that if you do have a good system that you go through in the morning, it will set up your day correctly. Yeah. That's why I think people ask why people want it and I get it. Okay, so I'm not trying to be like a jerk. Right. I'm not trying to get that negative.

Speaker 1:          01:37:02       I guess I'm kind of making five boy, you're making fun, making fun of morning routines a little bit, but at the same time I have one tonight and I stick to it, but I think that's a thing. I don't, I don't actually have something and I stick to it like I do. This is what it is. I follow the functional thing that works and you stick to it. Yeah and I stick to it. So that's that. But I do, I did like designed my morning routine. I didn't see who I'm going to design this program. No know. It's like I know what works. It's functional and that's what I do. I do things that work and everyone else wants to know what works well there you not everyone figured out on their own what works. I guess. Here's the thing. Your morning routine, your, you're ultimately right and I think this is super important not to forget or not to like miss interpret where you don't use just quote. You just said like your morning routines, not going to be the solution to your problems kind of thing. I think that's what people do think. I think that here is someone with

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       a level hate in my opinion. I don't, I don't know, but this is what it seems like where someone with a level head and they want to look for just that. Just, just, just that one thing that's going to help them just a little bit, you know? So they're going to be like, Hey, let me, let me formulate a good morning routine. I don't know that much about effective routines, so let me look into that. Just has a little helper, not the solution to my problems, which I think some people may kind of miss. No, you're right. You're right. And that's why, like I said, I'm not belittling the idea that a morning routine is helpful because it certainly is. Yeah. It might add some, some tiny bit of help to your desk if you're doing the right thing. Some benefits. Thank you. It might benefit your day, which is positive.

Speaker 5:          01:38:39       Will it cure your overall problems of life? No, but you know what? It's a good place to start. That's why we say wake up early. Right? Yeah. That's part of the routine, but even how you, I guess I am being a jerk. Yeah. But here's the thing. Let me, let me, let me just like, yeah, get on a good morning routine. That's a good idea. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not trying to make fun of it. I was, but I'm not anymore. It seems like you're making fun of it for people because this is what it may be sounded like when someone asks you, what's your morning routine? It sounds like you, you're kind of with this presumption, like you're presuming or assuming that they think it's going to solve all their problems. That's kind of what it's saying. Yes. But in that very specific direction, like if someone says, Hey, look, I'm always looking for things to benefit my day and my effectiveness.

Speaker 5:          01:39:28       You know, I've, uh, you know, I do this and do that and I found that this helps a little bit here and there. Hey, what's your morning routine? Maybe I can incorporate one or more of your reading maybe into mind. That'll give me a little bit of help to, I don't think you would have came off. Yeah, definitely. That would have been a very good question. Here's what I do. So there you go. So you get how you said the question like you were kind of impersonating watch her morning routine, like making them sign off. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Everyone. Not, not so good. So good. We got to the bottom of it. You can have your drinking water. Another drink you can drink is you can drink something called Jocko white tea. It's available on Amazon. Now this is the only tea available, not only in America, but in the world that comes with an 8,000 pound dead lift guarantee.

Speaker 5:          01:40:18       So there's no other tea. I never send something out there that are, that are they say 6,000 they say they can get your 6,000 pound deadlifts. Yeah, there's, I've seen, I've seen 7,272 some teas. Some white tees say they'll get you 7,200 and there's only one white tea that'll get you the guaranteed 8,000 pound deadlift. Good. There's some layers on the tea, which I kind of remembered last time. I didn't want to interrupt, interrupt you. You, you're talking his first episode of this podcast. Absolute first one. Oh yeah. I think the only one that doesn't start with this is Jocko podcast number. That's cause you had a different vision of the at the time with no we, yeah. And then the last it started with you were thinking of this podcast is to be 100% that's what it felt like. That first one. That's what it felt like in your mind.

Speaker 5:          01:41:13       Yeah. In my mind, if you listen, yeah. Now you can see I was not, I was not ready to Cruz. I came in there with a game plan. The game plan did not say cruise on it. He became friends and get after it. It's funny as you shut it down so quick, right when you heard it you were like, hey, you know you want to cut it at this point, not the, not the, the little car like we just rolled into a conversation. But here's the thing with that conversation, as far as the layers go, we talk about white tea, Chai. Yeah, no, cause I was trying to remember what kind of tea that was. I don't know about the tea, especially back then. Nonetheless, you are always on the pomegranate that started when I was in the dirt.

Speaker 1:          01:41:53       So anyways, you can get that, you can get it on Amazon and then you can start dead lifting properly. There's some books that you can get way the warrior kid. I get questions all the time about how you should raise your kids and, and, and, and not just how to raise him cause he'd, people know how to raise him but they not how to raise him, but how to raise him. Like they know what they want the kids to, they know the values that they want the kids to have, but they're not sure how to give them the values. They don't know how to do that. So it w real simple, get them this book way of the Warrior Kit that that's, you know, discipline, eating habits, working out, dealing with bullies, how to study. All those things are in there. These are the things you want, not just your kid, but the children of the world to have these type of qualities.

Speaker 1:          01:42:44       And now on top of that, we have way of the warrior kid too, which is called Mark's mission. Just talks about some important lessons, controlling your temper, overcoming fear of failure, working hard, saving money, being frugal, dealing with verbal abuse, helping other people, starting businesses. Yeah, I said that. And becoming a leader again, all the, there's no human being that would look at the lessons from way of the warrior kid and say would say, I don't want my kid to have that quality. No, the qualities are in there. So there's that. And if you want a good example of a warrior kid, checkout Irish oaks ranch.com where you can get soap. That's a handmade by young Aiden who's 12 years old. But he has a business, no big deal. He's making soap. Yeah. Goat milk soap,

Speaker 5:          01:43:43       that's soaps actually good like to use. So for sure, let's face it, you know how you have your friend and his wife makes

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       soap on the weekend sympathy purchase scenario and it's beautiful. It has the little packaging and then you say, all right, it's soap. Um, let me go ahead and use some soap. And you're like, pride. This isn't like usable soap. This is the novelty decorative item. It was a cool little educational experience because he asked me, you know, he was making soap and he's, and he reached out to me. His Dad is, uh, uh, a farmer, also a firefighter, but he's a farmer. Anyways, his dad and I were connected. I buy meat from his dad and you know, he said all my son wants to get in touch with you. But as we're going through the process, he sends me like his label for the soap. Yeah. And you know, it looked nice, but um, went back with, you know, this needs to be an OCR standard.

Speaker 1:          01:44:37       Yeah. So anyways, yeah, it's cool little learning process and yeah, you can get that soap. You could support a kid that's a warrior kid. And the Jocko soap motto, which I give aid, no credit for. Sorry Aiden, you're a good kid. But you didn't think of this. It took the, it took the masterful marketing mind or Jocko to come up with the motto for Jocko Soap, which is stay clean. It's good. And you know, there's some layers on that too, right? Like a Motorhead song. Oh, all right. There you go. And you like Motorhead and I am a huge fan of Motorhead and you don't do any drugs. So there's the kind of the reason that whenever I talk to people or people talk to me on the, uh, through social media or email and they've had a drug problem or an alcohol problem and I always kind of sign off like, Hey, stay clean, stay clean.

Speaker 1:          01:45:30       So cause that's also what Lemmy from Motorhead was saying. Stay clean. Like don't let this kill you. Now, let me from Motorhead was a rare dude who did a lot of drugs and alcohol and somehow was able to survive very well up to up to when he died, drinking incredible amounts of Jack Daniels. Yeah. Those are some legit layers, but he always would say, don't do it. Yeah. He's a guy that would say, don't do it. It's done. Don't do it. Don't do what people do. Don't do drugs. Stay clean. Stay clean. There you go. Uh, in addition to that, I've got another book called the discipline equals freedom field manual. And if this is, this is a good point. If you know someone that's off the path, right? Like people go off the path in life and it doesn't take, we talked about this last time, it doesn't take, but one step off the path. When you're on a slippery slope, it's a slippery slope when you step off the path. So if you know someone that has taken a step off the path and they're starting to slide down, get him this book to get them on the path, the right path. And there's also a chance that the person that stepped off the path is you. So get the field manual. It's got the faults and actions that are to be on the right path. Make yourself better, faster, stronger, smarter,

Speaker 1:          01:47:00       anything else, more physically fit and healthier. The audio version of that is on iTunes, Amazon music, Google play, other MP3 platforms. It's not on audible because then you can't have it as an album with tracks, which we obviously support extreme ownership. The first book I wrote with my brother Leif Babin over a million copies sold. There's a lot of copies sold. Yes, that's a lot of copies sold. You know how many copies they told us would be successful because we didn't know any Lafe and I didn't know anything about the publishing world. Wait, what do you mean? When we were getting on the book was getting ready to come out and I would talk to the point where we're talking to a publisher. Lafe and I were talking to the publisher and he says, you know, if this is a successful book, then you know it'll, it'll really be, it will be good to see blah blah blah.

Speaker 1:          01:47:46       And I saw like the standard, like a myth, like a certain amount. That's the socially no. So I said, hey, what a, I don't know anything about this. What is considered to be a successful book? You know what the number was? 20,000 bucks thing. He goes, yeah. He goes, hey, you know, we're, we're printing 12,000 on this first round and if you sell, if you don't, we'll print some more. But if you can sell 20,000 books, that's, that's going to be, that's a huge success. And it will be. We'll be proud. So here we are. We're 1 million. Dang. It's pretty cool. Yeah. Good Job Leif. Babin good job. Both. Yeah, they've tells a story that we got home from Ramadi and the only time I ever told him anything positive was when we got home. We'd been home for like two weeks and I told him that the Delta platoon commander, Hey, good job. Over there.

Speaker 1:          01:48:37       So yeah, we're keen. I likes to keep it real. Yeah, man. And actually, you know what though? Good job over there seems real simple, but I'm sure in that context he was probably the most loaded. Yeah, good job anyone's ever heard. Yeah, yeah. I believe you're correct. Beyond the books and beyond the podcast also echelon front, speaking of life and me, this is our leadership and management consulting company. This is the thing, every, this is a bold statement, right? Every problem in every organization is leadership problem. That's a bold statement to make. Yeah. And I'll say it again. Every problem in every organization is a leadership problem. So if there's a problem in an organization, the problem, it boils down to leadership on some level. So what we do is we fixed the leadership and thereby we fix your problems. It's me, it's Leif Babin, it's JP Denelle.
