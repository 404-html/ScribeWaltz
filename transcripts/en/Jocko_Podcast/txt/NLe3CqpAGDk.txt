Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 38 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       we're foot slog, slog, slog, slog, and over Africa. Foot, foot, foot, foot, slogging over Africa,

Speaker 3:          00:00:21       boots, boots, boots, boots. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:25       Moving up and down again. There's no discharge in the war. Six, seven, 11 five, nine and 20 mile today for 11 1732 the day before,

Speaker 3:          00:00:39       boots, boots, boots, boots,

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       moving up and down again. There's no discharge in the war. Don't, don't, don't, don't look at what's in front of you.

Speaker 3:          00:00:51       Boots, boots, boots, boots.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       Moving up and down again. Men, men, men, men.

Speaker 3:          00:00:59       Men will go mad with watching them and there's no discharge in the war.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       Try, try, try, try to think of something different. Oh my God. Keep me from him.

Speaker 3:          00:01:13       Go in. Lunatic boots, boots, boots, boots. Moving up and down again. There's no discharge in the war. Count, count, count, count the bullets in the bandoliers. If your eyes drop, they will get on top of you. Boots, boots, boots, boots, moving up and down again. There is no discharge in the war. We can stick out hunger, thirst, and wariness, but not, not, not, not the chronic side of them. Boats, boats, boats, boats, moving up and down again and there's no discharge in the wall. Tanked so bad by day because a company, but knight brings long strings of 40,000 million boots, boots, boots, boots, moving up and down again. There's no discharge in the war. I have marched six weeks and Helen said a Phi, it's not fire devils dark or anything, but boots, boots, boots, boots, moving up and down again and there's no discharge in the wall.

Speaker 1:          00:02:37       Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

Speaker 2:          00:02:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       That's a poem. That's a poem called infantry columns by Kipling. Rudyard Kipling.

Speaker 2:          00:02:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       Who we've actually read before on the podcast, he was a

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       British correspondent. He was an author. He was a poet. He was a patriot, a British patriot, and he was actually also critical of war and paraphrased from a book by a guy named David Gilmore. The long recessional, the imperial life of Richard Kipling. Kipling was deeply critical of how the war was fought. And by the way, he's talking about world war one of how the war was fought by the British army as opposed to the war itself, which is kind of like Hackworth. Hackworth was more opposed to the way we were fighting in Vietnam. Then he was opposed to the actual war itself.

Speaker 2:          00:03:45       Hm.

Speaker 4:          00:03:48       And he complained is early. This is Kipling complaint as early as October of 1914 that Germany should have been defeated by now. Then something must be wrong with the British army. Kipling was shocked by the heavy losses that the British expeditionary force had taken by the autumn of 1914 and blame the entire prewar generation of British politicians who he had argued failed to learn the lessons of the bu or war. And as a result, thousands and thousands of British soldiers were paying with their lives for failures in the fields. And so there's some definite complexities to Kipling and it actually goes a little bit further and deeper with these complexities. And there's a reason I started off with that poem.

Speaker 2:          00:04:44       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:04:46       And that poem, it is pretty much attributed that that the, the, the ID of that poem, which is obviously about marching long distances and it's attributed to a series of forced marches that were led by in the Boer war, which were led by Field Marshal, Lord Frederick Roberts, who led 60,000 men on forced marches during the second bu or war in South Africa. He let these forced marches that were almost a thousand miles, 950 miles from Cape Down to Transvaal. Okay. And so that's kind of weird. This, this poem comes from about how maddening it is to march in how hard it is. But the interesting, the other interesting piece of this is that Lord Robert, Rob, Lord Roberts, who led this March was actually personal friends with Kipling. They were, they were close friends and

Speaker 4:          00:05:47       Lord Roberts was commander in chief of the army during World War One. And at Kipling's request at root, your Kipling's request, Lord Roberts allowed Kipling's son to be admitted to join the Irish guard. He had some kind of a health problem. And so Kipling Rudyard Kipling called him up and said, hey, my son's got a health issue, but he needs to get in the game. And Lord Roberts worked it out, you know, commander in chief of the army and got him, had him admitted to the Irish guards. It was actually his eyesight. He had poor eyesight. And so the,

Speaker 5:          00:06:33       okay,

Speaker 4:          00:06:34       the horrible piece I guess of that is that, as I mentioned the first time we read a Kipling poem on here is that Rudyard Kipling son.

Speaker 5:          00:06:45       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:06:46       John Kipling was killed in September of 1915 at the battle of loos where the bro, the British suffered 60,000 casualties in three weeks of fighting's 60,000 casualties. His body was never identified and he is one of the 20,000 British dead that are corrupt, commemorated by the Lou's memorial. And while his body was never found, there were accounts that he was last seen slogging through the mud blindly after a violent shell explosion had ripped off his face. And there's further connections. And one of the lines in the poem is that there's no discharge in the war. Then this is actually from the Bible. ECCLESIASTES, Ds eight eight says there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit. Neither half he power in the day of death and there is no discharge in that war. So what he's saying there is no man have powers to power over the spirit to retain spirit. Meaning you, you can't keep your soul when it's, when it's time for your soul to go. You can't keep it. And then neither half the power over the day of death. Obviously you have no power to overcome death and there is no discharge in that war. And that is that this ultimate struggle.

Speaker 5:          00:08:37       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:08:37       between life and death. That war that we fight for life itself, there's no escape.

Speaker 5:          00:08:45       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:08:46       you can't get out of it. There is no discharge from that war and

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       [inaudible] maybe a little heavy way to start the podcast, but that poem also has a special meaning to a certain group of people in the navy. And those of you that know what I'm talking about there, you know what I'm talking about there. And it's a poem that I thought of often in my career, especially when I strapped on my gear and heave dawn overloaded ruck sack for a long patrol or march. And when you do that, any soldier, a military man will tell you this, that when you do that, that is one of the most demanding parts of the job. The ruck March, the long patrol, the hump, a little walk, the forest road march. And even though you're with a group of people, when you do that,

Speaker 4:          00:09:54       when you're marching, you're very much alone.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       You're alone with your thoughts and there's things that you got to think about. You've got to think about your field of fire. You got to think about your navigation, you've got to think about rally point. You've got to think about head count, you gotta think about terrain feature. You've got to think about the enemy and booby traps and ids and all that stuff. But even with that, there's still a lot of empty space to fill up inside your head. And I recently

Speaker 4:          00:10:29       took my kids out on patrol and I guess to be grammatically correct, it was a hike in the civilian world, but in my mind it was a patrol. It felt like a patrol and you know, it's

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       the same thing. I mean essentially you're moving from point a to point B. You said security. When you get there, you set your layup point, which civilians call like a campsite. Then you sleep and then you wake up and then you do it again. And as I did that patrol, and since it had been a while since I had done a patrol and because I was also watching my kids on their first patrol.

Speaker 2:          00:11:13       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       I got to kind of revisit my little relationship that I have with patrolling over the years.

Speaker 4:          00:11:21       And also as I saw them suffer and learn through their first patrol, I got to thinking to everything that I'd learned over the years from patrolling.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       And in doing that I realized how much patrolling had Tommy. So I'm, I'm there, I'm walking and I'm thinking about all these things that I learned. Because again, when you're patrolling, you got time. Even if even if you're thinking about navigation, you're thinking about

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       all these things, it doesn't matter. Even every piece of the job that you're focused on, it doesn't matter. There's still space to fill. And that's what happened. My, you know, your mind starts to think about all these things and it dawned on me how much patrolling and marching had taught me in and how it's really a fundamental component in everything that I did in the seal teams in the military.

Speaker 5:          00:12:18       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:12:19       And like leadership, there's some fundamental principles that apply universally to so many things in life. And also just like leadership. There's a certain aspect of patrolling in navigation that is as much art as it is science. And the science of course is relatively easy to teach, but the art as always, the art is hard to teach. And finally with this, this idea of navigation of moving from point a to point B, which includes plotting a course and picking way points along the way and identifying it and avoiding obstacles in route and how to overcome the unexpected obstacles and how and when and where to rest. And everything else. That navigation at patrolling includes and all those things are things that you face as you navigate a life. And as you set goals, as you establish where you're going. So I wanted to take a closer look at land navigation and how it relates to leadership and life. And in digging in, I looked at, I looked at some of the information out there, some of the, some of the field manuals and

Speaker 5:          00:13:47       yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:13:48       it's, it's

Speaker 5:          00:13:51       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:52       I learned from people, right. And I didn't learn from a book. And as I winter to the books, I was coping that I could find what I had learned from people. But, but I didn't really find it. I found pieces of it, glimpses of it, but nothing like what I was taught by the guys that raised me in the seal teams. And you know, I looked up the uh, Army FM three tech 25. Dot. Two six map reading and land navigation. It's a thorough document and it's very heavily heavy on the scientific side, but the actual technical skill of it, like how to set declination at a compass and how to work at the map and under what the contour line. All the basic tools are in there. And there's some good quotes and one of the quotes it said today, the complexities of tactical operations and deployment of troops are such that it is essential for all soldiers to be able to read and interpret their maps in order to move quickly and effectively on the battlefield. Okay? Can't argue with that. You got

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       to know where you are. And if you ever heard me say this, I always used to ask the uh, the young, the young seal officers, what's the most important piece of information you need on the battlefield? And they would say where the bad guys are or how many guys you have or how many enemy there are or, or anything like that. They'd have a bunch of different ideas. And I would say, no, no, no, no, no. The most important piece of information you can have on the battlefield is aware you are, you got to know where you are otherwise nothing else matters. And then I looked at a book called the last hundred yards, which we actually covered on this podcast, podcast number three. And it goes through a section which is describing, is talking about gps and how now we've got gps is, and the GPS is can be unreliable and you can't count on them and all this stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       And it's kind of true. It was even more true when that book came out, which was in 1995 and there was less satellites in the sky and the gps receivers weren't as good. And the encryption methodology wasn't so dialed in yet. So the GPS is, we're less accurate back then. And they were also still pretty big. They were these big contraptions. And even in 1993 1994 the GPS is that I carried or big heavy things. Basically you had to assign a person to carry them. And now of course they're tiny. They're, you know, everybody's got, um, you know what gps and you're on your iPhone or whatever smartphone you're using that are a thousand times better than the one I used to carry on my back. And they're also very accurate and reliable. Now in the military's comed up, rely heavily on them, perhaps perhaps a little too much.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       And I'm not going to be a guy that's like a stick in the mud that says, hey, don't evolve, don't learn anything because technology is awesome and you have to take advantage of it. But I also do think there's a need to remember the old ways. And I remember when gps first came out and I was coming into the seal team and they had this thing and I remember this, this officer's would, this officer's particular said to me, you know, hey, all I need to do is see all we need to do is carry this thing and, and you know, we'll know exactly where we are at all times. Then he hands me this, you know, 20 pound brick but big box thing and are kind of said, hey man, all I need to do is carry this map and compass and I'll know exactly where I am at all times. It's called land navigation. I want to learn it. But nowadays, uh, the GPS is, are awesome and we definitely rely heavily on them. But, but it is, it is piece of the last hundred yards that definitely emphasizes that you have to know how to Land Nav, which is good. But like I said, when I looked through these books, none of them gave me this same clear level of instruction that I learned about land navigation. It patrolling when I first got into the teams

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       back in the day. And again, these instructions in this methodology and some of these basic principles of patrolling and Land Nav, they stuck with me and are really fundamental building blocks of how I ended up doing everything that I do. And they're really the basis of the attitude that I had that was very beneficial and leading me to having success in other areas, which was awesome. And so again, here I am and taking my kids on their first patrol that made me realize this so clearly. And as I was thinking about, I was like, you know, I'm going to talk about this on the podcast.

Speaker 5:          00:18:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:48       Because these are lessons that I learned that I actually forgot that I learned. You know what I mean? These are lessons that are so embedded that I forgot that I thought about them, but I think about them all the time and then not seeing my kids do this. I'm thinking, Oh yeah, there they are. They're learning this right now for the first time. And so to go through some of those things, some of those principles, the first one is planning and you know, we, we, this gets every, of course everyone knows you've got to come up with a plan, but doing a detailed map study and identifying the obstacles that you're going to have to get around. And there's a couple different methods that you can use for land navigation. One of them is called dead reckoning. And dead reckoning means you get a compass bearing from point a to point B is, you know you're going to be traveling on 270 degrees.

Speaker 1:          00:19:40       So you put your compost on 270 degrees and you march, you go in a straight line, don't let anything take you off that line, head down and go. And that's called dead reckoning. And that's obviously can be very problematic because if in between you and where you're going is a giant mountain or a, you know, a bunch of rivers or whatever, you're gonna have to go through all those things and you're going to get, you're going to get worn out, you'd get tired. It might be not tactically advisable to go through those areas. And so the better form is called terrain Navar Terrain Association. And when you're doing that, you actually look at the map and you study what the, what the ground is going to do. And so if there's a big mountain, you can skirt around the bottom of the mountain and then you get to have the side of the mountain and there's a, a ravine that's, you can follow that ravine around till you get to a certain point on the ravine where it cuts far to the north and you can, you can head in the other direction to your, towards your turn.

Speaker 1:          00:20:35       So it's this, it's a method of really knowing the terrain that you're going to be on and it's infinitely more effective than dead reckoning. So if you think about this from a perspective of you have a mission that trying to get done well, how are you going to get there? You know, how are you going to get this mission done? Are you going to just put your head down and absorb any impact that you take and apply more pressure or you're going to be smart? Are you going to study the terrain and take a look and figure out the best way around those obstacles, those dead reckoning and terrain association util the Terrain Association. You don't like, let's say, go around the mountain and then tried to get back on the dead reckoning course. You're just using the journeys, the terrain, and you'll know when you do your map study, you'll know that you're going to go skirt around this mountain.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       You're going to go down a ravine, then you're going to cut over by this open field. You're going to hold along the wood lines. When you get to the end of the woodline, there's going to be a fence. You're going to step over that fence. Once you get to the offense, you're going to fall the fence for, you know, uh, until you hit another big terrain feature like another hill, and then you're gonna fall off the base of that hill until you get to a stream. So you're going to know exactly where you're going the whole time. And you can imagine how much more effective this is. I mean you don't have to look at your compass, you are taking advantage or you're going to patrol in areas where you have a tactical advantage too. So it's just uh, a much, much better way to do things.

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       So a lot of times I think people, um, you know, they hear the big uh, the big navy seal like, oh, we're just going to get it done. You just stay on the course, right? Well staying on the course means I'm going to reach my objective. It doesn't mean I'm going to pound my head into the wall without thinking. Right? So that's what terrain features do for you. And there's also some terrain features that are interesting. You can use reference points that keep you from going too far so you can know, hey, if we hit this main highway, we went too far. We know we missed our target, we missed our turn. If we hit this river, we know we went too far. If we hit this ridge line, we know we hit went too far. So you're going to set those up for you and they're going to confirm where you are.

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       And also you're going to use those as reference points, so you're going to tell you a whole team, so your whole team is going to know, hey, we made it this far. Oh there's the big river that were turning left at. Okay, we turned left and that's awesome. Next they're going to hit is a Woodbine, oh, here's the woodline so everybody knows. And so imagine if you're, again, think about this outside the the parameters of land navigation and patrolling. Think of it in a regular business or any situation where we're trying to get a team to do something. If you lay out the course for them and you plot out what the obstacles are and you explained to people where they're going to be and how how important it is that they need to get there and what we need to be looking out for.

Speaker 1:          00:23:41       I imagine how the team feels, the team knows where they, they understand where they are when you're doing dead reckoning. The back of the, the guys in the back, they have no idea where they are. I've been that guy. I've been that guy in the back of the patrol and you just have no idea where you are. You have no idea how much further to go. You just got your head down, your your slug slugging along with your weight and it's a nightmare. Whereas I've been on good patrols where I'm in the back, but we got a really good brief and I'm like, oh, there's that mountain own, there's that ravine. Okay, we should becoming that stream soon. Oh yes, we're at the stream. So you know where you are. And when you provide your team with that kind of clarity on the course that you're planning to take, it's going to make them so much more aware of what's happening. And the more aware they are of what's happening, the better performance you're gonna get from him. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       The other thing is, as you're doing this, you do something called a pace count, which is your, as you walk, you know how many paces it takes you to get a hundred yards and there's some, uh, Kentucky windage is there as walks and we were going uphill or downhill. You can, you can work out these diff, what you can get pretty accurate. So you can know that, hey, when I take left, when my left foot hits the ground, on average, when I'm wearing a hundred pounds, it's 86 paces for me and I just went a hundred yards. So that's, that's, you'll know that. And so then what you're doing is you're constantly checking it gives you another, it gives you another reference point because if we're supposed to hit, uh, you know, a stream in 300 yards, and I know we've marched 600 yards, some happened right time for me to stop.

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       In fact, at 400 yards, I'm probably gonna stop and say, okay, let's do a quick map study. So you want to double check these things. And in a business world, this could be some kind of a timeline that you've set up. So you're like, hey, at, at, you know, 42 days, we should be here on this project. Oh, we're not there yet. Okay, what's the problem? What did we miss? Why aren't we getting it done? So that gives you two sort of methodologies to confirm where you are as you can triangulate your position, which is smart. What'd you call it? Kentucky. What? Kentucky windage what does it mean it's give or take? You know, it's just, uh, it comes from shooting. Oh, and you would normally, you dial in your site to get you specifically, let's say you think 600 meters, but then there's a strong wind blowing.

Speaker 1:          00:25:59       So maybe you're going to hold off to the left to the Queen d in Kentucky or something I think is just shooting the, maybe the shooters in Kentucky had a, they made it their real accurate pulling a little Kentucky when we got to accommodate for that. Yeah. Gotcha. Chicago windage no, no. Well cause it's kind of windy, you know, so yeah, I see where you're coming from, but no, it's, it's, it's Kentucky. Windage my broaching you. So like I said, in life plan study, the route that you're going to go, think about the obstacles. How are you going to avoid him, what your goals look like? What do your smaller goals look like along the way? The little reference points. So you've got somebody you signs with a big project, okay, what are the little things? Or you got something in your life that you're trying to accomplish.

Speaker 1:          00:26:48       What are the little goals you've got to set for yourself? So you get to keep a reference point along the way and what's the timeline you're going to eat those on? Yup. That's how you stay on track. And you know what we actually did? We did something called pacenotes and what pacenotes were, and I learned it for for foot patrols and we ended up using it even more when it came to vehicle patrols. And I, I realized that, I don't know, maybe 10 years ago or something, we started sending guys to a rally driving school so I could learn how to drive rally racing cars. And that's day. That's been the way they always done pacenotes in rally racing. So you, so what's cool about it is when you do pacenotes, you're writing down specifically, this is the terrain feature, this is what I'm seeing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       This is how far away it is. This is the next terrain feature. This is what I'm going to see and this is how far away it is. So you can actually track that. Now we got so detailed with that on, on vehicle mounted patrols, we would actually just take the map and blow the map up so we'd see exactly what it looked like at that intersection or at that juncture at that city blocks. So we could see what the buildings look like. So we'd be looking for, so that's pacenotes and it, and it, it's almost like a rehearsal, you know, it's almost like a rehearsal cause you can, you can walk the whole team through and they can get a visualization of what they're going to see and how, how it's going to look. And the other, the other piece is that I said is you got to share that plan and explain it to everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       So everybody's on the same sheet. And, and I did this, w I x explained it to my kids, you know, and I said, okay, here's what we're going to see. We're at this area here, we're going to go across some flack round, we're gonna start hitting some little terrain features here. It's going to go up and down and up and down. That's going to tell us that we're here and not only does it help them know what's going on, but now I'm talking through it and that helps me because it helps to teach things because when you teach something, you become more proficient at it. That's one of the good things about teaching anything. You know you want to get better at something, teach people how to do it. It makes you better. You want to teach that arm lock or you want to get better at the arm lock, teach the arm lock. You'll notice all kinds of little details about it.

Speaker 6:          00:28:50       It's so hard to teach, like if you're not used to teaching, I jump in there and t cause you're just used to doing it and a lot of that stuff you just do without thinking about, okay, what exactly am I doing? This detail. You just do it. You don't muscle memory. And there's all these little factors that facilitate you doing something that you don't even think about and then tried teaching. You're like, oh, you kind of do this. Wait, wait, Whoa, whoa. You know, you didn't even know what you're saying. You know, Greg train always throws out little details like, oh, that's a good little right and he has something that I do. But once he points it out or teaches it and he'll be teaching us something basic that I know and I'm good at. And he'll say, oh yeah, and then I put my foot on the hip here to stabilize this. And I go, I go, I do that. When you start thinking about a new focus on it, it makes you that much better at it. And it's the same thing that's going to happen here when you actually brief your team and tell them exactly what to expect. Now again,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       this doesn't mean that you're going to say, hey, this is what exactly how it's going to go. Cause you've got to give the caveat that, hey, this is our plan and where you might have to deviate from this plan and that's okay, we're ready to do that, where adaptive. But when you talk through it, it helps you and it helps them. Yeah, that's funny. Greg train is the reason I ran into him. He was like, he's teaching or whatever and then he just all of a sudden busts out, hey echo, teach them that move that you do. And I was pretty good at that move. I started teaching. I think it's like, it is a guard past that I do sometimes and Brown, I'm teaching it. I don't even know what I'm talking about. I'm like doing it all good but, and everyone's like, oh, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       You know, I was like Brown, I am a poor teacher. Well that's something you can work on. I guess starting now, take over the podcast. I'm more comfortable avoiding it. Awesome. Uh, now that, now the next piece that I was thinking about on patrolling and that I saw my kids go through and that I went through as a young seal is you start questioning or you start going through this process of what do I need to bring with me? What do I actually need to bring with me? Now, when you don't have to carry it, well, when you don't know what it means to carry it, carry it. When I say Carrie, I mean put it on your back and bear the weight of that item. When you don't have to do that, you want to carry everything. I'll just carry everything. That warm sleeping bag in the whisper lights, stove and the extra food and the comfort gear and all this stuff. That's what you do when you, when you don't have to carry it on, you don't think about carrying on or you don't know what it feels like to carry it, but when you have to carry it, you get down to what you need real quick to what you actually need real quick. Totally limited on the food.

Speaker 1:          00:31:30       You're not going to be, I never, I never heated a meal in the field unless it was like, um, snow on the ground, a winter warfare scenario, never heated a meal in the ground if it was never, never heated a meal because that means you had to bring a fuel and a whisper light and all this stuff. And I never, I was a radium side. I already carry a radio and then I got used to that. So by the time I was an officer and I wasn't carrying a radio anymore, I said, I'm just going to be lighter than everybody else. Yeah. Um, comfort gear. No, no, we won't take that. And do you need to, do you need to get it, you need to bring enough comfort here that you can actually sleep and survive and be, you need to bring a ground pad or whatever. Um, but you know, we used to say a little sang was travel light freeze at night. That, that was my same for sure. Travel life reasoning. And I'll tell you, I got my indoctrination to freezing at night and traveling light. When I first checked into the team, I went to a comm school communication school, a seal communication school. So you're going to learn how to be a radio man in the

Speaker 4:          00:32:39       seal teams. And I had this, this old chief that was run in the running, the running the training and I was a fired up new guide, even have my tried it. So I was just brand new guy, didn't even try knows at the team and they sent me to the school. And so this chief and I actually went with another new guy who's, who's a great guy and we went out there total new guys. Neither one of us had to try it. So we had graduated from buds a couple months ago or from airborne school, whatever. So we showed up, it's wintertime and we show up and the end of this school you go through uh, a field training exercise and it's, I want to say it's five days in the field. It's like Monday through Friday in the field or something along those lines. And you are basically doing the reconnaissance mission and they give you really good targets to look at and you're going to look at and you're going to report back with all this information and then you're going to move, they're going to move you every couple hours.

Speaker 4:          00:33:34       They give you directions to a new point to move to. So we're doing where we're getting ready for this FTX and I'd never spent much time in the field and the guy that's running the course, you know, he's having fun with the new guy and he's like, hey Welink. And I said, yes chief. And he goes, you know what you think your hardcore, and I go, I'm trying to be hardcore. And he says, if you're really hardcore, you don't need a paunch, you don't need a sleeping bag or a ground pad, you'd just go out there with a, with a Poncho and Poncho liner. And I was like, okay, no problem. So sure enough, I go in the field with a Poncho and a Poncho liner and actually I actually, it was a bivy sack, which is a Gortex. It's like a Goretex sleeping bag.

Speaker 4:          00:34:18       Just a thin gortex shell and a Poncho liner, which is something that's been around forever and it's just a very thin, thin blanket. No, it's not even a tent. It's like a blanket. It's like a blanket. That's what it is. It's a very thin, it's, yes, it's a very thin liner. It's what? It's the Poncho liner. And so I had, those are the two things I had with me and uh, and my buddy took the same so we were like, oh, oh that you need to be like that to be hardcore. I'm article or how cold was it? Like, so we are going into the field, we're inserting in the field and in the sun is going like we've inserted right at dusk as we're inserting in the field, it's raining right as we get on the ground at turns to sleet. And then two hours into the night it turns into snow. So we freeze. I mean we freeze, we're just, we can't sleep. And the funny thing was was that we couldn't sleep. We literally couldn't sleep. It was too cold for us asleep. And you and the guy had set it up. So you had to make a communications window. You had to make communications. It was about every three or four hours. And so, and if you missed a communications window, if you missed it, that was, you know, you got your grade went down

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       or whatever, you got points subtracted. Hmm. So all the other guys who were experienced seals that knew how to live out in the field better than we did, they all were super comfortable. They all went out there and had sleeping bags and ground pads and all that. And they slept through their calm windows. At least some of them, they didn't sleep through all of them, obviously. But occasionally it sleeps through one after four days, three days, whatever. And so we were the only pair that made all of our comm windows cause we couldn't say good. You know? Yeah. We'd just be standing up just standing up, standing by a tree, doing burpees, just trying to survive. Yeah. So that was, um, that was one of the lessons on our learning how to travel light freeze at night. Now that we're a little too much. I I should, you did, the thing I needed was a ground pad.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       You need to ground pad when you go in the field. So travel late, freeze at night. It's kind of like a warning or is that like no it's a deal to do. It was my methodology and it's, it's the methodology of a PR, a portion of guys in the military that are, that are on the, it would rather be on the hard side. Right. So I'm going to, I'll freeze that night so I can travel, travel light freeze at night because you're going to be more effective when you're, when you're lighter. Yeah. I mean of course if you're exhausted. So that's why, that's why there's gotta be a balance there. We should have brought ground pads on that operation to that and that training operation for sure. Yeah. And and like we got trench foot legit and the guy that was with me had legit trench fort when he got out.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       Like no, it's when your feet cause cause this old part of this op part of this training operation took place in, in like a swamp. So says freezing in the swamp and he got legit World War One style trench foot. I had it to my, not as bad as him but what is that? It's just your feet get numb and rotted and jacked up. Yeah. Good Times. So, so again, how do we apply this to life and I, and I think if you, if you look at what you want versus what you actually need and imagine if you had to carry everything that you owned. Now of course that's not possible. But I think this is this whole like minimalist attitude that's, that's kind of getting popular right now that it's getting popular in the civilian world right now. But in the military we've always valued that.

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       And it's one of the cool things about going away on deployment. They, for me, I always love this feeling when you went away on deployment, you can only take w we as as seals took a lot of gear with us. But there's a limit. You took, you know, five or six kit bags, you know, five or six big duffel bags basically filled with gear and that's it. That's it. That's all your gear. It's all the gear you have. And so honestly to me that, that always felt good. That is what I got. This is everything I have. And you know, as a young seal that was basically you could fit all your gear in those six bags and then everything you owned in the civilian world, you could fit in two more bags. And we live that. Like, I live like that with my buddies back in the day.

Speaker 1:          00:38:45       We live like that for a long time. Oh you, we can go on an appointment tomorrow. We just put all of our stuff at home and a kit bag. We can blow in our stuff up and we can be ready to go. Yeah. Kind of like we're the uh, military guys are Kinda like the old g minimalists back in the day. Good. And then we got, I got to teach Sarah this stuff. Yeah. When people start to hold on to stuff, especially the part where if you or when you carry it, you realize how much you know that part where you're talking about once you know the weight of your own stuff, you think twice before in is really, really thorough. Start thinking about the cost of that gear and what does that mean over time and how much of usage are you going to get out of it.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       Now the thing that I hang on to, there's a couple things that I'm a little bit of a hoarder on. One of them is t shirts. Yeah. I'm not mad at them now. Now some people might be thinking, Hey Jocko, you wear the same freaking teacher every single day. Which is true. But I have, you know, old tee shirts that are just, I just, I just, cause I wear my tee shirts a lot when I wear them. It's hard for me to part with them better that than shoot. I have a, I have a ton of old Jujitsu tee shirts from like when I used to go to schools, I used to traveling school. Yeah. And they'd give me a tee shirt and I have all these old school teachers of schools that don't even exist. Aura schools that got really big or whatever, or just competitions that I did.

Speaker 1:          00:40:05       You know, when you've got those old school t shirts and I'm not, I don't wear them anymore, but I was thinking, you know, what I can do is inventory them, take pictures of them and put them on the inner webs and then throw them away. What do be, oh, like a, like a, like an archive. Because, because there's some it, it triggers memories that are like memorabilia really hard because you like to, uh, it, it triggers the memory of those times of the, of that event or whatever cause otherwise you're not thinking about it. And there was a problem with that. I'll tell you, I realize this from my experience, uh, grown up, you know, I grew up in, in New England and I don't go home, didn't go home at all. It hardly ever go back to the town where I grew up. And the people that I know that are still there, they remember all this stuff from when we were kids.

Speaker 1:          00:40:50       They remember this event and that, and remember when this happened. And I honestly don't remember. I just don't remember it. And I think the reason is because I go, went away from there and it never went back. And so I have nothing triggering triggering those members. I don't see the school yard where the fight happened. I don't see the, I don't see the, the road where the car flipped. I don't see that stuff. And so I don't remember it like they do, they, they're their old time. Oh yeah. I remember when little Johnny you get, you know, it's like, no, I actually don't remember that. So with some of this memorabilia, as you called it, sure. If every time I look at it I go, oh yeah, that was cool tournament or that was cool training with those guys or whatever. So I have a bunch of Jujitsu tee shirts that I have a hard time getting a bar party with. I was standing up taking them to the gym and framing them and hang them up to acoustics. No notch. I was teaching for a year, but they're old school t shirts. They'd be cool to have those old kids. And if you, if you got my t shirts, Dean tee shirts and Jeff Glover's tee shirts and put them up in there, that'd be sick. Yeah. Or it's on the poster. I remember best of the West. Remember that tournament? Yeah. That was a good one. God. Yeah man.

Speaker 1:          00:41:59       So

Speaker 1:          00:42:01       that's it. You go through this checklist back to the subject here you go through this checklist of what you actually need. And again, when you're, when you're in a business you got to look at what you, what, what do you need to complete this operation, what do you just want? Cause it'd be nice to have and separate those things. Separate those things. You can actually put them in those categories, you know, need, want, nice to have. Right. And then you go through, okay, let's call, let's contract and what we need first. And then we can see if there's anything that we want. And then by the way, if there's a nice to have, we can throw in there. Okay fine. But to go in there and just buy everything on that list or, or command everything on that list cause you think you're going to need it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       No wrong answer, wrong roof. And a lot of times people, and of course I'm not talking about, well maybe plays or it does apply to business, but just in life, what you need and what you want. You know, lot of times what you want doesn't even facilitate what you need. You know, how like you'd be like, Oh hey, I, I, I don't need faster internet, but I kind of want it. But the faster Internet is going to facilitate my work. Well it's that you do, you know, you need the internet at least that something, sometimes people will get stuff that they want that's just straight up no function. Yeah. Oh yeah, for sure. Well not in my family. I know things about function. I know like him don't like him. Um, okay. So, so again, back to this, once you've decided on what you're going to bring or what you're going to need, then it's time to start the operation, right? It's time to start this movement. And even from the start you've got to check, confirm where you are, make sure you know, then you get started. And I had this first reminder when I did this little patrol with my kids, cause I just said, oh we're good to go. It's a little trail and start walking. We started walking. I didn't keep a pace count.

Speaker 1:          00:43:51       That's ridiculous. That's embarrassing to them. It didn't keep a pace count and it wasn't really paying attention. And we're just kind of talking and having, yeah we're just talking and moving and kind of getting used to it all. And Hey, how's your backpack for you? And all that stuff. And all of a sudden I go, wait a second,

Speaker 1:          00:44:08       where are we? Where are we right now? Cause I had told them that, hey, we're gonna be looking for this trail goes up. And we talked through it and we pulled out the map and we started doing this study. And my son was like immediately with all we went too far, we missed it. I know what it's back there, and my daughter wouldn't commit either way. And I said, okay, let's do an assessment in. So we, and realize that we actually hadn't gone quite far enough so we went a little bit further. But my point is that you got to check yourself. You got to check yourself and check your team consistently. Not Constantly, right? That's micromanagement, but consistently and you also have to watch out for target fixation, which is trying to go too fast. I go, you're just trying to get to that to the end point without going by your little way points along the way. That is a way to get yourself lost because you're driving and you don't, you're not looking for your reference points and you'll lose the bubble. So you got to detach a little bit and stand back and pay attention to not be all crazy about that. You know for, you know, every 500 meters, maybe every you do a quick check. Every thousand meters you're going to do a little bit of more accurate study.

Speaker 2:          00:45:28       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       And that's gonna keep you, keep you in line. And if you are not aligned, you only going to be a little bit off track. You're not going to be 12 days of work or two hours of walking off track.

Speaker 6:          00:45:43       Yeah, it makes perfect sense to specially we by all these reference points that target fixation, you're just, you've got one reference point. It's probably not even that accurate because really just by the nature of the whole deal, the map, the one reference point that you do have is the furthest thing away, literally. So you only have that one hour for that. If you have all these other reference points, you get off track one step, two step, three steps. You still got like a bond to reference points. He does all, all right, let's backtrack all of these reference points there to support

Speaker 1:          00:46:10       Geo. That's, that's how you do it. And that's again, that's when you're planning something with a team and a business. You got to have some reference points along the way to help you get towards your goal because your goal is far off in the distance, you know? So you've got a plan about how you're going to get there

Speaker 6:          00:46:27       if you have a edit video or use Photoshop or is it has this, when I first started it has this history

Speaker 6:          00:46:35       little box. Every move you make it records. It was, that's pretty cool. Delete, delete. And then you have control over it, which is save. But that's something else. But it, yeah, each one. So you can literally go back, oh wait, it's reference point with every single move. That's awesome. So you can go up, oh, let me go all the way back. You know, 25 moves to when I erase this little thing. Oop. And let me start from there. You know, you bring one thing back that's far up the chart. Yeah. The, here's the only thing it's like, but it's like a little like a fork kind of. So like let's say you go back in time, essentially you go back like five moves and then you make a different move. It that one, this course. Yeah, it's gone. That's why in time traveling. Yep, exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       Time. Trial. All right. So when you get out on patrol now, um, disciplines paramount. Sure. For instance, you got to stay hydrated. You've got to keep track of your gear, you've got to keep of your pace count. You don't let your gear get out. You don't take out your gear like, oh were stopped for seconds. I'm just gonna pull everything out of my rucksack and lay it all over the place. No, you got to keep it tight. You don't rush over obstacles. So for instance, Oh, you know, it was a little log and I got us, there's a log going across this trail and I got to step over the log. Well I step up on top of it and then I'm just going to jump off cause I, it's a little easier. No, you don't just jump off cause that's how you sprain your ankle.

Speaker 1:          00:47:57       That's how you blow out a knee, which is, you know what, you're playing a basketball game or you're on the Jujitsu, Matt and you and you twist your ankle. Cool. We'll walk to the side, but some ice on it, you're, you know, 10 kilometers out in the middle of nowhere and one of your kids sprains and ankle urine, you're in trouble. You have a, you're in trouble. And if you're out on patrol in a military situation and you get somebody that gets sprained ankle, you're an even more significant trouble. So you got to have the discipline to slow down. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. Watch your footing, watch for danger. Watch your field of fire. Pay attention to the first person that's in front of you and the person that's behind you. And that's how you're doing new communications. You got to keep your communication up the whole time.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       So again, you can go right to any business, any project that everyone's working on. It's all the same thing. You got to be disciplined, you got to keep track of things. You gotta keep your communication going between your team members by passing whatever signals you've got to pass. When you get to a layup point where when you're going to actually stop and and basically camp out. I hate saying that because in the, in the, in the seal teams it's derogatory to say, oh yeah, so you never want to have anybody say that. So I wouldn't let my, when I went on patrol with my kids I was like, no, we're not camping limp point. But so you guys are camping out. No or not. So w w when you get to a lay up point where you're going to stop, you don't just flop down and turn into a pile of crap.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       And this is true. Again, with a business situation, you reach one goal. You don't just like flop down and say, oh we did it high five a office party. No you can, you can order a pizza maybe, but you're not ordering booze. You know what I'm saying? You still got stuff to do so you don't camp out. You have to remain tackle. You have to remain disciplined. You have to quietly assume your security position, you got to then be quiet and make sure you are as a loan as you think you are. Then you got to pick out some landmarks. Once you get to your little lamp point, you gotta, you gotta make that your home. You know, you got to look at for some landmarks or some somewhere where you know where you are and then you confirm your position. You know, you take a triangulation with your compass, maybe even break out your gps, get a little double confirmation. And then once

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       you've got everything set, then you can take a little breather. Hmm. But what you don't do is get to the finish line and just flop down and uh, we made it right. You never want to do that. And the other piece, this is something I've thought about a lot while I was on this patrol with my, with my two kids, I went with two out of the four kids.

Speaker 5:          00:50:46       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:50:46       When that, we kind of have a standard in most militaries do this. You're going to, when you're, when you're doing a patrol, you're going to move for 50 minutes. Mean you're going to walk for 15 minutes and you're gonna rest for 10 then your walk for 15 rest for 10 walk from 50 and that's kind of the standard. And I can tell you that if you aren't careful, it can be hard to start up again and you get tired legs and you get sore shoulders and you get hunger and you get thirsty and it's easy to let 10 minutes turned into 15 minutes and turn it into 20 minutes and turn it into a half an hour. That can happen very, very easily. And this is the thing you got to remember while you are arresting, you are getting no closer to your target. There is no progress that is being made. And by the way, the only person that is going to move you toward that target is you.

Speaker 5:          00:51:50       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:51:51       You're the only person that's gonna move you towards that target. You're not going to get carried. Their target's not going to move to you. You are the only person that's going to move to the target. And if you don't move, you'll never get there. And the faster you get there, the better off you're going to be. Now again, this doesn't mean that you're simply grinding yourself and your team into the dirt. There are rest periods involve there. You have 10 minutes of rest of you have 50 minutes of work. So I'm not talking about smashing your team, right? But you absolutely do have to drive your team because there will be no progress in the comfort zone. There will not in the inside the comfort zone, there's no progress happening. There's nothing happening. And when you're patrolling with a rucksack on, it is not comfortable, is not comfortable, it's not easy. And that is one of the things. That's why this discipline of keeping moving and continuing to push the pace is so powerful. And that's the same thing with any goal. Obviously, the correlation here is that any goal that you're going for, you have to keep moving toward it. You have to stay on the path.

Speaker 5:          00:53:08       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:53:09       Do you have to rest? Yes, but you have to go, you have to go down that path and that is another one of these principles and all of these principles day really apply to everything that I did in my seal career, regardless of what I was doing. The same things, planning, well, setting goals, knowing what they look like, staying disciplined on everything, on every type of mission, on every task, every job. That is what I always did. I didn't take it easy. Did I rest? Sure, of course I arrested, but did I cut corners? Did I take the easy way? Did I slack off?

Speaker 2:          00:53:56       No,

Speaker 4:          00:53:59       no, I did not. I held the line. Now from a leadership perspective, all this talk of marching and patrolling made me think of a short story called the beloved captain, which I was recently introduced to by the wife of one of the finest leaders I've ever worked for. A guy named General Sean McFarland, who was the colonel at the time who was commanding the one one a d, the first brigade of the First Armored Division, otherwise known as the ready first during the battle of Ramadi. And I recently saw general mcfarlane's a wife at a memorial event that we did for the 10 year anniversary of Mark Lee's death. And she told me about this story. Again, it's called the beloved captain and it lays out some fundamental leadership principles. And when the general's wife told me that he kind of referred to this story himself for guidance, I figured maybe the kind of guidance we can all use. And the story is written by a guy named Donald Hanky who served with the British army in World War One, the volunteer who enlisted at age 29 despite having served as an officer when he was younger, he enlisted

Speaker 4:          00:55:43       to go fight and eventually regained his commission. And in both as a enlisted guy, as an and as an officer, he fought on the front lines and he wrote this story, which is called, as I said, the beloved captain.

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       He came in the early days when we were still at recruit drills under hot September, son Tall, erect, smiling. So we first saw him and so he to the end, at the start he knew his little of soldiering is we did. He used to watch us being drilled by the sergeant, but his manner of watching was peculiar to his own. He never looked bored. He was learning just as much as we were. In fact more, he was learning his job and from the first he saw that his job was more than to give us the correct orders.

Speaker 4:          00:56:50       His job was to lead us, so he watched and noted many things and never found the time. Hang on, heavy, heavy on his hands. He watched our evolutions so as to learn to learn the correct orders. He watched for the right manner of command, the manner which secured the most prompt response to an order, and he watched every one of us for our individual characteristics. We were his men already. He took an almost paternal interest in us. He noted the men who tried hard, but we're naturally slow and awkward. He distinguished them from those who were inattentive and board. He marked down the keen and most efficient among us. Most of all, he studied those who were subject to moods who are sulky one day and willing the next. These were the ones who were to turn the scale. If he could get these on his side, the battle would be one. So here's this leader, very important for him to learn about as men and know his men and study his men. We've heard this before,

Speaker 4:          00:58:05       back to the book for the first few days, he just watched. Then he started work. He picked out some of the most awkward ones and accompanied by a corporal, marched them away by themselves in generously. He explained that he did not know much himself yet, but he thought that they might be on my get on better if they drilled by themselves a bit and that if it helped the, if he helped them and they helped him, they would soon learn. So there's some serious humility going on there. He's like, Hey, I don't know that much. You guys don't know that much. Let's help each other. Let's build a little team here. His confidence was infectious. He looked at them and they looked at him and the men pulled themselves together and determined to do their best, so he formed relationships here. Their best surprised themselves. His patients was inexhaustible. His simplicity could not fail to be understood. He's keeping things simple, so simple that they could not fail to be understood. His keenness and optimism carried all with them. Very soon the awkward squad found themselves awkward, no longer and after that they cease to be a squad and went back to the platoon. Then he started to drill the platoon with sergeant standing by to point out his mistakes. Of course he made mistakes and when that happened he never minded admitting it.

Speaker 4:          00:59:37       Some extreme ownership going on. He would explain what mistakes he had made and try again. The result was that we began to take almost as much interest and pride in his progress as he did in ours. We were his men and he was our leader. We felt that he was a credit to us and we resolve to be a credit to him. There was a bond of mutual confidence and affection between us, which grew stronger and stronger. As the months passed, he had a smile for almost everyone, but we thought he had a different smile for us. We looked for it and were never disappointed on parade as long as we were trying. His smile encouraged us off parade. If we passed him and saluted his eyes, look straight into our own and his smile greeted us. It was a wonderful thing. That smile of his, it was something worth living for when worth working for a bucked one up when one was bored or tired, it seemed to make one look at things from a different point of view, a finer point of view, his point of view. There was nothing feeble or weak about it. It was not monotonous like the smile of Sunny Jim. It meant something. It meant that we were his men and that he was proud of us and sure that we were going to do jolly well better than any of the other platoons. And it made us determine that we would

Speaker 5:          01:01:14       okay

Speaker 4:          01:01:15       when we failed him, when he was disappointed in us, he did not smile. He did not rage or curse. He just looked disappointed. And that made us feel far more savage with ourselves in any amount of swearing would have done point we've talked about on here many times that guy that's yelling and screaming, not getting respect, that

Speaker 6:          01:01:45       that has a lot to do. Also actually probably everything to do also with, remember who we were talking about. Um, use the carrot and the stick, you know, so that's basically, I mean, you know, on top of the bond or it could be a sense kind of the same thing where when they look for that approval, which we all do with our friends especially, they're not looking to avoid him getting mad. They're looking to make them happy. See, because of that, you know how, how that feels or how, how good that is. So he doesn't have to get mad. He just has to basically go to zero. He doesn't have to go negative 10 on him. Yeah. He goes to zero one there like, Dang,

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       I bill, I'm gonna get back to that. Yeah, that Tan. Yeah. And it's just great language. He just looked disappointed and that made us feel far more savage with ourselves in any amount of squaring would've done. Yep. And I had a boss like that one time with our whole golden life was just to, just to make, make him look good and have them say, give us a smile on their job. And we were all fired up, know back to the book. He made us feel that we were not playing the game with him. This is if they messed up. He made us feel that we were not playing the game by him. It was not what he said. He was never very good at talking. It was just how he looked and his look of displeasure and disappointment was a thing that we would do anything to avoid. The fact was that he had won his way into our affections. We loved him and there isn't anything stronger than love when all said and done.

Speaker 4:          01:03:26       He was humble too, if that is the right word and I think it is. No trouble of ours was too small for him to attend to. When we started route marches for instance, and our feet were blistered and sore as they often were. At first, you would have fought that. They were his own feet from the trouble he took. Of course, after the march there was always an inspection of feet that is routine, but with him it was no mere routine. He came into our rooms and if anyone had a sore fit foot, he would kneel down on the floor and look at it as carefully as if he had been a doctor. Then he would prescribe and the remedies were ready at hand being borne by the sergeant. If a blister had to be lanced, you would very likely lance it himself then in there so as to make sure there was done with a clean needle and that no dirt was allowed to get in. There was no effication about this, no striving after effect. There was simply that he felt that our feet were pretty important and that he knew that we were pretty careless. So he thought it best at the start to see to the master himself. Nevertheless, there was an our rise, something almost religious about this care for our feet. It seemed to have a touch of the Christ about it and we loved and honored him the more

Speaker 4:          01:05:00       literally getting down on his hands and knees and caring for the feet of his men. Okay. And you know, you can imagine the leaders that would, that would see this as being beneath them and maybe even thinking in some way that this would make them look bad. Right. But you can see, obviously he's comparing him to Jesus.

Speaker 2:          01:05:25       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          01:05:26       So I think it was a, I think it had a good effect on the men.

Speaker 2:          01:05:32       Thanks.

Speaker 4:          01:05:35       We knew that we should lose him.

Speaker 4:          01:05:39       For one thing, we knew that he would be promoted. There was our great hope that some day he would command the company also. We knew that he would be killed. He was so amazingly unselfconscious for that reason. We knew that he would be absolutely fearless. He would be so keen on the job in hand and so anxious for as men that he would forget about his own danger. So it proved he was a captain. When we went out to the front, whenever there was a tiresome job to be done, he was there in charge. If ever there were a moment of danger, he was on the spot. If there were any particular part of the line where the shells were falling faster or the bombs dropping more thickly than in other parts, he was in it. It was not that he was conceited and imagined himself indispensable.

Speaker 4:          01:06:40       It was just that he was so keen that the men should do their best and act wordly of the regiment. He knew that fellows hated turning out at night for fatigue when they were in arrest camp. He knew how tiresome the Long March there and back and digging in the dark for an unknown purpose war. He knew that the fellows would be inclined to grouse and Sherk. So he thought that it was up to him to go and show them that he thought it was a job worth doing. And the fact that he was there put a new complexion on the matter all together, no one would shirk if he was there. No one would grumble so much either. What was good enough for him was good enough for us. So you got to got to get out there and you know, I've told stories about picking up brass and doing the taking. The bad watch is all those things. And this is a exact commentary about that. Just because you're in a leadership position doesn't mean you don't get to do the hard stuff. We don't have to do the art stuff. It actually means you do the hard stuff. But let's talking to jade who days ago and you know, he's the boss of his company and stuff. Um,

Speaker 6:          01:08:01       and man, it pretty much every word that's coming from that is like, man, it's reminded me of this, where like this certain people in a group that can do that, that can go and like, you know, he'll, there'll wash your sheets, then you don't leave. You don't automatically have that respect. In some cases

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       you'll have less respect if like, sure. Like they're kissing your butt and they don't have anything to look up to, you know, or, or you know, these, these kinds of guys or whatever. But the point is, as the leader or the boss or the dad or whatever, like everyone in the group is, is watching you. People are watching. So if you're like, you can be like, Hey, you can make 10, 20, 50 great moves and then, but let's say he just kind of come in late every day or something like that. Or like you're anticipating or something. Yeah, they're watching. So they're like, okay, I see that. And they're not being critical necessarily. They're just watching, I'm sure. Yeah. I mean he can go conscious or even subconscious. It could be, yeah, they could be getting critical. But man, they're watching. So when you're like, when if they see you slack off, they're like, it's okay to slack off.

Speaker 1:          01:09:06       Yeah. All right. Okay, okay. That's what we're doing. You're not eating, you know, if you're from a leadership position, you're slacking, you're followers are going to slack. There's no doubt about it. And let there be no doubt. Or You lose your temper. Or even even if like you think no one's paying attention, and he was like, you know, your kid is cruising with your whatever you're on the phone with, I don't know, the cable guy and you know how they schedule that, you know, between these two and you're mad or whatever. I'd be there between 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM or 9:00 AM the next day or something and you lose your temper on the cable guy probably he's watching. I was like, oh, okay. That's kind of how it is. Like that's how we do it kind of thing. You know? I'm happy for watching. So yeah, this guy where he's doing the hard stuff, you know, the, the top level stuff, bottom line, he's doing it all.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       People were watching it and they see it, so they're like, man, that's the way to roll. That they didn't think were digging in and move moving at night and digging in, you know, for an unknown purpose. They, he knew that they weren't fired up with. Soon as he showed up and started doing it, they all realize, okay, it's good enough for him. You know, that's how we're rolling. It's good enough for us and they're back to the book. What was good enough for him was good enough for us. If it were not too much trouble for him to turn out, it was not too much trouble for us. He knew to how trying the nerves, how trying to the nerves it is to sit in a trench and be shelled. He knew what a temptation there is to move a bit farther down the trench and heard together and a bunch at what seems the safest end.

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       He knew to the folly of doing it and that there that it was not the thing to do, not done in the best regiments. So he went along to see that it did not happen to see that the demand stuck to their posts and conquered their nerves. And as soon as we saw him, we forgot our own anxiety. It was move a bit further down, sir, we are all right here, but don't you go exposing yourself? We didn't matter. We knew it then. We were just rank and file bound to take risks. The company would get along all without us, but

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       the captain, how was the company to get on without him to see him was to catch his point of view, to forget our personal anxieties and think only of the company and the regiment and honor. That's an interesting concept is that you're, this leader's presence actually opened his troopers minds to what he saw. Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:11:43       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:11:44       That's awesome. There was not one of us but would gladly have died for him. We longed for the chance to show him that we weren't heroes. We never dreamed about getting the Victoria Cross. But to save the captain, we would have earned it 10 times over and never have cared a button whether we got it or not.

Speaker 4:          01:12:13       We never got the chance. Worst luck. It was all the other way. We were holding some trenches, which are about as unhealthiest trenches could be the bushes, which is a slang term for the Germans. The Bush's were only a few yards away and we're well supplied with trench mortars. We hadn't got any at the time. Bombs and air torpedoes were dropping around us all day. Of course the captain was there. It seemed as if he could not keep away. A torpedo fell into the trench and buried some of our trap chops. The fellows next to them ran to dig them out. Of course he was the first one, then came another torpedo in the same place. That was the end, but he lives somehow he lives and we who knew him do not forget. We feel his eyes on us. We still work for that wonderful smile of his. There are not many of the old lot left now, but I think those who went west have seen him when they got to the other side. I think they were met. Someone said, well done, good and faithful servant. And as they knelt before that gracious pierced figure, I reckon they saw nearby the captain's smile.

Speaker 4:          01:13:56       Anyway, in that faith, let me die if death should come my way. And so I think shall I died content

Speaker 2:          01:14:13       and die. He did.

Speaker 4:          01:14:22       Donald Hanky who wrote that story was badly wounded in the battle of Ypres on July 30th, 1915 and after recovering from those wounds, he went back to the front, including action at the battle of the Somme and later preparing to go over the top at one 30 in the afternoon on October 12th, 1916 lieutenant a Hanky was reported to have told his men if wounded blighty, if killed resurrection in Blighty was a term that basically meant million dollar wound, which we've talked about before on this podcast. The million dollar wound is, hey, you get shot, it gets you off the front, but it doesn't kill you and it doesn't maim you for life. It's $1 million wouldn't. And that day the Brits called that a blight. And so at one 30 in the afternoon on October 12th as his guys are getting ready to go over the top, he tells his men if wounded blighty if killed resurrection. So you boys have nothing to fear. Shortly thereafter he was killed. He is said to have been buried near the spot where he fell, although the grave was never found. But we do have his words. So let us heed those words as we tried to lead others as well as he did as well as we can,

Speaker 4:          01:16:16       as well as the beloved captain.

Speaker 2:          01:16:27       And with that,

Speaker 4:          01:16:32       it's been some time since we've done some questions for the Internet so we can move to those questions. So sounds was good after, after hearing a story like that, it's, it's always tough for me to remember that when you hear a one story like that, you've got to remember that there are thousands and thousands and thousands of stories like that war and of leadership, end of sacrifice. And if we don't do our damnedest to learn from those lessons,

Speaker 2:          01:17:27       yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:17:28       And apply them, I questioned whether we even deserve to have this life.

Speaker 7:          01:17:40       Yeah. That though about this, this story, beloved captain.

Speaker 2:          01:17:44       Yes.

Speaker 7:          01:17:47       Like that's such a clear demonstration on how to be, where these guys would, would follow this guy basically into fire. They could probably watch them walk into a pit of fire and they'd all fall.

Speaker 4:          01:17:57       They did. Yeah. Think about it. They did. That's what World War One was. Yeah. Stand up. Go follow me. We're going.

Speaker 7:          01:18:05       Yeah. So if this guy's mere presence can make these other guys follow him like that in these types of situations, like if more people would be like this guy, you know, in normal life, I mean it'd be a breeze to have people you know, listened to you and you guys get some stuff done.

Speaker 4:          01:18:26       And, and how much of the stuff that the beloved captain does is counterintuitive of what people think of a military guy. I mean, almost everything in there, he's admitting his mistakes. He's figuring out who's awkward at admitting to them that he's kind of messed up too. He's getting down on his knees and, and basically being almost submissive to his men in order to make sure that they're healthy. He's taking all the hard jobs. He's smiling and developing these strong relationships with his men. Like every one of those things is almost counter to what people think. Uh, um, a big tough military is the jewel Sargent drill Sargent leader like no. And, and so I see people in the civilian sector that ended up in the same way they think, they think that that's how you lead because they've seen it in a movie, you know, that is not that, that that hyper aggressive mentality is, is ineffective with human beings. And actually there's a question here, so we'll probably talk about that some more. Um, but, but that's why I always make it perfectly clear that I'm all about being aggressive. Yeah. I'm all about being aggressive but being aggressive towards your mission, not towards people. I mean, unless the person warrants aggressiveness, which does happen from time to time, that's called a fist fight.

Speaker 7:          01:19:55       You ended up part, he noted where his mere presence kind of, um, not imposed, but impacts impacts their perspective where it's like, it's basically him walking in to, to whatever

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       the situation and them just kind of automatically a what what's he seeing right there? So just coming to them, hey, let me, let me move this weapon cause it's in a bad spot. Let me, let me pull it up like that stuff up here. That is completely right. Completely right. I was on a ship one time and I thought it was about the, the commanding officer on a ship. There's something called the one Mc, which is a basically a loudspeaker that goes throughout every portion of the ship. Everyone can hear it. And this commanding officer gets on the Sh gets on the one MC and he's going to make a speech, right? Because that's what commanding officers do sometimes. And he says, I thought he was going to make the most epic speech because he's not the most epic, but I thought he's going to say something pretty powerful.

Speaker 1:          01:20:48       Sure. He says, um, he says, Hey, when you, when, when, when you see a piece of trash on the ship and when I see a piece of trash, I thought he was gonna say, when I see a piece of trash, man, I go and pick it up. And he said, he said something along the lines of, when I see a preset trash, I'm frustrated that nobody picked it up. And think about the, the impact of those two statements. If he said, well, I thought he was going to say, which is, hey, when I see a piece of trash on the floor, I go over and I pick it up and, and put it away or throw it away. And then I make sure there's no the trash near cause I want this ship to shine. That's one thing. He, he said, hey, when I see a piece of trash on the ship, I get so frustrated that you weren't cleaning it up.

Speaker 1:          01:21:33       And I was so let down at that ship that, that commanding officers said that at that shit. Uh, but to your point, if you know, it's like, the reason I thought of that is because you can see when even when I've been in, you know, the commander of a unit of some kind and I would see when I walk in unexpected, there's like a change, you know? And it's not always, you know, sometimes I've seen it where guys, the commander walks in and it's, people are doing that cause of fear. Right? Right. Yeah. That's not different. That's not what we're looking for. Or You want to say, oh, the boss is here. I don't want him to see that this is going on. I don't know. This is, we shouldn't be doing that. We should. And that's, you're right. That is a real powerful, real powerful fought that he puts in here about how when when the boss comes around, when the commander comes around and you, and it actually provides the troopers the ability to see what he's seeing and how powerful that is.

Speaker 1:          01:22:28       Wellington, Jane, I forget what it, he had to do the thing where it's like, it was like a 10th thing and he was just telling, I was telling him, oh, he's talking to Sarah about it and he's like, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave like right after that cause I don't want to have to face like some awkwardness or something like that. And then, um, kind of once there I left, I was like, Hey, I'm going to tell Jocko that you're going to do that. And he was like, all like, he knew I was joking, but he was like, ah, you know, Kinda like, what would you think about that? You're not even as loss by the way, obviously, but it's kind of like that thing, you know, like, Hey, whoa. Would like, um, you ever watch, remember commando? Yeah. It's not, yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 7:          01:23:07       There's this part right where the story behind commando is one of his, his guys that he trained and stuff, um, went rogue, went back, came back and they thought he was dead and he comes back and he helps you know, the, you know, great, great story. It's dope. Anyway. Um, so this, this bad guy now he, you could stay, you could tell he still has all this admiration for, for his name's John Matrix. For Arnold. Yeah, for our logo. Cause he's like, he's walking around the compound that he's kind of like, you know, and all these guys are like talk, talking to and stuff. So he goes to the other boss that he's now working with. Um, he's all, it's, it's funny to hear your men talk tough. It makes me laugh. If Matrix was here, he'd laugh too, you know, kind of like he's, it's almost like human matrix are on the same team still. You know, he knows how he would see that. You know, it's kind of that same thing. Presence. Awesome. Uh, so wrapping that rough transition, people want to support the podcast. How are they going to do it? Echo Charles?

Speaker 7:          01:25:42       No. Passively as opposed task deciliter. No, no, no. It's aggressive. Yes. But it's not. So yeah. All right. Passive means you didn't do anything. It's, we have, we have troopers out there that are aggressively shopping on Amazon to support the podcast. And I dig that. I read that sometimes my friends on Twitter, they'll send me like a screen shot, boom of their trooper tool or their, or their little purchase. Like, Hey, I bought this stuff tape, here's my thing. And it's a screenshot. Yeah. It really makes me feel empowered and I'm not joking. Right. It does help the podcast fully appreciate it. Fully subscribe to the podcast of course iTunes. And then on youtube as well. I'm slowly putting more videos. I'll put a few and keep putting more. Oh, so you're not just stuck watching the podcast, which is cool too, by the way, if you're into watching it and listening is sometimes like people will put it on their screen as they work out, you know, so they can kind of watch lists and workout watch lists, you know, it's a good little little formula anyway. Yeah, youtube is a good one as well. And of course the Jocko store if you like, you know, shirts and whatnot, coffee mugs, stickers. Um, they're pretty cool. I've got some great feedback. One announcement.

Speaker 7:          01:27:13       We have women's stuff coming out in about what week or two female troopers. Yup. Who have been pressuring strongly recommending will say consistently strongly are up recommending. Yup. Yeah, they're good ones. Uh, I chose three colors. You're going to have to wait and see which ones they are and when they do come out, give me more feedback. I want to narrow it down to the, the stuff that we all want. So yeah, go ahead. Do that. Jocko. store.com there's some cool stuff. If you like it, boom. Get one or two or however many. And that supports as well. And plus that means I don't have to buy my wife anything. Yeah, I'll just give it. Yeah, I'll say one teachers. That's actually one of the good reasons I like managing this stuff. I don't have to, not that I really bought shirts that much anyway, but I have a bunch of shirts.

Speaker 7:          01:28:08       No plus maybe my daughters too. Yeah. Perfect. We're good. Yep. Good to go. Everybody's good to go. Are they regular? Are these the same design or is it something new? It's there. Yeah. They're more or less the same, but they're, they're basically the wounds version of what we got it. I started with a discipline equals freedom. I might just do one for women because let's face it, we all get get after it in pretty much the same way except for every once in a while. Women get after it in a different way every once in a while so it might be worth it to give them a little something different and special. Just my opinion, I don't. Awesome. All right, there you go. That's always the support. Support that podcast and with that question number one, I a marine corps vet only four years and I recently hired another marine. He had a great reputation and a lot of experience as NCO leader, gunny sergeant, but he's not doing well in our company. He only seems to lead through fear. Slash. Authority. It isn't working cause high standards, which I like, but he's not gaining the respect of his team or the rest of the company. What's going on and how can I fix it?

Speaker 1:          01:29:31       This is kind of a classic case and unfortunately it's an unfortunate case too. And what we have here is an example of a guy that's probably pretty charismatic. He's probably pretty aggressive. He's probably pretty loud. He's probably pretty authoritative. He's probably pretty smart. He's probably physically impressive. In other words, he's probably got a lot of natural good leadership traits and I surmise in a situation like this, that is the type of person that took the basics of what the military taught him and utilized it to lead. And so what he did was he used imposed discipline. That's what guy used on him and that's what he used. So it's the things that we just talked about, it's intimidation. It's the whole thing with maneuver warfare versus attrition warfare that the military still teaches, unfortunately, that the job of leaders is to obey orders and ensure orders are obeyed.

Speaker 1:          01:30:38       Okay. That's, that's what the military, unfortunately in some cases, teachers and you can go through your career and that's what you can kind of learn. Or you can have some good leadership inside the military that teaches you the better way, the way to actually lead. And so, but if you're, if you're raised that the way that your job as a leader is to obey orders and to ensure that orders are obeyed. If that's your job, how do you do that? Will you do it through blunt force trauma? That's how you do it. And as I've said before, that does work for a time period. It does get the job done. It's micromanagement and fortunately or unfortunately in the military, you've got people that rapidly cycle through leadership positions. And so it's not like you are permanently in charge of the same group of people. So you can kind of get away with it because you do a workup and it don't work of a stressful, and then you go on deployment to 20 it's only six months long and by the time you're done, everybody hates you, but it's okay, you're moving onto your next job.

Speaker 1:          01:31:44       And so that's how people survive. And what really hurts about this is because they survive that leadership position, it actually reinforces that type of leadership behavior, which is not good. But what they do is if, if let's say you do it, it just an American kind of mindset of, hey, if some is good, more is better. And so they take this, this attitude and they become more, more aggressive. They impose more discipline, they raise the standards to ridiculous level where it's no longer even sensible.

Speaker 5:          01:32:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:32:24       Where things just become stupid like we used to say. So I don't know why they called us, but in the military they called a pushup position, the front leaning rest. Sure. Front leaning rest. I don't know why, but I, and then they also use the term forward leaning, meaning, Hey, we want to be ahead. We want to be ready, ready, prepared. And I used to say, let's not be so far forward leaning that were in the leaning rest. Meaning that we're leaning so far forward that we're wasting our energy and getting tired and sore. At a certain point it can become stupid thing. An example of this would be like, um, a uniform inspections. Like, okay, you got to have a square to a uniform. You know, you got to be able to break out uniform, look sharp. Well if you do that every day, you're wasting time because it's not the most important thing.

Speaker 1:          01:33:10       It, it does have a level of importance somewhere on the hierarchy of important things, not real high, but there's some people, if you're a strict military disciplinarian, you might think, I need to have uniform instruction every single day cause my guys are going to look the best. And so you've got a bunch of guys that not only are they wasting time prepping their uniform and paying for them a uniform get dry cleaned and they're actually using their uniform is so much their dress uniforms so much that they're providing wear and tear on it. And so it's just, it's just stupid. It doesn't make any sense. So that's, that's what they do. They, these leaders that have been raised like that, they start to do it even more. And it just, it defeats its own purpose in most important is that these leaders start to stifle free fought from their subordinates.

Speaker 5:          01:34:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:34:00       And eventually, and this is even more critical, eventually they begin to stifle free thought from their own brain.

Speaker 1:          01:34:10       And that's likely what happened in a situation like this. And you know, you've got a guy that again was raised in this attitude and he took that attitude and he amplified that attitude and that is how he was successful. And he amplified it even more. And he ends up, now he breaks out of the Marine Corps. Well now it's not just a six month appointment. You got to lead people for years and years and years. And you've got to go from different various projects and all these personalities. And, and it's a more sensitive environment because it's in the civilian sector in lives aren't necessarily, it's steak. And so what do you need to do?

Speaker 5:          01:34:45       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:34:46       what, what you need him to see. So now I'm talking to the leader that asked this question, what, what can you do to help? Well, what you need that former marine gunnery sergeant to do. What

Speaker 4:          01:34:57       you need him to see is that the next level of leadership, the next progression along the spectrum of leadership is not more of all that.

Speaker 4:          01:35:14       It's actually less. It's not more imposed discipline on your troops. It's actually less. It's the troops having free thought and self discipline and it is not you leading more. It is actually you leading less. Eat is not you taking more ownership is you taking less ownership and your troops taking more ownership. It is him giving guidance, giving commander's intent and then stepping back, it is him not being the focus because a lot of times when you're in a leadership position that can be any ego feeder and all of a sudden you want to be the center of attention. You want to be in the spotlight, but you don't want to be that. You want to be less of that and it, and I'm telling you so that's what you gotta do. You gotta open his eyes to what the next level of leadership looks like.

Speaker 4:          01:36:15       He's never had that open for him. And I'm going to tell you right now, it's going to be hard to get them there because there's a good chance that he's a hard person to coach because he's been successful with the techniques that he learned and he has experience and he's, and that, that experience has strengthened his resolve and his belief in his leadership technique. It's, it's, it's a tough situation. So you're likely going to have to take an indirect approach. And so for instance, here's a good one. Hey, I was wondering, you know who, who's going to take your place when it's, you know, when it's time for promotion, who you grooming to fill your shoes? Hmm. Cause guess what? He's not grooming anybody. Hmm. Or you ask him how much time he's spending looking up and out at what's going on in the strategic as opposed to down and Ian that his own little element.

Speaker 5:          01:37:13       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:37:14       And the other thing that you could do is assign him some higher level projects that actually pull him out of the micromanagement weeds and maybe even put him on projects with people that don't micromanage. Hmm. And and good leaders that lead in a good way, put him on some kind of project with them so he can see what that looks like.

Speaker 5:          01:37:39       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:37:40       And obviously these are just some suggestions of approaches because you're probably going to have to, you'll, you'll have to adapt those and figure out exactly how to walk him

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       to the end state, which the end state, the commander's intent from me is you want to teach him what the next, what the next level, the next advancement of leadership skill for him is and it's something that's the opposite of what he learned. So

Speaker 2:          01:38:16       good challenge. Yeah. Yeah. That, that,

Speaker 1:          01:38:22       that leading from authority thing and fear and authority. It's almost like it's so black and white where when someone does that, it's so clear. It's very clear and it's very addictive person because there's immediate gratification. I told you to do it and so they do it and then OKC worked, kind of takes less work to a lot of the time keep us work. You don't have to invest in relationships, you don't have to invest in, in indirect approaches on things. Of course it takes less work. It's, it's real simple. You know, you can kind of give into your temper sometimes too. Yeah. You're temper is a little bit of a tool with that kind of, the problem is over time these, that type of leadership doesn't work. You want to be with the beloved captain who never lost his temper, who never yelled at his men and yet who would follow him into the fires of hell.

Speaker 2:          01:39:14       Yup. Next question.

Speaker 1:          01:39:22       If you had a leader at work he did not respect and know is ineffective and you've communicated that Tim, yet when they see you, they tried to shake your hand, how would you react and how would you deny their handshake offering? Appreciate the feedback. So, um, okay. This is just off the, off the mark. I hope people realize that this is, no, it's okay. I mean, I understand the reason I put this in there just because this is what we talked about earlier where you think, man, I'm holding the line and I'm, I'm holding the line and this is my expectations of a leader and you don't fit it. The song went to number one, I'm gonna tell you number two, if you're trying to shake my hand, you're not getting it. Right, right. So that's what we call an adversarial relationship and it is not what we want.

Speaker 1:          01:40:12       How, let me ask you this. How is this going to help your cause to have an error adversarial relationship with your boss? How does it help your cost? Is he going to listen to you more or less? Is he going to support you more or less? Will he give you what you want more or less? Which one you won't shake his hand and you think he's going to support you in any way? No. And furthermore, is he, if you have an adversarial relationship with your boss, is he more likely to promote you into position where you can have more control over decisions for the team and for your own future? What do you think the answer to that is? Negative. All those answers are obvious. This whole concept is wrong. Our job is to build a relationship with our boss and honestly with everyone else for that matter. That's what we're trying to do straight up disrespecting the boss or again, anyone is not going to help our cause. It's going to hurt it.

Speaker 8:          01:41:19       Now,

Speaker 1:          01:41:22       this doesn't mean that we're kissing ass. This doesn't mean that we're full being, it doesn't mean that we're weak. This is the, this is the, this is the challenge for me to convince people that want to be strong leaders, that this doesn't mean that you are weak and actually takes more strength to control your emotions. It takes more strength to remain professional. It takes more strength to focus on the long term win and not the short term frustration. It takes more strength to keep your ego in check and I would say that this whole question is a good is a, is an indicator to me. I might need to check my own ego. Okay. Am I critical of my boss? Am I critical because of my boss? Because I'm a little bit jealous. Is that possible? Am I critical of my boss because I think I deserve the job more than they do.

Speaker 1:          01:42:27       Do I think that my boss got lucky or he, he's a brown noser or he's favored some way. That's why he got it and I'm going to be bitter about it and therefore I'm not going to respect him. All those right there, ego talking, right full on ego talking. So you got to put the ego in check. You got to support the boss and you got to support the team, then that's the best way to support the Boston support the team. And the obvious caveat to this is if the boss is doing something that's illegal or immoral or unethical, then fine. Yeah, of course. Absolutely. You can call them out, you can deny his handshake, you can report them up the chain of command or to the authorities. Because if you're part of what he's doing and you know it, then you're complicit in the activities. So you're at risk anyways and it's the right thing to do. So obviously in those cases, yeah, you, you can hold your ground. But barring those extreme circumstances, what you wanna do with your bosses, build the relationship. And again, it's not just your boss, it's your peers. It's your chain of command up and down. You want to build those relationships instead of breaking them.

Speaker 8:          01:43:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:45       Yeah. It seems, it's so funny, not funny, but it's interesting how when you lay it out, and I'm sure a lot, maybe even when he's listening to this, just hearing this question out loud, it seems obvious, you know, but really you're trying to think about yourself in this situation where yeah, you don't like this guy and maybe said some stuff to offend you even and you don't respect them obviously. So yeah. Like you don't want to shake this guy's hand, like how you feel is a lot of times what dictates your behavior, you know, towards people and just otherwise. Um, so when you're in the situation, this is kind of like, it's so hard to be like, yeah, I don't respect his whole methods. I don't like any of this stuff. He's going to come shake my hand. It's so hard to be like, sure.

Speaker 1:          01:44:29       And, and do what you're talking about. It can be put your ego in check, put your emotions in check, put your attitude in check and just go, hey boss, how's it going today? Yup, everything's going good here. Yeah, so I appreciate the support you've been given us. There's one decision you made. I was kinda wondering about. I'd love to give love to pick your brain on and some point. Oh really? Whereas if I just go, I don't want to shake your hand. I hate you. I basically disrespect you and I hate you and what you do, decision you made over here was wrong. Is he going to listen to me? There's no chance. There's no chance you're going to wait. You're gonna lose the argument. Me, when I go in there and I say, hey boss, how's it going? Yes. Yeah, no problem. Hey, I, one thing I wanted to pick your brain about, this decision you made over here, is he going to listen to me?

Speaker 1:          01:45:13       You've got a better chance. Still might say no, but guess what? I'm fighting along war. I'm gonna outlast him out. Work them. I'm going to out maneuver him. My boss is going to do what I'm wanting to do. I know him. Yeah. You got to keep that in mind, man, because when you're in it, when you lose that little better cause really that's what it is. When you're shaking your hand and you're like in your head, you're like, I hate you. I don't want to shake your hand. Freaking get your hand out of my feet. Your whole existence of your hand, front of my face is an insult. That's what you're thinking. So if you shake it, you lost that battle and that's bad right there for you. That's what it feels bad. It's, it's, it's very, very immature when it, it just feels right at the, at the time.

Speaker 1:          01:45:52       But if you let your emotions get all crazy, if you're not being strategic, that's everything. Not Thinking about winning. Yeah, and by no means they might say playing the game correctly, but the point is, I understand that you feel as good as when you say it out loud, it's like, oh my gosh, it's so clear. Almost he doesn't. He know what you, you, you just indicated to me something very obvious is that over time, you know over time you get to the, okay, you go for a hard workout and you get to, you look forward to the feeling afterwards of debt. Yeah, I did this hard workout. There's endorphins or whatever. I'm going to tell you at some point I developed some sort of attitude where when I do, when I control myself and I make a good strategic move, if he's just as good, it feels way better than the short term. Aw Man. I really told him no, no. Wrong answer. You lost, you won the battle. Lost the war idiot. That's what I feel like if I make that mistake. That's absolutely correct. Don't leave you conditioned

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       yourself to the whole process. You know, cause he probably went through it a few times, tasted the fruits of winning the law and so it's just with experience that exactly right. Exactly right. So, and there's ways you can kind of do that to yourself. Like I do if like even if you haven't, like ultimately when, when you boil kind of your whole way of thinking down when you do have an ego that you think is like a functional ego, but use that ego to win the long words. So let's kind of like what I did with getting mad. It's like no one can like my, like no one's going to tell me I have low self esteem because really, you know, angry, angry shoes is usually because of low self esteem. So in this case you could be like, hey, if you ever facilitate that adversarial relationship where you don't shake his hand or you're like, you want to, as he said, you've communicated that to him.

Speaker 6:          01:47:38       You have a leader that you don't respect and you know as an effective and you told them, okay, so keep that. When you say stuff like that, consider that as like your weakness. Like just tell yourself that whether it is or they say that's your weakness, but forgetting the long war and for and for showing your cards that showing your credit. Yes. Yeah. Just, it's this little internal thing you'd tell yourself. And then just like how you were saying where you feel dumb, you give your ego can't handle that, can handle all that. Then I'll go back to my point that I said, this doesn't mean you're weak. It means that you are winning. Yeah. But flip it around as far as what you'd tell yourself. Like he, you know, it feels we to lose a small battle. I understand, but flip it around and say, hey, you know, if you win it at the expense of the long, that means you're weak. Say that to yourself and it'll get easier. You know, you're rushing yourself. If you lose the long term battle, you're even more week. Yes. That's the big weakness. Weakness.

Speaker 7:          01:48:35       All right, next question for the podcast.

Speaker 6:          01:48:42       What would ajiaco school for boys and girls, eight to 16 years old, this should be interesting. What would that look like? Schedule Subjects, physical education. Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:48:53       So first of all, I would love to do this and it's, you're seeing one day I w I may do this lord of the flies. Yes. Um, uh, I, I actually really do relate to kids for some reason. And I think a school, I think as I think I could develop a school that would be awesome and outstanding and would produce really stable, strong, mentally capable children for the world. So, and so, I was so happy when I saw this question and I've actually looked and I've actually, I've actually pondered the ideas of, you know, buying a house, buying a piece of property, you know, what it would cost maybe getting some investors together that we're going to build a scar. I mean, I've literally, I've actually looked for property, which is something I do all the time, but I've looked for property and said, okay, this probably work.

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       So, uh, like, uh, like almost like an extension school, like in the little [inaudible] academy, like a school that you go to, right. And you and we, we, what we could probably do is do like a, instead of a, hey, you're gonna go here from sixth grade to graduation, you go for like one year, you go one year here you go back to your regular school, after you've been in the school for a year, three to go back to your regular school, you're going to totally dominate. You're going to be number one. You're going to learn so much more. It's just going to be awesome. So we will need to bring, we wouldn't need to bring these young, these, these children into the school for, for the entire time because you know, you could go out, back out into the regular world and overlay what you learned at the academy and you would just dominate.

Speaker 1:          01:50:40       And so, um, yeah, maybe I'll end up doing that someday and the schedule, I mean I think I didn't spend that much time on it. It doesn't really even take that much time to figure out, cause you know what we're doing. We're waking up very early in the morning. We're doing a hardcore PT, some kind of sports variety of sports. Guess what, we're playing every sport, you know, baseball, basketball, swimming, football, soccer, wrestling, judo, boxing at we're new, a little bit of everything that's going to happen really. I mean obviously we're getting up at four 30. We are up before the sun gets up. I mean that's the way it is. And then we get the knowledge. So we'd go into the classrooms, the classrooms, W I w I would get instructors that will full on engaged in what they're doing just in the game that love their subject and that can relate it to the world.

Speaker 1:          01:51:33       And most important, cause I think this is what's lacking sometime most important through all the different knowledge courses. So all the basic knowledge there would be a common thread that connects them all together because that's what I think people are missing that a lot. I think we miss that, that underlying theme of, uh, through our educational system. But I think when you connect everything, they're more powerful. Like when you connect math to science, to history, to English, to foreign language, and you connect those to art and music and you can, there's some there cause they're all those things. If you look at history, all of those things are connected. They're all connected, but we don't make the connections and when you don't connect things, they're weaker. So I would, I would force or I wouldn't mean you wouldn't have to force it. You don't have to force it.

Speaker 1:          01:52:26       I would, I would foster that thread through everything so that everything made sense, you know, in a big picture. And that way when you get granular, you're tying it into this overlying theme of civilization and the movement of the way things go through civilization. Now I'll tell you another piece of this. You would learn vocational skills at my school 100% you would learn carpentry, you would learn how to do electrical wiring, you would learn plumbing, you would learn automotive and motor repair. You would learn all those things and guess what are you going to take those courses? Like I said this, this court, this school would probably only be a year long. That's fine because guess what? You know how long it takes to learn basic carpentry. Not Real Long. Are you gonna be a skilled carpenter? No, but I'm not looking to build skilled carpenters. Are you going to be ready to rewire a giant building? A commercial building? No. But could you rewire a house? Likely it doesn't take that much time to learn that. You won't be skilled at it, but you will have the knowledge. Same thing with plumbing and like I said, the automotive, so I, so you would learn those vocational skills because we have people in America right now that don't know any of that stuff. And that's jacked up.

Speaker 6:          01:53:49       Yeah. Even like when I was young, my dad used to make us change our own oil there. Now you can, you can go anywhere. It takes thinking whatever's 50 minutes, but he's like, Nah, you change your own oil. You got to know what to do with the oil. You know, there's this little process. You can't just be rolling around and change flat tire. Even though I have AAA, I don't, I don't culture blade for flat tire because Seitan hadn't got a flat tire in long time. I got a flat tire one day and actually recently I've been getting kind of fun nonetheless. But I change them every time because when I first got it, after not having a flat tire for awhile, I thought, Oh man, do I even remember how to do this? Of course I did. I remember how to do it. It's not that hard, just like you said. So there are people who don't know, they get a flat tire and they're, they're, they're lost, they're lost. And they, yeah, they don't have, they have AAA or whatever. Sure. They get saved. What if they can do with them themselves? You know?

Speaker 1:          01:54:41       So at my school you would learn those vocational skills and then on top of that you'd learn basic survival skills, little hunting or fishing, little gardening and planting and how to grow things, grow food and your basics, water, fire and shelter. You'd learn those. So you'd be able to survive in any environment, any situation, obviously with all those survival skills. And the vocational skills and even the classroom knowledge skills there

Speaker 2:          01:55:14       B, a, a

Speaker 1:          01:55:18       system of team building where you're going to be doing things together as a team, not only for your classes but also cleaning the place, working together. And even that's what they do. And in military boot camps, all you do is clean. They turned cleaning into like a team building exercise. So we would do that.

Speaker 2:          01:55:38       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:55:39       people would be in simple uniforms, you know, nothing too fancy. Obviously the nighttime would be the study of the martial arts and you would learn the basics of Jujitsu, boxing, Muay Thai and wrestling. And that's what my school would be like. And there'd be some real discipline there and there would be real achievement. And I think that anybody that spent one year in that school right there would have

Speaker 6:          01:56:11       a infinitely greater chance of success and domination

Speaker 1:          01:56:18       in whatever they feel they chose to go into. And when they went back to their school, to their regular school,

Speaker 6:          01:56:24       you, it's funny at first, at first thought when you're calm, kind of picturing this stuff or whatever. And I'm sure I'm not the only one listening to this where you'd be like, oh shoot, that product, that's a hardcore school, you know, they gotta be ready to get and now you need, now you want to go. Well, when you think about it, it probably wouldn't be that hardcore. In fact, it probably be kind of fun given your approach to, you know, teaching or in leading and stuff like that because man, I remember when I f it was like when I first met you, I met you and you don't remember when I first met you, but um, so I kind of knew you were whatever it, a little bit, this is back at the boxing club and you came in as a first time I saw your kids toward like Thor and I think one of his sisters, I forget, I don't know which one, I forget.

Speaker 6:          01:57:05       Oh, they were just little kids and you had brought them or whatever. And they come in the door and they just start running around. Like this is a big playground. Right, right, right. Yeah. Hitting the bags and doing all this stuff. Right. And then you had this look on your face, Kinda like you see, it's almost like you had control of the situation, but you're just going to let them be them kind of thing. And I remember just kind of kind of looking at it like, oh this is interesting. I'd never seen Jocko and his kids, you know, so let me, so I was kind of just watching. So decentralized command in a manner of speaking. Yeah. So just to start to kind of going on and I think you're, you might even been teaching, I don't know, you were involved in some way and um, they got loud real quick and it kind of was like, for lack of a better term, kind of distracting and you like kind of stop what you're doing.

Speaker 6:          01:57:53       You were like, you could stop that. Like real, real mean. And then I was like, let me see like how they react, you know, I look and then they stop. They look at you like just, just for maybe almost two seconds. They look, he look at each other like that and they just start laughing and they keep going. You kind of started laughing at the same time. I was like, oh, I see. Like you're probably strict, but it's not that they're kids, they're doing kid stuff. We want, they're not breaking nothing. Yeah. So it was like, it's almost like they knew and then they knew beyond that, you know, like they knew what was ultimately up. That was interesting. Well, who knows, maybe we can put this school together at some point. I know there's a lot of people that would love to send their kids to a school like this on every, and I would obviously I send all my kids to school

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       like this tomorrow if it existed. Yeah. One Year of the academy. That's what it's called, the academy. I think it would have to be. Yep. A big part of it. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:58:54       And I'm sure this would pro, and I'm sure there's would be, would be implemented in the whole system is how the teachers and instructors are treated. For sure. You know like, because I think that's a lot of the time anyway. Like one of the many issues, you know when they, when issues come up in education, it's like how are the teachers regarded? Yeah. That situation. Yeah man. Yeah. Good. Sign me up. Okay. Okay. Next question. I'm about to accept a position across the country after changing the IT field I work in, I've just been accepted from my first job and in this type of position with the amount of responsibility I'll have and I'm not, or I'm having some issues and some heavy hesitations on if I'll be good enough. Have you ever been in a position before where you tried to bite off more than you can chew professionally? How do you approach it and is there ever a time where you think it's best to bow out and quit? And if so, how do you know when that point is?

Speaker 4:          01:59:55       So, uh, actually most people get hired into leadership positions they haven't been in before. The seal teams is all about that. You get promoted, you do that leadership job in just as you're getting the hang of it, you get promoted again. So there's nothing abnormal about feeling that you aren't quite ready for a leadership position. And the reason that some people fail when they get to these positions that they're not ready for is because they're nervous that they're going to show that. And so they tried to hide it. They're afraid to ask questions, they're afraid to say they don't know. So they end up looking scared and stupid. Hmm. Which equates to looking in competent. And I mean even just with the beloved captain, Neat, they actually kicked off. There's a reason this guy included those statements in there that he asked questions and asked for guidance and admitted his mistakes. There's a reason that he was beloved. That is one of the reasons.

Speaker 2:          02:01:02       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:01:02       And so, so, so that's what you gotta do is be okay with it. Don't try and hide it now to bow out and quit. I have not done that, but there's no reason to because if I don't know how to do something, I have no problem asking for help. Up and down the chain of command, up and down the chain of command. Nothing wrong with that. And I've said this before, that what, what you're feeling.

Speaker 2:          02:01:34       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:01:34       Um, person that asked this question, what you're feeling that you weren't good enough and that you don't want

Speaker 1:          02:01:39       to blow it. Those are actually signs of humility and it's okay. Those are good. I've felt those feelings my whole career and I still feel I'm now and when I was in the seal teams I would over prepare for things and it wasn't because I thought I was going to dominate it was cause I thought I was going to fall short it even I was telling you

Speaker 1:          02:02:02       I prepared for the podcast all yesterday. I thought I was good. Literally had printed out my notes, woke up this morning, worked out and I was like, no, I'm not ready. I over prepare for this. Why? Because in my mind I'm feeling that I'm going to blow it and I don't like that. The thing, it's like a for real thing, it's called imposter syndrome. You've heard of that? No, it's this and I think, you know what? I think, I think everyone has it in whether it's a teeny tiny bit or a lot. It's where it's basically you feel this, you feel like I'm really like on the inside, like I'm really not this good. You can be like champion of the world and on the inside you're like this just a matter of time before they find me out. You know, I, I don't know. I don't deserve to be here.

Speaker 1:          02:02:46       Whatever that I wish more people would have that because there's a lot of people that I know that have been in leadership positions that feel that they have the divine right to be there. A lot of times they'll have it, they'll behave in that. Oh they absolutely you're saying you do. That's why they fail. That's crazy. So rehash as always, bottom line, be humble. Study and learn what you can ask questions and if you don't know something, admit it. Now I had to make this note, and I'm cautious to even say this, but I do have to say it. Asking questions doesn't just mean putting your ignorance on clear display all the time. Okay. When you ask questions, make sure you are asking thoughtful, meaningful questions. In fact, if you can find out the answer on your own, do that. If it's something that you can refer back to and you can look up and you can go back and you can check out the org chart, you can see where that department is or you can find out who's running that project without having to ask that question. Do that. Because contrary to popular belief, there actually is in fact such a thing as a stupid question and you can get away with it sometimes. So you don't need to be hyper paranoid about it, but you also, part of leadership is confidence and uh, up and down. So you got to have some confidence and you people have to have some confidence in you. And if, if you don't know anything

Speaker 1:          02:04:27       and you can't figure it out for, you can't figure out some portions of that on your own. That's not a good sign because I just expect you're gonna be in charge of me. Well that you can look that up. You didn't, you didn't review this before you came in here. I know you don't know my job, but you should at least know what the requirements of my job are. You, she didn't at least know what the outcomes at a strategic level of my job are. Right? You see what I'm saying? There's a difference. So you don't have to go in there and be, um, overly humble. You don't have to go in there and be overtly blank, uh, uh, wide open with what you, with what you don't know. Because again, I was cautious to make this note because this doesn't, I w I, you should feel comfortable enough saying, hey, I don't know how to do this.

Speaker 1:          02:05:17       Or Hey, can you explain that the way that works to me? Can you explain what this project, you know, what this project entails. There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that. But if you go into a room and you accidentally ask a question of something that everybody legitimately should know, you're going to look stupid. Right? That's a mistake. That's a mistake. And so don't do that. It's okay. Be Humble, ask questions. But ask thoughtful questions, meaningful questions that you don't know because it's brewed, it would be pretty difficult for you to know the answer yet. It's the, I mean it kind of seems obvious when you say it out loud where you're not going to know everything. No, so that makes sense. But you've got to know something's gotta be there for a reason. You can't be like, hey, I don't know nothing. I shouldn't be hearing it. And that's another thing from the beloved captain or he says for a few days he didn't do anything. Guess what? If you can observe for a few days, you're probably going to answer a bunch of questions just for observation and taking notes and getting back and maybe conferring with your trusted agent or you're a senior enlisted guy or you're, you're a superintendent. You can confer directly with them and keep that, build that relationship while you're guard garnering information.

Speaker 1:          02:06:39       Yeah, don't be that guy trying not to. It's true. Try not to Jocko, how do I take ownership of mixed messages to the people under me from the other leaders in my group? Pretty straightforward question. I like it. Well first of all, you have to address this straight up with the other leaders in your group because if you aren't aligned as a leadership team, this is going to hurt the cause. It is absolutely going to hurt the cross. This is critical and it's going to be hard. And there are some things in your group that people do not agree on and that is why they are undermining the messaging or why they're giving out different messaging because they don't agree with it. They don't have the courage to stand up and say, Hey, I don't agree with this right here, so let's do it a different way.

Speaker 1:          02:07:28       Here's my thoughts. They don't have the courage to that. So what do they do? They just sit back and then when it comes time to put out the word, they put up the mixed messages and it's, it's a bad situation and you actually have to lead here. That's what you have to do. Any, it shouldn't actually be that hard because what you're asking for is something that anybody can tell is important. So, you know, you said, do you say to your leadership team, you go, hey guys, our message to the troops needs to be aligned. And right now it isn't. We need to fix that. Is there anyone on your leadership team's going to disagree with that? No, they won't. That's not what they disagree with. They, everybody knows that the leadership team has to have an aligned message. They have to be on the same sheet of music. And that's what you need to do. And, and again, it's going to be a hard conversation. It's going to bring out that statement should bring out the conversation of what people don't agree on and why they're sending ms messages. Now, if you, if you cannot get them aligned, it is a serious problem. But if you can't, the best thing you can do is mitigate,

Speaker 1:          02:08:38       mitigate that to your team by becoming the trusted voice. So, so with your team, you want to become the trusted voice. Now you did this doesn't mean they're going to go on undermine your other leaders. It's a, I'll echo came in here. He doesn't know what he's talking about. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm never almost never talking about undermining another leader or a leadership team. What I'm going to do though is I'm going to translate them and say, hey guys, our job on this, I Know Echo said that. Here's our job. Here's, here's what our focus needs to be. Here's the way this translates for us, so I'm not disparaging you and I'm not even disagreeing with you. I'm simply honing the message for my team. Now

Speaker 1:          02:09:25       you still, even when you do that, you're mitigating that as much as possible. You still have to maintain the critical goal of getting your leadership team aligned and one other little tool to help make that happen is to present their words back to them and you said, you know what? I wrote down what you said to the team this morning and I just wanted to go through that with you and break it down a little bit and and then go through it line by line and have the hard conversations and make the tough decisions. You've got to make the tough decisions and also give a little seed some points, right? Be Flexible but unify, unify the message. And there's a worse, not even a worst case scenario, but there are scenarios where echo and I cannot agree on the message and we got to go up the chain of command.

Speaker 1:          02:10:22       Now, I would never want to do that. I would never ever want to say to my boss, Hey, echo and I can agree you need to make the decision for us. To me, that's a total failure. It's a failure in my leadership that I can't get us on the same sheet of music. So I don't, I can't even think of any time that I ever did that. Went to my boss and said, hey boss, I can't we, you know, I can't come to come to a conclusion here with the other task in new commanders or I can't come to a conclusion with the other platoon commanders or I can't come come to conclusion with the my squad about how we should do this. I've never done that. So you should be able to, if you're right, you'll win. The argument and if you're wrong then you change your mind.

Speaker 1:          02:11:00       So it's not that it's not like this ultimate, not like I'm saying I'm great. I'm just saying if you're right, then you'll win the argument and if you're wrong then you'll change your mind. So it's not that hard. So that's what happens. Needs to happen here with the leadership team. We've got to find out who's right and people that are right need to convince the people that are wrong. Now you need to check your ego. Obviously across the board, every t everybody on the team's got to check the Ricoh cause a lot of people will be holding onto their idea because it's their idea and they loved their idea because there's egotistical

Speaker 1:          02:11:39       and that's how I would deal with mixed messages coming down the chain of command. I'm going to go ahead and just say it. That could have been one of the best lines I've ever heard. If you're right, you win the argument. If you're wrong, you'll change your mind. That's a good, that's a good word. You just make that up. I didn't just make it up. I mean, I guess it's something that I've known but right. Yeah. That's what makes it so good. Cause you kind of, it kind of seems like, Oh yeah you don't. Right. But that's never the case. But if you're being on the up and up, there it is right there.

Speaker 2:          02:12:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:12:16       There you go. Echo likes that one. No, we've got time for about one more. I don't see why not. Jocko, you often talk about being on the path. What path is that and where does it lead? Ah, yes,

Speaker 2:          02:12:38       the path.

Speaker 1:          02:12:41       Well I can tell you what path I'm on and what path I strive to stay on. And that is the war path. That's the path I'm on the war path. A path of war. Cause to me warpath means moving toward a battle, a fight towards [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:13:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:13:14       In that is what I am doing. And that's what I've always been doing. Whether it was the actual war against our nation's enemies or the war

Speaker 4:          02:13:31       against my own weaknesses. That is what I am doing. Preparing and, and sharpening my sword and honing my skills and maintaining the unmitigated daily discipline in all things. And the war path is just that. It's a path. It's a root. It leads somewhere. And so you ask, okay, then where does it lead? And yes, yes, it, it can lead to war. And that's fine. In fact, I am waiting and I am ready because the war path is a war against weakness. And so it leads to strength. It's a war against ignorance. And so it leads to knowledge eats a war against confusion. And so it delivers understanding and the path, the war path leads to control and leads to ownership of your life. And that to me is the war path, the path of fire and adversity, the path of blood and sweat and of suffering. The warpath is the preeminent path of discipline, which is why it leads to freedom. And beyond that, in the end, the war path, it leads to peace. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So thanks to everyone out there for taking the time to listen to this, this, this little podcast we put together. And if you like it, then you want to support it. Echo. Nah, do they do that? If you're in the mood, if you worked out,

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       I know you heard this before, but if you work out and you want supplements that actually work because the supplement industry, and you probably know this bro, they can put whatever they want and there's no regulation. Yeah, you can, I don't know if it was a documentary. It's something like that where a guy just put chalk, that's all it was. Chalk and there he was like, hey look, protein powder, sell it. And either he found there was like, there was no like regulation saying he couldn't do it technically anyway. Um, it's, it's a whole long thing nonetheless. If you want for real ones where it's actually not a bad product id, we could make protein powder that you can use as chocolate bar. So you could be chalking up and then eating. Yeah. Good. No. Yeah, yeah. I Dunno. Maybe you get on it to make the protein powder chalkup yeah, that's, that's a little bit different from what else kind of sane.

Speaker 1:          02:17:20       But nonetheless, if you go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko you can get 10% off their supplements. Anyway. My point being with that story is that their supplements are all like legit. And you can even read about it like the [inaudible] oil. I said this before, I feel like I said this before, but you can see like how they harvest them. They use like eco friendly boats. Like it's like, it's basically the ones who went to go votes. Like the engines are like ecofriendly and like, you know, like that kind of stuff. Anyway, I was watching it. You can get addicted on there. But um, yeah, all legit warrior bars. I feel like we haven't really talked about worrying. I got asked by somebody on Twitter the other day what, you know, hey, my joints are hurting, which I take, take her awhile. Yeah, that's it man. Take her while.

Speaker 1:          02:18:04       Yeah. I've been using [inaudible] for a really long time. I'm 44 years old. I'm almost 45 years old actually. And my joints are doing solid and knock on wood. Um, you know, I had some joint pain in the past and when I started taking Krill oil, I'm talking 10, maybe even longer years ago. Um, the, it's I, I definitely attributed to helping me and also also the glucosamine. Yeah. So, and that's saying a lot because you're big. You're a big guy to third if I'm not exactly flexible. Yeah. Flexible person. And I do like, I do heavy duty stuff. I mean I'll get after it. Not, not as much as I want to and not as much as I should, but I tried, I tried to, to work out hard. I train Jujitsu, I surf, I run, I sprint, I just do all kinds of activities. And before up until several years ago, I was in the military, I was in the seal teams and I was running around doing all that crap for my whole life. And so yeah, I would say order up some krill oil bro. Just saying, just doing Jujitsu alone, especially as much as you do it, that alone,

Speaker 6:          02:19:28       old young, whatever, just doing the end. You're like, my joints are fine if you're in that situation to buy that alone. Yeah. And, and the Krill oil for sure. And also I believe that working out period is, is very helpful in staying injury free because I always work out and therefore I'm always moving and therefore my joints aren't getting rusty, you know? Do both, do both. You know, I do get injured, you know, I had the finger injury, which is a better net. Pretty good right now. I had, um, I had my shoulder got tweaked a little bit. Yeah. But that's a situation that's nice. Got me from rolling. Yeah. And that's not the kind of, Hey, I should have took more krill oil. It's not that, it's like, it's like when you wake up or when you, when you're like, Hey, I'm going to go out.

Speaker 6:          02:20:14       You start working. You're like, Oh Dang, I got to warm up some more. Some Marshall, you know, and I take it, just Fyi, I take three of the 500 milligram, what are the capsules in the morning and three at night? That's a lot of thousand a day yet. Dang. Well, hey, there you go. Then do that then. I mean, like I said, you're a big tank that needs more pills anyway. Yeah, it's good and firm on it. You know, you're getting like the good, the good on. Yeah. You know, it's not kidding. The clean stuff, mass manufactured, you know the one from the corner store. Krill. Yeah man, it's good. And you get 10% off, which is honored grid on a flash Jocko podcasts probably. It's a, it's a win. Win, win. Yeah. And speaking to port it, supporting this podcast, amazon.com click through, it might be the best way.

Speaker 6:          02:21:08       I don't know if it's the best way I would say it. It's another way. No other way, which is very effective, which has definitely helped support the podcast. Yeah. And it doesn't cost anything. It's real easy to do. You just click. Yeah, no, yeah, that's good. Yeah. The key thing to that one is remembering it, remembering to do it true too. And he's like, yeah, trooper tool, we got that. So go on the chrome extension. Interpretable chrome extension. If you haven't put that on your browser and, and you do want to support the podcast through the Amazon situation, put that on there. It's easy. It makes it super easy, efficient, aggressive, active and efficient, not passing like your attitude. You can support that way. And then, um, obviously the po it subscribe on Itunes and the Youtube, which I'm putting more videos on there starting to, and it's going to pick up too. I got some more content I'm going to put up for sure. And then, um, the Jocko store if you like shirts and whatnot, if you like them, get one of those and we have women's coming out. Is there anything else you have coming out? Yeah, it's a secret. Yeah. Okay. Actually if you're signed up for the, if you enlisted in the,

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       what is it that the insider check email and find out what else is out there, what else is coming, what else is on the horizon? Yeah. Cause we've had a lot of people ask for this item. What? Give me a hint. Rash guards [inaudible] rash guards are coming up, don't do Jujitsu. And they still wear rash guards for like working out, working out or um, or diving or, or Surf Surfing or surfing originally for, yeah. Yeah. I use the surfing rash guard a lot of times for Jujitsu. But yeah, the record's coming out and then if you, if you're into the Geek, you got some patches to, Oh, you got the patches coming out too. They're good, cool. Basic the way we like them. But yeah. Anyway, Jaclyn [inaudible] dot com that's, you can see all this stuff and um, yeah, if he, if, if you want to be on the insider's list, we don't, I don't spam people were saying you like stuff just for the sake of sending stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:23:23       I don't do that. In fact, I kind of understand stuff. Yeah. People don't want to be bothered if, if you're going to send something, make it be important. Yeah. At least something that I honestly think that you'd be interested in. Yes. Yeah. Honestly, I'm a put some thought into that. So yeah, there it is. That's the waste. Now in the very, very near future, like I'm talking maybe a week and it's by early September, 2016, you will be able to order Jocko white tea and you'd be able to order it from Amazon, which is good to go. And I got my first batch in matter of fact, I'm drinking a little bit of that stuff. Right. And um, it's, it definitely puts you in the zone low place. I like to call the assault zone. It gets, gets you there. So look for it. This is, this is, you know, if you heard that first podcast with Tim Ferriss and he was like, what is this adrenaline filled drink?

Speaker 1:          02:24:24       It was white tea and white tea is not loaded with caffeine. There's other stuff in there, there's magic in there, there's antioxidants in there. It tastes good. And uh, anyways, so that's common. You'd be able to order it. We're kind of wonder, I'm kind of wondering to see if people want Jocko white tea. I think they do. Yeah. And we will find out shortly. I know I do. Yeah, it's, that's an interesting thing because you know, like just kind of on the surface won't be like, hey fuck what's Jocko into? It's not like, you know something crazy. It's like something let's face it sounds kind of delicate, you know white well when you see the can that it comes in, it's not delicate. It's delicate. It's weird cause I was trying to think of where I discovered it and I actually don't know. I actually can't remember how, why drink it for the first time, but when I started drinking I was like, oh yeah, this stuff, it feels good.

Speaker 1:          02:25:22       Especially when under stress or there's a lack of sleep or um, you need to be mentally sharp. It's the deal. But you can mix white tea with, it'll mess up the taste. But you mix Jocko white tea with Alpha brain. I've done it. I've done it. I've done it here in the podcast. Yeah. It doesn't mess up the taste. It tastes good. Dang. All right. We'll get the white tea. Is, is a, it's not like this super harsh taste. It's a supermarket. It's a mild cause you can taste it. You can kind of feel it to length but heavy, he'd say, I don't even know how to describe it. It's just not an act. It's not a heavy taste. Yeah, so you can mix it with lot of stuff. Um, and you can, like I said, you can be able to get that on Amazon, see a click through the, get it on Amazon.

Speaker 1:          02:26:12       You can also go ahead and get by the below book called extreme ownership when you're there you recommend. Yup, and you can get that anywhere. Anywhere they sell books. You can buy the hardcover. He can buy the digital audio format, which my brother Leif Babin and I actually read. You can get it for your people up and down the chain of command, your friends, family, whoever it is that you think needs to get on board with the program, get him a copy. That's kind of a good initiator forum. And also October 20th and 21st in San Diego, we are having the extreme ownership muster that is also Leif Babin and myself. We're going to be getting granular, granular with the combat leadership lessons that we learned on the battlefield and how you apply those lessons in your business and in your life. Now that event is going to be

Speaker 1:          02:27:15       extremely interactive. It's more not going to be hiding behind the curtain. We're going to be out front with the troops. If you got questions, we are going to answer them. If you got something you need, we're going to talk about it. If you've got a problem, we're going to come up with a solution. I say we because it we were going to work together. We're going to learn. I can't wait to see how much I'm going to learn with the, the list of people that are coming is awesome. It every industry you could imagine every level of leadership you can imagine. It's just, it's really going to be fired up and laugh and I've been hammered out the schedule and there's so much material and so much good information and so much good content. It's going to be awesome and I cannot wait to kick it off.

Speaker 1:          02:27:59       Or do you just do part of the schedule? Jujitsu is not on the schedule, but what I'm gonna do is I'm going to basically have a Jujitsu situation happening at the gym. So the event is Thursday, Friday, so maybe it's going to be Wednesday night. If people come in early, maybe it's going to be Saturday. If people want to stay or Sunday people want to stay the weekend. So, or just have them like where they're like, you know, the welcome come to the gym. You know, like these are the things from the moment I could just bring some mats to the hotel and do some kind of a, but now when they, then we got to, now Jim is way better because it's like that, you know, one of the best people to the gym. Yeah. So yeah, if you want to get the Jujitsu together, we are going to get the Jimmy and I trained Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          02:28:42       I'm in San Diego, I'm training, so we'll be in San Diego. We will be training, we might not be able to do it Thursday night because it's a packed schedule. Um, doesn't end until late at night, but either Wednesday night or probably probably once the monsters over cause head heading into the monster. I'm going to be like David. Actually I think it would go. No, I have an event earlier in the week, so probably going to be the weekend if you want. If you want to get your Jujitsu on, stay the weekend. Yeah. Home Sunday afternoon, get a red eye flight back to the east coast or whatever and, or if you're out here, just go home Sunday night.

Speaker 6:          02:29:19       And that's kind of um, just muster. No mustard. People come in and they're like, hey, I want to come in that gym. Yeah, but guys have comms getting Max. I just, I just met him and his girlfriend, his wife, I forget if they're married now, but they came in and he was like, Hey, um, you know, I just came in and whatever. Um, so yeah, people would just come in and they just let him into, of course, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:29:43       Also a look. I know that the monster is expensive and in this situation, guess what? It costs money to put it on. It costs money for the hotel room, the event, the event room, the Food Dav equipment, the security, the logistics, all that stuff. It costs money. And the reason that we're investing in it is because we want it to be the best. We want it to be. The best event that you have ever been to. That's what I want. That's all. And but that does cost money. And so if you can't afford to come out to it, you know what, I apologize the, but the podcast is free. The book is 20 bucks. Um, get what you can out of that. But if you can't afford to come out, come on out because you being there is going to make us all better because every single person that I get so many responses on Twitter, I get so many stuff, so much stuff through, through the social media that I'm learning from everyone here. So anybody that can come out and participate and ask that question or give that scenario or give that piece of input is going to make us all better. So come on out and get some. And as always, if you want to continue this conversation, you know where you can find us all up on that. Andrew Labs, Twitter, Instagram, and that Facebook, he Baja,
