Speaker 1:          00:00:01       This is Jocko podcast number 53 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening. At what point do you quit? At what point did you give in? At what point do you surrender and what is it that makes you surrender?

Speaker 2:          00:00:33       The enemy

Speaker 1:          00:00:35       fatigue, hunger, thirst, bitter cold. Who are these men that decide that they will not surrender no matter what? What will, what humans will do? They have,

Speaker 2:          00:01:08       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       that they decide they are going to fight on no matter what they face. Well, I will tell you these men,

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       amen.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       They're human beings like you like me, human beings that decide they're going to fight on despite being surrounded by the enemy. Despite the hunger and the danger and the thirst and the bitter cold, they decide they will not surrender.

Speaker 2:          00:01:51       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       and we can find examples of these men throughout history. But one of the four most examples comes from the Korean War in late November and into mid December of 1950 when 30,000 UN troops, mostly American, we're surrounded by 120,000 communist Chinese forces in these Americans were attacked, attacked by the enemy, and attacked by the, the bitter, freezing cold and attacked by hunger and fear. And yet they would not and they did not surrender. Or tonight we're going to hear from a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps, Joseph R, O, n who served as a mortar section commander for Baker Company, First Seventh Marine Regiment, First Marine Division.

Speaker 2:          00:03:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       In his book, which is called colder than hell. And the book starts off with one of the best short overviews of the Korean War I've ever read, likely because it's written by a man who was there, a man named General Raymond Davis. Ray Davis, who, first of all, he was a battalion commander in World War II at the battle of Pellalou awarded the Navy Cross there for leading his men against overwhelming Japanese fire. And in Korea he was awarded the Medal of honor as well as two silver stars, a Legion of Merit, and a bronze star as the commander of the first battalion seventh marines.

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       And beyond that, he also served as the third marine division commander in Vietnam in 1969 where he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal and three republic of Vietnam Gallantry Crosses. So when he speaks, I think maybe we should listen.

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       And I'm going to start with that forward by General Davis in the book, Colder Than Hell. My Joe, twice in 1950 during the first months of the Korean War, the United States faced military catastrophe. Both situations occurred because of American errors of diplomacy and faulty intelligence. And because our military was not prepared to meet a determined enemy on the battlefield, North Korea and China where the enemies that exploited our failings on two occasions that year, they caught us by surprise, launching massive attacks first against our allies, South Korea, and that against our own inadequate forces.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       Both times the consequences were devastating. There were tragic numbers of casualties in the ranks of our soldiers. And Marines and American prestige worldwide was severely impaired. The surprise invasion of South Korea by North Korea with a supportive communist China and the Soviet Union was a virtually invited by the United States in the South Koreans. South Korea was vulnerable. It's soldiers were ill-equipped, poorly trained and improperly deployed. The American forces at that time, victims of Washington politics and false economies were nearly as bad off following the end of world war two drown draw down. They were in skeletonized formation. Sad be undertrained and inadequately equipped. So there's a little warning for us today. You need somebody. Somebody asked me that question, what's your foreign policy? Can you say it in 140 characters? Somebody asked me that on Twitter. I answered it in one word. My foreign policy, his strength. This is why.

Speaker 2:          00:06:35       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       back to the book. Moreover, our secretary of State had proclaimed to the world that the Korean Peninsula was outside the area of American vital interests. North Korea, China and the Soviet Union read that message to mean that the United States would not defend South Korea against outside aggression. South Korea would be theirs for the taking. We now know of messages exchanged between Joseph Stalin and the North Korean President Kim Il Sung that explored our weakness and concluded that South Korea could be captured in five days. Subsequently, the North Koreans launched a sudden and massive invasion solve the North Korean capital. It's quickly taken and soon all that country was overrun except for one small pocket around the port of Pusan. That pocket was formed by American troops on ready as they were that President Harry Truman hurried into Korea in response to the crisis at great sacrifice. These American soldiers with a follow on brigade of marines held the Pusan perimeter long enough to allow forces to assemble for an amphibious assault on Incheon behind the North Korean lines. We recaptured soul and the North Koreans were put on the run.

Speaker 2:          00:07:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       Fearing entrapment, they fled back across their border to the North American and South Korean troops. We're joined by soldiers from other United Nations countries and pursued the aggressors deep into North Korea. Our mission was to fold, to punish the North Koreans and to block the Chinese People's Liberation Army. If it threatened to enter the war?

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       Because of a failure of intelligence. However, we were far too late to deter the Chinese. They had already positioned vast numbers of their well trained soldiers in the mountains of North Korea. We were sued under heavy attack, fighting a numerically superior enemy in unfavorable terrain and blue brutally cold weather. The UN forces predominantly American were chased out of North Korea.

Speaker 2:          00:08:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       At the chosen, whereas of war where we were outnumbered 10 to one, the Chinese generals prematurely boasted of the destruction of the First Marine Division. Yet the opposite happened there. Although the marines were forced to withdraw, we destroyed several Chinese divisions as we fought our way to the sea and to escape. Our withdrawal was a successful one, but we paid a terrible price. Casualties reduced the division to nearly half its strength. The three rifle companies at first battalion seventh Marine Regiment, which I was privileged to command and dirt losses of even greater proportions. My battalion had been hastily activated in response to President Truman's urgent call to action. It was a thrown together rifle company, a collection of regulars gathered from marine corps posts and stations all over the world and reservists mostly untrained who were suddenly called from their homes, jobs, schools with only a few days of training.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       They were embarked aboard a ship heading across the Pacific and thrown into combat. They had to learn to fight while under fire. They're saving grace was that they were led by disciplined officers and NCOC who showed them by upfront example how to fight like marines, although they suffered casualties that proper preparation would have avoided. They learned well and they hardened and define rifle company. No North Korean or Chinese force ever stopped them from taking it objective or overcame their position. Let us do all we can to assure that no future generation of young Americans need to go to war unprepared as were those heroes who went to Korea in 1950 and again, that is the foreword of the book, which was written by General Raymond Davis, Medal of honor winner. And like I said, the book is written by Joe Oh and Joseph Owen, who was marine corps officer. And let's continue on. And now we start hearing from Joe and they're at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Nobody at Camp Lajune had expected a shooting war. We nor we were ready for one. So they're, they're, they're, they're just kind of peace time, peace, time, marines, you know, kind of doing their thing and all of a sudden

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       the North Koreans attack and here we go. They're all sitting around listening to the radio, a bunch of marines. The announcer continued more than 2000 Americans, military advisers and civilian workers and their families are said to be in the path of North Koreans. Surprise, aggression. Their fate is unknown at this time. American involvement in the new war is not clear war. Yeah. The possibility of American marines in a combat role. Excited us. So these guys are young, not all of them. There's, there's, there's definitely, we're gonna run into many World War II veterans, but the young kids, they don't know. They want to get after it there. They're fired up. They're so fired up back to the book. One story alleged that a commando force of volunteers was forming up for an immediate commitment to battle.

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       That one tied up phone lines on the base. As we tried to track down the commando headquarters in order to volunteer. They're all ready to rock and roll now. Then they start seeing what, what's beginning to occur. They see that we're surrounded. They see that we're kind of getting the North Koreans are getting the best, if not routing back to the book. Americans at home were stunned by reports that their army, the conqueror of the mighty Germany and Japan only five years before was outnumbered, outgunned and out fought by the upstart North Koreans.

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       General Macarthur called for a full division of Marines to help him turn back the North Koreans. The Marine Corps welcomed the call, but we did not have a full division to put in the field like all the services. The core had been stripped of men and weapons in order to reduce itself to the level of the 1930s both the first and second marine divisions were less than half strength. The core would need to draw men from guard detachments to ships companies and posts and stations throughout the world, but it still wouldn't find enough troops to fill a division. President Truman thus authorize the commandant of the Marine Corps to call up the reserves, so it was, again, this is a warning as a nation and as a, as an individual cumin, don't let down your guard. Peacetime will not last and the weaker you look, the sooner the peacetime we'll end. Now they get the orders standby to ship out on the Saturday evening before we left Camp Lejune Dorothy, so that's Joe's wife. Dorothy hired a babysitter and we went to the officer's Club for dinner. There were candles out at our table which was covered in white linen and set with heavy silverware. The food was delicious and plentiful and I would think about it often in Korea when my men and I were hungry and cold

Speaker 1:          00:14:54       that night, Dorothy's hair glistened like gold and the candle light and her eyes smiled bright and blue and warm. We danced and laughed with the other lieutenants and their wives.

Speaker 3:          00:15:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       For some of the couples are closest friends. There was the last night they would ever have together.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       So they depart lagoon and they show up at Camp Pendleton, California and they get to Camp Pendleton and he, they will, we'll talk more about this, but camp Pendleton is a, believe it or not, it's on the coast of California and there some pretty aggressive hills in Calif in Camp Pendleton, which I've spent many nights on cause we would work up there and uh, they, they can, they can turn some soft men into some hard men pretty quickly or break men if they're too weak. So back to the book, our ranks were filled by 215 men and seven officers who had never before served together. Half of our enlisted men were infantry trained regulars. The other half were reservists, most of whom were youngsters who knew, knew little of marine infantry and its method methods. Five weeks after we first formed up at Camp Pendleton, we went into the attack against North Korean soldiers who were dug into a hill north of Seoul.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       And we had spent half of that time on board ship on the way to war. So let me break that down to you. They have five weeks, so five weeks from when they form up, five weeks later they're attacking North Korean troops. So just Fyi, for a seal platoon that's going to Iraq, we used to work up for a full year. This is after we went through seal training and after we went through seal qualification training, and after all the guys show up the team and go to special schools and then you get formed up into a platoon, you have an unbelievable workup to prepare. And, and the Marine Corps does this too. I mean the army, everyone does this now. That's the amount of preparation that it takes to prepare for combat. And here are these guys five weeks of which, what was it? Half that time is spent on a ship just sailing over there. Hmm. Unbelievable. Back to the book, The Sun, scorched hills of Camp Pendleton had over the years tough in the legs and tested the spirits of thousands of America's best fighting men. One of those towering hills loomed across the road from our training site, so again, you want to get tough, get on some hills with a rucksack on your back that that will do it to you and I guess I kind of included those little sections about Camp Pendleton hills for my pleasure and thinking about those hills.

Speaker 2:          00:17:52       Awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:17:56       Back to the book. They're going through, they're going through this training and they're getting ready to deploy and we'll go back to the book now. Dorothy took $75 of our scant resources and bought an airline ticket from Syracuse to San Diego each night after we had dismissed the troops, bill and I, this is Bill Graybar, he's another one of the officer's bill and I caught a ride to the hotel restaurants in the little village of San Clemente. We're closed that late, but Dorothy would have a cold supper waiting for me. Then we would stroll to the beach and listen to the waves crash across the sand. During those walks we talked about the babies and we made plans for my return from Korea. My next assignment. I assured her would give us at least two years at a good duty station. Maybe I would be senior enough for us to rate decent quarters in the mornings early. It's still dark bill Graybar and I would grab a ride back to camp with the other officers. Everyone except the driver's slept all the way crowded against each other and the tight seats of the car. We were very tired but we were young men and we did dearly love our beautiful wives

Speaker 1:          00:19:13       and you're going to see throughout this book that even though his wife was not with him, she was with him the whole time. I like many spouses are when guys are deployed overseas and now they are on board the ship. The ship is getting ready to pull out of the San Diego Bay. Back to the book. The wives remained on the dock long after we had gone aboard. The sqirl of bagpipes sounded as we wave to them. Pfc Timmy Killeen Able Company stood on the fan tail of the oak can outgun and his bagpipes filled the feeding afternoon with the marines. Hymn handkerchiefs flooded from the dock and the ship's horn blasted. We were underway. There were tears, but marines and marine wives aren't ashamed of tears when they're him plays.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       So now they're heading over to Korea. They're in cramped quarters. I've done a couple deployments on board ships and there's, and fibia ships is what they're called. And these ships were meant to take people overseas, don't. The ones that I deployed on were, were what drove us, what drove soldiers to Vietnam. We used to deploy on those ships for six months, but it's just really cramped. You know, their basic, you're basically like a cattle car, a giant cattle car ship, and they just pack everyone on there. It's really tight and uh, there's not much to do on there, but you know, you take a bunch of marines, you put them on a ship and they figure something out. Back to the book. Staff Sergeant Richard revealed himself to be an all purpose NCO and an acquisition specialist. One day he produced a set of boxing gloves and the men of Baker one seven immediately became avid pugilists

Speaker 3:          00:21:13       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:14       For three exuberant rounds to the delight of the company, the little bull by folk and the little gorilla Lupa cine engaged in mutual annihilation. When Sergeant Richard claimed his mess gear to end the Bra, the troops, and much of the ship's crew or an a cheering frenzy, it had been a grand fight. Both men were covered in blood at bruisers bruises, and at the final clang they wrapped arms and leaned against each other. Exhausted my mortar men swarmed into the square, pummeling by folk with congratulations Perkins, who had been holding by forks, glasses, placed them carefully over his swollen eyes. I saw Burris then gently guide by fork out of the ring. Gino, Brian Lupa, Chinese platoon sergeant followed with his man and Baker one seven we're still whistling and cheering when the two fighters and their handlers went through the hatch and down the ladder to sick bay. Joe Casaba stood next to me, so go joke, or is one of the platoon commanders stood next to me. This outfit is coming together. He said Joe rarely smiled, but there was a big grin on his face after that fight. So there's you. You notice that in these stories about combat wrestling, fighting, boxing, there is something to it. There is something to it that bonds men together. Fact,

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       back to the book when we weren't on deck with the troops, the officer spent the waking hours around the wardroom table, so the wardroom ownership is where the officer's eat. Captain Wilcox now, this is the introduction, introduction to Captain Wilcox. He's the company commander and he's a a vet from EOL Jima, Captain Wilcox, lettuce. In review of the principles and lessons of the of rifle company combat, he and Joker Saba use their own battle experience. As experiences has illustration, they focused on the chaos of combat and how the best laid plans always disintegrated under enemy fire. That's why we got to keep our plants simple.

Speaker 3:          00:23:30       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       War is hell. Captain Wilcox who had much experience at it would tell us, but you never know what particular kind of hell it is going to be. We studied the after actions report

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       that had come from the fifth marines. The North Koreans they had faced were tough skilled fighters. Every bit is tenacious in battle as the Japanese had been in the bitter Pacific island fighting of the last war, the red soldiers, fifth marines called them gluecks. We're well trained in the Russian style of combat with effective use of supporting armor, mortars and artillery. They were men who also were adept at night fighting. Fighting at night was a combat skill we had yet to learn. We would do so under fire and at a terrible cost. So Joe Owen is actually, he's not a platoon commander, he is a, he's the mortar section commander. So in a company of, yeah, call it 200 200 marines, there's multiple rifle platoons, maybe 40 guys, 50 guys in each one of those rifle platoons. And then there's a little section of mortar guys. And mortars aren't indirect fire weapons. So for those of you that don't know anything about mortars, mortars, shoot rounds, they're there. You see him in movies, there's a tube, they're basically a tube and they're at a really high angle and the, and you drop rounds into it and they fire at a very high altitude and high angle. And then they dropped down from straight above and hit targets. And so, so Joe and in this company is in charge of the mortar section.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       Back to the book, when Baker one seven was still on the way to war, the first and fifth marines forced the landing across the tidal flats at Inchon harbor. The radio and the ship's wardroom was tuned to the tactical net and we listened to commanders on the beach as they reported the action to their senior echelons and made call for air and artillery support and ammunition resupply over the static and crackling transmission. We could hear shells exploding, small arms, fire, battlefield curses, and the screams of wounded men. The transmissions were piped out onto the deck with the troops. Also listened to the grim sounds. I left the wardroom and went out to be with my mortar men. They sat in a tight cluster staring intently at a loudspeaker as they heard the war that was about to swallow us.

Speaker 1:          00:26:15       That's a real introduction right there. You're, you know, you're going to award. You get to listen to guys on the ground and a fierce firefight and hear the shouts and screams of the wounded. That's a reality. That's a reality check right there for those guys. So at this point, um, Owen, he, he kind of wants to pick up a platoon instead of being the mortar section, he kind of feels like mortar section, you know, they're a little bit in the, in the rear and he wants to be a rifle platoon. If you, if you remember what Mac Alan said that the last book we did about the Korean War and you know, rifle platoon commander, rifle platoon commander, right. For two commander. That's what if you're gung Ho, that's what you want to do. And so Joe, when he feels kind of like, you know, I wish I was a platoon. I wish I was a rifle platoon commander. That's what I want to do. But he's a mortar section commander. Okay, that's fine. Well, he tries to get that job and he says he is, he's kind of pressing to get that job up the chain of command. I should have backed off. I plowed on Sir. The word is that the first and fifth marines are running short on lieutenants. I like to request transfer as replacement. The captain turned to Caney first sergeant, if you will excuse us. I'd like award alone with Lieutenant Owen.

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:28       Yes sir. Responded Caney. So he kind of gets rid of the senior enlisted guy. He knew I was about to get reamed any smirked at me as he disappeared behind the pile of crates. Captain Wilcox gave me that glare. Once again, you want to transfer out of Baker one seven sir. It's the, Oh, it's only that I want to put my training of some use before the fighting ends and to hell with your men. To hell with the company. Is that right, lieutenant? No Sir. Captain, it's just that. It's just that you want to jump ship on us. The skippers face glistened with press perspiration and he turned into a steaming red. He had been angry with me before, but never like this, sir. I, okay lieutenant, here's what you do. You put your request for transfer in writing and I'll forward it approved. No sense holding back a gung Ho hot shot. The second lieutenant, sir. It's not that I want to leave the outfit, it's just that I thought that put your request in writing. That's all lieutenant dismissed, sir. I dismissed.

Speaker 1:          00:28:28       So this is your typical typical meat ball that thinks he's gonna. You know, he's just been gung Ho was trying to make something happen. Yeah, it's not a not a good way to be. And you can see that. So that's another thing you've got to think about other people's perspective, right? You gotta think about your boss's perspective. Your boss is sitting here trying to get this company together and then one of his section leaders go lower. Go some world, right? Right. Kind of for him. So what does meatball meatball, oh, sorry. That's just an expression for, it's an expression for a new guy in the seal teams. Oh, meatball or a meat stick or Fng. Any one of those can be utilized. So I guess I threw it on on the, the new guy here. It kind of slipped out. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       Oh good. Now they get on shore and

Speaker 1:          00:29:16       back to the book, we passed a company of third battalion that had been pulled off the line. It's men were sprawled along the road. Unshaven and ragged wearied by days of fighting. So there's another, another little wake up call

Speaker 1:          00:29:32       seeing the guys that are coming off the line now they get into a position. This is Baker six move forward out. Captain Wilcox ordered. We all reported ready as we started across the bean field, we were greeted by a fuselage of fracking. Sounds North Korean bullets tearing through the bean plants, frack, frack, frack all around us. I kept an eye on my men. They crouched low, but they stayed together and moved ahead. Then the Cri Korman God, I'm hit a few feet from me. A marine from Kaiser's platoon rived on the ground, his hands clutching his belly, grayish red intestines, pushed through his fingers and blood stained the ground as he thrashed about screaming in his pain and terror for the first time. I felt the shivers of dread, the awful fear that comes with combat. I froze a second. How many seconds until I once again became aware of the flacking sounds and the bean plants and I yelled at the men, move it you people keep moving.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       They bent lower to the ground. As we went forward, the North Korean mortars came, spouts of earth and black smoke leap the about us laced with flame and screaming shrapnel. The leaves from being plants spawned in flurries and the ground shook. I was suddenly in the midst of a frenzied storm of noise. Mortars, whistled and crashed. Bullets, wind and leaves. Flacked men shouted prayers and blasphemies. The far end of the bean field was the dyke of a rice patty. We headed for its cover. A string of mortar shells exploded around us and a man threw himself to the ground kicking and screaming, can't take this. I can't take this screech. The fear stricken marine tiny curled up himself into a fetal ball. I ran to him and prodded him with a bottom. My car being on your feet, his head was buried in his arms. Can't take this. He wailed get up or I'll shoot you the sound of the words coming from my mouth was unreal to me. Jesus don't shoot me. The man whined tiers cut Pale streaks through the dust on his cheeks. As he stared in horror at my car been, which was inches from his face, I grabbed the man by his collar and pulled him up to his feet, move. I yelled, Sargent Dale from the first platoon ran toward us. I got him lieutenant, he's from my platoon. Dale said,

Speaker 1:          00:32:01       so there's fear. Then you can see Joe in his feeling fear and he's dealing with it. And this other young marine is feeling fear and he's not dealing with it.

Speaker 3:          00:32:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:12       And they, they finally get to that dike across the field. Back to the book, I crawled up the dyke to peer over the top smoke obscured my view, but far ahead and across the road, I detected some movement. The enemy positions were difficult to locate. No flash came from their weapons when they fired. I raised my binoculars before I could focus on the target. However, a flurry of bullets pelted the dike and spurts of pebbles and dirt stuck my face. I jerked my head down and to cover beside me. A rifleman tumbled away from the dyke. He made a choking sound and his helmet bounce to the ground. Blood gushed from his head, which suddenly became a wet crimson pulp. Another wave of fear shuttered threw me a massive paralyzing force again. I froze, aware only of that blood drenched face and head.

Speaker 2:          00:33:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:04       Captain Wilcox voiced cracking crackled out of my walkie talkie. Baker five this is six. Come in the voice. Snap me from my paralysis. Baker six this is five comment six

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       I was scrambling back up the dike. I knew the skipper wanted the sixties the sixties are his mortar. 60 millimeter mortars to bear on the North Koreans who had us under fire. Get those guns cranked up. Five over Roger that six I said to the radio on the double sergeant wing gun was a few yards away behind the dike and I crawled over to get in front of it. Stand by for a chief fire mission. I called the wing it number one gun standing by a chief fire mission, the staunch wing, it called back with all the will I could muster. I forced my head above the dyke binoculars at the ready. The terror of having my head blown off to a pulp was diminished by fear of losing the respect of my men. So there's a couple of things there.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       You've heard me say you trained how you fight. What they go back to is the fundamentals that they practiced and trained. And we didn't dive too much in the training. But if you ever, if you've ever seen marines in the field with a 60 millimeter mortar, I haven't seen army guys. I'm sure they're outstanding too. But when you see the marines setting up a mortar for a fire mission, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing. And this is exactly what it's like. Even in, even in the 90s you know, 40 years after, after the Korean War, when I would watch the, the mortar men set up a mortar to shoot. It was just like that. They'd be stand by for fire mission. And then you know, one of the sergeant would call out number one guns standing by a chief fire mission. You go back to your training and those fundamental basics that you learn, the simple commands, that's what you go back to. That's why you train. That's why you use repetition. So when that fear comes up, you go back to what you know your instinct becomes. Instead of cowering, your instinct becomes to do what you've trained how to do.

Speaker 2:          00:35:07       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:35:08       back to the book. All along the dikes are marines were sprawled heads below the edge. The corpsman had moved their wounded alongside the road waiting for the ambulance, jeeps, the meat wagons to come up. There were two bodies face covered by ponchos. They were Baker one sevens first killed in action. The KIAA. So Baker's is the company that they're in that you could, that's why they keep referring to Baker one seven first battalion Baker company back to the book someone said

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       won't be nothing left up there by the time the are artillery gets it. So what's going on here is they call in some, some big guns, some big, so 60 millimeter mortar small. And then when you start calling in how it serves a big giant bombs are coming from the sky. Uh, that's what they call some of those in. And do you know, you're sitting there sitting there watching the mountain where these, where these North Koreans aren't, they're seeing massive explosions. And so now back to the book, someone said, won't be nothing left of them up there. By the time that artillery lets up, Staff Sergeant Richard, the company armor was crouched near us, don't fool yourself. He said, artillery never wipes out. The geeks softens them up and keeps their head down, but they'll be there waiting when the guns led up. This is another lesson we learned a lot about.

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       You know, you think, you think that no one could survive something and they do survive it. It we, we used to, when we were running training, we had the, the Humvees would be shooting blanks. It's training. So the Humvees would be big 50 caliber machine guns and they shoot blanks into a building. And then the guys in the building would come and shoot back at them and the guys and just going through the training, the seals, all, you know, we, we shot a bunch of 50 cal in there. Those guys wouldn't be alive. And you know, I would say no, actually they will be alive. They will be alive because I've seen it. And those 50 cows, they're on awesome weapon. But there's a guy, two rooms deep inside that building, you can shoot all those rounds in there. He's going to be okay. And as soon as you let up, he's going to be there shooting back at you. And it's the same thing with obviously with a big artillery and the North Koreans are dug in. I scrambled to my feet, keep moving. The men were all up and they ran after me, bent under the weight of their guns and Ammo. Get us the hell out of here. Someone cried. And so what do they do? They attack. So when you're pinned down, it's just another example when you're pinned down attack, and here's what it looks like. Back to the book to have Kaiser squads moved up in short bounce while a third laid a base of fire.

Speaker 3:          00:37:46       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       cover move. You're going to be covering move all throughout this book and every time we bring it up, I'm going to mention it because I want to make sure everyone that's listening go. Those folks that are in the military, you hear it every single time. This is the first one of many to have. Kaiser squad moved up in short bounds while third laid a base of fire, the first 50 yards when easily. Then the North Koreans popped out of cover and took us under fire. Suddenly the ground before us with skate, with torrents of bullets, mortar shells whistled in and exploded the long car. Kaiser's line corpsman, corpsman, so if you don't know a corpsman has as a medic in the, in the army, it's a medic in the navy it's called a corpsman and navy corpsman are the ones that go and deploy with the Marine Corps as medics.

Speaker 1:          00:38:32       So that's when you hear those, those Corman calls. That's what it Korman Korman came a despairing whale, add top alert stuff from prone position and ran toward the wounded man as enemy bullets. Spurted around him beside me. Another man went down with a grunt and did not move. Fear slammed my gut once more and I was flat on the deck. Nichols was down there with me. What do you want to do? Lieutenant Nickels, plump young fee, face street with dirt and sweat showed the same fear that had me in its terrible grip. Jesus the boy depends on me. I forced my head up. That's a classic. What do you want to do lieutenant?

Speaker 1:          00:39:23       I was, I think I might have talked about this, but I was in when I was in Sri Lanka and I was a young kid and there was all those guys that were hardcore combat veterans and one of the captains, army captains, again Sri Lankan army captain, who had been in tons of combat. And I was talking to almost trying to like be garner information about war cause I hadn't been in any and he'd been in a ton. He was wounded and shrapnel in his face. And I'm talking to him, you know about it. And he said, you know, when you're in a war, he goes, it's pretty easy to take care of yourself and take care of yourself. Like he said, if I was in a war, if I, when we were in a firefight, if I just had to take care of myself, I'd be okay. But when you're in charge of everyone is totally different than now. All of a sudden you got people saying, what do you want us to do, lieutenant? And that's the pressure, which I will never forget him telling me that story. And that's a great example of it right there. Sure. He's scared. He's scared, but he's got a mortar section waiting for them to tell, waiting for him to tell him what to do to save them.

Speaker 1:          00:40:37       Now we get introduced to a guy named Lieutenant Lee, who's a Chinese American guy, very by the book and very hardcore. You're going to hear plenty about Lieutenant Lee year. We tend to lead, came upon Baldwins gun. Sir, I think we should move this gun. Baldwin said to his lieutenant, it's kicking up dust. You have a good position here. Baldwin responded. Lieutenant Lee, I'll show you how to handle the dust problem. Lee opened up as canteen and walked around the machine gun sprinkling precious water as he went. Now fire off a burst orderly and machine gun fired but raised no dust. Lieutenant Lee walked on up the hill ignoring enemy bullets that hit around him.

Speaker 1:          00:41:18       Moving forward a little bit. Hey Lee called by folk. Get down. We're getting shot at by full cad. Lieutenant Lee's attention. The lieutenant dashed where by folk was hugging the ground. You address me as Lee. He asked, standing over the astonished young marine, Jesus, yeah, get down, you're drawing fire. You on your feet. Demanded Lee Bullets Zip through the year punctuating the bizarre scene of a lieutenant bracing a PFC to attention in the midst of a firefight. You call me Lieutenant Lee or Sir, you understand that marine? Yes, yes, yes sir. Stammered by folk wishing that he were in a very deep foxhole and you never forget that. Understand now carry on. Set the lieutenant. And he proceeded to walk further up the hill, seemingly oblivious to the enemy fire. What the hell thought by folk. And he got up to walk behind Lee, the rest of the mortar squad or rose and followed.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       So like I said, Lee is by the book. And that's an extreme example. I don't think I necessarily agree with that example either, but Lee's going to hold the line and maybe there was much danger as a, as he thought. But instilling that discipline, he's given no slack back to the book while the mortars obscured the enemy's view. Van Winkle moved his people up. So you've got the mortars dropping fire and that allows vanwinkle to move his people. That's called cover and move. By the way, nearing the top of the ravine, Hank Kaiser positioned his assault squad to follow a barrage of grenades into the enemy positions. As soon as the mortars lifted. So you've got three situations you got the mortars are going in. That's the first cover. Then once the mortars left, they're going to throw grenades. That's your second cover. The ammo carriers for the marines machine guns filled in with riflemen on the line of assault, ready to charge up the last few yards of ground. Lee was with them bayonet fixed to the top of his car being the mortars. Fired, fired a final barrage there. Explosions were followed by the sharper impact of grenades thrown at enemy holes. Shouts and war cries swelled from charging marines who leaped. Bayonets pointed into the enemy positions that were dug in along the face of the rich. Some of the North Korean stood to fight their bayonets also fixed, but they were cut down. Others scurried over the hill. Many were shot from behind is they tried to escape.

Speaker 1:          00:43:51       We all knew had been a far from perfect exercise. Some of the men had been slow to respond to direction. Not all of our orders were clear enough for quick and effective fire and movement. We were fortunate that the enemy had not chosen a fight to the death defense of this hill as they would have advanced as they would would we advanced further north. So think about this point. Not all of our orders were clear enough for quick and effective fire movement. He's not even blaming the guys. He knows that the mistake was that they weren't being simple, clear, concise with their waters and that makes everything lag

Speaker 1:          00:44:34       back to the book. And we had nearly reached the top captain Wilcox pushed weavers platoon through Kaiser's for the final assault platoon. Sergeant King led the charge and we could hear is piercing. Rebel yells all over the hill. Once again, it was a ragged performance orders confused in the hellish noise. Men who bunched close together and some who hesitated to risk the move against enemy fire. However clumsy we were though, we had the fundamentals right. The NCO is directed, their sectors of fire, the fire teams went forward in bounds covering each other as they protect progressed and our machine gun and mortar fire stayed ahead of the events and kept the enemy heads down. That's the, that's what, that's what small unit tactics are. It's cover and move, cover, move, cover, move. Now they're digging in some some night defenses and because there are these peaks, I mean this huge mountainous terrain, steep cliffs, they end up dis aggregated across the battlefield. So they're not, they're not right next to each other cause there's valleys between them.

Speaker 3:          00:45:48       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       Back to the book we had, we had to set our own isolated perimeters and we couldn't tie our flanks to the other companies for mutual support. The same held true for attack. Almost always the battalion was channel. It channeled into attacking some with one company, one hill at a time. This sort of isolated fighting made it difficult to communicate with battalion and other companies. That problem was not solved much of the time we company level officers were on our own initiative, decentralized command, just decentralized command. So imagine this, you can't talk to battalion. There was a hill that cuts your radio signal. You have to beat, you have to know what the intent is of the operation, and you have to be out there ready to ready to execute on your own to the best of your ability underneath the commander's intent.

Speaker 3:          00:46:38       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       Back to the book, I learned how to deflect the fear

Speaker 1:          00:46:47       after the first jolt of it, which came with the initial shock of coming under fire, I would force myself upright and attempt to read the situation before the skippers. Boys came crackling out of the walkie talkie. Once I had rammed myself into action, the fear subsided. It never completely went away though. So people ask this all the time, how are we going to overcome fear? And what did he do to overcome fear? He forced himself into action, didn't weight you. Start feeling that fear. Go, go, get up. Take a look at that situation. Try and analyze it in his own clock. What he made for himself. The timer that he made for himself was I'm to, I'm going to assess the situation before the boss calls me. So that's the time we put on himself that that forced him into action.

Speaker 3:          00:47:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:37       So we say this over and over again. You're afraid of something. Step into it. Take action. Don't wait back to the book. There was no deflecting the confusion. That's it. Came with every firefight, but we'll during patterns of noise and grotesque scenes exploded all around. Men screamed it. Rage and pain and fear. Swarms of bullets. Wind and splattered close by the mortars blasted her old flames and slices of steel and raised clouds of greasy black smoke. The sparing voices yelled corpsman and someone would surely call, what do we do, lieutenant?

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       In the turmoil, the officers and sergeants made themselves visible and we shouted, orders, watch your sector or move up or bear on me or CUC machine gun, 10 o'clock, 300 yards. We subdued the fear and showed the men that we were in command, and I've talked about this one before too. I talk all the time about, oh, you got to explain to everybody why you got explained to why we want everyone to be happy. You want people to form the plan with you and you want it to be their plan. Do you want them to take ownership? And then I also say that when you have a critical situation, you have to lead and that's what he's talking about right here. You have to lead and that's what they do. They would give these to orders, simple, clear, direct orders of what to do in this situation and show the men that they were in command

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       back to the book. We could have alleviated some of the confusion if our walkie talkies had worked at that as advertised. The handheld two way radios were supposed to transmit and receive up to a mile in distance. We found that they rarely functioned over a hundred yards, never over on even terrain. We carried them because they were all we had, but we had little faith in them. Instead, just like frontline military leadership throughout history, we relied on line of sight communications, arm and hand signals, and we sent runners back and forth in those first five days of combat. I learned to stay visible and I learned the value of a good runner. The North Koreans use to whistles and bugles for bag battlefield command more effective by far than our walkie talkies. And I'm a huge proponent of verbal commands and you know, I think life's told this story a bunch of times where I've told me you don't use, he's, he's trying to tell these guys what to do over the radio.

Speaker 1:          00:50:20       And I said, hey leaf, give him verbal commands and cause when guys are, when, when you're, when you're working, there's this weird, there's everyone's talking on the radio and it turns into white noise and so they're not responding. But when you give a verbal command in the seal teams in the military, you get trained that if I tell echo peel, right, you're going to, when you hear that your instinct and your training, it tells you to repeat that command. So you're gonna repeat it. The next person. When they hear it, they're going to repeat it. So everyone repeats the verbal command. So when you say verbal command, that's like the radio. It's like, yes, it's yelling and yelling and talking, but in all actuality it's a yelling. It's yelling. And so the, the radio's just sometimes, you know, and our, our radios are infinitely better than these radios and even while I was in the radio is made vast improvements in by the yet. By the time I retired, the radios were pretty damn good. But there are times if the radio is not working, you've got to go with the verbal commands and you, that's why you got to train. You've got to train for the verbal train without radio's a bunch. I always tell guys, yeah, take the rails off, make sure you can do it without the radios. It, how's it going to go with their communication? Net goes down. You got to have that backup communication plan all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:51:31       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       Now here we are in another, another firefight does is basically a massive book of firefights back to the book. The North Koreans disappeared into the deep ditch that ran along the other side of the road. They were moving in our direction and we dove for the, our own ditch. Grenades flew toward us, but landed wide. There was a machine gun up ahead. However, I couldn't locate it and it started and it started to fire down on us. I tossed two grenades in the ditch where the North Koreans were concealed and told burrows to have his men crawl up, call, crawl over a clump of boulders, 20 paces away. When the squad and its mortar we're in. I told Nicholas to go for it. We were crouched together, but nickel, but as Nichols turned to crawl away, a bullet speared his chest and through him backward against him, against me, his blood spattered, my dungarees. The boy made a terrible rattling sound and then was still his teenage face. Expressionless Burris watched horrified and I waved him back when he began to crawl towards us. Then I took a deep breath, pressed myself flat to the ground and crept rapidly away from the ditch. I left Nichols behind me where he had died.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       Harsh firefights and they, they, they wrap up this, they keep taking their objectives, their taken a lot of casualties. And this section here is after the fight is over, back to the book, we grew silent thinking of our families. I took the snapshots from the webbing inside my helmet and remembered their images one by one. Then I thought about the days, next mission and reviewed the fighting we had done that day. I tried to blank out the blood, screams men killing each other and dying the ground. Exploding. Burst of flame and stabbing tracers, hot smell of weapons at full automatic. The stench of guts and feces oozing from a dead marine and the shuttering. Fear.

Speaker 3:          00:54:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54:03       And they continue pushing. They're pushing north and they're on one of these patrols heading north. And we'll go back to the book. Through my binoculars, I saw bearded old Korean emerged from one of the huts. Papasan. We called these GRANDPA's who wore traditional garb of high black top hat and flowing white robes. The old fellow stood before his doorway watching, but wilderness has weapons laden. Marines passed through his village, crack went brain x car. Been only a few inches from me, and the old man fell to the ground. The tall black hat fell beside him. Got The bastard exclaimed [inaudible] his car bean was still up searching for another target. God Damn Fool. I yelled, astonished at the murderous act.

Speaker 3:          00:54:58       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       without fought. I slammed the butt of my own car. Been in the brain. It's ribs, brain IHC, scream with pain and went down to the ground writhing. I stood over him, poised to deliver another, but stroke got damn full. I screamed again. As right came from behind me and held my arms wing. It was with right and pulled my car being away. Hold it, lieutenant, right shouted in my ear. Hold it. What the hell happened? You see what he did? I screamed. I'll kill the deer. Torsky the corpsman was already kneeling beside Branick. He snapped a Syrette of morphine and Jab brandix arm. I endeavored to control myself. Deep breaths. Okay, Sergeant. I said, and right released is hold. The men were circling looking for me to break. They were silent. Goddammit. He shot that old man for nothing. I yelled through the pain brain at grown.

Speaker 1:          00:55:52       I thought he was a Goddamn goop. I thought he had a weapon. Any, have you seen what happened when could ask the men? No one responded. No witnesses, right? Said softly to me. Whatever happened, nobody saw anything. The realization hit me. No one except me. He had witnessed brain IX shooting that old man. But if someone had seen me hit Branick, I could be subject to a court martial for striking enlisted man. No witnesses, right? Said again. No one saw anything. This stays in the mortars. I heard someone say meaning, we're just going to keep this amongst ourselves. Yeah, someone else responded. This stays with us. There was a murmur of a cent. Shall I moved them out? Lieutenant, right? Asked.

Speaker 1:          00:56:40       Yeah, sergeant. I answered numbly moved them out. The morphine had not yet taken as his effect on break. He ground his teeth together to hold back cries of pain and he was scared. I bent over him and said, you know, you and I know what happened. Break and you're going to have to live with it. Break nodded his head. He said nothing but blinked his tear filled eyes and nodded his head, take care of him doc. Then I went to catch up with the mortar men. When I walked past the old man's hut, a circle of women and children surrounded the body crying, their sorrow and old woman caught my eye. I'm sorry. I said, although she wouldn't understand my words. We're all very sorry.

Speaker 3:          00:57:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:33       It's madness and again, you young military leaders out there, you've got to watch your people and you got to give them good commander's intent. They got to understand, they got to understand what's right and what's wrong and that's going to come from you.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       Now at this point in the book, and again, obviously I'm not reading the entire book, but you all should see, you can capture everything that's in between, but I'm jumping forward a little bit here. They get relieved by the army. They moved to the rear and they start getting word on what they're going to be doing. Back to the book under the glare of the lantern. Captain Wilcox spread a map on the hood and we jostled for a view maps. To this part of the world were scarce. This is the first one we had seen of the country beyond Hamhung. It was a topographic chart made by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea, the characters and language on the map where Japanese place names and legends had no meaning for us, but we could read the physical features and the contour lines. That terrain they showed was a military nightmare, roadblock and ambush territory. It was a country of high steep hills, deep valleys and sharp ridge lines. The lower elevations were largely forested. Settlements were sparse than the few roads twisted snake like through tight passes and along river beds at the northern extremity. The map at the end of 70 miles of a narrow corkscrew roadway was a meandering blue dot. That was the chosen reservoir.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       The Chinese have committed themselves to this war began captain Wilcox. They are in force. They are slicing through the Republic of North Korea army up north, like a hot knife through butter

Speaker 1:          00:59:36       up here. He used his band ed as a pointer to indicate the Chinese advance there people will, we will fight are the hundred and 24th division of the regular Chinese army. Definite and confirmed no matter what Tokyo wants to believe. So the military command was in Japan. They weren't Korea, the military was the military command. The generals were over in Tokyo. So he's saying no matter what, Tokyo wants to believe this is who we're fighting back to the book. They're tough. Well trained soldiers, 10,000 of them in all of their officers or combat experienced their very best.

Speaker 3:          01:00:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       After the briefing, I requested a word alone with Captain Wilcox to ask him if we could leave sergeant. Right. So sergeant right, you've heard his name mentioned a few times. He was the senior enlisted guy working directly for captain up for a Lieutenant Owen and it's, it's actually time for him to go home. I request a word alone with Captain Wilcox to ask him if we could leave sergeant right behind with the Co when the company moved out. Sergeant White has done a good job for us, but he's a short timer. Just waiting for paperwork I offered. Furthermore, sir, it's not good for the troops to see him with his morale down. I like to replace him with sergeant wing yet before we hit anything serious up ahead. Good idea. The captain said, except it's too late. Battalion says we mount out as we are. I'm not about to snarl up with them on a transfer detail right now. You tell sergeant right that, I'm sorry we can't do anything for him. I, I sir.

Speaker 1:          01:01:11       So that was a little opportunity for sergeant right to get out of there, but it didn't work out. And now just talking about kind of the morale of the troops back to the book, there was a great energy in the ranks, strong, healthy young men on the way to adventure. We cleaned and recleaned weapons and earnestly sharpened our bay and nets and fighting knives. The old salts retold stories of Japanese ferocity on the Pacific islands. Oh, there's remembered pitch battle with the Chinese bandits along with the pleasures of the north China occupation. The newly blooded veterans of last month's fight boasted to the replacements about their triumphs over the stubborn North Koreans. All hand speculated about whether the quality of the Chinese army would be equal to that of the North Koreans we had beaten down south. The fear that settles in the gut before combat had not yet surfaced on that Christmas morning with our clean shaven faces, clean dungarees squared away gear full canteens, full bellies and full issue of ammunition. The marines have Baker one seven feared no one. They start heading up north and one of the colonels is out. Colonel Litson Berg was there. He stood beside the road as we pass, nodding and smiling at his fighters. You're looking good marine. You're looking good marine. He kept saying and all the men waved and smiled back at him. The veterans from down South recognized all recognized old homer. They had seen him frequently up on the line, good hunting. Owen, good hunting young man. He called to me as I passed by

Speaker 1:          01:03:02       now. He has that opportunity now to maybe figure out a way out for right who had the opportunity to go away. While the men were loading up on Ammo. I talked to sergeant, right. No sense for you to go up. I told him your orders could come down from battalion anytime. Now stay here with the gunny. I appreciate that lieutenant responded sergeant. Right, but I do want to stay with the mortars if it's okay with you. That's what I'll do. I nodded. It's okay with me, sergeant. I just don't want you wasting time getting back to your kids. He said, stiffly, I'll stay with the section, sir. He didn't like my favoring him. He went back to the mortar men and told them to get ready to move out.

Speaker 3:          01:03:51       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:52       I'm telling you there's up, there's a certain bond. There's a certain bond and obviously in this case it's a bond that's even stronger than the bond he has with his kids is the bond that he knows is his brothers and arms are going into harm's way and he's going with them no matter what. So now we get a Baker one seven there. They're dug into some positions, they've moved and now they're dug into some positions. Back to the book in the brush below. Kaiser's platoon Chinese assault squads weighted in silence for the rockets and bugles that would signal them to attack. They're quilted uniforms kept them from shivering in the chill night. They already knew in detail how Kaiser's defenses were set up and the location of each forward hole and our weapons. During the late afternoon there, officers had watched Baker one seven dig in and they knew our line as well as we did under cover of darkness, the assault teams had crept soundlessly into their jump off positions within grenade range of the marine line. These soldiers were honored that they would be the first Chinese to attack American marines.

Speaker 1:          01:05:09       So these guys are staged and ready and here we go. The sound of a rocket ripping through the year close above us, jolted awake and brought me upright in our whole. Kelly was with me. A streak of fluorescent green crossed our line, followed by a red rocket from the other direction. Bugles blared and whistle shrilled down the suit. Dong Valley. The luminous hands of my watch says zero zero three zero Baker one seven was under attack. A sudden clamor erupted from Hank Kaiser side of the hill, the Erie chant Molleen die, Marlene die issuing from a chorus of Chinese voices. Then the crash of mortars, the boom who concussion of grenades and the sharp sputter of Burp guns. Seconds later there was the deeper sound of answering marine rifles and bars joined by the pounding of our machine guns and the explosion of marine grenades. The screams of wounded men soon added to the Malosh of sounds, along with profanities of rage in both languages.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       Fast forward a little bit, Chinese grenades exploded into the line and they're burp. Guns blazed the first wave of enemy soldiers rushed in and forward. Holes were buried in mounds of quilted uniforms, clubbing and stabbing. The Chinese searched up the third platoons. Hill behind them were left dead marines and wounded men who cried for the help of their Korman. And one of the things that they talk about in here is one of the tactics that the Chinese used is not everyone would even carry a weapon when they would attack. And if you were a guy that wasn't carrying a weapon, you would go attack. And as soon as someone got shot, you would take their weapon and carry on. So that's how, that's how many people they had. Number one, they also didn't have, you know, a weapon for every guy. Obviously they would have given them, but they also do, you know what, here's the plan.

Speaker 1:          01:07:13       But then think about how now light you are, you're not even carrying a weapon. It even carrying any ammunition or anything, you're just, you're just able to travel. And it's, it's hard for people that were never have never put on gear. It burdens you down so much, it just makes you slower and you get used to it. Sure. But when you, you can get as used to it as you want when you take it off, you feel like superman. Yeah. So these, these Koreans are f the, sorry. The Chinese are feeling like superman sneaking up into these positions all quiet. They also had real legit winter gear, at least this group, we're going to run into some groups that didn't have it, but they got these nice quilted, uh, uniforms and jackets. So that's they, they're just bringing it. They're bringing it.

Speaker 3:          01:07:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:07:56       Back to the book. Van Winkle ready the marines near him for the next Chinese attack, putting his people into recaptured fighting holes. The men stacked Chinese bodies in front of their holes for greater protection. Somebody yelled to van Winkle that his own shoulder was bleeding. The big sergeant felt his arm and found a Chinese had indeed passed through his shoulder.

Speaker 3:          01:08:19       He didn't care.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       Nobody near sorry. Nearby a man on the ground sobbing and shaking. My Buddy, my buddy Guccis shot his head clean off the orange glare of a Chinese grenade, illuminated the sobbing marine van Winkle crawled over to the man, grasp his arm saying, come on kid, come with me, you'll be all right. He rose from the ground and pulled the kid up with them.

Speaker 3:          01:08:48       Leadership

Speaker 1:          01:08:52       going forward a little bit. Archie van Winkle now found himself on the lower fringes of the Chinese attack. He ignored his wounded shoulder and fired his car, been one handed. He called for nearby remains marines to follow and launched his own attack into the flank of the Chinese who were moving up towards Kaiser. So you got a guys wounded just picking up young marines to getting them back in the game, firing his rifle with one hand and leading it up, leading an attack on the flank of the Chinese that are attacking his buddy higher up the hill. Gunny foster brought Sherman Richter's two machine guns from first platoon and they commenced to pounding down Kaiser slope, withering fire and exploding grenades. Now from both flanks and above stymied the Chinese attack. There was a series of whistle signals and the attackers fell back. They crawled over their dead but pulled their wounded with them as they backed down to the bottom of the hill and into the woods. They were supported by well directed, covering fire and they held good order as they withdrew. When the Chinese were fighting the off the hill, the marine cease their fire and both marines went silent. So the Chinese are also doing cover and move as they, even as they leave, as they withdraw,

Speaker 3:          01:10:15       they,

Speaker 1:          01:10:18       they're, they're in another little firefight and

Speaker 1:          01:10:23       oh, when's trying to quickly get his mortar up and they drop up, they drop a mortar round. The way a mortar works, you crop the mortar into the round, into the tube and it fires. If there's a misfire, it's really, it's a scary situation because, so if, if you drop the mortar into the tube and it doesn't come out, it doesn't shoot. Well now you've got a live round. Yeah, inside the mortar tube. So you have to literally pick up the tube and let gravity pull, like let the, let the mortar round slide out and you put your hands there to catch it. Yeah. Wait, why does it explode? It's not like a timer or nothing and no, it's like it's got a little detonator. Yeah, makes it shoe. And you've got little propellant, um, around the fin that makes no different ranges. But essentially you drop this thing in there and it's supposed to shoot out and it, when it doesn't, it's a scary because now you've got a live round inside your mortar tube and in order to get it out you, you, you just lift the mortar tube up when you've kind of pour it out into your hands.

Speaker 1:          01:11:23       So they get a dud round and there's a bunch of things that can call it cause a Doug round. Some of it can be, you know, a bad batch of ammunition, but that's what's going on here. They get a dud round, dud round, try another one. I told [inaudible] again, they're trying to get some mortars down range. So they're all in a panic situation and they're getting shot at, by the way, to dud round. Try another one. I told wing yet Kelly yelled for us to hurry up wing. It asked me to wait while he checked the tube for an obstruction. He grabbed a long stick, which he shoved into the tube. He pulled out a cleaning rag. The cause of our misfire, it was, it was careless that we had not checked the tube for an obstruction before we fired wing. It said, I won't tell anybody about this if you don't.

Speaker 1:          01:12:06       And he says, shut up. Damn it. I yelled at him and this is the reason I highlighted this cause he said, my fear showed itself in anger. And I think that's an important thing to think about. We all know, we all know when someone's getting mad that, that they're probably afraid, right? They're afraid of something that's, so we all see that. So if you're in a leadership position and you start losing your temper, it's, it's very visible to everybody that you're just scared. You might be also frustrated, but it's showing you what it's showing is that you're losing control of your emotions. And that's why we can't do that in leadership positions. Or you can't do that. That's why it's so much, infinitely better to remain calm. Yeah. When, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:12:52       flip frustration, like all the, so if you go into a situation where you're scared, you know, so a lot of times, especially if you're like an Alpha type person or a powerful person, you go and you feel that fear. It's basically the fear kind of is this feeling of, of weakness. So a natural tendency, this goes for pretty much everybody over natural. Yeah. It's the bounce back. So, so you, your natural way to invoke power is a car, like this anger, aggression type attitude. So when you know leaders or whatever, when they feel that fear, it's like, oh my powerless. It's like a subconscious thing. I'm powerless right now. So I gotta I gotta fight back. So comes angry in this point. And, and the thing is,

Speaker 1:          01:13:36       you just said, we all cumins know that instinctively. Yeah. So when you see a leader start to act like that, it becomes very clear that there's some emotion. There are some fear or some frustration, some anxiety, and that's going to spread. By the way, if I start panicking and start getting crazy jaqual you got to get this done. You know I'm scared. So now you're saying, wait, if chocolates scared, I'm scared too. And now we started having issues. So try and remain calm is the, is the basic principle. So they get done with that particular firefight and we got a little debrief here on it. Back to the book. Baker one seven lost more men that night. Then we had in the first five days of our campaign against the North Koreans, Captain Wilcox raised a hell when he heard Sergeant Dale and his men had been killed in their sleeping bags.

Speaker 1:          01:14:33       I didn't cover this section, but one of the, one of the small elements, they were in their sleeping bag, she got overrunning killed. So Captain Wilcox raised hell when he heard that Sargent Dale and his men had been killed in their sleeping bags. He made it standard operating procedure that the company stayed out of sleeping bags at night. And when we were on the line, tell your people that they can put their feet in the bags and loosened their boondockers. That's as far as they'd go. He told us from then on, no matter how cold it became, we slept outside of our bags and our boots only came off to change socks.

Speaker 2:          01:15:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:12       Now I didn't cover this part where this happens, but one of these guys, Sergeant Lany, he, he had, he had, he had taken a patrol to another area in one of the mortars and when he went, they got lost. And then when they got lost, they got overrun. And instead of fighting or doing anything, they'll just all ran. They just all ran in different directions. Now actually, all of them lift miracle, all of them lived. I shouldn't say they got overrun, but fighting broke out and instead of doing something organized, they just all took off. And so sergeant [inaudible], he's, they come back and they say, what? You know, oh, and says, hey, what happened out there? And they said, Sergeant Loney just, you know, basically said every man for himself and so he's about to get relieved of his command, which means you got fired in the military. Okay, back to the book. Sergeant Lany. I'm relieving you of your squad. He looked straight ahead, but his eyes moistened you let your men down last night you abandoned your responsibilities. It's only good luck that the squad wasn't wiped out. They could all be dead or taken prisoner. Lenny's voice trembled lieutenant. It was pitch black down there. We were lost. I use my best judgment. I can understand getting lost. I said, but you said no security. When the Chinese came through, you forgot to take you forgot your men to take care of yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:16:41       Lieutenant. I panicked. I admit that, but if you give me another chance, tears streamed down his cheeks and he looked to the ground. I can't give you another chance. Your men don't respect you. You report to the CP, they'll give you orders. From there, his head bowed. Sergeant Lonnie said, I'm sorry sir, I'm very sorry. I'm sorry to sergeant dismissed. Sergeant [inaudible] walked back to the section perimeter, gathered his gear than charged up hill to the CP. No one's said goodbye to him. I felt sorry for the man and I couldn't forget the Times that fear had taken me close to the edge of panic too. That's why I included that because, oh, when who was going through all kinds of fearful situations, he knows that he's been close to that edge, but he doesn't cross the line. He holds the line and that's the difference.

Speaker 2:          01:17:51       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:17:52       now they're pressing forward. Again. This entire book is them either pressing forward or you're going to see quickly that it becomes them trying to leave. Once they're surrounded back to the book. Baker one seven took point and marched for more than an hour without any sign of the Chinese, a single file of each of us on the side of the road. The men moving easily, so they're pushing forward and nothing's happening. All of a sudden don't like this one damn bit. Lieutenant Owen O'brian said to me, he was a reservist, combat experienced from the Pacific war. It is unnatural for the Guccis to let us move up this easy. We're walking into their trap. All I know is that Macarthur says the First Marine Division is going to go for the Yay Lou Yalu River.

Speaker 1:          01:18:47       I said, the Yalu River was North Korea's border with China, so they're good. They have been ordered. Hey, you're going to the Yalu River, and pretty much they're all saying at this point, they all kind of feel like it's a trap there, but they're walking. They're not getting any resistance. Back to the book, the troops were in good humor. They joked and laughed as we marched and made obscene comments about the things that were central to their lives. The Chow, the terrain, the enemy, the lack of women. Second thing I'm going to do when I see my wife again is take off my pack. Said one of the married reservists in the column. Oh yeah. Came the answer. By the time you see her again, you'll forget what the first thing was. Hell, it'll be so long before we get backstage side. You'll be too old for that stuff. Someone else joke to the married man who is nearly 30 years old.

Speaker 2:          01:19:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:19:43       I'm telling you guys keep up the good spirits and that is, that is, it's impossible. You know I got include this because I always had fun on deployments. I was saying this the other day, we laughed out loud like once a day in Iraq, laughed out loud hysterically at something so that for those of you that are civilians or have any comprehension of this kind of thing, guys that are in the military, they have a good time. Even in the worst situations they're having. We have fun. You have to and you know you can apply that to your job, to your job. When things get stressful, when things start getting hard as a leader, if you're just bearing more stress on everybody, it's not going to help. One of the best ways to alleviate stressors, to have some fun, and that's exactly what's going on here. The guys were on patrol.

Speaker 1:          01:20:34       Okay, we're not getting shot at. So guess what? Let's bust this guy's ass about missing his wife. No problem at alleviates some of that stress. You don't need to just bear down and create more stress on your people. I've been asked that. A couple people have asked me that on social media. Can you talk to, can you tell us about, you know, humor in as a leader? When do you use humor and like, yeah, absolutely. We always have fun and you know, there's obviously a time to be serious, but there's plenty of time when you're going to joke around and have fun and poke fun at each other all the time. Yeah. Do you ever run into like situations where you know, some people they just joke more than other funeral and then there's the, you know, the opposite guys joke class. You ever run into a situation where you are serious and then someone's like trying to make jokes, you know, and, and it does get annoying or in the way of, I don't know that people when, when I'm serious, I don't get a lot of jokesters and the gate.

Speaker 1:          01:21:35       I, I've, I've just, I'm saying most of the time when I'm, when I mean, and I think, I think there's a pretty, I mean maybe that happens in, in, you know, in a school setting, you know, or, or I guess in a business setting it could happen, but if you've got to, if you've got a good team that works a lot together, people, no, it's not, you know, and I, and once you tell a joke or you crack a wisecrack and nobody laughs and you just get a look from people going, hey man, shut up. That's it. You know? So maybe I've, maybe that's happened to me a dozen times in my career where somebody said something, it's, you know, everyone just said, okay, well you know, enough at area, everybody feels it. Yeah. I would imagine to working that close with important tasks like that important people are pretty going to be pretty much in tune with the comedy at dynamic.

Speaker 1:          01:22:22       Exactly. Now, I had a guy that I worked with when I was the admiral's aid and he, he and I, he was older than me. He was actually retired captain. He's one of my favorite guys, but I was the admiral's aid. So I was a young, you know, young lieutenant, and he was a retired captain and we would go back and forth all day long, regardless of what the situation was. We would never say a serious thing to each other the entire day for months on end, nothing. Everything was a sarcastic kind of comment through each other. And it made a pretty, a pretty miserable job of being the animals. Ate is not a fun job. It made it like we just had a good time. So, so once again, we're even in a situation where, hey, I'm in a uniform, an office all day from six o'clock in the morning until seven o'clock at night, every day, day on day, you know, in the military and in the civilian world, when you come back from a trip from somewhere, they're like, oh, you, oh, you were on a trip.

Speaker 1:          01:23:16       Hey, you know, don't come in tomorrow morning. You know, you can come in a little bit late because you got back at midnight. You heard of your animals. I had no, you're coming. You're coming in at six. That's the way it is. There's no, there's no, Oh, you haven't seen your family in two weeks, so that's cool. Could we will see you at six o'clock in the morning tomorrow. Oh, you want to take your daughter to school? No, not happening. So it's like that. And yet I had this one guy that I work with who we, we just, we just never said anything series to each other and always kept it light and fond and that's, that was pretty awesome. Was that D, I mean, thinking back, do you think that that was on purpose or did it just kind of shake itself out? Like it just, you could sell out, you know, we just said phony.

Speaker 1:          01:23:52       Uh, the way our relationship was was we were just two guys that like to give each other a hard time about stuff and set each other up for stuff and just, just, yeah, we both knew. I mean, he was under a stressful job as well, you know, he's got, he's got a lot of pressure on him and so what are we going to do? Sit there and be miserable all day. No. You know what, we're going to have a good time. Even in this, you know, fairly miserable administrative scenario that we're living in a good time with it because some people do it on purpose where it's like, oh Dang, things are getting real tents here for work or whatever. And then they'll throw in jokes. They're going to be on that fine line between, okay, you're right now things are tense. Why'd you say that joke?

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       That's inappropriate. And the other side, which is like it, it helps, you know saying like in like this guy and I, we would be even in the really stressful situation where no one else was joking. I might like, you know, shoot him a look across the room and roll my eyes at him bugging. You didn't see this coming digit tough guy and we would just be laughing. So even in they're really stressful stuff we would, we would lighten it up. But that's because, you know, that's the first time was that we had, yeah. All right. Speaking of not no joke whatsoever. Back to the book, major tie. The operations officer told us that there were increasing reports of heavy enemy concentrations on all sides of the battalion. However, General Macarthur himself was expressing inpatients with a slow pace made by the first marine division and its progress toward the Chinese border.

Speaker 1:          01:25:21       The army was trying to light a fire under General Smith, the division commander. So you got the marines are saying, hey look, it looks like we're starting to get surrounded here and talks a little bit about this in the book. The marines were kind of slow rolling. They weren't, they weren't making any great effort to go as fast as they could because they felt like they were going to be trapped. So they weren't trying to move as fast as they could. And Macarthur's general Carthy in Tokyo by the way, saying, hey, hurry up. Come on Marines. You know, army is pushing up there real quick. What's wrong with you guys? But they're starting to get Intel reports that they're being surrounded. And Oh by the way, uh, Lieutenant Lee, who I talked about earlier, the real by the book guy, he, he actually got wounded and when he got wounded taking the hospital, he went on, he went on. He would absent without leave. Awol. You went AWOL from the hospital to get back to the line. Oh Dad. Yeah. He's, oh no, I'm fine. My arm can't move it. Send a slang. Doesn't matter. I'm going to fight. And speaking of Lee, talking about Lees, Lees platoon here, when they weren't on patrol, Lee put as men through a rigorous training program of small unit tactics. They maneuvered all over the nearby hills and they bitched at some extra work.

Speaker 3:          01:26:37       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:26:38       Lee paid little heed to the grumbling. Soon we will meet the enemy. He predicted to his men, we will be ready. So Lee's a hard ass and his guys, everyone else is doing it. You know, they're, they're, they're moving up north and it was an easy day patrol. Cause remember the Chinese aren't pushing hard against them right now. So what does he do at night? Oh guys, we're going to go do some work. We're going to do some tactical drills.

Speaker 3:          01:26:57       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:27:00       Back to the book. He was an article of faith with Lee that combat leadership came from the front. In the attack. He positioned himself with the most advanced squad just behind the point. He wore a bright fluorescent pink vest fashion of cloth panels that he obtained from the tactical air team. The intended purpose of the brilliantly colored panels was to mark the Ford extent of our lines for supporting aircraft. Lee wore his vessel. That is men could locate him quickly during a firefight. He still had a sling on his wounded right arm and he carried his car being in his left hand. He fired from the hip using it to shoot tracers that marked sectors.

Speaker 3:          01:27:43       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:27:43       so Lee is just, I mean a whole nother level, whole nother level. Chu [inaudible], that's his full name to [inaudible]. Now we get into a situation the Chinese were dug in above Lee. They had a machine gun and a line of rifles, more formal than their usual defensive formations. They were expertly deployed below the crest and their automatic weapons fire, short discipline bursts, tracers, street and bullets. And shrapnel swept down the stroke slope. It took me some time to locate the machine gun that was giving the most trouble. When he found that he fired one handed to put a tracer on it, his squads moved into skirmish lines and the NCO sent their own tracers to mark for their sectors. The bar and grill and Michelle and rifles followed sending a great volume of fire up the slope with the Chinese. We waved to me to let me know the mortar was ready. I aim to trace her toward the machine gun and pump my arm four times the signal for 400 yards. I saw around leave the tube and following its path that disappeared over the ridge line wing. It realized that he was too long and without need for my correction. He came up a turn, so he's adjusting the where their where their mortar rounds hitting his own. His second round was close and I waved him to fire. For effect,

Speaker 1:          01:29:06       we seldom wasted ammo bracketing a target. AMMO carried up the hills was too valuable to be wasted on the niceties. The enemy guns slackened as WIC as wing it pounded them. Lee's squad moved upward responding to the NCO signals with short bounds fire team by fire team, five 10 yards at a dash, then to ground bearing their enemy on the bearing fire on the enemy as the next fire team winning closer cover move. It's happening again. The mortars are covering for them and then each individual a fire team is covering for each other. It was the classic marine rifle tactic that Lee had drilled into his platoon. During this extra training, sessions on marine went down and ride on the ground. The platoons, Corman Bill Davis dashed low across the slope and crashed at the wounded man side. Another marine fell and didn't move again. His buddy stabbed the dead man's rifle into the earth by its bay. A Net then continued forward. The Chinese found it difficult to defend against Lee's energetic tactics are coordinated. Mortar and machine gun fire kept them pinned to the ground. They were no longer able to apply aimed fire and their effectiveness Dovid diminished as our riflemen pushed closer in on them. Cover move it. By the way. There's a reason why when I wrote down the the four laws of combat, the number one rule is covering move. This is why.

Speaker 3:          01:30:30       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:30:30       lease sent a squad quality crawling forward into grenade lane range. I signaled to wing it to cease fire and the mortar stopped exploding along the Ford crest of the hill. The Chinese soldiers heave the barrage of their potato masher concussion grenades down the slope. The Marines through or responding volley are grenades were more powerful. Filling the air with bits of hot flying steel. Both sides, dove for holds. Another volume was thrown. Lee Ran forward waiving the car, being over his head and calling for his marines to follow. They search for the top screaming. They're gung Ho and rebel yells. The Chinese withdrew. They pulled their wounded away, but left their dead on the slope. Lee pushed his men over the ridge line where they prepared to defend against a counter attack. Lou Puccini stood beside Lee, his bar at the ready Lupa cine had appointed himself. Lee's body guard sergeant bond around the platoon guide rifled through the pockets of the dead Chinese gathering material. For our intelligence people. I sent Kelly for a detail of the ammo carriers to bear the casualties. Bill Davis had two wounded men doped up with morphine and out of pain, and there was one marine dead already covered by his Poncho when he was certain that the Chinese would not counter attack. Lee ordered us off the hill and if patrol on the return march to the company perimeter, no one complained about lieutenant Lee's excessive training methods.

Speaker 1:          01:32:04       He walked along the column and thank the men for their good work.

Speaker 2:          01:32:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:32:09       I wondered to myself how many firefights Lee would survive standing at the front of his troops clad in that brilliant pink vest.

Speaker 2:          01:32:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:32:20       so the excessive trading, everyone's complaining when they're training and then you get into a firefight and everyone's thankful that they had good discipline leadership.

Speaker 2:          01:32:29       No.

Speaker 1:          01:32:35       Hmm. A little bit more if we now this point again, there's, they're continuing to get pressed by the Chinese back to the book. More Chinese fired, broken out far too are right in front of Lee's in front of Lee's line. They fired from a sharp short hill that rose from the meadow. We wheeled one of his rifles, squads to face the rise and maneuvered them forward. Burris, his gun was with we and he traversed the face of the hill with a cheese before the squad moved up. So cheese is high, explosive mortars and Burns is is one of the mortar man and he's covering for the movement of Lee as they're pushing up. The Chinese ceased, fired, withdrew quickly. A familiar tactic. We stayed with the main body of his platoon and sent a fire team up to reconnoiter the top. When they reached the top of the rise, the four men walked along the ridge and search of the vanished enemy looking up.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       Lisa has men silhouetted against the skyline and yelled for them to get down. There were perfectly outlined targets. The Chinese saw them too and already had the ridge line registered for their mortars, their first rounds, blue a marine to pieces. The next barrage claim two more. The fourth man dough from the Ridge and leaped, rolled and stumbled down the hill. He came to a halt at the feet of Lieutenant Lee Lee. It seen three of his men needlessly killed and he stood in silent fury. It's good hand grip. This car been so tight that his knuckles and went white, stupid. He has through his clenched teeth, stupid, stupid over and over again, stupid. He turned to gene O'Brien, his platoon sergeant. See to it that this never happens again. Sergeant, you tell the men, if you, if I see another marine on the skyline, I will shoot him myself. We tend at least strode off to be by himself until his fury and frustration subsided. So you got guys making big mistakes and for those either don't understand what happened. When you stand up on a ridge line, you're completely obvious. It's very clear and Lee's watching this happen and sees that as guys were a ripe target.

Speaker 2:          01:34:49       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:34:49       He's yelling at him, but it's too late and the mortars hit.

Speaker 2:          01:34:52       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:34:54       Now we get the company here a little bit for now. The company is actually pinned down. The company's pinned down back to the book. When the skipper had artillery fire control on the radio, he called in the coordinates, coordinates for a registration round. The battery of 105 millimeter howitzers that supported was dug in a mile and a half away. So in a mile and a half away you got these hundred and five millimeter howitzers big giant cannons. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:35:28       Less than a minute later. And, and you got the company commander that's calling in calling in to to tell them where to shoot. These cause a mild, obviously you can't see there's no satellite back then you can't see. So you're just going off of bearing and distance back to the book. Less than a minute later we heard the heavy ripping sound or the first round cutting the air over our heads. It landed a hundred yards of fronted in front of where Lee, the captain and I stood, stabs of flame flame like lightening from a black cloud, leaped off the ground and we felt the earth tremble from the explosion. Close God to close. Shout at the skipper, then into the Mikey said, add three zero zero repeat ad three zero zero. So he's telling them that means add, it means shoot 300 meters further. The next round landed further away and we barely saw the stabs of flame.

Speaker 1:          01:36:22       It was where the skipper wanted it. The enemy machine gun fire, it stopped. The Chinese knew what would be coming at them. Repeat Range, give me concentration. Fire three volleys on my command. The concentration fire would saturate the area where the Chinese were concealed. The captain waited to give the order to fire until sergeant king had positioned the covering squad in front of us. Fire 20 seconds later, the first rounds of the barrage landed less than 50 yards away. Short rounds, meaning that the rounds didn't go as far as they were supposed to. We go for the deck. All of us evenly. The following rounds dropped among the front of the squad. That first book tune had position to cover the company. Withdrawal screams from our own men. Mud and flame and crashing funder. The skipper yelled into the radio, cease fire, cease fire, short rounds, short rounds, friendly fire.

Speaker 1:          01:37:27       The worst thing that can happen in combat are dismal day turned to horror, cries and moons and agonized screams. Pierce, the black smoke that drifted over the broken ground. Doc Mickens and Joe King. We're already working among the wounded and mangled and dead marines. Bill Davis and ed topple the other platoon. Korman sprinted across the field to help Captain Wilcox. He yelled into the radio as the next line of shelled has exploded now away from us farther to our front. They'd been in the air before the gunners could comply with the order to cease fire. They did us no further damage, but there noise added to the hellish scene. I arose, shaken and not sure what to do. I saw sergeant right at the edge of the field and called for him to bring the ammo carriers forward. We would use them to carry the casualties away. Joker Saba had already brought the company headquarters people to lend a hand with the grizzly work. We had four more dead and three wounded. Casaba went to the skipper and said that we should get the company out of this place and back down the road.

Speaker 1:          01:38:42       Captain shook his head a few times to clear it at thought about Joe's suggestion for several seconds. Then he got Kaiser Lee on the walkie talkies and told them to prepare their platoons to move back. He told me to walk a screen of hs 200 yards out to discourage any Chinese from following us. When I reported to him that the mortars were ready for the fire mission, I thought I saw tears coming down his face. Although it could have been the drizzling rain, eight dead marines for the day, more wounded and nothing accomplished. The rain and sleet turned to snow wet, sticky stuff that coded the ponchos covering the dead men. The troop struggled down a wet, slippery trail to the road burying the dead and wounded. They were soaked through and spoke no words except to blast FIM. The God damn fools who sent us into this miserable, wet, cold country friendly fire blue on blue.

Speaker 3:          01:39:54       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:39:56       think about it. Try and keep it in the front of your head. When you're in combat situations, try and keep it in the front of your head. Try and keep it as a real possibility. It's not impossible to have it happen

Speaker 1:          01:40:12       in the end. It's to kind of like in fighting. When they say it's the, it's the, it's the, it's the punch that you didn't see that that's the one that's going to knock you out. It's the same thing in, in, in this situation, if you could see that a blue on blue is going to take place, you would stop it. Yeah. You can't see it. It's not, it's something that's going to be unexpected. That's why it happens. It happens because it's unexpected and this one you, there's a lot of things that can happen when she started bringing a artillery in. There's a bunch of variables there that are really hard to control, but it is obviously, it's a nightmare. It's, it's, it's a nightmare in, I was having this conversation with one of my seal buddies the other day. That's why you train hard. That's why you prepare for it. That's why you create chaos in confusion inside of your training so that you actually force blue on blue force blue on blue is to happen. You forced these fratricide situations to happen so that they happen in training so that they don't happen on the battlefield.

Speaker 3:          01:41:23       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:41:24       It, it it, it's, you know, same thing with the police department. Police Department sometimes has, has blue on blue train hard set up the crazy scenarios make people do unexpected things.

Speaker 3:          01:41:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:41:39       All right. They come down from that scenario and they get a day arrest. You might think, hey, you know, you took eight, eight killed and multiple more wounded. I will give you some time off. They got time off one day, one day arrest, and then they're back on the march back to the book, the column March North in a cold swirling wind that swept the road clear of snow. We put it on the ponchos again to help ward off the wind. They soon fro stiff at crackled as we walked in. If you notice as they left that other situation, the rain turned to sleep in the snow. So that's like in one hour. Winter was here and so now you're going to eat. Now you're going to start hearing about the cold big time. The men weren't a foul temper. What kind of stupid bastards we got running this goddamn war came from the column. Don't worry about them guys running this goddamn war. They're sitting by a stove someplace sticking pins in their maps. Yeah, and they'll get their pick of cold weather gear before they send us, send it up to us. Poor suckers guy in the battalion mess line said them rear echelon bastards are already wearing big fur coats and winter issue. Boat boots. That's okay. We'll get the stuff next spring. Sure. What's left of it by the time it gets to us, we'll be needing jungle gear because these guys are just letting out their frustration and anger.

Speaker 1:          01:43:04       The worst suffering that day came from our feet. We only had thin cotton socks under the boondockers. A little protection from the cold, especially as they were still damp under our leggings. We stomped the way the freezing toes, the pain of the freezing toes and kept the blood circulating. There were complaints of numbness. Some meant felt as if they had tables in their socks. We didn't know about frostbite.

Speaker 3:          01:43:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:37       If you don't know what boondockers are there, your basic like the most basic form of a boot, leather, rubber soul. That's it. That's what I, that's what boondockers or they got cotton socks. Now they get some new gear and then one of the pieces that they get is called shoe packs. Go into the book. Shoe packs would change the way we walked and bring us the crippling scourge of frostbite. They were big and cumbersome twice the weight of our boondockers, they had thick molded rubber bottoms with heavily cleated souls. The tops from the ankle up to the shin. We're made of stiff leather. That lace tightly shoe packs were clumsy for climbing, climbing and slippery on the ice. The worst thing about them, however, was that they were laced when they were laced up. No air could circulate on a steep climb or an a long march. Our feet would sweat, no matter how cold it was when we stopped moving and the cold said in the sweat soaked felt inserts and socks would freeze. Long stretches of wet frozen feet spelled frostbite.

Speaker 1:          01:44:53       I Dunno if you remember this from the last one we did, but, and I didn't include it, but one of the videos that they showed later to the co two, the, uh, soldiers and marines that were going over to Korea was to warn them of frostbite. And it was the doctors with the frostbitten feet and they weren't surgically removing the toes. They were just like, break them off like Eh, cause they were just frozen dead toes and they would just break it. That's the video they showed them. Hey, keep your feet dry. But it was these poorly designed shoes was one of the problems that they try or we make these guys, these super warm boots doesn't, it's not that easy. It's not that easy. You make, I'm so warm and so waterproof. No air escapes from him. Now you've got sweaty feet. Now your feet are going to freeze.

Speaker 1:          01:45:42       Now we get this. Uh, one of the replacements that comes in is a guy named woody Taylor. You're going to hear it a little bit about him and there's a little fire fight that takes place. And Captain Wilcox, who's the company commander maneuvers. Some of woody Taylor's guys. He says, Hey, you guys go check that out over there. Mm, woody Taylor doesn't like it. Those are my men. Says Woody Taylor, so here we go. Captain Wilcox Taylor called loudly, loudly to the skipper. If you don't I, I've used the word skipper a bunch. I should have explained what it is. Skipper means the commanding officer of the company, just just, just like the skipper of a ship. Captain Wilcox Taylor called loudly to the skipper. He was red faced and out of breath from the run up the column. That's a squad from my platoon. You sent over there on the flank.

Speaker 1:          01:46:28       Yeah, Lieutenant. I saw a few bandits over there. Captain, those are my men. Taylor interrupted my platoon moves on my orders. Captain Wilcox glared at Lieutenant Taylor. I'd seen that cold book many times before when it had been leveled on me. I figured that woody Taylor would not be long with Baker one seven our new lieutenant and the captain stared at each other. Would he calm down a notch, sir? He said, I'd much appreciate it if you put any orders to my men threw me. Colonel Davis sent me up here to run this platoon. That's what I reckon to do. Tailoring the skipper war eyeball to eyeball and the skipper realize that he had indeed violated the chain of command. Yup. Lieutenant. He said, you're right. That's your platoon and I guess we understand each other. I guess we do. Captain said Woody Taylor. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:47:28       Then carry on. The skipper dismissed his new platoon leader. We figured woody Taylor was going to have, what's going to be one hell of a fighter. He was the last replacement officer to come to Baker one sever seven and he was with us to stay so little stand off, but there's a lot of little things that go on there. Right? Number one, Taylor was too aggressive out of the gate, you know, hey, those are my guys. Yeah. That was too aggressive. He was able to catch himself from back off and say, hey sir, I really appreciate it. If he could come with that attitude from the beginning, he would have, he would have had a better chance of making what he wanted to have happen with no risk. Cause there was a risk here. There was a risk here that Captain Wilson costumes, you say, shut up might be your platoon.

Speaker 1:          01:48:13       It's my, it's my company. Don't talk to me about this again. He could've said that, but also he's a good leader that when got pressed on this, he said, well let me, let me, let me detach. Instead of getting mad, he was getting mad. He detached. He said, okay, wait a second. What's going on here? This young lieutenant that's in charge of the tune, I just ordered this guys around without telling him. Now he's mad about it. Does that make sense? Yes it does. He's calmed down. He's, he's, he's talking to me in a better tone now. He's just asking me. He that he's appreciated. I can accept that. I was a little outlined. Cool. Yup. You got it. And they were able to solve that problem. So just a little little dynamics, some dynamics out on the battlefield going on.

Speaker 1:          01:48:57       More firefights happen, more madness going on. They get through the next situation and now we have Colonel Davis. Again, this is the medal of honor winner. Who's who's in charge here? Back to the book, Colonel Davis came up to Baker one seven to inform us that we were moving out again tomorrow morning. We would advance up the west side of the chosen reservoir. Our objective was the town of you, dom knee, 14 miles away. This was not a patrol. Our battalion commander told us it was an attack and we should expect the fighting to get serious. Right. So they haven't had any serious fighting, right? Oh No, wait. Yes they have, but expected to get more serious. When he finished briefing the officer's Colonel Davis asked me to bring sergeant right to him. The hardship transfer order had finally come through and our colonel wanted to say goodbye personally to a good marine NCO.

Speaker 1:          01:49:52       It was a great moment for sergeant. Right. All the company officers were there and the colonel expressed his appreciation and best wishes to my departing sergeant, Captain Wilcox and lieutenants added their own well dones. Sergeant [inaudible] had done a good job of whipping the mortar section into shape and keeping them squared away. The mortars had a for farewell party for their sergeant who had been up with them since the first day at Camp Pendleton. The rifle platoon Corman came by Mickens and Davis and topple each bringing a canteen of sick bay alcohol. The skipper and joker Saba joined us in for a few tastes toast when he was ready to leave weapon and gear all squared away like a proud, like a parade ground marine sergeant right approached me. His eyes glistened probably mine did too, sir. I think we did some good with these people. I want to thank you for giving me a chance to serve in your outfit. Thank you surgeon, right? You're a four five marine NCO. God bless you and your family sergeant, right. Snap the saluted me and strode off. I would never see him again and I would miss him very much to sergeant. Sergeant right headed home,

Speaker 1:          01:51:06       our guests. It was his time and he'd pushed on when, when he could have gone home a lot earlier, but he pushed on and now they're getting ready to make this next move and it, and he has his orders now in hand in a orders or orders. So we hit up back to the book. The weather turned ugly again as we formed up to reserve resume the attack to the north, a bitter cold wind greeted us, filled with a stinging, gritty snow. It was my birthday. After the troops were squared away, I crouched in the ditch alongside the road and took some time to go through my snapshots. I thought a Dorothy teaching the happy birthday song to the babies and how they would try and sing it. I saw their little pink cheeks and blue eyes and Dorothy's golden hair, rough way for him to spend his birthday. And as you sit here today, wherever you're listening to this, know that somewhere in the world there's an American servicemen that's out there celebrating their birthday in a similar manner. I guarantee it away from his family and his loved ones.

Speaker 1:          01:52:22       What else does he get out for his birthday? He gets some enemy activity. Back to the book. The enemy fire became heavy, about 50 Chinese were dug in against us and they were serious about defending this place. Lee took his platoon off the road to extend our firing line. Captain Wilcox came forward with Garcia and the big radio and set up in the ditch just behind I marvel. That is easy. Ambling gait during firefights, he always stood up straight. It's like JP, the static of the SCR 300 radio out at added to the pounding of our own machine. Guns and bars. Rifles cracked Johnson's mortar thumped out. Eight gs and enemy bullets zing through the year and spun off chips of boulders. Soon came the urgent cries. Korman Oh God. Corpsman and the fear came as it did to me on the onset of every fight. The corpsman cries the booming explosions and the wine of bullets. Blood trenched Parker's dear God, not this time please. Platoon sergeant king from Taylor's platoon crouched among some large boulders above me. He shouted down that there was a machine gun near the spike of rocks that mark the Chinese main position. I willed myself to climb up and get a better look. The fears submerged and the cold was forgotten.

Speaker 1:          01:53:51       Overcome that fear. Take action.

Speaker 2:          01:53:55       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:53:55       now they continue in this little fire fight and then finally we get enough talked about them before we get some air support's marine corps support. We've got some marines on the ground that are pilots. What we now call Anglico. The marines are on the ground. These are fighter pilots that go out and do infantry work and call for fire. And so here we go. Back to the book, Bob Wilson brought in the course errors that were on station to cover our advance. I called down to burst to laid down around of white phosphorous to mark the Chinese guns and the flyers came in on the column of white smoke. They flew in low, barely above, above us. They're great racketing noise overpowered all other sounds as they flashed by on the first pass, as they fired the machine guns and cannons. These had a little effect.

Speaker 1:          01:54:41       The Chinese were dug in to, well, they followed with a napalm run, a spectacular, a spectacle of awesome and terrible beauty. The pod slid from the plains, tumbled across the ground that exploded. Black smoke, billowed and red flame leaped against the white snow and seconds later we felt the blast of heat that consume the ground 200 yards away. Chinese soldiers were a flame running about and frenzied circles. They threw themselves flailing into the snow. There was sudden silence. The Chinese ceased fire and our own weapons were quiet. We were stoned by the power of that close end flaming strike.

Speaker 2:          01:55:26       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:55:27       200 yards away. That's not a big distance. That might seem like a big distance. That is not a big distance when you're in an airplane and you're coming down to drop napalm and kill a bunch of people. So that's a tiny distance. Marine Corps pilots just getting after it. It's called danger close by the way. So if you're going to call in an airstrike that's close to your positions, you have to say on the radio, you say danger close, meaning look, I know it's close by and you got to do it right, right

Speaker 1:          01:55:59       go. And so they, they, they sniffle out that one. But guess what? The, the Chinese are far from done back to the book. The Chinese showed that they would not hibernate from the war because of the cold weather. The farther we advanced, the stiffer was there resistance. The hills continued to grow steeper and each climb we made encumbered with the heavy clothing became its own or deal. Most of our fights were platoon sized Kaiser or Lee or tailor maneuvering up a Slippy slippery snow covered slope to dislodge a force of Chinese who fired at us down the road. So as they're moving down this road, they're just having to go into the high ground all the time and take out the Chinese.

Speaker 1:          01:56:41       Here's a, here's a cool little anecdotal story. They get pinned down and Colonel Davis is there and they're trying to figure out what to do. I'm going to the book. Colonel Davis was at the head of our column with Captain Wilcox. When the Chinese opened up from across the Chaz. I'm 300 yards away. The skipper called me upfront. Can you knock out those guns? Captain Wilcox asked, he in the kernel crouched their acknowledgement of machine gun slugs that torn to the slope above our heads. Yes sir. I answered crouching alongside my two commanders. So there's a machine gun up on the hill and they can't get it with their guns, but they want him to get his, his mortar tubes up there and then drop mortar rounds on the, on the machine gun position. So he yells out to his runner. So he's runners, just the guy that spreads word.

Speaker 1:          01:57:29       He runs out to his, his runner Kelly bring up Johnson's gone. I commanded Hugo was with, uh, Kaiser's platoon leading the column that day. They were just behind the bent. I Sir snapped my runner in a way to impress the colonel. Colonel Davis and Captain Wilcox continued to scan the opposite slope. 11 o'clock said the kernel indicating slight movement and an outcropping of bowl of boulders. Yes, sir. I have it. I told my carnal as I located the enemy machine gun through my own binoculars and another one at 10 o'clock, 50 yards higher, sir. Good eyes. Lieutenant said Colonel Davis, there was a sudden commotion behind us, the sound of marine singing as they doubled timed up the road, Kelly was leading the mortar men forward and he had them sounding cadence with his parody of an army marching song, song, marching songs sound off. How can a mortar man survive following a man who's six foot five sound off puts your rifles and machine guns away. The 60 mortars are all in the way. Sound off, sound off? So they're in a firefight, they're pin down and these guys come running up the road singing cadence. And by the way, I forgot to mention this, that Owen is six foot five. So he, that's who they're talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:58:45       There was no ditch. So Hugo could not take cover from enemy fire while setting up his gun. He and Dean Westburg spread the bi-pod on the rear of the rear edge of the flat open road surface. I stood behind the gun as they work quickly, the volume of bullets increased. 11 o'clock you go. I said, give me three five zero. I fired a tracer from my shoulder. Westburg had a mortar round ready? You go with his sharp shooters. I spotted the target and said three five Oh, plus a hair. He laid the tube in the direction of the machine gun and cranked is elevation fire. He said to Westburg, the round thumped out and we followed its arc, ignoring the Chinese bullets that were bouncing off the frozen surface of the road and the slope behind us. The first round was a direct hit. God bless you. You Go. Johnson, captain will. Wilcox called out for the platoon to continue the march. Colonel Davis approached the gun. He had a big smile. You tell your men they're shooting is right on lieutenant. He said he glanced at our choir director, Kelly and added, but tell them that they're singing is way off key.

Speaker 1:          01:59:55       Like I said, even having a good time in madness of firefights. The cold is getting brutal. Back to the book we seldom removed are knitted gloves that we wore under the canvas. Mittens. Bare fingers we found froze to metal. They froze to weapons. Bayonets buckles, whatever we touched. The cold, forced a corpsman to change their way of doing business. With the first sounds of a firefight, they would take several Seretse of morphine and put them into their mouths. This kept the morphine liquid until the Seretse word jabbed into the wounded mans flesh to relieve his pain. The corpsman were the only ones who worked with bare hands in the severe cold and they found a way to keep their fingers nimble while attending two wounded man, the heat of the man's blood did the trick or his guts as they were stuffed back into his belly freezing cold back to the book. Despite our efforts to keep the men and clean dry socks, we were losing the fight against frostbite, which resulted from damp, cold feet. Med would complain of pains or numbness in their feet and when they limped badly, we sent them to battalion aid station. Many never return. Some waited too long to turn themselves in and by the time the doctor saw them, their toes had become purplish black. It had to be amputated

Speaker 1:          02:01:29       because the ground was frozen hard digging, good fighting halls was nearly impossible. Digging in became a matter of chipping a shallow in the unyielding earth beneath the snow than barricading it with rocks or tree bridges.

Speaker 2:          02:01:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:01:46       If any dead Chinese were found on the hill, we added they're stiff corpses to the barricades.

Speaker 2:          02:01:53       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:01:54       to make level places for their guns. The mortar men took turns at the concrete like dirt within trenching tools and combat knives

Speaker 2:          02:02:06       and

Speaker 1:          02:02:08       they're continuing in this freezing cold. They get to a point where there

Speaker 1:          02:02:18       in sort of an open area, and we'll go to the book that Chinese maneuvered down from the ridge lines all around us. They ran across the snow in squad columns. Then foreign firing lines among the boulders or prone in the snow. Chinese mortars began to fall on us in the CP, which was 50 yards or oss and the CPU, which was 50 yards behind us, around, exploded close by and lifted me off the ground. I was dazed for a while and went full awareness returned. Kelly had me by the arm leading me toward the CP. Where are we going to Kelly? I didn't understand why we were heading away from the line. Get a corpsman to look at you. I thought you were gone or back there. He pointed to my park of flapping around my knees. It adds shrapnel holes in it. They don't get closer than that to tearing your balls off.

Speaker 1:          02:03:08       It's a good thing you got me around lieutenant. The corpsman at the CP was far too busy with the seriously wounded to tend to my mild concussion, the casualties laying blanket covered rose, doc, Torsky, Davis and topple. Those are the corpsman went from one to the other. They jabbed morphine, slowed bleeding, cleaned out holes, blasted in Flash, patched them and wrap them as best they could. The corpsman had their mouth filled with mouth filled with Seretse of morphine and their bare hands were bloody. When they worked with the WWE, they worked with enemy mortars, exploding bullets, stabbing the air two feet above them. Weak, frightened voices called for their help. Doc Mickens from first platoon took some shrapnel, then a 25 that a slug in the leg where he was patching the wounded in action on woody Taylor's line. This stretcher bearers, drag Mickens to the CP and laid him in the line of casualties next to him damning the Chinese and his Arkansas drawl was sergeant king who had been blasted by grenades and hit by a burp gun. Paul Renden on machine gunner with the platoon lay there to a leg shot up the first platoons rapid. The first platoon was being rapidly depleted, depleted and was having a hell of a fight holding their end of the perimeter.

Speaker 1:          02:04:34       So these guys were, you had a perimeter, like I said, sort of an open area in the Chinese, just calm down in there, you know, full on attack on them, full on back to the book. The afternoon light faded and we worried about whether the AMA would run out. The Chinese said fully encircled us. Their volume of fire was just enough to keep us pin down. They would wait for dark than swarm over our lines. They had plenty of people to do the job. Our band nets were fixed and our grenades ready. Every man had a target sector and we kept fire discipline to conserve ammo. We began to settle in and wait for dark.

Speaker 3:          02:05:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05:17       As bullet zinged grenades exploded and marines cried for help. Someone yelled out that cop, Captain Wilcox had been hit. He taken a bullet to the face and a piece of shrapnel and shattered his arm. Joker Saba took over as our skipper.

Speaker 3:          02:05:33       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:05:34       As soon as we heard about the captain, we ran to the CP. We found him there. His head wrapped in a big white ball of a bandage, unable to speak his blood soaked sleeve dangled beside him. He kept struggling to get on his feet. When the docs put him down on his spread out Poncho. After awhile the morphine kicked in and the skipper nodded off groaning softly

Speaker 1:          02:05:58       before they stabilize the line around us. The Chinese, of course, the first platoon back almost to the CP. So you got the platoons. The CP is the, is the kind of like the brains of the unit, right? They got the different platoons are out in the perimeter in 360 degrees and in in the center of that, you've got the command post, the CP, and you have the radio men in there. You have the people that are going to do fire support, maybe the mortar sections in there, and then you have the leadership is in that CP. But now we start to see that the, the platoons are getting pushed back towards the CP. They're losing their perimeter. Just as Joe Casaba came in to take over command of the company. What he tailors stormed in demanding that we get the hell Outta here. The geeks have all the high ground. They got us surrounded, he boomed. They're going to pick us to pieces tonight. Joker Saba answered him quietly. We need air support to run interference for us. Then we might be able to make a break for the road. The better get to work mighty fast. Said woody, we only have a few minutes of daylight left, so there's joker Sabas keeping it cool again. World War II vet now, just out here getting after it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:07:11       And

Speaker 1:          02:07:12       that's what they need. So what they need is they need the course errors to come in, which if you don't know what a Coursera course, there's an awesome aircraft, World War II vintage and you can tell them cause they have very distinctive wings that have a distinctive bend in them. And they're very uh, very distinctive looking aircraft and obviously very good at at close air support. Back to book all afternoon, Joe Hedrick, the air controller had attempted to get a piece of the air support dedicated to the fifth marine. So there was aircraft working on another group of Marines working for another group of Marines. Now in the remaining minutes of daylight, he caught a flight of four course errors in search of action.

Speaker 1:          02:07:55       Then he calls those things in, gets, gets them on the horn, calls him in. And here we go. The four Coursera street in Lowell above us pointing themselves at the Chinese position less than a hundred yards away. They dropped their big earth shaking bombs and they SCADE the long deep valley with rockets and heavy caliber slugs. The Chinese took cover and we moved out. So that's covered. Move. Once again, all they needed to do to get out of this situation with, they needed someone to cover for their movement. That's what they needed and they couldn't supply it themselves because they're shooting uphill, didn't have the firepower income, the corsairs to get after it and give them cover to move back to the book I lost ground in that day. The Lad who, who had tried hard to be a good combat marine, he was running toward me carrying a helmet filled with grenades, taken from the wounded when a bullet tore through his throat. The shot didn't knock him down at first, just threw his head back and I saw a fountain, a blood spurt from his neck. He staggered a few steps, then fell face forward and the snow, which quickly turned red. When I got to him, he was already dead.

Speaker 1:          02:09:10       It took hours more for Baker one seven to make its way the mile down the road. Colonel Davis brought elements of Charlie company out to meet us. We loaded our dead and wounded on waiting trucks and sent them back to you. Dom knee. The Chinese had caught off the MSR. That's a myth. That's a main supply route between you domini and Haga. Rury the colonel informed us, so now they are truly trapped on the march back into the U. Dot. Omni perimeter past midnight, the men were silent, spent from this cold, brutal day and Captain Wilcox had been a good skipper and when they get there, Lee was waiting for us. When we staggered into you dumb knee perimeter, many of the men limped with the first stages of frostbite and there were some walking wounded who had elected this stay with the company. Undisguised tears ran down Lee's face when he saw the column make its way in.

Speaker 1:          02:10:17       And that was the reason that Lee wasn't with them was because he literally got ordered 10 that he couldn't go because his arm was becoming infected and he, he was, he could not, they would not let him go. And so he's there an undisguised tears down his face as he saw the column make its way in. Joker sobber formed us up at first light while the core stairs were blazing at enemy hills. He told us that we were going to aid Charlie, going to the aid of Charlie company, which had been posted on Turkey hill to guard the MSR last night after we marched away from that area that Chinese had poured out of the hills and surrounded Charlie. Charlie was fighting for its life when we went to pull them out. So there's a, there's a small company of Marines, Charlie Company, and they are surrounded.

Speaker 1:          02:11:12       They go up and one of the, one of the abl companies, so you've got able, Baker and Charlie able company sets up on the flank and then Baker also patrols up and kind of sets up to to come to their aid. Back to the book, through my binoculars, I had a good view of Charlie's perimeter for 100 yards away. They were in a tight circle, not more than 75 yards across halfway up the slope of Turkey hill, Chinese machine guns and rifles infested the halo around them firing at any marine who moved Charlie's people were thoroughly pinned down. So picture this a little circle, see all your, your whole company. Maybe there's a hundred maybe there could be 150 but I think they've taken a bunch of wounded, but at this point, but they've got a hundred guys in a little 75 meter circle and you're all pinned down and no matter what, every time you move, every time his head gets stuck up, you're getting shot at. Back to the book lead, put his machine guns on the Chinese who were firing into Charlie's perimeter from lower slope. My three mortars had the same target ables machine guns and mortars raped the hill above the perimeter. Soon our tracers line the sky and puffs of black smoke from the mortars dotted the rocky hill. Then the big shells from artillery and the battalion's 81 started to fall and the hail rocked with their explosions.

Speaker 1:          02:12:29       Chinese soldiers scurried for cover. My classmate pay attention to this. My classmate gin Stemple led ables assault down the ridge line and into the Chinese. The enemy soldiers had their heads down from the heavy covering fire. Once again, covering fire and Stempel's platoon tore into them through the binoculars. I observed one squad of temple's Marines, led by a giant of a man in a flapping Parker who swung a huge double headed ax. The Chinese soldiers seeing this great maniacal devil charge it. Then branding brandishing a bloody ax, abandoned their positions in terror. So there you have it. I've never, I never, I don't even know where you get a battleax in the midst of the Korean War, but this marine right here attacks the Chinese not with grenades, not with a bar, not with a machine gun. He attacks with a freaking battle ax.

Speaker 3:          02:13:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:13:40       Back to the book. That Chinese quickly lifted their seeds of Charlie Company and made a rapid retreat from Turkey hill. As they fled able companies downhill assault, they had to cross Baker's line of fire. Woody Taylor's platoon had come up to extend our line in every weapon we had was trained on the Chinese says they ran to the protecting slopes on the other side of the valley. Turkey shoot at Turkey hill are people called it. We were at rapid fire with the mortars and machine gun and machine guns, the bars and there, and the rifles. Even call Vars, rocket launcher. Few Chinese made it all the way across the gauntlet of exploding flaming steel. They dropped and heaps even before the Australian planes came down on them. We hadn't worked with the Australians before and they were out to prove that there was gung Ho is our own Marine Corps pilots. They came roaring low along the valley from behind us and when they passed above Lee's glowing pink vest, they dropped even closer to the ground. They're, they're low enough to cut off the chinks. Pigtails, Kelly quipped, the planes had their blood there, guns blazing and the Chinese went down and bunches. The Australians made two passes at the end of their second low level of salt. There were no Chinese soldiers left to shoot that.

Speaker 1:          02:14:59       It took almost every able bodied man that Charlie company had to bring down their dead and wounded there overnight. Defense of Turkey hill had costs dearly

Speaker 1:          02:15:13       and they got one more rescue mission basically to do. There was a uh, Fox company is now in another situation, you know, horrible scenario and first Baker one seven needs to get to them and it is a treacherous, treacherous movement. And they decide, you remember early in the book you said, you know, we weren't used to night fighting. They'd be mostly work during the day. Well, they decide that they need to do this at night so they go on this patrol at night. Going back to the book under the heavy Parker's, our body sweated with the strain, but our hands and feet were frozen, numb. The wind borne cold attacked with terrible fury. When we stopped for bearings, we stood silent and motionless because we needed to maintain Silas. We could not slap our hands against our sides or stomp our feet for circulation. The cold gnawed at our toes and fingers and ate into our bodies. The sweat we generated, wall climbing froze against our skin. We shivered violently. Men muttered through their clenched teeth. Some of our, we're freezing to death here

Speaker 1:          02:16:32       and they push on. I returned to, decided to call them. Many men had collapsed in the snow, curled into balls like Eskimo dogs and CEO's moved along the fallen prodding and kicking, urging them to their feet. I collided with another marine churning forward through the snow. Both of us fell and as we weirdly recovered, I realized that I had knocked down Colonel Davis. What's the holdup? Lieutenant was all my battalion commander said. Then he continued breaking through the snow to the head of the call. Time had no meaning. We labored through infinite darkness and ghostly clouds of snow over an icy path that rose and fell, but seem to lead nowhere. We saw only the back of a man's head, a hunched figure in a long shapeless Parker who's every tortured step was an act of will. We carried on with the only strength that was left to us. Marine core discipline. Yeah. They finally get within range after this brutal freezing march and here we go. The night exploded with the flash and sound of the fight. The marines had the advantage of surprise and momentum. They fought with fierce energy. Now released from hours of cold and misery. The Chinese could do little more than try to escape.

Speaker 1:          02:18:06       Many of them were on armed and most ran off to the south, so the the the Chinese run, there's some firing, there's some shooting, but it's pretty much our route because they had gone at night and they had pushed harder. They had that surprise and violence of action.

Speaker 1:          02:18:25       Back to the book. Dawn arrived gray and cold and we jumped off the second phase of the breakthrough. Able and Baker attacked online, headed out for Fox hill a thousand yards away. Minutes after we moved out. Kaiser's platoon on the left walked into heavy small arms machine gun fire from a ridge on his flank. The sixties responded with h e on the ridge and Kaiser's people broke through the deep snow to melt the hill. When they neared the ridge line, we lifted mortar fire and the platoon drove through the enemy position on its own firepower cover and move added again. We were astonished by our first view of Fox Hill. The snow field that led up to the embattled company's position was covered with hundreds of dead Chinese soldiers. Many of them seem to sleep under blankets of drifted snow, but their bodies were frozen in spasms of pain.

Speaker 1:          02:19:19       There would jumbles of corpses in padded green uniforms. A white clad column had fallen in the formation that it attracted the attention of Fox company's machine gunners. Craters of dirt and snow made by the big guns were rimmed with bodies and parts of men, thick bands of dead Chinese lay at the base of Fox company's perimeter. We stood in wonder men bowed their heads in prayer. Some fell to their knees or their brief quiet ost oats of disbelief. Tears came to the eyes of raggedy marines who had endured bitter cold and savage battle to reach this place of suffering and courage.

Speaker 1:          02:20:08       Someone let loose a wild cheer and we broke forward in a jubilant run across the snow covered at corpse field battlefield. The Marines of Fox company waved brightly colored banners. The blue, yellow and red remnants of the parachute drops it. It sustained them for nearly a week around their perimeter. Fox company had constructed barricades of frozen Chinese bodies from behind these walls of of the d from behind these walls of dead. The marines had mounted their weapons and maintain a fight against an enemy who's number's never ceased. Now, the men of Fox company arose from behind these groups and piles to join us arms, slings and blood. SOCOM presses were common among them. Med hobbled about with makeshift leg splints. All hands, we're haggard at dirty as we're we. We exchanged profane greetings that did not conceal the love that we marines felt for each other. The Sun came out and marines appeared along the skyline's to the north. Then we saw marines marching down the MSR towards us. There were columns of riflemen at first followed by a long trail of vehicle and the vehicles and artillery pieces are Corsair, swooped in close. They're crooked, wings wagging and salute. The fifth and Seventh Marines had broken out of you. Dumb knee.

Speaker 1:          02:21:41       Now they broke out. They have a path, but they still have to go 14 miles to get out of there.

Speaker 1:          02:21:51       Back to the book. All the platoon sergeants had been hit, as were most of the squad leaders. We had corporals and privates stepping into leadership billets, but they were combat experienced marines and they knew the work. The Marine column that came out of the besieged, do you? Dom knee had hundreds of jeeps, ambulances and trucks as well as the big guns of the artillery regiment. Many of the trucks were filled with wounded men and some were stacked with the corpses of our own killed in action, the walking wounded. So now you've got to picture this column like almost like a mad looking column. The walking wounded who could carry a weapon work turned to as riflemen to protect the column. Every man who could walk, hobble or limp was ordered off the trucks. The only riders were those serious cases, the gut wounds and blinded men along with severe leg wounds and men with frostbite so bad that they would need amputation.

Speaker 2:          02:22:49       Okay?

Speaker 1:          02:22:49       Many of the wounded died in the trucks, some froze to death and some were shot by the infiltrators. The 14 mile ride was three days and nights of grim survival. The rifle companies of the fifth and seventh marine stayed in the hills guarding the MSR is the column pulled in to Haggar. Rury. The garrison town came out to meet the bedraggled Marines who had run the 14 mile gauntlet of fire and ice. As the walking wounded came with inside of the town, someone commanded them to fall into ranks. Maybe it was the limping sergeant who gave the command the old salt who had set the defenses along Bob Fisher's stretch of the column. It could have been father Griffin. We're sergeant wing it. We're corporate Burris or Corporal Johnson, the wounded men and some who are unharmed, but who staggered from exhaustion formed up into three files, shouldered their weapons and marched and ragged step slowly the tread of their thick rubber soled Pat Schou packs on the icy road became a steady sure cadence and the haggard and hurt marines put their heads high. Captain Wilcox, who couldn't carry a weapon was in the Ford ranks. His arm was in a huge cast and splinted so it was horizontal to the deck. His head and face were a cocoon of bandages, but holding himself erect. He picked up the cadence in March, standing straight into Haga Rury,

Speaker 1:          02:24:39       a battalion sergeant at battalion surgeon took time away from the hundreds of wounded men. He tended in the aid station to witness the columns, arrival, those bastards, those magnificent bastards were the words the doctor used to describe the worn and torn marines from you dumb knee. And I want you to, I want you to picture that image,

Speaker 2:          02:25:12       okay?

Speaker 1:          02:25:13       That image of these hundreds of men just battered, wounded, barely even able to walk frostbitten and they're meandering into camp and when they get close, someone says, Hey, fall in. And they fall into ranks and they begin to march will. That's human will and it's human will under the power of leadership. And he doesn't even know who gave that order. Somebody said, fall in the ranks. It's the right thing to do. And they do it. They find more, they find, they dig deeper to fallen to ranks and hold their heads high as they walk back into town.

Speaker 1:          02:26:05       Back to the book, except for the road we had opened Haga Rury was under siege, surrounded by many thousands of Chinese soldiers. They had been held off by a battalion of the first marines and a hundreds of rear echelon people who had reverted to rifleman for three days and nights. The cooks and bakers truck drivers and artillery men office, pinkies and technicians dug in alongside infantry marines. They threw back every thrust the Chinese made against the Hagia Rury perimeter. American soldiers were there to army technical support people who picked up rifles and bars and went up the hills and filled in the marine lines. Wherever there were gaps. The artillery through an massive bombardments during daylight hours, the coursers flew in low with bombs, rockets and napalm to help hold the attackers at bay. The three divisions of Chinese who tried to isolate the fifth and seventh marines, plus those who had been at Fox hill followed us south and now they added their numbers to the Incircl Mint of Hagia Rury, the single road, the MSR to kowtow re and our only way out was caught off the hills. That flank that road were high and steep and there were as many Chinese embedded in them as their head been at you dumb knee. So there's still completely surrounded, but all this stuff is happening. There's still surrounded

Speaker 1:          02:27:45       the engineers with their heavy earth moving equipment had dynamited the frozen ground and leveled and airfield large enough for cargo planes to fly in and out of Hagia Rury air force pilots flew in the big clumsy planes loaded with replacements, rations and ammunition for the return trip. They filled the plains with the most seriously wounded. When they landed and took off, they had to fly low between the hills that line the valley, the planes became slow moving targets for the Chinese guns in the hills and every one that left Haga Rury was perforated with bullet holes. The men on the ground marveled at the courage of the air force pilots who kept flying in and out of there. So you've got just cargo pilots flying in to this place in sanity

Speaker 3:          02:28:40       now? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:28:44       they're in a position on a perimeter because just because they survived all that, they still gotta to go back out and hold perimeter. They get out to hold perimeter and here we go. Back to the book through my glasses, I saw column of 15 rifleman marching toward us out of Hagia Rury. There were two files and then moving at a brisk pace alongside the road, but alongside both sides of the road. They weren't crisp, White Parker's and swung their arms smartly because they were clean shaven and an energetic, we assumed they were fresh replacements flown in from the airstrip. We found out later that these clean and jumped he troops were royal British Marines who had fought their way into Haga Rury from the south. They too had found the MSR blocked and they had punched through the Chinese forces, far superior to them a number. They were the 41st commando, a unit that roughly compared in size to one of our own rifle companies like us. These marines had suffered heavy casualties. The Royal Marine column halted in spread into ditches along the road near our CP. A freshly groomed young officer's strode toward Kelly topple and me with the young officer was a grizzled sergeant whose proper military bearing could have come straight from the pages of Kipling. The sergeant had a meticulously trimmed broad mustache that would've stirred gunny Buckley's envy, like the lieutenant or the sergeant was dazzling, clean, and squared away,

Speaker 1:          02:30:15       right binoculars hung around my neck, which is how the lieutenant distinguished me as an officer. Certainly there was little other difference among Kelly and topple and me are Parker's were all stained with blood food, gun oil, dirt are filthy. Faces were matted with bristly beards that bore icicles of mucus and spittle. The lieutenant concealed his disdain for our appearance, braced himself and delivered a broad hand salute. I say, sir, we've ordered to extend our patrol beyond your lines, um, to get up the covering machine guns and I would be most grateful for your suggestions.

Speaker 1:          02:30:56       I appreciated the British lieutenants, Kurtz courtesy, and if I possessed a ranger, I would have shaved on the spot to make myself more presentable. Says, one of the reasons I included this, because people always ask me, you know, you ever work with any other militaries? And I've worked with the British and people say, you know, how are they? Well, this is how the British are. The British are outstanding, the are so professional. It's, it's, it's great. It's so impressive. They're like impeccable. Just the way they're described her. That's the way the British art, that's the way the British military, as their outstanding back to the book, the Royal Marine Lieutenant and his sergeant followed me to our machine gun positions and they checked out the fields of fire for their own mission. As we walked the line together, we exchanged observations about fighting the Chinese. The British lieutenant knew what he was talking about.

Speaker 3:          02:31:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:31:50       Cock a little bit about the army units. The army outfits that went east to the reservoir were her be patched together and poorly equipped for their mission. The artillery and tanks that were to support their advantage. We're not organized in time to accompany them when they move north of how out of Hagia rowry the heavy weapons that aided the marine breakout west of the reservoir. We're not there for the army and many of the soldiers in that fight had not yet received cold weather gear scores of them froze to death.

Speaker 1:          02:32:23       It was the army's bad fortune to that. A large number of its officers and experienced NCO is had been knocked out of the battle out at the onset, the two senior commanders occur, a colonel and the lieutenant colonel was killed at the front of their troops. Most of the company commanders and platoon leaders went down in a short time. The casualties of all ranks outnumbered the able bodied and some of the wounded had to be left behind, but tunes and squads dwindled to a few men and coalesced into small bands that fought until their ammunition was gone. Those who could walk or crawl then made their way back across the frozen reservoir to the marine lines at [inaudible] for the soldiers. It was a disastrous fight, but it had one good effect. The Chinese division that mold them was aimed at the attack on Haga Rury. The fight the soldiers put up on the east side of the reservoir had slowed their advance and that bought valuable time for the marines and the army survivors made their way into hogger Rury. Those who could still carry on were reequipped and formed into a provisional battalion. That became part of the First Marine Division, a fall along side us for the remainder of the campaign.

Speaker 3:          02:33:51       Now,

Speaker 1:          02:33:52       well, like I said, at this point, there's still surrounded and they need to now break out to get south to a town called Hung Naum where there's a port where they're going to be extracted during be pulled out. Back to the book, one seven Arba and two seven where to lead the breakout from Cotto re one seven was to take the high ground east of the road to seven the west four miles on the MSR. The Chinese had blown out a bridge over a deep chasms. The battalion first marines coming from the south would take the ground that commanded the other side of that gap. Then the engineer's were putting in a new bridge beyond that was a full army division. The third waiting to give us cover.

Speaker 1:          02:34:41       After we crossed the bridge, the army would take over the fighting. All we needed to do was get a few more divisions, get through a few more divisions of Chinese soldiers. So even on the division level, 10,000 we're talking, covering move even on the division level. So it's an individual thing. It's a squad thing. It's a platoon thing. It goes all the way up to the division level because they need to have the cover of the army to get out of there. Here we go. April company went out in front. The Chinese, the weighting, Chinese immediately put down a sheet of fire, mortars, machine guns, burp guns, rifles. April's casualty. Soon started to return. We huddled against the blowing clouds of snow and prayed to God. That able wouldn't get so badly malt that we would have to take their place. Our prayers were not answered. Battalion ordered us to pass through Abel and continue the attack. Although it was daylight, we could barely see where we were going. The Chinese did not need to see us. There was only one way for us to get it damaged straight along the road. They had our approach well marked and covered with their weapons. As soon as we went past able, the Chinese mortars began to drop and their machine guns opened. The tracers where weird streaks of orange that flew out of the blinding snow. Clouds are new. Korman was quickly put to work.

Speaker 1:          02:36:13       The Chinese were shooting down from a hill that flanked woody as well as from straight ahead. Joe didn't want to send anyone up that hill fearing he would lose them in the heavy snow. I keep, you're just getting shot at the, there's clouds up there at altitude and so you're just getting shot from snow. It's like a cloud. That shooting machine gun fire at you. It's a nightmare. Back to the book. We were getting nowhere joke or Saba was standing alongside the road behind Lee's platoon. He called me over to him. Bullet zinged in shrapnel wind around us, but Joe stood straight and I stood with him. He decided to risk and move up the hill on the left flank. Move Your platoon up there, Joe. Oh, by the way, at this point, Joe had taken over a platoon. He was no longer just in charge of mortars. Now, one of the sergeants was in charge of the mortars, so he's now in charge of a rifle platoon. Move Your platoon up there, Joe. He instructed me, see if you can take those guns out there killing us. He spread out his mat and trace the route, spread out his map. They trace the route that I was to follow. He fell silent.

Speaker 1:          02:37:18       A Chinese bullet had found its target just below the rim of his helmet in the center of his forehead. A small black hole appeared there. Joke or Saab is dead. Eyes stared at me for several seconds before he slumped slowly to the ground. I caught him in my arms as he fell and held him for a moment. Then I lowered him gently into this snow. Jesus. God joke, her Saba, my friend Joe, who had helped me so much show me so much, who had gone to bat for me with Captain Wilcox, who had been my big brother, joker Saba, whom I loved taking the mat from his mitten hands. I went forward to give it to Lee and inform him that he was the new company commander.

Speaker 2:          02:38:08       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:38:09       On the way over, I got on my walkie talkie to tell battalion that Casaba was Kiaa. Their CP was close behind in the walkie talkie, worked through the Merck. I spotted Lee's vest. He was walking the line behind his men who were prone in the snow covering 50 yards upfront. Looper cine with the bar was with him. I felt alone without Kelly. The Chinese fire was passing overhead high. The enemy couldn't see us either. Casabas dead. I told Lee caught one in the head. Dam was all Lee said in response, you're the new skipper. I added giving him the map. Joe told me to go up the hill on Woody's flank. See if I can get around those guns and take them out. You still want me to do that? We must do something. Lisa said they're killing us up from up there. That's what Joe said.

Speaker 1:          02:39:04       Yes. See what you can do. Is Your radio working? Yeah, I just talked to battalion on it. Okay. Let me know the situation when you make it and when you're ready to attack. If we can get artillery. I don't want you to want run into friendly fire. I skipper. I said First Lieutenant Lee gave me an ironic little smile at that, so they're going to go up this hill and try and take out that machine gun and as they're going up the hill, he starts hearing something. Someone called from behind us, sir. Lieutenant owned Owen. It was woody Taylor's runner. He was breathing hard from the effort he had made to catch up with us. Sir, Lieutenant Taylor wants you back down with the company. Lieutenant Lee's been hit and Lieutenant Taylor wants you on the double. He says, damn it to hell. I might've been able to roll the Chinese from the flank and take out the guns that were holding back the company.

Speaker 1:          02:39:55       I tried to get woody on my walkie talkie. I got more static. I waived for Morrison to rejoin us and the tiny platoons slipped and slid back down the hill as they came behind me. The men, Kirsten complain about the second lieutenants making up their mind. What he tailored, waited for us at the base of the slope. He was senior to me in rank and with lead down. He was our new company commander. He said that battalion had sent up a pair of tanks and their firepower would cover a frontal assault up the hill. So here we go. Finally we get tanks in. Anyone that doesn't know I am a huge fan of tanks. I love tanks and all you tankers out there, thank you for being out there for these ground pounders. So he couldn't, the old school tanks, they had a little phone on the back of the, on the back of the tank to talk to the guys that were inside the tank. He picks up that tank as they get prepared to do this assault and he says, put your thirties up below the ridge. Goop, wishing going to 10 o'clock then on my command, hit them with the cannons. We'll jump off on that. A tinny voice came from within the tank. Hear you loud and clear. The 30 caliber twin machine guns of both tanks began there. Jack Hammer pounding. I watched red tracers stabbing up the snow covered hill toward the Doug and Chinese gun that we could now see dimly

Speaker 1:          02:41:22       now the under that fire power, they start to attack our line. Moved up the hill, 25 yards above me to Chinese soldiers appeared from behind a large boulder one had a rifle, the other burp gun. As I swung my car being toward them, I heard a grunt from Lupa cine. He fired his bar straight into the air and he fell forward in the snow. He did not move and I knew he was dead. The best bar man we had, God dammit, you've lost Lupa cine. I couldn't get my weapon on the two Chinese above me fast enough. The one with the rifle put around in my left shoulder that spun me around its impact, generated a shock, like a powerful jolt of electricity that went through my entire body. Damn. How can I be hit after all of this? How could I get hit? I saw the burp gun trigger a burst at me.

Speaker 1:          02:42:14       The snout of his weapon flashed and I could not lift my feet above my need of above the knee deep snow to get out of the path of his bullets. Two slugs tore into my right arm to more of the electric jolts and my car being flung itself away from my grasp. I saw it rise into the air. As I fell into the snow, this cannot be happening. I tried to raise my head and reach to retrieve my car being get the bastards. My arms wouldn't move. I could not raise myself. Joe's down. Someone shouted, Bill Flux Voice, get the bastards. I heard myself yelling, get the bastards. I screamed in pain and overwhelming anger and my marines rushed past me and up the hill leaving Lupa cine and me and the snow. Get the bastards. I yelled again and again. It was all I could think to do.

Speaker 1:          02:43:13       The young corpsman who had been assigned to us for the day's battle cry for the day's battle. Heard my screams. Although the enemy fire steel flayed the hill, he ran clubs lead through the snow to reach my side. I was flat on my back and he crouched beside me. Okay, Lieutenant, he gasped for air with the exertion of the run laden with his aid kit and cold weather gear. His breath made puffs of white steam and is smooth shaven. Face was red with 25 below zero cold with bullets. Zinging all around of the new corner. Cutaway my Parker, the bullet through the shoulder, it nicked my lung and blood was gushed and blood gushed from my mouth and down the front of my parka covering his bare hands. Give me some morphine. I told the kid the pain was terrible. I can't sir, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          02:44:05       He shook with the cold and with his own fear bullets stung the air and raise little fountains of snow a few feet away. Gimme some goddamn morphine. I yelled, spraying my blood on him, sir. The morphine is frozen. I can't give it to you. What the Hell is wrong with you? Carry the goddamn stuff in your mouth, don't you boots snow. Yes sir. I'm sorry sir. He put the surette in his mouth and continued to cut away at my clothing. Just just try and be still, sir. Even with the pain and the rage, I realized that no one had told the new doc how to take care of casualties in below zero weather. I gritted my teeth and tried to shut up. I didn't feel the jab when he shoved the syringe surette into my flesh, but I soon felt a wave of warmth come over me. The pain float away and the noise of the fighting above us receded. You're a good lad. I told the corpsman I felt his hands doing something. You'll be a good marine. Yes sir. He sounded far away before I drifted off. I remembered the photos in my helmet. Those are the photos of his wife and his two kids. My pictures. I said, that's my wife and kids. Don't let the geeks get them. I won't, sir, said the corpsman who had risked his life to save mine and who's name I never knew.

Speaker 1:          02:45:36       Woody Taylor was the only law officer left with the company. He let the troops, the crest of the hill fighting as a rifle man himself. The Chinese were on the run and battalion ordered Bacon one seven to keep after them. The troops were frozen and exhausted, but wardee pushed them on.

Speaker 2:          02:45:58       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:45:59       Late in the day they reached their objective with their small number. They set a tight perimeter on the high ground overlooking the gap in the road that engineers would bridge the next day.

Speaker 1:          02:46:14       So they get that targets cure. They get that hilltop and now they're overlooking the gap where the engineers are going to build that bridge and they sat in to a security perimeter. Woody Taylor put the weary company on 50% watch against the enemy assault he knew would come in the dark. It was the coldest night that the men had yet endured a reported 30 degrees below zero. The wind howled at them and every direction, all through the unbearably cold hours until dawn Taylor and Sergeant Richard move from man to man to assure that no one froze to death. A detail of Korean soldiers who had been attached to the army arrived to bolster the perimeter. But most of them filtered away during the night.

Speaker 3:          02:47:05       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:47:06       Several Times. Marines hurt the enemy moving around their lines in the darkness, but no attack came would he put out patrols early in the morning before light.

Speaker 3:          02:47:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:47:19       Within a hundred yards of a wine, they found frozen dozens of frozen Chinese soldiers whose feet and hands were frozen to ice. The extreme cold had been on our side holding back the attack.

Speaker 3:          02:47:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:47:40       And the next day would he, Taylor brought the remnants of the company down from the hills, marched them across the bridge and into the shelter of the Chow town of Chin, Hong knee, their battle and did there sergeant Richard took roll call, his final count. Where's 27 men?

Speaker 3:          02:48:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:48:21       27 minutes. And that is, that's out of the original 200 plus men of the company. And then on top of that, another hundred replacements that filled their ranks in this battle. So that's 300 men and only 27 remained 27 now few of us will ever face those kind of odds in few of us are ever going to face those hellish demands. You of us will ever stare at Hale like these men did. But I want you to think about something. I want you to imagine. Imagine what we can accomplish if we applied even a fraction of the will that these men displayed, the iron will oh will that is stronger than their bodies a will that is stronger than their minds because clearly let's face it, their bodies,

Speaker 2:          02:50:15       yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:50:16       their bodies were broken and their minds in many cases or broken and they didn't want to go on, but there will, there will prevailed.

Speaker 2:          02:50:37       Okay

Speaker 1:          02:50:42       will we'll conquers all and our will is delivered through discipline and as Joe Owen stated many times in the book, sometimes the only thing that press them on was disciplined discipline, the discipline to push yourself and you know, we are all capable of more I and capable of more. You are capable of more, you can overcome the obstacles and the challenges and the enemy, and you can overcome your own weaknesses. Thank you. Can overcome your own desire to quit. Let let bees men that these men be our examples of how to fight

Speaker 4:          02:52:08       in, how to use your will and how to drive on and let these men B are examples of how to live or don't. Don't let these men down. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. Echo. If you, uh, want to give me a second here to recover and talk about some stuff over there, I'd be much obliged. Yeah, man,

Speaker 4:          02:53:04       this could be one of the rougher of transitions. Yeah. You know, it's, you gotta remind yourself, this is a book. This happened, this happened, this happened, this happened in the fact that these guys could endure this and fight on. If that doesn't give you the inspiration that you need to step pass whatever pathetic little challenges in front of you, you're wrong. Don't listen to this podcast anymore. Go somewhere else. Yeah. Yeah. It's easy to forget it because of the kind of the contrast of your, like your problem or whatever you want to call it, your challenge, your task, right issue that you're trying to overcome. And then contrast with basically the luxury that you live in and that luxury is kind of put on you this kind of way of feeling on a habitual level. So now you're faced with this task comparatively. Habitual comfort is what we experienced. Yes. Habitual Comfort. Exactly right. So then one night I woke up early in the morning. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:54:25       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:54:26       You know what I mean? Hey, I worked out real hard and sweated a lot. Okay. Well really is that all I got? I need to step it up man. I need to step it up. Yeah. And you know, I woke up early in the morning or you know, I didn't get that much sleep. So my real hardcore yeah, your foot's not freezing off of your body. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. And, and what's, what's incredible, this is every single time you go, damn, you know, I'm glad they made it out of that didn't make it out anything that they're still just, just surrounded. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what's is when you do remind yourself of this kind of stuff, like, like right now, if you knew one feels the way I do, I feel like, oh, I feel pretty much rejuvenating. And when I kind of flashed back to my life for a second, yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:55:15       I'm like, Oh man, I'm kind of stoked. Yeah. I can go, you know, if I got to work out, I'm going to crush that workup because I got all my limbs right now. They didn't freeze off all this stuff. So the point there is, when you re are reminded of real adversity, whether you remind yourself or the, or a book or something you see or hear about, um, like it, it gives you that, like that added will to, to overcome. Maybe you, you actually can take some of their wheels. You can learn it, you can learn it. You can say, Oh, you know what? Oh, I'm cold right now. You're not cold, you're, you're in. You are not cold. You are not, you're tired right now. No, you are not tired. You're afraid right now. No. You are not afraid. Learn. Yeah. Yeah. Learn, increase your will through knowledge.

Speaker 4:          02:56:06       It's a real thing. Yup. It's true. And when you do, with my point being, when you do remind yourself of this kind of stuff and it helps, it'll help you do whatever it is or, or overcome the faculty. Yeah. Because you realize that you, that human beings are capable of more way more than once, you know, you know more than I know I'm capable of more than what I've done. I'm going to do more. I'm going to get after it harder. That's the, that's what I take away from this. These kind of books obviously besides, there's incredible tactical lessons in there. There's incredible leadership. There's incredible, but that the, the testament of cumin will, is income is unbelievable. Unbelievable Testament. Yeah. So now I feel like, or it seems like you knew that when we're faced or when I'm faced with like, oh, this is too hard, or, Dang, I got all this ahead of me to, I got to do all this, all really, all that is now looking at it.

Speaker 4:          02:57:05       It seems like all it is is a deviation from my habitual comfort. That's all it is. And I'll tell you what was awesome. The way that he reinforced it reinforced several times because people talk about fear. I've talked about fear on this podcast before, but you know, I kind of say, Hey, take action. If you're afraid, you've got to step into it. And she said that over and over again. He actually had a methodology. Okay, if I'm afraid I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my, I'm going to stand up. I'm going to get a record. I'm gonna find out what's going on and I'm gonna get, I'm going to, I'm going to find out. I'm going to assess the situation before my boss calls me. That's my timeline that I'm working on. And that forces them to take action. You know, so many, so many great lessons learned in there.

Speaker 4:          02:57:47       Well yeah, I feel like, yeah, we can transition over to used to support. We'll, yeah, if we want, if people, if people do want to support the podcast out there, I guess you could if you're in the mood of how to do that. Uh, yeah. So the first way, and this is kind of a two way street, you know, um, okay on its supplements, right? Supplements, all kinds of cool stuff. In fact, my friend from quiet Cameron, he hit me up and was like, Hey, what's on it has this, it's a new uh, preworkout you know, but it's non stimulant. Usually preworkouts crush up a bunch of Phaedra and these feed it to you. They don't actually do that, but it seems like they do, I'm not saying that's all a bad thing, but it's not like healthy, you know? So anyway, this one is like a healthy one is like nonstimulant who's check?

Speaker 4:          02:58:33       Oh, I got, I just got it. Haven't tried it yet, but I'm going to get a report back to us once you've tried it. But if you're into like, you know, sometimes you go on the website and you get like caught up reading all the cool stuff and all this stuff like that. It's on there so you can look at it and see how good you actually mentioned that a lot. How you go to the Onnit website and you know, I maybe I just don't do as thorough research as you when it comes to checking out where my krill oil comes from. But sure, I know what I'm looking for it and I go do it. But if you're more like echo and you want to spend time on the website reading and researching, it's a good place to do is on [inaudible] dot com throw a slash Jocko on there.

Speaker 4:          03:00:59       I take the coconut MCT oil from on it and I mixed it with heavy whipping cream. I don't, yeah, I don't do that until it's whipped cream. I just pour it in a little bit in there. I stirred up and I drink heavy whipping cream, which is just all fat, which is awesome with MCT, which is more fat and I didn't drink all that. Yeah, and it's a good fat. It's good fat, but it also, it's, it's very, very fulfilling. Very, very notes. But I'm not, I'm talking, I almost, it's a little bit big when I have little glasses that I mix it in there bigger than a shot glass, but they're smaller than a cocktail glass. It's called the rocks glass perhaps in the bar industry. You know more about that stuff. Yeah, it's bigger than MCT. I mean not to go into all the fats and good feathers, but it's more fulfilling.

Speaker 4:          03:01:47       Fat has nine calories per gram. Carbohydrates and protein have for alcohol. Seven little trivia. I was not aware of that. Yeah, it's all good.

So yeah, he's the one of the, one of the cadets at West Point. Yeah. So, um,

Speaker 1:          03:06:10       he's, I don't know how, do you know how he saw how he saw him or whatever, but a cadet at west point and I don't have, I don't have his name right now in uniform. Yeah. Yeah. He's in uniform. But the uniform that they wear, it's cold up there. So then basically it's like a giant Cape. And underneath the Cape he had a, uh, a Jocko podcast shirt on. He had actually, he actually had the straight up Jocko face on that thing and it was, he said he posted an awesome picture on social media of him, of him pulling up his cape and he had that that

Speaker 3:          03:06:41       okay.

Speaker 1:          03:06:41       That tee shirt on. Yeah. Chuck Lewis face. Maybe that was the secret weapon that led the army to the first victory, I think 14 years over navy and football. Tom, Neil, Tom the, Oh yes, he's the, he was the cadet doing it. Yeah. Sending in the wild

That's, I mean I don't know what the regulations are, but I'm fairly certain that the t shirt, the Jocko podcast tee shirt is not part of army regulations something unless it is now. I'm just saying, I never know perhaps. But yeah, he's been, he's been actually in touch before he went to west point. He was, when he was getting ready to go, he was like reaching out and he was getting after it. Right. And go crush it. Doing this point. So good for him to some Gnocchis Jujitsu as well. True, true.

Some hoodies on there, some rash guards on there for, for some activity.

Speaker 4:          03:07:42       You know what I'm talking about? And some patches on there, the regulation one within the velcro that's um, that's on there. Some other stuff. So yeah, go on there, look at it. You don't have to buy nothing. Just look at it. If you like something, go ahead. Get it. Good way to support and boom, you got a shirt. Um, also, okay, so here's the thing. And this started a while ago. Okay. So I'll tell this story, I'll keep it short, but, so I was like, I don't have echo went rogue again, basically. Yeah. So, and it started with kind of nothing, so, you know, okay, we're talking about luxury and like, okay, fine, I only got six hours sleep. I'm usually used to eight and a half or something like that. Right. So, but I know I can do a workout and I know you don't get that much sleep or if you're tired or not tired of what a, you still push through the workout. But I'm thinking, yeah, yeah, your hard, your money, whatever. But you got to, there has to be times where you got to basically talk yourself into it basically.

Speaker 4:          03:08:47       So I'm like, all right, like what do you say? You got to, you know, be honest. Like, what do you say? You know, to yourself. And I figured it would have, you know, like a lot of the stuff that you can always say like, you know, we have this luxury and all this stuff. I'm like, all right, but let me, so I asked you and what you told me. I was like, okay, that, um, that was good. It was legit right there. So, and, and it worked. It totally worked. Um, so what I did, you know, one thing led to another kind of in my head, so I was like, all right, you know what we're going to do? We're going to record that. You're going to say that I'm going to record it. And on top of that, not just the working out and usually like with food and stuff like donuts and I joke around that I eat like whole things of Oreos because they, how I, that's just a joke.

Speaker 4:          03:09:35       Like sometimes I do, but you do. Yeah, but I have willpower. Like that's not a problem with, but um, some people don't. So I'm like, yeah, the, if that workout thing that you just said could apply to like all these other things, we're going to record that too. Then you start thinking and you know, a lot of people have been saying, hey, what about like a ringtone? You should ever ringtones w you know, for my alarm and all this stuff. So I'm like, all right, well basically one thing led to another, we recorded them and I put them on iTunes, called it psychological warfare. Good move. I think on my, it's on iTunes. Yes, on iTunes. It's like, yeah. So we're trying to, here's the, so this kind of ties it back to how you can support the podcast look. So we hit about eight to 10 birds with one stone with this, it's 99 cents for a track or you can buy like the whole fancy and was like 1314 tracks on there for nine bucks.

Speaker 4:          03:10:32       I think that's kind of standard and but so that's how much I put it or I listed it as um, and you just download it. You put it as your ring. There's one for waking up. Actually there's two for waking up. Right. So you scan your foot reefer waking up maybe. Yeah. But there's a few, in my mind, I pictured people like, Oh, you want to wake up? Cool. We can come down on that. I go through that every day waking up. So yeah, we'll do that. It's of like a song that you could buy. It's like a song that you could buy on iTunes. Howard album. Yes. Same process. You just, yeah, you just don't know. You can buy one track d tracks or the whole thing wouldn't handle it. I mean it's 99 cents. So it's not like you're supporting the podcast. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 4:          03:11:12       Right. Here's, here's a little tip. I was thinking about though. So you need your wake up. There's like a few wakeup ones, right? I mentioned that if you put that as your alarm cleared with your wife or whoever you're sleeping with, I'll tell you right now if that thing, but if she don't know about it and that comes on, it'll freak her out man. So do that. That's a little pro tip right there if he's in it, but I will, I will almost, I'll say it's 100% guarantee if you're, if you felt like how I felt with workouts, like I'm really not in the mood to go do a workout and you listened to the workout one, I will say with 100% certainty you will not skip the work. I'll say that right now as a legit anyway, psychological warfare. Who's the agonist? I think it's just a willing, okay.

Speaker 4:          03:12:02       I think cause that's how they list them by artists, right? Yeah, I think so. Did I just that just become an artist. That's scary. Let's call it something else. You kind of got, can I use you something else? You kind of got and pushed into it though. So you know, artists, author, a podcaster technically. Is that a thing at the happy I heard it. You know what? I can give you the heads up. Three, I'm over here being an artist. What happened? Okay, but it's all you know wrong. Not going to happen. It's offered good cause though I'm telling you because if anyone's like I am, which I'm, I'm straight up. It's more than an assumption. I'm, I am of the belief that some people are like me in that way where you just don't feel like it. I know we just read this and now we all feel like it. I understand that. But you don't have that feeling every single day. I'm telling you right

Speaker 1:          03:12:52       now. This helps. This helps you get after it helped me for sure. Anyway, psychological warfare, you know, all right. Also Hae on iTunes or sorry, not an iTunes bought on Amazon. You can get some white tea. It's like I said, we're working through the supply chain issues, but it's been popping up every couple of days. They refill. You can order it. It tastes good. And it makes you feel good and it will increase your dead lift capabilities to a minimum of 7,000 pounds. Many are getting up to 8,000 pounds, headless from drinking chocolate white tea. You can get up and get after it Mug by the way too. So those are, they're bigger than normal. I'll say that they're bigger than a normal mug. A normal mug is not as big as it get after it mug with every sip, like you're acting, you're doing bicep curls, you're getting, actually, that's not my joke.

Speaker 1:          03:13:50       I could steal that from Twitter. So that's that. Uh, also on Amazon, you can pick up colder than hell. The book I read today do it. Put it in your collection of Badass books. You can pick up another book that's called extreme ownership. That's written by me and my brother Leif Babin. It is also a book that's about combat, but it's more of a book about leadership. And if you want to give some work, speaking of the holiday season, if you want to give someone a gift that's gonna, you know some gifts that you get, they go in the drawer that doesn't get opened anymore, right? And then it takes you a couple of years and you're finally throw it away. Don't give that gift the gift that someone's going to say, you gave me that book, it's legit. I read it. Oh, I implemented this. Hey, what'd you think about the good?

Speaker 1:          03:14:42       Give them a gift that's gonna have long term value, longterm value. Give him a little book called extreme ownership. You can get it on amazon.com uh, hey. Speaking of extreme ownership also we got the muster number two zero zero to May 4th and fifth at the Marriott Marquis in New York City. Now the last one that we had, we had people from 42 different states. We had people from five foreign countries and we had leaders at every level of the chain of command in every size business that you could imagine. So it was a super diverse group of people that are all together with, they had one similarity in that is they want to get better and crush it in leadership, in their business and in their life. So that's what we do at the mustard leaf and I who are there obviously when, when I say we're there, I don't mean where their meaning we're in the same building but were hiding somewhere.

Speaker 1:          03:15:41       No, no, no, no. Where there we are actually with you. We are sitting down with you. We are talking. We are, we're not hiding behind the curtain. We don't even have a backstage. They said well where do you want your backstage or we don't need one. We're not going backstage. Yeah. People want to come and talk and learn. We want to learn from them. So come and get it. I've said this every time this is going to sell out, it's going to sell out and then you won't be able to go. And also the prices are going up. So as you get close to the event, the prices go up. The reason we do that is so we incentivize you to buy the tickets now so that we can plan better, right? We like to be planned, we planned and we prepare things. If all of you sign up, you know, April 22nd we got some logistics prompts.

Speaker 1:          03:16:29       I don't want to be in the same boat I'm in with Jocko white tea where I've failed logistically and it takes me a while to get it back on track. So sign up early, save yourself some money and let us be better prepared for that. If you got questions, you can email muster@echelonfront.com or you can check out the website, www.extremeownership.com and we will see you there and we will and you'll see me, you'll see Lafe, you'll see echo Charles and you'll see everybody else.

And finally we appreciate you listening and supporting the podcast and of course spreading the word, but don't just listen, do execute. Take a look at your life and see where you can apply the kinder human will we heard about tonight.

Speaker 1:          03:18:12       They're kind of human will that overcomes challenges and obstacles. Whether you're fighting a war or you're fighting a fire or you're fighting crime, or you're building a bridge, or you're building a piece of software, or whether you're doing HVAC work or retail work, or whether you're healing kids or you're teaching kids, no matter what you are doing, what can you do to do it better?
