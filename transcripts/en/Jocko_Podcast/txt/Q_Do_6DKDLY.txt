Speaker 1:          00:00          Going to your book a little bit. I'm gonna, I'm going to, um, pick up. Going back to that first thought. Standing up means voluntarily excepting the burden of being your nervous system responds in an entirely different manner. When you face the demands of life voluntarily, you respond to a challenge. Instead of bracing for a catastrophe, you see the gold, the dragon hoards instead of shrinking and terror from the all too real fact of the dragon, you step forward to take your place in the dominance hierarchy and occupy your territory. Manifesting your willingness to defend, expand, and transform it. To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life with eyes wide open. Great. The reason I pulled that one out in particular is the feeling that you have as a soldier or as a, as a military person, a feeling that you have going on and off offensive operation where let's say you're a bad guy and I'm gonna come and get you at night.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Well, first of all, you don't know and I'm sneaking up on you and I have all this power, right? I feel good about it, I'm going to get you the opposite of that is when I'm doing a convoy or I'm going on a patrol where now the bad guys are out there, they're waiting to attack me. And that is a defensive posture. And your attitude about that type of thing is bad. Now we would train our guys that we, we made a specific point with my guys. I would say, look, when you're on patrol, we're on the offense, we are scanning, we are looking to get the, to get us to be standing up straight and to get the mentality of we want to do this and we're moving towards the target as opposed to we're being chased. That's a big deal.

Speaker 2:          01:46          Absolutely. That's a big deal. Yeah. And, and that's, that's, what would you say? That's an extreme example of what's necessary under normal conditions in life. So one of the things that happens if you're treating someone who has a phobia, say like agoraphobic. So they become afraid of virtually everything. Um, maybe they're afraid of an elevator. It's one of many fears. And so you think well, and they're afraid of an elevator because they've actually gone in elevators and have panic attack. So it's weird because what you do to cure them is to get them to go in elevators and you think, well wait a second. That's actually what caused the problem. So how can getting them to do that again, make it better. And the answer is because they've gone in elevators their whole life, right? And yet they still become terrified. So how can getting them to go in an elevator cure them for a long time?

Speaker 2:          02:31          People thought, well you get them to relax while they were in the elevator. And the pairing of the relaxation with being in the elevator taught them to not be afraid. That was the first theory. But then people learned, didn't know you could just get them to go in the elevator without having them relax. And it also worked. And eventually psychologists sorted this out and what they figured out was that voluntarily encountering something you're afraid of is not the same thing as running from it. Like it's seriously not the same thing. So you say to the person, you're afraid of the elevator, let's can you go look at an elevator? And they usually say yes and maybe they're so terrified because they're so far gone in their illness that they can't say, well how about we look at a bunch of pictures of elevators since like virtually everyone can do that.

Speaker 2:          03:12          So let's say let's look at pictures of elevators till your board. That actually doesn't take very long because it's actually quite boring. So then the next thing would be, well let's go. You have to have the person trust you. And so the rule is, look, we're going to do some things that are going to push you like competition, but you can stop whenever you want and we're not going to push you any farther than is good for you and all stop anytime you want. I often practice with my clients, like I taught one client a while back to not be afraid of needles and he was afraid of needles. And I'll tell you what that meant. He had dental surgery with no anesthesia. Oh right, okay. So that gives you some level of what it's like to be afraid. It's like all do the dental surgery, but you're not putting that needle in there.

Speaker 2:          03:52          It's really, it's like I'm no needles so, so I taught them how to not be afraid of, of needles, you know, and it, it didn't take very long. But the first thing I did, I told him I was going to bring a needle into the office. That was all, I told him the first week is next week I'm going to bring a needle in here and I'm going to keep it sheets and it's going to be sitting on a shelf and that's where I'm going to put it. And when you come in here, you can look at it and if you want me to put it away then I'll put it away. It's under your control. And then so he was okay with that. So he came in and said there's the needless, do you want to look at it and said, no, but Kenyon, it's like all look at it.

Speaker 2:          04:27          So he looked at it and then they said, look like I'm going to pick up the needle and now what you're gonna do is you're going to tell me to put it down and I'm going to put it down. So I picked it up and he got nervous, like right away, and he said, well, you put that down. I put it down right away. I said, we do that 10 times so that the bottom part of your nervous system actually knows that that's what's going to happen. Said now, and then the next thing we'll do is we're going to practice you saying you've had enough and leaving the office. So I'd pick up the needle and then he'd say, okay, so now you say you've had enough, I'm leaving. And so he said that and then I'd let him leave. We did that like 10 times so that he knew that he could just say he'd had enough and leave.

Speaker 2:          05:08          So that mean he didn't have to be a prey animal. Right. So we're getting them out of that mode and it didn't take very long until, well then I could bring the needle close to him and I said, make sure you watch it. You can't pretend it's not there. Right. I'll bring it close to him and touch and touch them with the sheath needle. So we did that a bunch and then finally I unsheathed it and I'd bring it close and he tolerate that or stop me and then I'd touch them with that. And then the last part of it was that, um, I put it under a piece of paper so he couldn't see it and then I'd bring it close to him. Right. Cause that was, that was the unknown. Right. You don't know what the hell is going on underneath the piece of paper, but he got to the point where he could go and have a needle.

Speaker 2:          05:47          It took them about, it was very brave of him to do this because, well, what had happened, he got, what had happened to him is he had a very bad experience with the childhood dentist, held him down, held him six people, held them down to give him a needle. It's like wasn't so good. It had some long term consequences. But see what happens. So when you, when you do that with people, you don't teach them to be less afraid. You teach them to be braver. That's different. And so like I had a client once the doors open on the elevator and she looked and she said, that's death. Like that's a tube. And I thought, wow, that's an amazing response. And her idea was she'd go in there, her heart rate would accelerate, she'd have a heart attack and she die. So as far as she was concerned, walking in, there was death.

Speaker 2:          06:30          Right. Okay. So for me it was an elevator, but for her it was death. It's like, okay, well what do you do about your fear of death? Well, we're not getting rid of that. It's like, you know, and you could die in the elevator. You actually could, probably, you won't. But people do die in elevators. And her idea was that, well, if anyone has ever died in an elevator in the history of mankind, that's a good reason for me not to be in the elevator. It's like, fair enough. You know? And why aren't you terrified out of your skull all the time? Because while you're wondering around, you might have a heart attack like that, we'll probably in fact happened to you at some point. So why aren't you terrified of that at every moment? Well, that's the mystery. While, so you treat people and, and you see with that client what I eventually did with hers, we went and watched an embalming. She was terrified of death. Like, seriously? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. No kidding. But you know, so you get, you don't get less afraid. You get braver. That's better because there's plenty of things to be afraid of.
