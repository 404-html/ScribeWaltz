Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This is Jocko podcast number 23 with Echo Charles and me, Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo, good evening. Better and faster and stronger and smarter and wiser. Always trying to get a little bit of all those things and we try and get wiser. That's one of those things. That's wisdom, which technically wisdom comes from experience. So how do you Garner experience you? You can't just make yourself live longer in a shorter period of time. No, it doesn't work that way. So what do we do to garner wisdom? We look to the past. You got to know your past, you've got to know history. And as I tell my son on a pretty regular basis, history revolves around war. And in many ways history is war and war.

Speaker 2:          00:01:28       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       is a human endeavor. The worst of human endeavors. Some. But it is a human endeavor nonetheless. And because it is a human endeavor, it therefore reflects human nature. And that's why we can learn so much from the history of war, not just about war itself, but about man and about human nature. And the same goes for principles of war. The principles of war can be applied to life, can be applied to business, can be applied to relationships, can be applied to every human endeavor. And so with that in mind, that full spectrum of application, let's take a look at the oldest book about the principles of war written in 500 BC over 2,500 years ago. A book whose principles still apply today, some sues the art of War Sun Sue said the art of war is a importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death. A road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can or no account be neglected. You gotta study war and like I said, it is really about life in conflict and friction in relationships and human interaction. You're going to see all of that when you start looking at the, at the art of war

Speaker 1:          00:03:38       and he restarts talking about trying to figure out who's going to win in a situation when seeking to determine the military conditions. Let them be made. The basis of, of a comparison in this wise, which of the two generals has most ability on which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? Which army is stronger? On which side? Our officers and men most highly trained in which army is there. The greater constancy in both reward and punishment.

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       That's something you talked about Echo Charles, and we're talking about kids. You talked about how it's important for the punishment to be constant and consistent. Yes. Now what's interesting here, and this is something we've talked about before, and you know what? I'm gonna say that a lot today. This is something we've talked about before because when you start talking about military strategy, it runs through the ages. There's threads that run through the ages, and this is one of them. He says, while heating the profit of my council, avail yourself also have any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:05:06       According as circumstances are favorable, one, you should modify ones plans, so don't get dead set on something. Don't get locked into a plan. You gotta be open to change it.

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:23       Continuing all warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable when using our forces. We must seem inactive. When we are near. We must make the enemy believe we are away when far away. We must make him believe we are near hold out baits to entice the enemy fame disorder and crush him. Now this is something that applies it absolutely directly to Jujitsu. Obviously, you know, uh Oh. Oh you, you think you're going to get my arm? Boom. I just, I just swept you and got on top. Oh, I'm really panicking. This situation. Oh, guess what? I just got deep. Half guard came out in the back and now I'm going to choke you. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:06:16       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:16       Back to the book. If he is secured, all points, be prepared for him if he is superior and strength, evade him. If your opponent is of Kolarik temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant so well. This is something people don't think about. The fact that hey, if your opponent has superior strength of atum and obviously that's something that we also heard from Mau, the same, that was the same gorilla strategy. If your opponent strong, you avoid him, and here he's saying if they've, if they're losing their temper a little bit, go ahead and irritate them. Help that along. You pretend to be weak so that your opponent grows arrogant and thinks, doesn't have to worry about you.

Speaker 3:          00:07:06       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       Continuing. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are United, separate them. Attack him where he's unprepared. Appear where you are not expected. These military devices leading to victory must not be divulged beforehand.

Speaker 1:          00:07:30       It's, it's, it's strange that this is the oldest book and this thread runs throughout history and yet people interacting with each other. We'll constantly decide that there's going to go toe to toe. You're going to argue with me. Cool. I'm just going to go toe to toe with you. Yeah. Yeah. This is an intellectual approach and I think that's, but you know, if you're not detached, it's harder to jump on that intellectual methodology. Yes. With you. If you come at me with your argument head on or you accuse me or you're trying to tighten me up on something, you're just being super direct with me. It's your diet. I might get offended and then what I'm going to do when I go right back at you, right? Instead of maneuvering on you, right? So like, yeah, if someone's super, super smart or super calculated, they're way more likely to to sign on to this type of, so as you started losing your temper with someone, think about what Echo Charles just said. That means you're not being very smart and you're not being very calculated means you're making a mistake. You know means there's a better route to go, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:08:35       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       now continuing. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple air. The battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. So you got to plan and it's free. It's interesting you the word calculate calculative and he just used the same word,

Speaker 2:          00:09:00       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       Now, this is something that I've talked about to fight and conquer and all your battles is not supreme excellence.

Speaker 2:          00:09:11       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:09:11       I'll say that again. To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence. Supreme Excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting, and I always take that one step further. I always take the point that the enemy doesn't even know that there was a fight, right? Right. They didn't even know what was happening. They thought they were having dinner and going to sleep, but they just got beat, and that's especially true when you're in, you're part of a team and you're trying to win some. Are you trying to push your idea through? You're trying to, trying to convince people of something. The best way to convince them is when you didn't go toe to toe with them. They came to the conclusion themselves. At least they think they did, right? You fought them without fighting them. Thus, the highest form of general ship is to block the enemy's plans. The next best is to prevent the junction of enemy forces. The next in order is to attack the enemy's army. In the field and the worst policy of all is to besieged walled cities. The rule is not to besiege wall cities if it can possibly be avoided.

Speaker 2:          00:10:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       Now, this is another thing, and I've said this on this podcast before, which is if someone is super dug in on a position or why are you going to attack them? If you have this belief that you're just dug in on and I'm trying to maneuver around it, why am I going to attack that position? You've got, you know more about it. You've studied it. You've been in this argument 47 times in the last three weeks, so how am I going to come up against you when you've got that well fortified position? Yeah. The answer is I'm not. It's not going to work out good for me.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       Therefore, the skillful leader subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting. He captures their cities without laying any siege. He overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field. That's the goal. That is the goal. You had. Just something else about martial arts. I think like when you get someone that really knows how to fight, most of the time you don't have to fight. Yup. Most of the time you can tell, people can tell that you know how to fight. Like for instance, when they get in your face and you smile at them and you go, oh, let's do this. Then they realize this is not a good idea. Yeah. Little projection of power going on here. Thus we may that there are five essential oils for victory. He will win. Who knows when to fight and when not to fight. This is sort of like when we were doing Napoleon and and just about everything in the book, you can just stop and think about and it's, and it's also sorta like Jujitsu in that what you've learned, it's once you hear it, it seems super obvious, but why aren't you thinking about all the time? Right. And why do you make stupid mistakes that portray that rule?

Speaker 4:          00:12:24       Yeah. Cause it's not front of your mind, right? Yeah. It's like I said, the two. When you're emotionally charged, it's you just handle things way different, which it's kind of ironic in a way because that's what makes this so effective when people normally handle themselves in that emotional way. Yes, and that's what Vander yourself in this way. That's the very thing that makes it effective.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       Yeah. The underlying theme to this, the which hasn't been said, I mean he doesn't address this the way I addressed it, the way I talk about it in our book, the way we talked about on the podcast is the, the idea that you're talking about, which is the idea of detaching and not beat emotional so that you can do things so that you can make good decisions. Yeah. Next he will win. Who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all ranks.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       so if you're in a leadership position at, you got part of your team on board with the program, not good enough. You've got to get the whole team on board with the program. That's who's going to win.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       He will win. Who prepared himself, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared. I'm just going to wait until you're not ready. Why would I square up? You know, why would I do that? If you're ready to fight me, I'm not going to go. Let's just wait till you're not expecting it.

Speaker 4:          00:13:58       Yeah. Along with that emotional kind of state that some people are in where they, where they don't exercise these types of strategies along with the emotional state is the ego to stickle state. You know, the guy who was like, Hey, I'm just going to stand toe to toe. And you're like, all right. That's tough. That's, that's, you know, that might, it might make for a show in a fighting MMA situation in it. But as far as the strategy to win, that's again, it's cool for the show. But as far as winning, actually winning, um, it might not be the best. We'll just say that. Yeah, I would agree with you.

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       Number five, he will win. Who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       Victory lies in the, of those five points. So that means you, you can't get micromanaged. If you're being micromanaged by the, by higher powers, you're going to have problems. And here's the classic classic saying that everyone's heard. Hence the saying, if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself, but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will off also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       So you got to know yourself and that's the one that you know, that's, that's you, that's your team. That's you. That's why you got to learn. That's why you've got to study. That's why you got to train. That's why you got to test yourself too. It's why you got to put pressure on yourself because you don't know yourself unless you put yourself into those situations. Yup. Physically, mentally stress. That's what you want to go into so that you know yourself. Yeah. When we used to send CEO Paul, when we sent the opportunities over seas, they know what their limitations are. They been tested hard individually and as a unit. Yeah. Going on son Sue said, and this is actually that's a quote from the book, so I guess he must've wrote that because this is a allegedly a literal translation of the of of Sun Tzu and so he starts off his statements with Sun. Sue said the good fighters of old put first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy to secure ourselves against a feat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself. So he's going to talk about that more and it is laced throughout this book that you got to focus on your game. You got to focus on your what you can do in the situation now worried about them but like what can I do to be prepared,

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       put myself beyond the possibility of defeat. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for defeating the enemy going on, son Sue said the control of a large force is the same in principle as the control of a few men. It is merely a question of dividing up their numbers.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       Now when I wrote about that and Lafe and I talk about that all the time, that's decentralized command, dividing up the numbers and having subordinate leadership, running the teams and having sub more did leadership inside teams running smaller teams. That's all it is. The principle of control is the same. Now we get into a little bit of direct versus indirect. Again, a topic that I talk about all the time in all fighting the direct method bay may be used for joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory. Indirect tactics efficiently applied are inexhaustible as heaven and earth on ending as the flow of rivers and streams like the sun and moon. They end, but to begin a new like the four seasons they pass but to return once more.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       So he's talking about how when you get to indirect hacks, there's there, there are infinite numbers, infinite numbers of ways to approach things. There are not more than five musical notes yet. The combination of these. Note, these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard. There are not more than five primary colors yet in combination. They produce more huge than can ever be seen. There are not more than five cardinal tastes yet combinations of them yield flavors, more flavors than can ever be tasted in battle. There are not more than two methods of attack. The direct and indirect, yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers. The direct and indirect lead on to each other intern. It is like a moving circle. You never come to an end who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination.

Speaker 3:          00:19:35       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:38       he went a little, he would descriptive right there. He was obviously convinced as I am to that even though there's basic maneuvers, the the way that you apply them is limitless and that's one of the things that makes leadership hard. Cause when you're dealing with people, I mean there's, there's, there's a certain number of types of personalities you got to deal with, but then those personalities are all mixed together in a way that you have to react to them and treat them a certain way and how the two are the same and then you have to deal with how they interact with each other as well. And then not to mention the fact that they may or may not change as individual as the day goes on. As the day goes on, they start getting hungry, they start getting angry. Yeah, right. Well, well maybe they just watched a romantic comedy and they're feeling a little different. Let's hope that's not the case or whatever. I Dunno why I think romantic. All right. Back to Sun Su Sun sue said, whoever is in the first, in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy will be fresh for the fight. Whoever second in

Speaker 5:          00:20:47       the field and has to hasten to the battle will arrive exhausted. Therefore, the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him. Hear that all the time in MMA. Who's going to impose their will on this fight?

Speaker 3:          00:21:04       Hmm.

Speaker 5:          00:21:06       By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord. That's Bait, right? Or by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near. If the enemy is taking his ease, meaning if the enemy's trying to rest, he can harass him. If well supplied, he can starve them out. If quietly and camped, he can force him to move. So all these are just little things to basically annoy the enemy, right? Throw him off his game, throw him off of his game. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend march swiftly to places where you are not expected.

Speaker 3:          00:21:47       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:21:48       And Army May march great distances without distress. If he marches through country where the enemy is not, you can be sure of it's of succeeding in your attacks. If you attack places which are not defended, totally obvious, right? You can be sure of succeeding in your tax. If you attack places which are not defended.

Speaker 5:          00:22:12       And this is something that we do in Jujitsu, you know, you're attacking the NAC, you're attacking the NAC, they're protecting the neck there. Protect the neck, boom arm or you're going for Camille, you're going to freaking mirror, you're going for Canberra. Boom. Straight arm mock other arm. Yeah. Big One is you, when you fake a submission to go for a guard pass or something, that's not a submission, you know? Yeah. Cause it, it throws your mind off. Like Greg does it really well where he'll go for that guillotine and you're like, oh he's going for a submission. So your mind, it's one thing to be like, okay, I see he's going from my neck and then get my arm could be exposed. It's, that's one thing because you're thinking, okay, this submission to this next submission, but if it's, you know, if they're going for something completely different, different aspect of the game, it throws you off even more.

Speaker 5:          00:22:58       He's got me with that like three times in a row before. Yeah. That's basically going to even further to the flank. Yeah. Yang, some, you know, you're expecting this, somebody to shoot you with a machine gun. They start lobbing mortars at you. Yeah. You weren't ready for that at all. Or they start like taking your guys' hostage it in the, went back through the back door or something like that. You know? Completely different. Yeah. You can ensure the safety of your defense if you hold only positions that cannot be attacked. How obvious is that? Yeah. Let's just get in positions where we can't be attacked and then we will defend them very easily.

Speaker 3:          00:23:35       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:23:36       The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known for. Then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points,

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       and his forces being thus distributed in many directions. The numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately, phew. So you don't want to let the enemy know where you're gonna attack him because then he can defend that specific area. Whereas if he has to defend all of his areas, he's got less people defending where you're going to attack. We did that really well in World War II, the d day, you know they, the Germans did not know. They were suspect where we were going to attack, but they didn't know it was Normandy, so they had a lot of defenses strewed about and other areas and costume.

Speaker 2:          00:24:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       Now here we go with how we deal with what the enemy does. Four should the enemy's strength in his van, which van is like the division at the front. It's the front of your troops van. That's why they like the term fan. Guard is like your front front guard. Four should the enemy strengthen his van? He will weakened his rear should he strengthened his rear, he will weaken his van. Should he strengthened his left? He will. Weaken is right. Should he strengthened his right? He will weakened his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere week

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       and that's what you know. Again, going into Jujitsu when someone is, when you feel in passing and they're locking you and they're thinking about a knee lock and [inaudible], they got all those things going on at the same time and you're just trying to spread your defenses then then when they do one of those three you're in trouble and I always explained to people, you know when you, it's easy, it's pretty easy for anybody. If you tell me how I'm going to try and straighten out your arm and that's my whole focus is to stop you for straighten my arm. It's you know, I can do it. I can do it pretty well. I'm well defended on that area. There is no opening somewhere else. Right and the same thing with guard passing. If I'm trying to pass your guard all tight, low and heavy and you're just defending, defending, defending, that means there's an opening somewhere else probably far away from you. Yeah, super common one with guard passing is you know, you smashed to the, you know one side, right? You're smashing, smashing to one site and then you hop your hip though to the other site wide open all the time. And the harder you smashed, the more wide open that far side is. Yeah, that's a common one. Yeah. It's just a, it's just a distraction. And then a flank, son Sue's been doing it for 2,500 years. Ang. All right. Do not repeat the tactics would you have gained?

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:26:14       you're on victory. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you won victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.

Speaker 2:          00:26:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:25       Military tactics are like unto water for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downward. So in war, the way to avoid what is strong is to strike what is weak. Now, this is something that we definitely got raised within seal teams. You don't use the same methodology over and over and over again and development pattern. You don't do it no matter how minor you change things up, you change things up. And that's something that any good military unit does. It's something that any, anybody that's uh, being, uh, threatened. You know, if your life is in danger, you don't set a pattern on what you do, you change it up.

Speaker 2:          00:27:08       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:27:10       Water shapes its course according to the ground over which it flows. The soldier works out his victory in relation to the Foa whom he is facing, therefore, just as water retains no constant shape. So when warfare, there are no constant conditions.

Speaker 1:          00:27:36       You got to have an open mind. You can't get trapped inside your own tactics. You can't get trapped inside your own game. And I see this with businesses we work with, with companies that we work with, where they have got their thing that they've done and they've been successful for six years running, and then all of a sudden something changes and they're trying to run the same methodology without ever stepping back and saying, wait a second. We did well. We had a 12% growth average for the past six years, and all of a sudden we're down 22%. What happened? Well, let's just do what we did before again and again. That's what, that's what, how people spiral into a bankruptcy. Why? Because the conditions change, the conditions change field and they don't look and say, oh, the enemy adapted, the competitor's adapted. You know, we can look at some of these businesses that have gone on. I mean, the music industry has changed dramatically. No cds. I mean, imagine if you owned a CD production warehouse somewhere. I mean, you wouldn't [inaudible] cds. Yeah. Tower records. Classic example. Yeah. Yeah. And, and back to the [inaudible] doing the same

Speaker 4:          00:28:49       thing over and over again. Like, you know, if you succeed with this one, you know, method, it's like salespeople, salespeople, they really low. A lot of them, they really look at sales as this kind of war. You know, it's me get someone makes the sale. Either you sell them your product or they sell you why they can't buy whatever. Um, when you see as a consumer, when you see the low, especially from sales people directly, when you see the same

Speaker 4:          00:29:16       language over and over, after a while you like, I see exactly what you're doing. I see what you're doing. You know how they ask you. They'll ask you a question that if you say no to you look dumb or something like that. Yeah. So I dunno if they say yes 15 times in a row and then yeah, they'd be like, oh obviously right. And you're like, I can't, you kind of feel like you can't say no, but after a while you're like, I see what you're doing. You know, so let me work. Cause then they probably teach them that, you know? So if it's like, oh yeah, that works. That's, that works. That works.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       But yeah, it was starting to get hip to it. Stuff won't work anymore. Not, it's definitely not gonna work on that cove, Charles. No, no, no. I see what you're doing. I see what you guys are doing. All right. And this is just restating the same thing. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning may be called a heaven born captain.

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       So if you can look at what your opponent's doing, and this is something that, again, I see companies do it. I see Jujitsu players do it. They have that one thing that they're used to and then someone's really good at defending that one thing and they just keep going against to keep going against, to keep going against it and keep running into that brick wall and it's not going to get you where you want to be. Yeah, it's problematic. Here we go from Sun Su, a soldier spirit, his keenest in the morning. By noon day it has begun to flag and in the evening his mind is bent only on returning to camp. A clever, a clever general therefore avoids an army when it's spirit is keen but attacks when is sluggish and in Thai inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods. I liked that. The Art of studying moods. This is about knowing people. Yeah. That kind of like the guy in Jujitsu class who shows up 15 minutes before the class ends when everyone's been rolling. Yeah. Yeah. He's getting everyone on there and sluggish, threatened to go back to camp like, hey guys, want to roll off fresh?

Speaker 3:          00:31:20       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight. Do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. Do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that's returning home as a good one. They're going, they're running. Let them run. Let them go home. They're going to fight hard to get home, right? They got visions of their family and their head. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free. Do not press a desperate photo too hard, and this is something you see psychologically a lot. You know with an argument, you got a couple of executives and maybe the senior executive has a plan and no one likes the plan. Well, you just don't want to box him in and prove them wrong in front of everybody, right? You don't want to do that. You want to be crafty. We want to get yourself sued together. You want to leave them a little opening where he can say, you know what? After reconsidering, I've decided I want to go with this other way because figured out that

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       blah, blah, blah. I give them an out. Yeah. What you don't want to do is make him stick to this bad plan because his ego is making them stick there.

Speaker 2:          00:32:52       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:32:53       Recognize,

Speaker 2:          00:32:58       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:33:00       Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions when you're doing Jujitsu. Don't, when someone gets across side, you scramble, you go crazy. Don't let him settle there. When somebody is trying to get that Kogi color up underneath your head and they're going to have you trapped. Don't let them get there. Don't, don't linger in dangerously isolated positions. Move. Yeah. Yeah. It's W it's, it gets so complex with this and in Jujitsu worked. So just get considered what, just what you said, because this is kind of, it kind of overflows into the another part that you just talked about. So let's say the example of the guy passing your guard into your site control. Right. During his pass you said don't let him settle. Exactly. So, but when he, let's say whatever, you lose the fight for whatever reason, any does settle. Now you're faced with a situation where if he settled on you hard, where he's, you can tell he's putting strength into holding that position and you then you try to scramble, you're going against, you're going full speed, you know, toe to toe like Oh, he said not to do.

Speaker 5:          00:34:05       So at that point you got a change strategy. If you had, had already lost that battle, you and he settled and he's putting his, his energy into holding you, now you got to play another tactic that he said, let him, you know, you got to relax a little bit. And so he starts relaxing a little bit. You know what I mean? It's like that's a common thing that's like, you know, a pretty well known strategy, I would say. When you, when you get advanced and you do too, but it's crazy how he just lays it out. And that's the perfect exact exact example. Yeah. All in one little one little move, one little movement.

Speaker 5:          00:34:40       And actually he continues on that. Same, on that same thread in hemmed in situations. In other words, when you're surrounded in your, you're under the bad situation, you must resort to stratagem and stratagem doesn't really mean strategy. It means like tricks or deceptions. So you've, you've given up, you've, you've, you've given up your position. The person is dominating you now and exactly what you're saying is correct. When someone has got you in that position, either in an argument or a plan or a situation that you're in a relationship, they've got you locked down, stop fighting. Yup. You, it's not going to work. You're, they've got you. If you continue to struggle, you just going to wear yourself out. You're going to worsen the scenario stop and now you have to start thinking about a trick to get out of there. So I'm kind of a better tactic, some kind of a deception, something to get you out of there because

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       going strength to strength isn't going to do it. They're in a superior position. You know, sometimes you can tell someone's doing that if you have them in a situation and they start actually using this tactic. Little strict, a little tricks. One that I've been able to recognize is they do like some ad Hominem fucking argument. They'll start attacking something else. Yeah, yeah, of course. But it's a, yeah. If you, if you kind of have a handle on the whole situation, it's real obvious. Yeah. Yeah. And then he says, in a desperate position, you must fight. Now the difference here is now there's a submission. Hold on you. Yeah. No choice. You have to fight. You're going to fight fighter. You're gonna tap. Yeah. So you get that situation where it's gone beyond just their secure and they've, they've got you in a dominant position, but now they're actually going to kill you. Right. You have no choice but to buy the last level of settling. Now this is interesting. There are roads which must not be followed. Armies, which must not be attacked. Towns which must not be besieged positions, which must not be contested commands of the sovereign, which must not be obeyed.

Speaker 3:          00:36:48       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:36:52       So it's always interesting to me when you hear somebody that's a military mastermind and they're saying that there are orders from their sovereign that must not be obeyed.

Speaker 3:          00:37:07       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       And I think we've heard that, and this is something that people aren't familiar with the military or aren't familiar with military history. They think everyone just follows. Orders, follows, orders, follows orders. But Napoleon we've heard say it, Sun who we've heard say it. We've heard these repeated things where people say, you know what, that's the wrong order and I'm not going to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:28       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       And it's interesting too, the other dichotomy has all these people talk about the necessity of discipline and inherit and discipline is absolutely the following of orders. But as much of as stringent as I am about discipline, hmm. If I'm, I want my guys to question my worst, I want them to say, Hey, wait a second. Why is Jocko making us do this? He's, he's wrong. I don't want them just obeying me blindly.

Speaker 3:          00:37:55       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       Is You don't want your team obeying you blindly. You don't want that. You want them to be thinking back to the book. The Art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him. Not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position on the salient ball. So what that is, again, he's putting the the preponderance of the outcome, not on what the enemy does, but on what you do.

Speaker 3:          00:38:31       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:38:32       It's not what happens is not what happens to in your life. It's what you do. It's what's you prepare for. It's your own readiness that's going to affect the outcome, not the chance of what the enemy's done done. It's how have you made your position? How have you set yourself up? How have you prepared? How have you trained? How have you worked? That's where the outcome comes from. Not what the world does to you, but what you do to the world. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general one recklessness, which leads to the destruction to cowardice, which leads to capture. So those two, you got one guy that's a maniac that doesn't care. He's going to go get after it. He's going to die. You've got someone else that's a coward. He's going to get captured. Three, a hasty temper that can be provoked by insults. Dangerous, a delicacy of honor that is sensitive to shame. Sort of the same thing. And then over solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble and oversell a stew. That's basically you over affectionate. You care about the men so much that exposes you to worry and trouble. These are the five per setting sins of a general ruinous to the conquer, ruinous to the conduct of war.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       Some things to watch out for it. It's interesting, you know, obviously the one that's, that's I guess the most controversial to me is that over solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry in trouble because you know, in the modern military, you know, he was dealing with conscripts. So even eat, it's interesting, even conscripts back then he's saying, hey, you could get too affectionate with your conscripts and now we have brothers and so you're gonna, you're gonna care about your guys, you're going to care about your guys more than anything else in the world. But what you have to counter that with is not, hey, I'm not going to care about them. No, it's, I'm going to make sure I do everything I can to keep them safe. Yeah. Yeah. I think

Speaker 4:          00:41:09       like, you know how in, in a lot of companies they discourage fraternizing with your coworkers. So I used to work in the nightclub industry where, you know, from time to time people would

Speaker 1:          00:41:21       hookup. So what that can can

Speaker 4:          00:41:26       result in is, um, you know, people who are too focused on the relationship between each versus

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       their job go or, yeah. So there's a total assumption, but maybe that's what he's talking about exactly what he's talking about. That's exactly what he's talking about. And, but if you take that into the military scenario, it's, you know, like I said, you're going to care about your guys so much and you have to counter that with the fact that you have a duty and you have, you have a job and that everybody on your team, like we were in the seal teams, you all know the risk. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody knows the risk. Everybody knows that when you go on an operation, it might be your last operation. You get hit with an ID, you get shot, you get mortared, you get blown up. I mean, everybody accepts that risk and that therefore as a leader, you know you're not imposing that risk upon them.

Speaker 5:          00:42:21       They volunteered for that risk and I think that's what allows a modern military commander to to say, Hey, I love these guys, but they all know what they signed up for. There's going to be risk here and we've got a job to do as opposed to, Hey, I love these guys. They don't want to be here and I'm going to send them to their deaths. That would not, that would be a different scenario or harder scenario or you got clothes. Let's say you know you're, you're in command of you know, 10 guys, five of those guys are your best friends and you get too attached in the sense that you have a mission that you have to do a dangerous one, but you're like, Hey, I'm not going to send those five guys because they're going to be at risk. I want to keep them safe, you know, so I don't want to send them there.

Speaker 5:          00:43:09       The other five guys go rather than the 10. And you know, messes up your whole, your whole job. Which oddly enough, I always sent like the guys, I love it. Worst scenario, all my brothers, they would be lining up and saying, I'm going, I'm going. I was fired up. Siva. Yeah. I mean, you're obviously very specific type of person and you guys probably are too, I would imagine. Um, but still it, you're still exercising that discipline between, you know, them potentially going to their death and that job you guys have to do. So you're, you're thinking of it in a smarter way. Know what's interesting, I just thought of this like if a guy got in trouble for whatever reason, when we were over on deployment, whenever I was on deployment combat, if a guy got in trouble, you know what their punishment would be.

Speaker 5:          00:43:56       You're not allowed to go on a mission. I know. So just so that just tells you what kind of an attitude. Yeah. You know, the guys that we're working with, it's like, oh, you can't go on these next three missions. Yeah, guys are angry because they realize they're letting their buddies down and if something goes wrong and they're not there, it's a nightmare. Yeah. And their, their, their duty, their job is, is it's part of them. You know, where I was listening to this thing where he's talking about this, the Amish Amish people. Right. And they're really into work, you know, hard work and stuff. So one of the punishments for the kids would be, you're not allowed work. Yeah. It's the same.

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       It's like saying it's like there. Yeah. Same thing. Yeah. Meanwhile, my kids, I got a beat them senseless to get them to do any work. Just kidding. Just kidding. But I guarantee they're not working as hard as some Amish kid out in the field.

Speaker 4:          00:44:49       Yeah. Putting up buildings with the wood nails that they do. I mean, yeah. It's awesome. Yeah. The work is obviously part of their identity, you know, so like, you know, it's certain things people, let's say quote unquote normal people might find like, like exercise for example. Like if, so if let's say you're just an average person who's like, man, I got to, I'm going to make a new year's resolution. I'm going to lose some weight or whatever, I'm going to get a trainer. It's hard for them. It's worked for them. Right? So if the trainers like, Hey, today's rest day, and they'd be like, oh, sweet. You know, but then you take you, for example, like how you were saying your wife is like, hey, maybe don't go to Jujitsu today. You're all pissed. Yeah. You know? So it's the exact opposite. But, so that's kind of the, the scenario when it, when it's ingrained in you and the, and it starts to become part of your identity work or not work. You want to, you want to get that done. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       That's interesting how those, those embedded feelings, yeah. Developing your life. But what an awesome deal. Like, if you think about that, we would actually, if we had to punish our guys would punish them by saying you can't go on to missions. Perfect. It'd be angry. Maybe both. It, it'd be let down. They'd like help everyone get ready and they'd stand there whenever it was leaving and learn their lesson for sure. Heard him. Hold on. All right, next when the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       This is a good one. So when you, when you're, when you're in Jujitsu, when someone for instance pulls guard real quick, you know, they've got a good guard. You know, when someone's like all standing up and, and all upright and reaching for your color while you're standing, you know, they got some judo going on. So it's funny how when when people have a dominant position, they'll lean towards it. Yeah. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait. Hmm. So if it looks, if it looks too good to be true, it's too good to be true. You've got to watch that when there is much running about, it means that the critical moment has come when some are advancing and some retreating. It is a lure. When soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want to food. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves. The army is suffering from thirst. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to it, the soldiers are exhausted. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about sedition is afoot.

Speaker 2:          00:47:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:50       When an army feeds it's horses with grain and kills it's cattle for food and when the men do not hang their cooking pots over the campfires showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death. The sight of men whispering together in small knots and speaking and subdued tones points to dissatisfaction amongst the rank and file.

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       now the all those right there. What I really like about those because some of them are obviously are a little bit archaic, you know, people leaning on their spears, people, uh, not putting out there cooking pots. Those aren't things that we're going to see today. But what's so key about this is how observing how people act can tell you much more if you're paying attention to it. Yeah. You know, you see people talking amongst themselves and small group, there's a problem going on. Yup. You know, the, those are the kinds of things that you gotta be aware of as a, especially as a leader when you're in a leadership position and you, you see and you look and you watch and you've listened. Cause I see some people, some leaders, they get isolated from the troops. They get isolated from the situation, they get isolated from the enemy.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       They're not reading what's happening. Mm. So you've got to have this awareness and the sensitivity, right. It's a sensitivity. It's a sixth sense of, hey, something's not right here. And what are you picking that up from? Yeah. You know when you walk in a room, everyone's all talking or you see it from a distance people were talking and then when you either walk by or you joined them, they are there. They happen to be done talking every single time. That's not going to be a good side. They're talking back to the book. He, you exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them.

Speaker 2:          00:49:48       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       So when you're saying all, we'd have nothing to fear here, we can take these guys, we can win that contract. We can beat the opponent, we can win. That's when you're going to be taken down. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive. And unless submissive, they will be practically useless. If when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be useless. Therefore, soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. This is a certain road to victory. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well disciplined. So now you do realize that Sun Su 2,500 years ago was leading humans and if you came out of the gate before they knew you and you treated them bad, they were never going to work for you. They will never going to submit to what you want to do.

Speaker 3:          00:50:57       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       And once they were attached to you, if you had punishments and now you had built enough respect and then you said you were going to punish them for something that they did you, you set a certain standard and then you don't hold it, they're going to be equally useless. Yup. Inconsistent inconsistency. I firmly believe in if, if in training soldiers commands are habitually in forced, the army will be well disciplined. You got to stay consistent and you got to remember that you're dealing with humans.

Speaker 3:          00:51:32       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       When common soldiers are too strong and their officers are too weak, the result is insubordination. And this is something that I saw a couple of times in my career where I had a guy that worked for me who was a tough guy. This happened a couple times, just a bad ass guys. Super tough beast, hardcore go getter. And when they work for me, man, I loved him and they did anything. I would tell him to go, you know, run through a brick wall. They would start running and they would run through the brick wall. They'd figured out they'd get through that thing super hard.

Speaker 3:          00:52:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:15       And then, uh, one guy I like, I went to another team and he went on another deployment and got sent home from deployment because he was just too much to handle. And his support, he didn't, I talked to him about he goes off, my officers were weak. He literally said my officers were week. Okay. And so here is, is like a caged animal that if you don't, if he doesn't know who, but who are the bosses and he doesn't respect the boss, he's not gonna listen you, he was the Alpha male. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And when he was the Alpha Male, he was doing whatever you want. It wasn't listening to these people that were in charge of him. Hmm. Yeah. What is that like a like a mix of like he doesn't, I don't know if they look up to him, but there's a sense of that right?

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       Where a if, if your leader is, it's just respect you had that kind of ingrained respect and then not to mention on top of that you don't fear any real consequences from him. Cause thing, you know, it's kind of weak. I can take whatever you can dish out kind of thing. So it's both of those you think? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. This one guy that, that this happened with, I taught him Jujitsu and he was excited about it in a way that I've never seen anyone excited, like super happy about knowing that you could choke people and, and he would get into fights in the civilian world and come and give me these full debriefs and ask me for like pointers and judgment. And that was, you know, a warrior that like to fight. Yeah. He found out that you could grab people and then submit them.

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       He was super excited about it. Like a little kid. And I always say that that's kind of the, the risk you run with teaching people Jujitsu cause it is like I'm going to, it's a super power essentially because you don't have to learn that much for it to be effective in this huge way. So you know like kind of like superman with great power comes great responsibility. Yeah. Yeah. It goes on to say when the officers are too strong and the common soldiers two weeks, the result is collapse. So when you put the super hardcore guy over that can't modulate his, his leadership, he can't back off and build people up before he starts to smash him. You're going to get claps and that's something you definitely got to look out for it. If you, especially if you're a super strong leader and you come and take over a team that's been led by somebody that's weak, there's a chance that the players and the team are weak and now you've got to come in and you got to build them up before you let loose your vicious leadership power. Right? You can't just come in there with the Iron Fist and start dropping hammers. No. You need to say, hey guys, all right, let's go. Let's build this team up. Then you can, you can escalate your own force as your subordinates grow and become powerful themselves, but you don't want there to be a huge gap between your power. Yeah, and theirs because they won't, they won't develop into it. They'll just be in the shadow. They won't grow in the shadow. You got to come down and let some light get to them and let them grow. Right

Speaker 1:          00:55:22       when the general was weekend without authority, when his orders are not clear and distinct, when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men and the ranks are formed in a Slava and Lee haphazard manner, the result is other disorganization.

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       pretty clear. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight. Even though the ruler forbid it. If fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the rulers bidding. Once again, disobeying the chain of command. Sun Sue himself disobeying the chain of command.

Speaker 2:          00:56:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:15       This is a big one. The general who advances without coveting fame had retreats without fearing who's only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign is the jewel of the kingdom. So that guy that's not doing this to get famous, that's not doing this for awards. It's not doing this to get promoted. It's not being brave to be promoted. He's doing this to protect the country

Speaker 1:          00:56:47       or to carry out the mission, not doing it for glory. And furthermore, the same person can retreat without feeling Micah disgraced. That means they're gonna protect their people without going all. We can't. We can't fall back. This person is the jewel of the kingdom, the jewel of the kingdom, and it's beautiful. Your work for people like that. You know that what they're trying to do, what they're trying to do, good. They're trying to do their mission. They're trying to do good for the country that tried to do good for the team. They're trying to do good for the business. That's what we're trying to do. They're not trying to get promoted. They're not trying to get an award. They're not trying to get a good fitness report or a good evaluation. They're trying to do a good job. And that's why when people ask me a lot, you know, all, I've got this boss that wants to get the credit for everything, give it to them.

Speaker 4:          00:57:31       Yeah. Give it to them. Let them look good. Don't do it for, don't do it for your glory. Give that glory away. It feels good to give glory way. Give it away. I told you he used to work in the nightclub right back when I was young and kind of the protocol would be to, you know, we'd, we'd work or whatever and the bartenders would give us tips on like a little sound clips, right? So at the end of the week you'd be kind of pooled, right. And we'd get some tips at the end of the week. That's cool. Whatever. And um, so my boss, so it was back when I first started, my bought the head door guy, right? He was at the end of the week, he called his own little meeting with us and we're like, all right. So he kind of goes over some stuff. I don't even know what it was and um, and he busted at the end.

Speaker 4:          00:58:22       He's like, Oh hey guys. Uh, so yeah, we have tips. So what I did was, you know, hey, you guys are doing a great job. So what I did was I, I, I took my tips and I gave it to you guys and he kind of had this look on his face looking at us as if he needed us to be like, wow, that was so great. But you know, when the look is so transparent, he's like, so I was like this guy, it's like so disingenuous. You know? Like he, he wanted the credit and he wanted to speak like, aw, thank you. Thank you. You know, it wasn't that much by the way. This is, you know, it's $14 each if that. Cause we got to divide it up anyway. But yeah, that was like is the clear example of that very thing right there where he's given us the tips. I know what he did that, yeah. Okay. You lost 14, my youngest daughter, she does good deeds for the sole purpose of increasing

Speaker 1:          00:59:18       birthday present Christmas present.

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       Does it that kind of go into a different strategy altogether though? You know, it's pretty, it's pretty cute. And you see this six year old like Daddy, I decided it would be really great if I picked up your socks. Right. Wait, they, since my birthday is coming. Right. But that's a, that's another tactic. It's like, it's called for a super cool something like when you do something and then, yeah, yeah, yeah. But what that it's effective. W uh, uh, heart accretion is used to do it. They'd be like, you know what? Hey, hey, um, you know what? Whatever their messages. And they'd be like, Hey, take this free gift. And they give you like, I dunno, a flower or a book or something and they know that that will leave you, that the typical person, they'd leave them with a feeling of Dang. Like I kind of, Oh, this person, he, he was so nice to me. I can't just walk off and be a Dick, you know, so I'll give you five bucks or dollar. Yeah. Especially when you recognize they're doing it. In fact that you do yourself a disservice to fall for it because they're going to keep doing it. You know? It's basically guilting someone in to do something, but it's called a reciprocal recipe. I don't know. Something reciprocal, something. Well, I guess we'll look that up and figure it out later. Otherwise, what's called reciprocal something.

Speaker 4:          01:00:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       All right. Now, here we go. This is speaking to kids. This is awesome. Regard your soldiers as your children and they will follow you into the deepest valleys. Look on them as your own beloved sons and they will stand by you even unto death. Completely true statement, completely true statement. If however, you are indulgent, been unable to make your authority felt kind hearted, but unable to enforce your commands and incapable moreover of quelling disorder, then your soldiers must be likened to spoil children. They are useless for any practical purpose. I think that speaks for itself. If you are so lenient with your troops, when they say indulgent, that's what I mean to me to like super lenient. Yeah. When you're lenient with your troops, when you can't make your authority felt, when you're super kind hearted, you're unable to enforce your commands, all those things are gonna end up with a spoiled little kids for troopers and they're not gonna, they're gonna be worthless. I got a little saying about kids, lay it on me. If you had, if you're helping them, you're hurting them. Think about it. If you're helping them, you're hurting them. Yeah. You want me to tie your shoe, tie yourself because what? That when they tie their shoes that literally, uh, trains their fine motor skills.

Speaker 5:          01:02:21       If you want them, you know, if they want a glass of water, go get your own glass of water. Right? They want help moving something across the hallway. You move it across the hallway. If you're helping your kids, you're hurting your kids. Right. And I could take it one step further and say, if you're hurting your kids, you're helping kids. I'm not going to do that few far. Really. I do think about that. When your kids ask you for something, you got to say, okay, is this something they can do themselves? Even if it's a struggle for them, even if it's a challenge for them. I mean for a while my daughter was late for school and Oh can you just tie my shoes? No, I can't tie your shoes. You can tie your shoes. Right. And that's when they work on their fine motor skills and that's when they learn that they can, that they have to get the skill and they become more self reliant.

Speaker 5:          01:03:09       Yeah. Yeah. Fully in. And obviously I'm not going to wage some kind of semantical battle with you or nothing like that, but it depends on what you mean by help. So that, and I talked about this before, where you have systemic help, indirect help. So systemic health is exactly what you're doing. Tie your own shoes. How about you? How about I teach you to tie your shoes or how would I prepare you for this shoe tying world that you're about to embark in? That's systemic health. That's the real help in my opinion. Same thing. Like a homeless person. You give a homeless person a dollar that's direct health, that doesn't help, that's hurting them as you would. So what is that called? Direct cal direct to give your children direct around Systemic Hill you, your job is to prepare kids to do everything I do. That's in a perfect world.

Speaker 5:          01:03:54       Everything on their own by the time they will, and you actually can prepare a human to do everything on their own because at least you prepare them to face a challenge. Research how to overcome it, practice overcoming it and then overcome it. It's so easy if you teach them, if you, if you teach them, you know, you say you can give them a fish or you can teach them how to fish, you can teach them to learn how to fish on their own. That's what you really want to do. Yes. That on a tee shirt. Yeah, that's it. That's absolutely correct. Great. So if you go the more systemic, you could probably end up breaking it down into maybe three things and you know, whatever those things are, I know they're going to have something to do with how to think, how to manage your emotions, how to adapt a lot of the real basic things that are going to in one way or another, apply to everything.

Speaker 5:          01:04:42       Yeah, it's interesting that you go from, this isn't back in the book. I went back to the conversation back to the book then. It's funny how you're, you're talking about Sun Tzu or to war and we're talking about kids, we're talking about business, talking about nightclubs, talking about Jujitsu. All right, back to the book. Now for real, those who are called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy's front and rear to prevent cooperation between his large and small divisions to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officer's from

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       rallying their men.

Speaker 1:          01:05:21       So when you are looking at your opponent, what can you do to split them up? What can you do to interfere with what they're trying to make happen? That's a skill set in its own. So instead of worrying about attacking you and mourn about, I'm focused on dispersing you or splitting you up instead of worrying about attacking you, I'm worried about hindering people from helping you. Hmm. It's, it's a different way of thinking about waging a battle. He said, if thinking about the battle itself, what other ways are there to go about this? Hmm. More creatively. Rapidity is the essence of war. Take advantage of the armies of the enemies. Unreadiness make your way by unexpected routes and attack unguarded spots.

Speaker 3:          01:06:12       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:06:13       Yeah. Here we go. Back to the human side of things. Carefully study the wellbeing of your men and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength. Keep your army continually on the move and devise unfathomable pat plans. Now this is interesting. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape and they will prefer to fight. They will prefer death to flight.

Speaker 3:          01:06:45       Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       Officers and men alike, we'll put forth their utmost strength at the critical moment. The leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him.

Speaker 3:          01:07:02       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking pots.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       It's a second time we've heard about those cooking pots, obviously that depth and that meant something back in the day that meant it's on. We're not coming back. We're no, no need for dinner tonight. Right. But that's an attitude to have. And it's interesting, you know, this is, this is somewhat contradictory, some of what the other things that he said in the book, you know, if, if the, if the enemy is strong, fade away. And now he's saying put your soldiers in a position where there's no escape. So that's contrary. But I, I, I understand. I think I understand. Or the way I translate that is if you have to put your, if you have to accomplish something very challenging and you have no choice, step into it, step into it, kick away the ladder, break your cooking pots and let the guys know we're not coming back from this. We have what? One choice and that's victory all in thus or sorry, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the key VA.

Speaker 2:          01:08:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:08:19       Key Viva, which means, uh, who goes, which means on watch key Viva without waiting. This is the important part. Without waiting to be asked. They will do your will without restriction. They will be faithful without giving orders. They can be trusted.

Speaker 2:          01:08:38       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:08:38       so then you get the pure decentralized command where we're without waiting to be asked to do something, they're going to do it. That's what you want your troopers to do. They will do. You will without restrictions, they will be faithful. You don't have to hold onto him. You don't have to give him commands. You don't have to give them orders. They're going to be faithful to you.

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       Without giving orders, they can be trusted. That's true. Decentralized command and that's what you want.

Speaker 2:          01:09:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:09:14       And then to wrap this one up, unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise.

Speaker 2:          01:09:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       Meaning we want everyone to think, hey, we want everybody be on the same page. Move. Not unless you see an advantage. Use Not your troops, unless there is something to be gained. Fight. Not unless the position is critical. Again, that's contrary to what what I just talked about. But I think the reason he said that is because sometimes you have to, sometimes you get into decisive situation. You have to fight, you have to win. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen.

Speaker 2:          01:10:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10:11       And Spleen. When he says that, that used to be where people thought that the seat of emotion was so your emotion came from your spleen. So He's saying what you've been saying the whole night. No rulership put troops in the field merely to gratify his own emotions. And that emotion could be anything, could be pride. It could be irritation, beat anything. No general should fight a battle simply out of peak. And that's, that's pride and ego. It is to your advantage to make a forward move, make a forward move

Speaker 2:          01:10:53       if not,

Speaker 1:          01:10:56       stay where you are.

Speaker 2:          01:10:59       Such

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       is the art of war, obviously so much to be learned from the past, from the ancients

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       and also it's so accessible, but there's so many lessons to be learned. Their lessons that if you learn their mistakes that you don't have to make yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:11:27       All you have to do is open a book. Eight, open your mind and you'll be there.

Speaker 5:          01:11:42       And I think we get now go to questions from the interwebs. Let's do it. But before that,

Speaker 3:          01:11:50       mm.

Speaker 5:          01:11:52       Internet stuff up, go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko and why do you want to do that? Get some good stuff. Yeah. Good sell supplements, shroom tech. If you're, um, if you're into high intensity workouts for, you know, some prolonged period of time gives you, gives you that, that, that boost in that sustenance as far as output goes. Um, Alpha brain helps your mind work. That's the ones that I think we, that I recommend and the warrior bar, Do yourself that favor in life. And I do the Krill oil, of course, Krill oil. I went to a meeting this week, they had a big old stack of warrior bars when I went, they were in the game, my boy Zack was in the game down there. That'll surely enhance the meeting for sure at warrior who did powered me up. Also, if you get in the mood to support this podcast, go to Jocko podcast.com before you shop@amazon.com click on that, that little link there, and you can, you know, kind of passively support to Jocko podcast, boom. Or get some shirts if you like them, Jocko, store.com or a mug coffee mug up before the enemy. Both.

Speaker 3:          01:13:10       First Question

Speaker 5:          01:13:14       Jocko as an overthinker, you missed some factors. Anxiety, low confidence, low Iq or Iq, perfectionism and often a failure to prioritize. Yeah, so this is a question from the last podcast, right? And this guy just sent me this tweet and I thought it was a good assessment, right? Cause I'm not an overthinker and maybe this guy is, and sorry, I don't have his Twitter call sign there, but um, and he, maybe he's an overthinker so he kind of knew about it. If you don't remember the question, you know someone that overthinks things, they get analysis paralysis, right? They just start thinking and thinking and thinking they're frozen from their own thoughts. Too many thoughts. And so I thought these were good little factors here. And it basically, to me, it all boils down to actually fear because if you're thinking then you're not taking action. And if you're not taking and there's no consequences and if there's no consequences and there's nothing to be afraid of. So I think that the overthinking can be an excuse for actual fear. And same thing with like, oh, I'm a perfectionist. That's also a fear. It's fear of not being perfect. And then on top of that, low confidence, well, if you have low confidence, guess what? You're afraid your confidence is low, you're not sure yourself. So you sit around and think about doing it instead of actually doing it

Speaker 5:          01:14:44       and then anxiety. Well, yeah, anxiety actually is fear. You're afraid to do something. And then Iq. Now that might be, I guess maybe someone has a High Iq and therefore they're thinking a lot. And maybe that's not fear, but let me ask you a question. If you're so smart, then why aren't you taking the action and making something happen? So you've got a big Iq that's no excuse to sit around and overthink things, especially because if you're so smart, why can't you come up with a quick solution to why can't you realize that overthinking is actually causing the problem harm? It's not moving the problem forward.

Speaker 5:          01:15:23       So quit thinking so much and take action. Next question. Okay. He's, he's talking about the Tim Ferris, the video with the extension of your Tim Ferris. Yeah. Yeah. You're talking about martial arts or martial arts. What are the best martial art? If you haven't seen that and you can look it up. Um, so he says with respect to the above mentioned video about your views on real martial arts. I have one quick question. You said that you came to your conclusion based on a sparring match between yourself in one of your fellow navy seals with the match between yourself and the traditional martial arts with 20 years experience of friendly sparring match typical and training where he was pulling his punches and strikes and strikes or was he attacking you with full force? From my observation, Jujitsu guys collect some headshots while going in for a takedown.

Speaker 5:          01:16:19       And if a traditional cut, a tikka karate practitioner doesn't hold back with this health, some devastating effects in the long run. Similar to what pro football's players experience. I would love to get your take on this. Someone who is real world experience. Okay. So first of all, I didn't come to a conclusion based on that one event. I mean that event influenced my thoughts today, but even right now, I don't have a conclusion. Someone could show me something today. It's possible that I go, wow, that worked really well. I never thought of that. And that's new dot. Now trumps everything else. It could happen. Not Likely though. Uh, my mind is still open, but that's not like they have seen a lot now. And that's particular scenario. He was usually, he wasn't using a striking, aren't a traditional striking her and he was using the grappling aren't

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       actually I kido and so he, he was grappling with me. He wasn't throwing punches at me, but it doesn't matter because I have sparred and, or fought with plenty of people over the years that we're absolutely trying to knock me out, no doubt about it. And the fact of the matter is it doesn't work. Um, even where this guy above like for instance, this guy and the question he says, if a traditional karate practitioner doesn't hold back, it would have the same devastating effect in the long run. Similar to what pro football players experience. That statement actually defeats itself because if you watch a football game, those guys get hit in the head the hundred times during a football game. And how often do they get actually knocked unconscious? Not very often. If you multiply whatever 10 players per side that are actually banging heads times, however, and he plays, you know, you're talking about thousand Mo, you know, probably more than a thousand head on head contacts and a football game and there might be one knockout in a game.

Speaker 1:          01:18:21       Sometimes there's no knockouts. Yeah, typically not. The fact of the matter is a hitting someone in the head is not a guaranteed knock out by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it rarely occurs. It actually rarely curves in boxing where two guys are trained to do that. So it's hard to knock somebody out and it's the same thing if you watch UFC, especially the early UFC. Yes. This was proven over and over again that yeah, the dude grapplers going to take some hits on the way in, but they're going to get in and they're going to take the person down and of, of course, do you have a puncher's chance? Of course you do. There is this a very small chance that when you shoot it on somebody they time and knee, are they time a punch and it happens to hit you right in the spot that knocks you out?

Speaker 1:          01:19:06       It does happen. It happens in UFC occasionally. If you look at the number of take downs to the number of knockouts that happened while the take down is going on, it's not a big number at all. Correct. So you don't want to rely on that as your formation of self defense at all. Now when things evolved eventually to where the strikers were wrestlers to and you got guys like chuck and you've got Tito and you got Randy where it wasn't their striking that was preventing the takedown. It was because they were bad ass wrestlers. That's what was stopping to take down. It had nothing to do with the way they punched. Yeah, so you really can't count on striking to stop a grappler. That is not a good plan to say, Hey, I'm going to get so good at striking that I'm going to stop a grappler that is not a good pant plant. Well you have to do is learn to grapple. You have to learn to wrestle, you have to learn Jujitsu. And, and the opposite side of that is you can't count on grappling to take down a striker because you that might know how to wrestle

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       and therefore you need to know how to strike. So it goes back to what I say all the time. You got to know how to graph and governor not a strike. Right? Yeah. And if he's um, he's talking, he says a traditional karate practitioner, traditional. So, and I'm assuming the, the only understanding of traditional is he doesn't do karate and Jujitsu. He's not a mixed martial artist. He just knows karate. So, yes. And I've taken crowded before and there was no take down defense. There was no takedowns, there was no functioning in any capacity on the ground. And so yeah, and how you say like, okay, over the longterm, okay, you're going to have head trauma and lasting damage if you take sustained head trauma, repetitive over the years, really we're worried about the next 42 seconds of the fight. That's about to happen, not the next three decades of my life where you can definitely break down.

Speaker 4:          01:21:07       Cause I took some head trauma. Exactly right. So you'd have to get, let's say that for the example of this question that your experience with this guy, he was a karate guy and he was going full speed and he didn't knock you out. We'll just assume that he didn't knock you up. You'd have to go. I'm just going to restate that. That is a very safe assumption to assume that the karate guy was not able to knock me out, that I was able to come in, you know, uh, a stand there. Good. Get it a good distance. Faking with my hands, touch his face a couple of times. He throws a big punch. I do a double leg take down, he's on his back. It's game over. Yeah. And by the way, go watch any youtube video of, you know, Jujitsu versus whatever. Right. And it's the same outcome every single time.

Speaker 4:          01:21:53       You know, occasionally there'll be one with a lot of hits because it's the, it's the chance knockout or the chance or something else happened. Yeah. But 99% of the time it's double leg take down slam on the ground. Game over. Yeah. Sorry. You can look at uh, who did Randy coach or a fight that pro boxer Tony James Toney. Yeah, I mean it was, it was that exactly. Here's you a a worldclass boxer. A professional boxer. What did Randy do? God inside took him down. Came over. Oh why didn't you knock them out? Cause you can't, right. You can't just, you can't just knock people out fully. And that's not to mention, and I'm, I mean I'm going to mention it but that it is not to mention that especially if you, if you practice the more self defense, like if it's heavily self defense oriented Jujitsu, one of the first things you learn is distance management.

Speaker 4:          01:22:43       One of the first things you learn, it's like you almost can't get past that element of it. So you will take hits. Of course. Maybe you will take it to the top of your head, shoulders or whatever. But yes, significant strikes to anything to warrant how it's stated here in the question. Um, long term term damage compared to football players. You back to your situation, you going with this guy, let's say he did go full speed, you would have to do probably 10 to 15 bouts of that every single day for a long time for you to have any sustained damage. And then so maybe if this guy is taking the long term strategic view that you should get to continuous bar me and hit me in the head until I'm 50 years old navy elistic disease. And maybe I'm saying maybe so. Cause if he's a traditional guy, he doesn't know how to manage the takedown.

Speaker 4:          01:23:32       So knowing how to manage the takedown makes your strikes more effective. You don't have that. Your strikes are not effective. So can you take one hit let's say, let's say you take five hits, right? You controlling the fight as much as Jujitsu does, even if you're not that high level versus the guy who doesn't know Jujitsu way outweighs this grossly to the point that these things are aside from the puncher's chance in effective and I think UFC one two three you know as before people start to get hip to the whole Jujitsu thing, but before people knew Jujitsu, they just knew there are other stuff that was the testing ground. That was the whole reason you'll see was invented by the way on. That's why those first few of are awesome. Yeah, you, you get to see these 250 and no bare knuckle kick boxer guys strong, you know, go in there with real quote unquote real fighting experience against the way smaller grappler Jujitsu guy and lose and it's act.

Speaker 4:          01:24:29       This is to go one step further. If you watch UFC too. Pat Smith, who's I want, he was one of my favorite guys by the way when I was watching. It's a kickboxer. He's bad ass guy to 10 solid racking guys, makes it to the finals against hoists. Gracie and hoists. Gracie didn't tap him out or he tapped them out. But now with a submission hold, he tapped him due to strikes. So grappler pounded out a striker guy. I'm not submissions. It was all punches. It was nowadays, no one would ever talk to that now. But I'm just saying only because they know if you don't know, you just think your dad. Yeah. Yeah. One guy, like I said before, long I tapped because he was claustrophobic. He just got mounted. But nonetheless, um, yeah, it's, it's hard to really reconcile really what this question, I don't know if it's implying anything.

Speaker 4:          01:25:17       Well, it's definitely implying that this guy that I was going against was like holding back. Right. And that might, uh, you know, pull the different tale if, but I've been against countless, literally countless of guys have sparred against me trying to talk me out whether they're traditional martial artists, whether they're just countless guys. Yeah. And it's hard to knock somebody out. Yeah. And I dunno, I don't know who, that's the question. Of course, I'm not going to hate on the question or nothing like that. But speaking from experience, this sounds like the exact question that inexperienced people have. You know, people who are, no, this is coming most likely from something that's been heavily involved in traditional martial arts and has been told that, hey, don't worry about somebody trying to take you down because if you just hit him here and here or they'll fall and you'll win. That's what I'm talking about. That's

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       not, that's not good. That's sort of why I put this in here. And you know, just to make sure that, um, that they realize that hey, you shouldn't, you should actually pay attention to what else is going on in the world instead of staying in like, Hey, just this one little traditional martial art. And it's the same thing with, if you're just doing Jujitsu and we're going to, I got this in here and later, there's another question about this, but I mean, I don't tell people just trained Jujitsu. I tell him, train, Jujitsu, change, wrestling, trained boxing chain, Moy, Tai, and you know what? When you get done with all that and you have a good base train Krav Maga and then you, you know what do realistic situation, by the way, you should learn how to shoot a gun and by the way, you should be in good shape. Do everything. Yeah. Yeah. Agreed. The answer is not the answer. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:26:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26:49       T shirt. Every time we say something like that, like one answer is not the answer, which I must admit, it sounds pretty cool. Pretty Dope. But we'll get, everyone's going to say, put that on a tee shirt. Hey, then I have to refer to echo to see if he's going to put it on a tee shirt. Yup. We'll see how that works out. All right. Next question. Is it better to reveal too much information or too little information? Both in personal life and leadership. Okay, so there's two sides to this, not just the personal and the business side, but in, in the business side, there's two pieces really. There's operational and planning, right? So if you've got something that you're planning for, whether you're a company and you're trying to plan a new strategy for the next quarter, the next year or the next company that you're going to open or the Newco, whatever you're going to do, there's that and you're planning that.

Speaker 1:          01:27:48       Then I want to, and and in the military, if you're planning an operation, you're putting together a mission that you're going to go do. In both those situations, I give everyone all the information that I have. Absolutely. I don't. I let them know everything that I know so that they can away everything. As much as I wait. In fact, I want them to toil with the, with the information more than I do so that I can kind of get a fresher look at it when I come in. So I, and I think I do and I did see people that would hold back information in those situations. Leaders that would hold back information. Why would they do that? Because they're insecure because knowledge gives you power and you use that knowledge to say you come in and echoes, got a good plan put together. And I go, yeah, but you got to think about this right here. And you just say, well, I didn't know that, but it gives me a little bit of leverage. It gives me a little bit of power. That's ridiculous. So when it comes to planning and operations and conducting business and planning missions, man, share all the information you've got in your organization, out of the organization. So everybody has the knowledge. That's answer number one. Then we get to the information regarding the leadership of humans.

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       And of course you hear words like transparency and we gotta be honest and you can hear those things getting thrown around and, and of course no one's going to argue with them, right? No one's going to argue and say, hey, you shouldn't be honest. No one's going to say you shouldn't be transparent. Right. But the fact of the matter is you cannot always share all the information all the time when it comes to leading people. You can't do it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:29:28       And here's the problem of why you can't do it because people can't always handle the truth. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:29:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       And when you give them the truth, they might have a bunch of different reactions. Right? Some of those reactions being anger and defensiveness. So in other words, if I tell someone, hey, I'm putting this other person in charge cause I don't think you're smart enough to figure out the solution. Yeah, that's my true statement. I'm going to be honest with you. I don't think you're smart. What does that do? How does that affect the mission? Does it move us closer to the goal? Are you, is that person now going to be really supportive of me and work hard knowing that I think they're stupid. The answers, of course not.

Speaker 3:          01:30:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:11       I mean another example is what if you think that your boss is planned is terrible. And so you go in there and say, Hey, your boss is terrible. Your, your plan that you came up with is awful. Now, there might be some bosses that are secure and their leadership and their secure with it and they go, aw man, why do you think that here? Break it down for me. That's cool. But a lot of bosses are going to be insulted by that. A lot of bosses, you're going to hurt their ego and instead of listening to the, to the idea that you have, instead they're going to be angered by it. They are going to turn it off, they're going to turn off, their minds are going to be mad at you. They're not going to listen to you anymore. Cause the way you came across so you would have been better off.

Speaker 3:          01:30:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:30:52       Not being quote unquote honest and not sharing all the information, you would have been better off slowly trying to take the plan that he came up with and maybe maneuver on it or maybe say, hey boss, I don't know if that's gonna work because of this thing over here. But you be tactful and there's a million examples we could talk of like that. And so when it comes to leading people, not operations, not planning missions, when it comes to leading people, you need to think, think about what you're saying, thinking of how it's going to impact the team. Think about how it's gonna impact the relationships up and down the chain of command. Think about how it's going to impact the mission. Because if you're a good leader, anywhere on that, anywhere in that chain of command, if you're a good leader, the most important thing you should be achieving the mission. So if your honesty is actually creating adversarial relationships inside your team, what good are you doing moving the mission forward? The answer is you're not. Hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:31:53       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:31:54       So I'm not telling you to be dishonest, but I'm you to think,

Speaker 5:          01:32:02       and it's the same thing in your personal life. You got to think about what you're saying. You got to think about your wife's perspective or your husbands perspective, where your kid's perspective or your friend's perspective.

Speaker 2:          01:32:17       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:32:18       how is what I'm about to say going to affect them long term. You gotta be measured. Now you might give them a little hint of something and then see how they react. And maybe you could be a little bit more honest with them. Maybe you could throw some bait out there and see if they bite on it, but you just don't want to jump in or throw it out to where now you've created an adversarial relationship with your friend, with your spouse, with your kids, because now they're not listening to it's even with your kids or you got to be totally honest with your kids. Okay. You know what? Totally. Honestly, I don't think you're capable of being this level of an athlete. Right? Do they need to hear that when they're nine years old? Probably not. Mm hmm.

Speaker 5:          01:33:14       So you just gotta think you gotta think, and there's a ways to get that information across in a tactical way, in an indirect way so that it's still manages to improve the person. Because I don't want to have echo come up. Will you come up with a bunch of bad ideas? And all I do is say, oh, that's a good idea. That's a good idea. That's good. I didn't train you, I didn't improve you. I want to say, hey, you know what, that's not bad. What if we did this? You know what I mean? And so we move in the right direction. We still have some mentorship going on, but it's indirect. We still have some coaching going on, but it's indirect because I don't want to coach you and you don't want to be coached by me.

Speaker 5:          01:33:58       Even my son when I like tell him something in Jujitsu, I've been doing Jujitsu for over 20 years with some of the best guys in the entire world literally. And I'll say, hey, thought you need to scoot your hip a little bit more when you do that move. And he'd go, no, you don't really know actually you do it. What he'll listen to Jeff. Hey listen to dean. Actually you won't actually, I've heard him argue with both Jeff and dean. He's navy with their approach. Yeah. Maybe they can give you a little more indirect. Correct, Doug Man. Yup. And that kind of illustrates one of the many challenges with that. Um, you know, one of the simple but not easy things because everyone's different. How you saying throw something out there and see how they respond. Everyone's going to respond different. That's the thing. So it is kind of this feeling out process.

Speaker 5:          01:34:45       It's, you know, I think that, and I mentioned this before where, you know, some people they'll be direct but people don't really like him and then they, they dealt kind of doubled down on it and say, Hey, you know, I, I speak the truth, you know, and like me for who I am or whatever. So what you do when you do that, when people do that is the render themselves ineffective in, in situations now, no one's leadership. Exactly right. And guess what? No one's who might each of their party, no one wants to be your friend. You know, you may or may not have gotten a divorce from it and it's all because you check, essentially you just chose to be a dick. We all understand that certain things are insulting if you're quote unquote to on, you know everyone except you, you know, you're the, if you look around and no one wants to be around you, that's a problem.

Speaker 5:          01:35:32       Yeah. Newsflash, you're a jerk. Yes. And inch. And people don't follow jerks. They really don't. Yeah. Yeah. So it's not an isn't it? Honesty is never an excuse to be a jerk to people. Yeah. And don't mistake, you know how people have this kind of misconception that speaking your mind is a good thing. It's not black and white. You're totally right. Don't be like, Hey, I know that's what's so crazy about this is like, um, people I think always have that feeling. I mean, I said it when I was talking, you know, people say, oh, of course, honesty is, you know, the best thing and you gotta be honest. And I would say that I am, I am known as a person that is honest and a straight shooter and that's great. But at the same time, like you just said, that doesn't mean I run around.

Speaker 5:          01:36:25       It insults people. It means I'm a tactician. You know what, it's not honesty. It's tat. It's being a tactician because w this is something that can actually go too far as well. Um, if, if you're constantly always telling him everyone thing every year, all sugarcoated. Well now the no one respects your opinion either, right? You just hear him saying, you know, if I just say, oh, Echo, you did a great job with that video. You did a great job with that video too. You did great. Well, what if you were producing junk video, sad exam? I need to tell you. Yeah, I know. It's a rough example. Uh, I would need to think of something that you didn't do such high quality point take. No, for sure. I've gotta I've gotta be honest with you and if all I do is tell you, hey, it's great, it's great, it's great, it's great, it's great, it's great.

Speaker 5:          01:37:10       You know, that doesn't help us. What I need to say is, hey man, that's an awesome video. It'd be cool if you captured this angle too, right? Or do you think it'd be possible to get this message across also and you'd say, Oh, I can do anything. You see how I just played Eureka? Then you see what I did that, yeah. Hey. Yeah, like I'll, do you think it's even possible to get this angle in there and you'd be like, Oh yeah, I could make it come across strong. Dang. I didn't even know there was a fight. He didn't just what? I just had a little victory up in here. All right. Yeah, so it's not black and white or like like everything. It's a balance. It's all balanced sense of dichotomy psychotomy between telling the truth and being tactful. Next question, Jocko. How do you handle

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       it? When someone up the chain of command betrays trust, like what is this like lying? They lied to you or this could be, this is a huge, this is a huge spectrum of, I guess for number one you just learned, you just learned something about someone's character. Yeah. You now kind of know better what you're dealing with. Now, if this is a major situation, you might have to immediately confronted and or go above them and the chain of command, I mean, if there's lives at risk, if there's something morally wrong that is happening, if there's something illegal that's happening that now you're going to get wrapped into, and that's another decision you got to make. If you're not going to be wrapped into it, then it's a decision you've got to make. If you want to ruin this person's life, whatever, that's that's a different decision.

Speaker 1:          01:38:42       That's not this question. We'd have to deal with that in a separate question. Mm. Are innocent people being hurt? So if, if it's something like that, lives at risk, you know, something morally wrong is happening, something illegal is happening, innocent people being hurt, then you're probably going to have to say something or you're going to have to say something. Now, I will tell you this before you say something, make sure all your ducks in a row made sure you have evidence. Don't go off half cocked. Be Ready. Because people that are deceitful like this, they, they, they prepare, they are ready for battle to protect themselves and they don't care what happens to other people. So you've got to watch out for that. Now if it's something really, if it's something minor, you know, if it's something minor, then

Speaker 2:          01:39:33       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:39:34       that's something that you logged down and in the brain, right? Something that you logged down in the brain and

Speaker 2:          01:39:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:39:45       But it allows you to see person's character. And that means, again, it's a minor infraction, but it also means you got to watch yourself and you got to watch them a little bit more closely. You gotta be careful because people like that, they think they're smarter than everyone else. They think that they're getting away with why. So they think they're smarter than, there's like a little hint of sociopath. Yeah. In there that they can get away with these lies. And so you got to watch him. You got to watch him.

Speaker 2:          01:40:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:40:18       Carefully in, in, like I said, it kind of goes back to that previous question because you don't want to be a person that comes across as dishonest yourself. And if people don't think they can trust what you're saying, they're not going to trust you with other things. So if you know, I'm not giving you good feedback because I'm too nice, you're not going to start you, you're not going to respect my opinion anymore. Right. So you know, when you're, when you're dealing with someone, if someone comes to you instead of getting, this is honesty versus if you come to me and say, Hey, what do you think of this plant? I'm not going to say, Hey, I think that's a stupid plan.

Speaker 3:          01:41:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:41:02       I might say, I don't know if that's how I do it. I might try this approach. Right? You're just going to be diplomatic. If you, if I'm not going to say to you, I don't think you're smart enough to figure this out. I have moved you to a different division cause I don't think you're smart enough to solve this problem. I'm not going to say that. I'm going to say, you know what? I need you on this other project over here that I think you're going to be really knock this thing out of the park.

Speaker 3:          01:41:25       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:41:26       Now you're getting to know deep inside.

Speaker 3:          01:41:31       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:41:32       But it's called tact and that's what you have to use. But back to the honesty or when person betrays your trust, you've learned, you've learned about their character. If it's a big thing, you're going to have to talk about it. You're gonna have to tell somebody. Yeah. It's a little thing. You got to watch TV. I think we just learned that vocabulary tonight. Who's their watch?

Speaker 4:          01:41:58       Hmm. Yeah. The, you know how you see and you log it in your brain, right? Logging in your brain that, okay, they lied about that. Or Oh, I, you know, I think you should constantly do that. Right. And I think we all do that anyway. That that's really, I think that's why. And your brain has certain ways, um, just the way it's wired, like first impressions, right. That's usually a big thing. But really what's really going on isn't that the first impression is this has more weight specifically. Then you know, other other impressions that you get along the line. It's because let's say you don't, let's say, I don't know that much about you. I don't know really. This is the first time I ever met you heard about you, whatever your first impression. It's not that it's so heavy, it's just, it's the only impression.

Speaker 4:          01:42:43       So it seems like everything. If you're a dick to me, okay, you're a dick in my mind you're just a dick. Second Day you're not a Dick, you're 50% Dick, which is, that's still a day, you know? Even if you're 20% Dick, you're like, okay, I like them buddies still the day, you know. So again, my point is you're always logging stuff in your brain. What does this person, what does this person not when it comes to someone who betrayed your trust, this doesn't really count them out as far as trusting them. Cause a lot of times the more time you spend with them, the more experience you have with them, you start to get a picture of, okay, he'll be trained. My trust, in this case, in this type of situation, it's like if you have a friend who he would literally risk his life to save your life, but at the same time he would probably hook up with your wife if he had the opportunity, you know? So there's different kinds of things. So as you gain experience with people, therefore risking his own life, right? Sure. Of course. But you start to get a picture of who the person,

Speaker 1:          01:43:42       and I don't have any friends like that. Yeah. But I do know what you're saying. There's people that have different moral compass and moral and so

Speaker 4:          01:43:51       you're judging them based on that, right? Yeah. So just be careful not to judge him based on that. So again, based on, we'll see, but that's part of like this big picture. So, cause ultimately you want to get to the point, and I've had this experience specifically in my life before where, you know, you want to get to the point where you trust them. Yeah. I trust them to be that person. You know? I know he's not trustworthy in this, but he's just wear this. So I, yeah, his role in my life or in this company or whatever. I know I trust him to be him, that therefore I won't give them this task. You trust that he's going to have them. Yes, exactly. Right. I host the Scorpion to be the Scorpion stings the frog to be the frog. Yes. And that comes with like the experience.

Speaker 4:          01:44:33       So if someone, you know, like you said, if it's a minor thing, don't go jumped down his throat or just jump to this thing. Really just be like, okay, you know, deal with it in your way. But like I said, log in in your brain and move forward what you know and keep your eyes open to things that you can trust them above so you can get that full picture. And I hate to say this and I've said it before, I don't have these massively high expectations of other human beings. Yeah. I hate to say it, but I'm kind of anticipating that they're telling me half truths. Yeah. And Yeah. Yeah. So don't get these high expectations and expect that people are going to try and get one over on you. Yeah. And then when you do get your core of people that you know are really truly trustworthy, that's awesome.

Speaker 4:          01:45:14       Yeah. That might be three people in your life. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, I would say that that's, that's fair. You know, I think a lot of people are like that and I think everyone's like that in one way or another. You know? And it's a spectrum. But I've been in a situation where someone say, Hey, do you know this guy? He'll be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. There'll be like, yeah, you're friends with that guy, isn't he hard to trust because of like this. And I'll say, I don't find them hard to trust. I trust him to be him. And just exactly how you're saying you trust the Scorpion to be a scorpion. Yeah. You know, Scorpion can be relied upon for specific things and straight up can't be relied upon for certain other things. So again, if you just keep your eyes open and you know, don't start burning bridges with the person. If it's this small thing as as time goes on, you can start to get a feel of really who this person is in the entirety and it might be beneficial in the in the situation you're in with them. No, your people. I agree. Next question.

Speaker 4:          01:46:18       Here's a strange one. I have ongoing regret for never joining the military or police department and I'm not yet strong enough to consider changing careers now for financial reasons. I also don't know how to discuss this with my wife as we want to make some additions to the family soon. I feel unfulfilled in the single aspect of my life. It's a strange feeling considering I have skyrocketed up the chain in my company so quickly, so many would do anything to be where I find myself. How do you overcome your face or how do you overcome or face yourself knowing you're holding back from a certain calling because I really do see it as a calling in some form. I'm interested to hear from you.

Speaker 1:          01:47:09       I think this is pretty easy. Go join the reserves. Hmm. Go join the reserves. Go in the army reserves, go in there. Like every branch has some reserves where you're going to do one weekend a month, you have to do bootcamp, that'll be whatever it's going to be 10 weeks, 12 weeks, 14 weeks depending on which branch you go into. And then you do one weekend a month and you do two weeks in the summer. You, you'll understand what the military is about. There's actually a chance, well first of all, there's a chance you'd be deployed. I mean, when we were in Iraq, you know, when we deployed to Ramadi, my second deployment to Iraq, the, the unit that was there, the two to eight iron soldiers, they were reserve unit out of Pennsylvania. They were awesome and they'd been doing that for 14 months and they lost a lot of guys and they fought hard.

Speaker 1:          01:47:52       So it's not like this reserve is thing is, is is a different class a soldier, they're soldiers for real. They're marines for real. Then you may be going on deployment. But what's cool about it is most companies, they will excuse you. Basically when you go in the reserves, they'll excuse you when you have time. And in fact, I think it's, I was never in the reserves, but I think you're actually protected by the federal government from being fired because you're serving in the reserves. So I would definitely go and look into the reserves because otherwise that feeling that you have, I can only imagine it's never going to go away. I don't know. Because I had that feeling that I wanted to do in the military when I was four years old and I did it as soon as I turned 18. So I don't, you know, I, I, you know what I regret now, I was like, I want to still be in.

Speaker 1:          01:48:42       Huh. You know? So especially now with the fighting picking up overseas, it's uh, you know, that's, that's the only thing that, that I feel is, damn, I want to go back. But if you never did it at all, that's a grinding feeling. So go talk to recruiter, getting the reserves and you know what else? In certain areas there's definitely volunteer fire departments. Yeah, you can volunteer as a fireman and you can volunteer as a policeman. They have certain, uh, I dunno, I have no idea what state you're from asking this question. But there's deputies you can get deputized, you can go through a, in San Diego they definitely have reserve cops where you have to go to school, you have to go to the police academy and you become a reserve cop. So, and with all that you want to talk about it with your wife.

Speaker 1:          01:49:30       Talk about with your wife, you know, you say you don't know how to, this isn't a situation where you can be totally honest with her. Hey, I always wanted to join the military. I haven't done it. I feel like it's something I really want to do. Here's the options I want to go look at. What do you think? Now you're, you're married, you're married to a and you're going to have kids. It's your military service will be harder on her than it is on you. So she better be strong, she better be tough. And you know, the military wives out there, I mean my wife, when I was gone and deployment after deployment, it's, it's not easy. I mean luckily she's tough and she raised kids without me and she took care of household without me and she went to the hospital to visit my wounded guys and she went to the funerals of my guys were getting killed and she had to do that while I was gone on deployment.

Speaker 1:          01:50:21       And I was, she was hearing from me once a week maybe. So you're gonna put your family through a lot of stress. Now you might stress your family a lot by always having regret that they held you back. That's selfish. But that's true. So I would just go look into it, see what the options are, talk about it with your wife. There are some really good benefits to it. And also the final point is sometimes when you're reservist, you can decide that you want to go active duty. Maybe you love it. Maybe you say, yeah, this was my calling. Maybe you're fourth day in boot camp where you haven't slept. You had your head shaved, you're tired, you're hungry, the food is horrible. And you say, man, this is what I've always wanted to do with my life. And if that happens, there's options where you can now go active duty and, and you can see how your wife dealt with it while you were gone and she dealt with it.

Speaker 1:          01:51:12       Well that's great. Hey, let's make a career out of this and that's a good option. Yeah. And to do so there's some, I think you're, this is, this is, this is an easy day, easy, easy problem to take care of. No factor. Interesting. Next question Jocko. What's your take on sport Jujitsu versus self defense? Jujitsu and can support Transport Jujitsu? Can it translate onto the street? Most schools are geared towards sport. Yeah. So for anyone that's listening that doesn't do Jujitsu, both of you that are out there, that don't do together listening, first of all, do Jujitsu. Uh, second of all. So there's, there's Jujitsu is rooted really in self defense and like anything that gets put into a, a closed environment, it starts to breed and become different and mutate. And so Jujitsu in a way, what they called, what they now call sport Jujitsu is Jujitsu that has been in this competition environment, in the Jujitsu sport competition environment.

Speaker 1:          01:52:25       So Jujitsu is a sport as well as self defense. It's a sport with points and you can win on points and they have championships and it's very competitive and it's, it's pretty entertaining to watch if you know and understand the game. But since it's in this environment, this closed environment, it starts to mutate. And that's what's happened. So for instance, there is maneuvers that you do in, in Sport Jujitsu that are so intricate and they're so reliant on, for instance, reliant on the Geeky, that Jujitsu uniform, which is a heavy fabric [inaudible]. And you can actually use parts of the Geeky to choke people. And you can use parts of the Geeky to, uh, make a person off balance called a sweep and get on top. You can literally take the lapel of their key and put it between their legs and wrap it around your leg and then grab the geeky there and it's gonna and then you just swing your hips and is going to pull them off balance.

Speaker 1:          01:53:27       Now this is something you could literally never do in the street. So that's what they're talking about when they're talking about sport versus self defense. And they have this with other things. I mean there's sport shooting where they do certain and it's, it's semi realistic. Just like Jujitsu, semi realistic. When you go in a tournament, it's somewhat simulates a street fight, just like some shooting competitions, somewhat simulate combat, but they're not exact. And so the question is, does the sport translate onto the street? And my answer to that is, first of all, yes, it does. Not every move, certainly, and there's absolutely moves that you would do in Jujitsu in a tournament that you would never do on the street. Now luckily anybody who's good enough to do those advanced moves in a tournament is good enough that in the street, they're not going to need those moves.

Speaker 1:          01:54:25       You're not going to need to do a reverse Alma Plata in the street. You're not going to need to do, um, donkey guard in the street. [inaudible] right? You're not going to need to do bear and Bolo in the street. You're just not going to need to do it. If you're fighting someone that that's good, well then guess what? I guess you didn't need it, but you're not going to come up against a person in the street that's going to have a counter to your bare and Bolo attack and you don't have a Guianan. So that's not going to work. I mean, there are some Nogi versus that. The bottom line is if you're doing Jujitsu, you're definitely going to do very, very well in a street fight. Now that being said, that being said, sometimes you know what you gotta do. You gotta train Jujitsu for the street.

Speaker 1:          01:55:10       You got to, you got to punch each other. Occasionally you got to say, Hey, you know what? Let's go live a little bit and we'll do some, maybe you put gloves on. Maybe you put MMA gloves on. Maybe just use open hands and you smack each other and you realize like, Oh, when I'm on the bottom and the half guard where I feel super comfortable when I'm doing Jujitsu, if I'm in a real fight, I'm going to be getting headbutted or I'm going to be getting punched in the face and that's not good. So what do I do to get out of this? Um, do you know, even in the guard can be horrible on the bottom. Yeah. Um, did you don't want to be on the bottom

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       anyways in a fight. You don't want to, you don't. The bottom line is you don't want to grapple if you don't have to. Yeah. You don't want to be in a street fight in the first place. The reason you're in a street place cause you could not avoid it. That's why you're in a street fight. You could not avoid it. You got attacked, you got taken down to the ground because even if someone swings at you and you can still get away from you, they haven't grabbed you yet. Runaway. Cool. So train Jujitsu with punches. Also trained boxing, wartime wrestling. And also work on some real scenarios. Work on the headlock and I've seen this, where do you get a a guy that's really just come into the game and jump straight? You know these young kids, they come into the game, they start, the first thing they want to learn is the rubber guard.

Speaker 5:          01:56:31       The first thing they want to learn is the Omoplata. The first thing they want to learn is it bare and Bolo. That's like the first thing they want to learn. And literally someone will put them in a headlock and they won't know what to do because it's different. Just like just like a bear and Bolo requires to neck technique. The headlock escape requires some technique to get out of that. So work on that. Work on the bear hug, work on the the arm grab and the risk grab and the the the straight arm choke in big looping punches that you're gonna see. And I'll tell you sometimes dean will teach a self defense class. And when Dean teaches a self defense class, every time he teaches one, I learned something. I'm like, man, that's a good little technique. He just showed how to get out of this, how to get out of that.

Speaker 5:          01:57:14       So bottom line, yes, you can, it it, sport Jujitsu for the most part translates into the street. And if you're good enough at Sports Jujitsu that you're competing at a high level, even purple belt in up, you're not going to need to use any sports. Jujitsu moves in the street, you're going to be destroying somewhat in a street fight. Yeah. If you end up in that situation. Yeah. The, the, it's a Spec, especially now, just like, are you saying the Jujitsu has evolved and kind of mutated, morphed, um, in, in the gyms now a petri dish Jujitsu's that can, a petri dish, it's growing. It just grows on its own. It turns in this weird fungus and it gets all different looking and it does look different. Yeah. It does look different than it did. You know, even like, I remember, I remember Dean when I were talking about the other day, we would remember when the Omoplata came out. Hmm. You know, I think it was like 1996 we started seeing the Oma plot and we, oh man. And it looks very fancy. It looks very, it's a fancy looking move and now, now because of the Internet, because so many people are, it's exploding how rapidly it's changing and mutating. It's mutating faster now than it ever has. Yeah, yeah. And that's part of the beauty of it I think in, you know, in most ways, um, the, it's a spectrum though, right? If you went from one side, which is just the basic, the original basic,

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       you know, take down mountain side, Mount Guard, all this, all the way to worm guard something that that or, or baron bullet for example, where, so sport, Jujitsu, if you want to narrow it down, it's, it's, it's, if it's something where the moves or whatever you're doing is dependent on the sport elements of it. So it's dependent that you have a mat, it's dependent that you have a g and a belt. So if you do warm guard, that's highly dependent on the guy having a geeky with the lapel out. And eventually someone's going to figure out how to do warm guard without it. They'll figure out some variation for sure. They may have already. Yeah. Yeah. So it should Keenan's working on the pioneer. So, um, it's like, you know, just to kind of put it into define terms, right, so self defense I think now is you may find a gym that's only does sport where if you came in no experience and then you know, three, four or five years later, your sport Jujitsu might not take you very far in the street.

Speaker 4:          01:59:45       It's, it'd be rare I think. But you could probably find the school like that. I don't know where they are but, but I think just like what you're saying, when you make it to purple belt, you're the basic Jujitsu. We'll win on the street. And really when, if you go to a school, like even though the original Gracie academy in Torrance, if you go there, the self, the self defense pursuit in Jujitsu is more of it is it's tactic based. Like mentally it's not specific moves. It's distance management. It's where your mindset is in the guard. Your, your, your pursuit, your goal in the guard is way different than in a, in a tournament or something. They won't, they'll say don't even go for submissions right here. It's not your job to do submissions right here. I was going to say that you said is dependent on the gates to sports you use depending on the Guid, depending on the mat, it's also dependent on the rules and spending it on an opponent that knows Jujitsu.

Speaker 4:          02:00:38       Yes. Depended on somebody that knows what they're doing cause they're going counter of what you're doing in order to make something work. Absolutely right. Yeah. So the, if you go back to the self defense, you're going to be learning basically how to protect yourself given what Jujitsu is. That's, that's it. In sport, you're going to be learning how to score points, how to control a certain guy with this specific uniform, how to utilize that uniform. How do you utilize the mat and that's another thing that's messed up. Like in the IB, Jj, after the official rules of Jujitsu, there's some things that you're not allowed to do right. And that's not good. They should allow these things in regards to pursuing self a sport. It's a sport really when it comes down to it. Yeah. I guess you can put whatever rules you want. Yeah, but you shouldn't. Yeah. Yeah. If you, if you don't mind the deviation from self defense, if you don't mind that, then put whatever rules you want. But yeah, I would say you shouldn't. If you care about the more rules you in the sport

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       gets, the less effective it becomes. I unfortunately. And so they need to stop with the rules. Yeah. And it's the same thing with judo. It's the same thing with wrestling. I mean wrestling in America, if they, if they allowed submission holds in wrestling in America, you know, America would be insane with fighters. We've done pretty good. But can you imagine if every high school kid that wrestled knew how to do all submissions? They'd be nuts. That's the way it should be. I wish it was that way. I wish the world was that way. It would be a better place. But they, what they did is, what they did is with wrestling, they took, they took submission holds out because they considered it to be dangerous in judo is a clock is a classic example where they remove the double leg. Like you can't do a straight double leg in a tournament anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:02:25       You have to set it up. It has to be off for something else. Cause because wrestlers were coming in and dominating and judo tournament just hitting double legs cause cause they're awesome at Adam. Right. And it's the same thing now you see with with Jujitsu in Ibj JF there, you know with the, with the no heel hooks, even at a black belt level you're not allowed to do, he'll hooks. So that completely changed it. Some parts of the Games and it doesn't change and where it was going to make you lose in a street fight. But it definitely puts a stop to the, to the growth of the sport in terms of technique.

Speaker 4:          02:02:58       Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So exactly what you were saying, how the sport, the rules and stuff, all that does is, is narrowed down the, the sport part of it and the more people who pursue it for sport, not just sport, but sport. If pursuing Jiu Jitsu for sport is part of your game as part of your, your goals or whatever, and then now the sport has become this limited thing where you can't, like there's 20% of moves you can't do, you're gonna spend way less time practicing them. You'd be way less effective at these moves that are a part of grappling, a huge part of grappling ultimately. So. So yeah, you're still going to have that huge overlap for sure. If you know mount, which is probably the first thing, you would have your first Jujitsu class, you're going to learn mount, which is theoretically the most dominant position you can have.

Speaker 4:          02:03:45       So you're going to learn mount, take what to do when the guy flips you over, what to do in the guard, how to function. You know these things. That's what's going to get you by in the street. That's what's going to going to make you effective in an actual fight. Yeah. And then, you know, like, like anything, all these offshoots that grow, you know, they, you know, there's some overlap for sure. But, um, if, if you go into a tournament that's a specific pursuit. If you want to defend yourself, that's a specific pursuit now. And as time goes on, they're going to start to draw out that there's a lot of overlap right now and in the future there'll be less. Yeah. Has the way that they're putting rules over the sport. Yeah. And, and just, and the sport in general and the sport mutating.

Speaker 4:          02:04:30       Yeah. Yeah. So you know, the sport, depending on the, depending on the fact that there's a mat, like if you tried to do a burn Bolo in the street with on the road or something, it's just the way that you spin on the mat. Yeah. There's too much friction on the street. It'd be definitely one that would make it hard. Yes, you can. The grass would make it hard. Yeah. I haven't tried to bear them Bolo on the street. Go get a fight. Pick a fight. Yeah, but both are good. I think it's fun. You can't help but really like, cause because when you go to Jujitsu you're like, hey, this is basically a fight. Yeah. We can train full speed and be safe. It's a fight. That's what makes it so fun because when you win, the payoff is so good on the inside and when you lose, it's like you still get that detriment.

Speaker 4:          02:05:10       That's still, you still have that feeling. But at the end of the day, you know you lived, you're not enemies with the guy, you're not injured, nothing like that. So it makes it this, this wind when the whole time. Right. And when you see a cool move like warm guard when like you're controlling one guy with your weird foot that face this way in one hand and the guy can't even stand up. Yeah. That's all fun. Yeah. It's like, oh I have this super power and wielding, you know, in the Mat. He can't help it pursue those fun thing. Bear and bull though. You get, it's like you're a break dancer doing some cool stuff. Meanwhile you're dominating the guy. While you're dead, you can't help but do that stuff. It's so fun, you know? Yeah. So you can't, I mean, I don't think you can really hate him.

Speaker 4:          02:05:45       The sport. No, I don't. I don't hate on a sport. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. I'm saying good, but some people, do you know how even just the question cut, not that the, the person who asked this question thinks this, but it implies that there is a little bit of a climate of, Oh yeah, I got a receipt. If you don't like the bear and Bolo, learn to defend against it. No. Yeah. You know what I mean? Sure. If you don't like Robert Gard, cool learning to defend against it. Yup. That's my opinion. Because if it's working then credit. Yup. Yup. You either effective or ineffective. My brother Leif Babin said, yeah, let's do one more. One more. Okay. Jocko, a lot of your advice applies to leading yourself, not just leading others. Self-Help quote unquote is a loaded word. So let's say self management. What is the one change readers should make today to start improving themselves and their situation?

Speaker 1:          02:06:46       I don't really like those words. Self help or self management or self improvement. I don't really like what those words have come to mean these days because there's a lot of people out there that are constantly trying to improve themselves by looking for the one change, the one change, right? The one change in their life that's gonna make their dreams come true and even worse. On top of that, there's a lot of people out there, a lot of self help gurus and these hyperactive motivational speakers and these other self appointed modern Zen Yoga warriors that they're trying to sell. The one thing they're trying to sell the nine steps are the enlightened path that's going to allow you to unlock all of your human potential and fulfill the dreams so you can live the life that you've, you've always wanted to live. Now I'm no guru, Hey, and I definitely don't claim to be, I'm just a man. But I will tell you this, it isn't one thing and it isn't 10 things and it isn't a hundred things. It isn't a quick path and there are no shortcuts in meditation, won't get you there and neither will a miracle drug or an organic supplement or some super food.

Speaker 3:          02:08:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:22       Getting better isn't a hack or a trick or a one change that you need to make.

Speaker 3:          02:08:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:31       Getting better is a campaign. It's a campaign. It's a daily, a weekly. It's an hour leaf fight.

Speaker 3:          02:08:40       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:40       An incessant fight that doesn't stop against weakness and against temptation and against laziness. It's a campaign. A discipline.

Speaker 3:          02:08:49       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:08:50       The campaign of hard work and dedication. It's waking up early and going to bed late and grinding out every second in between every single day. So you want to get better.

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:09:08       You want to self improve. Stop looking for a shortcut and go find your alarm clock. Find your discipline.

Speaker 3:          02:09:18       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:09:19       And flank your guts and your passion and your drive and find it. You will. And then, then you will find your freedom. And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So I'll you troopers out there, out on the front lines, fighting against evil or fighting against crime or fighting against fires or fighting to make things happen, fighting. They get ahead and make something out of this little bit of time that we've got. Thanks for joining us in the fight.
